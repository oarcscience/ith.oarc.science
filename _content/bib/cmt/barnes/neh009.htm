<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><I>Notes on the Bible</I>, by Albert Barnes, [1834], at Intangible Textual Heritage</FONT></P><HR></p> <h3 align="center" align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#001">Nehemiah Chapter 9</A></h3> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#001">Nehemiah 9:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">neh 9:1</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The festival lasted from the 15th day of the 7th month to the first. The 22nd day was a day of solemn observance <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#018">Neh 8:18</A>. One day seems to have been allowed the people for rest; and then the work of repentance, for which they had shown themselves ready <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#009">Neh 8:9</A>, was taken in hand, and a general fast was proclaimed. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#004">Nehemiah 9:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">neh 9:4</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The Septuagint and the Vulgate remove the comma after "stairs." By the "stairs (or scaffold) of the Levites" is to be understood as an elevated platform from which they could the better address and lead the people (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#004">Neh 8:4</A>). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#005">Nehemiah 9:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">neh 9:5</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Stand up - The people had knelt to confess and to worship God <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#003">Neh 9:3</A>. They were now to take the proper attitude for praise. Compare throughout the margin reference. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#006">Nehemiah 9:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">neh 9:6</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The host of heaven worshippeth thee - i. e the angels. See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#019">Kg1 22:19</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#021">Psa 103:21</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#017">Nehemiah 9:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">neh 9:17</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>In their rebellion - The Septuagint and several maunscripts have "in Egypt" (the words in the original differing by one letter only), and translate - "And appointed a captain to return to their bondage in Egypt." Compare the margin reference. The appointment of a leader is regarded here as made, whereas we are only told in the Book of Numbers that it was proposed. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#022">Nehemiah 9:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">neh 9:22</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Thou didst divide them into corners - i. e., parts of the holy land; or as some prefer "thou didst distribute them on all sides." 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#025">Nehemiah 9:25</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_025">neh 9:25</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Became fat. - i. e., "grew proud," or "wanton" - a phrase only occurring here, in the margin reference, and in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#028">Jer 5:28</A>.
<p>Delighted themselves - Rather, "luxuriated." The word in the original does not occur elsewhere; but cognate terms make the sense clear. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#026">Nehemiah 9:26</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_026">neh 9:26</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Slew thy prophets - Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#004">Kg1 18:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#010">Kg1 19:10</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#021">Ch2 24:21</A>. Jewish tradition further affirms that more than one of the great prophets (e. g., Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel) were martyred by their countrymen. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#027">Nehemiah 9:27</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_027">neh 9:27</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Thou gavest them saviours - See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#015">Jdg 3:15</A> etc. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#038">Nehemiah 9:38</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_038">neh 9:38</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Seal unto it - The exact force of the phrase used is doubtful; but its general sense must be that the classes named took part in the sealing. It was usual in the East to authenticate covenants by appending the seals of those who were parties to them (see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#010">Jer 32:10</A>).
