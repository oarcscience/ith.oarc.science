### [Ezekiel Chapter 28](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#001)

[Ezekiel 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 28:1</span></span>

The prophecy against the prince of Tyre. Throughout the east the majesty
and glory of a people were collected in the person of their monarch, who
in some nations was worshipped as a god. The prince is here the
embodiment of the community. Their glory is his glory, their pride his
pride. The doom of Tyre could not be complete without denunciation of
the prince of Tyre. Idolatrous nations and idolatrous kings were, in the
eyes of the prophet, antagonists to the true God. In them was embodied
the principle of evil opposing itself to the divine government of the
world. Hence, some of the fathers saw upon the throne, not simply a
hostile monarch, but "the Prince of this world, spiritual wickedness (or
wicked spirits) in high places." Whenever evil in any way domineers over
good, there is a "prince of Tyrus," against whom God utters His voice.
The "mystery of iniquity is ever working, and in that working we
recognize the power of Satan whom God condemns and will destroy.

[Eze 28:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#002)

Thou hast said, I am a god - Compare [Eze
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#003); [Dan
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#030); [Act
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#022); [Th2
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#004).

I sit in the seat of God - Words denoting the speaker's pride; but the
situation of the island-city, full of beauty, in the midst of the blue
water of the Mediterranean, gives force to the expression. Compare the
words describing the lot of Tyre as having been in Eden [Eze
28:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#013).

Thou art a man - Rather, thou art man.

[Eze 28:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#003)

Thou art wiser than Daniel - The passage is one of strong irony. Compare
[Eze 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#014); [Dan
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#003).

[Eze 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#009)

But thou shalt be a man - Rather, yet art thou man.

[Eze 28:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#010)

The uncircumcised - The pagan idolaters as opposed to the
covenant-people.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 28:11</span></span>

The dirge of the prince of Tyre, answering to the dirge of the state.
The passage is ironical; its main purpose is to depict all the glory,
real or assumed, of "the prince of Tyrus," in order to show how
deplorable should be his ruin.

[Eze 28:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#012)

To "seal the sum" is to make up the whole measure of perfection. Compare
the Septuagint

[Eze 28:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#013)

Thou hast been in Eden - "Thou" wast etc. The prince of Tyrus is
ironically described as the first of creation; but at the same time the
parallel is to be maintained in his fall from glory. Like Adam in the
enjoyment of paradise, he shall be like Adam in his fall.

Every precious stone - All the stones here named are found in the High
priest's breastplate [Exo 28:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#017),
but their order is different, and three stones named in Exodus (the
third row) are wanting. The prophet may purposely have varied the
description because the number twelve (that of the tribes of Israel) had
nothing to do with the prince of Tyrus, and he wished to portray, not a
high priest, but a king, having in view a figure which was to a Jew,
especially to a priest, the very type of magnificence.

Tabrets - (or, drums) and "pipes" were a common expression for festivity
and triumph.

[Eze 28:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#014)

Thou art - Better," Thou" wert. "the anointed cherub that covereth" In
the temple the cherubim and all holy things were consecrated and
anointed with oil ([Exo 30:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#026) ff). The
prince of Tyre was also anointed as a sovereign priest - covering or
protecting the minor states, like the cherubim with outstretched wings
covering the mercy-Seat.

Thou wast upon the holy mountain - As the cherub was in the temple on
the holy mountain, so the prince of Tyre was presiding over the
island-city, rising like a mountain from the deep.

Stones of fire - i. e., bright and shining. Decked with bright jewels,
the prince walked among jewels in gorgeous splendor.

[Eze 28:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#015)

The "perfection" was false, unsuspected until the "iniquity" which lay
beneath was found out.

[Ezekiel 28:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eze 28:21</span></span>

Prophecy against Zidon. Zidon (mod. Saida) was more ancient than Tyre
and was the original metropolis of Phoenicia [Gen
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#019), but in the times of Phoenician
greatness it ever played a subordinate part. Only once [Jdg
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#012) do we find the "Zidonians" in
conflict with Israel. The evil which they did was the seducing them to
idolatry (compare [Eze 28:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#024)), as in
the case of Jezebel, daughter of Ethbaal, king of the Zidonians [Kg1
16:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#031). The capture of Tyre by
Nebuchadnezzar increased the importance of Zidon, which was a wealthy
and flourishing town when Artaxerxes Ochus destroyed it. It has rallied
from time to time, but has never attained to any great consequence,
though not in such complete ruin as Tyre.

[Ezekiel 28:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eze 28:22</span></span>

Be glorified ... be sanctified - Or, "get Me glory ... have shown Myself
holy" (and in [Eze 28:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#025)).

[Ezekiel 28:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">eze 28:25</span></span>

The contrast of the future of Israel with that of the surrounding
nations. This prophecy reaches far beyond a mere temporal restoration.
It points to times of more permanent security, when from all nations and
kingdoms the Church of Christ, the Israel of God, shall be gathered in,
when the power of the world shall be forever broken, and the kingdom of
Christ shall be established forever.

This transition from the enemies to the people of God closes the portion
of the prophecies against the nations in the immediate vicinity of the
Israelites, before passing to the more distant Egypt.
