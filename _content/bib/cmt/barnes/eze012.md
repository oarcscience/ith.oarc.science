Heritage

### [Ezekiel Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#001)

[Ezekiel 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 12:2</span></span>

Compare [Deu 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#026); margin reference;
[Rom 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#021). The repetition of such
words from age to age, shows that the prophet's words are intended to
reach beyond the generation in which he lived.

[Ezekiel 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 12:3</span></span>

Stuff - Raiment, vessels, and the like. The "removing" was to be of the
kind that accompanied exile. The whole account of this transaction marks
it as a real act. The prophet was to be "a sign" to his countrymen, and
the "exiles" as well as those that remained in Judaea had need to be
taught this lesson, for though themselves far away, they looked to
Jerusalem as their home, and were scarcely less eager for its safety
than the inhabitants themselves.

[Ezekiel 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 12:4</span></span>

The particulars which Ezekiel here foretold actually occurred (compare
[Kg2 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#004); [Jer
39:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#004)); but at this time Zedekiah
seemed to be prosperous, and the Jews at Jerusalem expected, it is
clear, a long continuance of his prosperity (see [Eze
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#001) note).

The prophetic character of the passage is undoubted (the prophet is
declared to be "a sign," [Eze 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#006)) -
the genuineness of the book and of the position of the passage in the
book, are beyond dispute; in the historical event we have an exact
fulfillment. The only legitimate inference is that the prophet received
his knowledge from above.

[Ezekiel 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 12:6</span></span>

Thou shalt cover thy face - A sign of mourning (see [Eze
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#017)); also of Zedekiah's blindness
[Eze 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#012).

[Ezekiel 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 12:7</span></span>

In the evening the prophet was to return to the wall, break through it,
and transport the goods from the inside to the outside of the city.

[Ezekiel 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 12:10</span></span>

Burden - A word used to indicate a prediction of woe to be borne by some
individual or people ([Isa 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#001) note).
Ezekiel, bearing his "stuff" on his shoulder was a sign of the weight of
calamity coming upon king and people.

[Ezekiel 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 12:13</span></span>

Compare [Jer 52:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#009) ff

[Ezekiel 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 12:16</span></span>

Few - literally, as in the margin; so few, that they can easily be
counted [Isa 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#019). The few who should
escape destruction should make known to all among whom they should dwell
how great had been the wickedness of the people, how just their
punishment.

[Ezekiel 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 12:18</span></span>

Here the sign is the exhibition of such terror as the danger of a siege
creates.

[Ezekiel 12:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eze 12:19</span></span>

The people of the land - Chaldaea.

Of the inhabitants - In respect to "the inhabitants."

Desolate from, all that is therein - i. e., stripped of all its
inhabitants and of all its wealth.

At one and the same time, Jeremiah was prophesying in Jerusalem, and
Ezekiel in Chaldaea; the prophecies of the former were sent to the
exiles, and those of Ezekiel to the dwellers at Jerusalem, that the
guiding hand of One God in different places might be made clear
(Jerome).

[Ezekiel 12:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eze 12:21</span></span>

As in Ezek. 7, the nearness of the judgment is foretold.

[Eze 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#022)

The land of Israel - is put generally for the land where the children of
Israel dwelt, whether at home, or in exile. There was prevalent a
disregard for the true prophets, which is ever followed by a recognition
of the false. First, the true prophet is rejected because it is thought
that his prophecies fail. Then men persuade themselves that if the
prophecy be true it respects some distant time, and that the men of the
present generation need not disturb themselves about it. Compare [Jer
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#011); [Amo
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#003); [Mat
24:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#043); [Th1
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#002); [Pe2
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#004). Against both these delusions
Ezekiel is commissioned to protest, and so to lead the way to his
condemnation of his countrymen for their blind reliance on false
prophets.
