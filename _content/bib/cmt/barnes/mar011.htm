<p>See this passage illustrated in the notes at Mat. 21:1-16.

<p>Two ways met - A crossroads. A public place, probably near the center of the village.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#005">Mar 11:5</A>
<p>What do ye, loosing the colt? - Or, why do ye do this? What authority have you for doing it?
<p>See this passage illustrated in the notes at Mat. 21:1-16. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#011">Mark 11:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">mar 11:11</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>See this passage explained in the notes at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#018">Mat 21:18-22</A>.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#011">Mar 11:11</A>
<p>Into the temple - Not into the edifice properly called "the temple," but into the "courts" which surrounded the principal edifice. Our Saviour, not being of the tribe of Levi, was not permitted to enter into the holy or most holy place; and when, therefore, it is said that he went into the "temple," it is always to be understood of the "courts" surrounding the temple. See the notes at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#012">Mat 21:12</A>.
<p>And when he had looked round about upon all things - Having seen or examined everything. He saw the abominations and abuses which he afterward corrected. It may be a matter of wonder that he did not "at once" correct them, instead of waiting to another day; but it may be observed that God is slow to anger; that he does not "at once" smite the guilty, but waits patiently before he rebukes and chastises.
<p>The eventide - The evening; the time after three o'clock p. m. It is very probable that this was before sunset. The religious services of the temple closed at the offering of the evening sacrifice, at three o'clock, and Jesus probably soon left the city.

<p>Afar off - See the notes at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#019">Mat 21:19</A>.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#015">Mar 11:15-24</A>
<p>See the notes at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#012">Mat 21:12-22</A>.
<p> <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#016">Mar 11:16</A>
<p>Any vessel - Any vessel used in cooking, or connected with the sale of their articles of merchandise.
<p> <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#018">Mar 11:18</A>
<p>All the people were astonished - He became popular among them. The Pharisees saw that their authority was lessened or destroyed. They were therefore envious of him, and sought his life.
<p>His doctrine - His teaching. He taught with power and authority so great that the multitudes were awed, and were constrained to obey.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#021">Mar 11:21</A>
<p>Thou cursedst - To curse means to devote to destruction. This is its meaning here. It does not in this place imply blame, but simply that it should be destroyed.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#022">Mar 11:22</A>
<p>Have faith in God - Literally, "Have the faith of God." This may mean, have strong faith, or have confidence in God; a strong belief that he is able to accomplish things that appear most difficult with infinite ease, as the fig-tree was made to wither away by a word.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#025">Mar 11:25</A>
<p>And when ye stand praying - When ye pray. It seems that the posture in prayer was sometimes standing and sometimes kneeling. God looks upon "the heart" rather than upon our position in worship; and if the heart be right, any posture may be proper. It cannot be doubted, however, that in private, in the family, and wherever it can be conveniently done, the kneeling posture is more proper, as expressing more humility and reverence, and more in accordance with Scripture examples. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#006">Psa 95:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#013">Ch2 6:13</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#010">Dan 6:10</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#041">Luk 22:41</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#060">Act 7:60</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#040">Act 9:40</A>. Yet a subject like this may be made of too much consequence, and we should be careful that anxiety about a mere form should not exclude anxiety about a far more important matter - the state of the soul.
<p>Forgive ... - See the notes at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#012">Mat 6:12</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#025">Mat 6:25</A>.
