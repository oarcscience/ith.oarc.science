### [2 Chronicles Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 16:1</span></span>

This passage runs parallel with Kings (see the marginal reference).

[2 Chronicles 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 16:3</span></span>

Compare the [Kg1 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#019) note.

[2 Chronicles 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch2 16:4</span></span>

Abel-maim - or, "Abel-beth-maachah" [Kg1
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#020). It was one of the towns most
exposed to attack when an invader entered Israel from the north, and was
taken from Pekah by Tiglath-pileser [Kg2
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029).

Store cities - See [Kg1 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#019) note.

[2 Chronicles 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 16:7</span></span>

The rebuke of Hanani and his imprisonment by Asa, omitted by the writer
of Kings, are among the most important of the additions to Asa's history
for which we are indebted to the author of Chronicles.

[Ch2 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#007)

Escaped out of thine hand - Hanani means, "Hadst thou been faithful, and
opposed in arms the joint host of Israel and Syria, instead of bribing
the Syrian king to desert to thy side, the entire host would have been
delivered into thy hand, as was Zerah's. But now it is escaped from
thee. Thou hast lost a glorious opportunity."

[Ch2 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#009)

From henceforth thou shalt have wars - As peace had been the reward of
Asa's earlier faith [Ch2 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#005); [Ch2
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#005), so his want of faith was now to
be punished by a period of war and disturbance.

[Ch2 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#010)

In a prison house - Or, "in the stocks." Compare [Kg1
22:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#026).

[2 Chronicles 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch2 16:12</span></span>

Yet in his disease he sought not ... - Rather, "and also in his disease
he sought not." Not only in his war with Baasha, but also when attacked
by illness, Asa placed undue reliance upon the aid of man.

[2 Chronicles 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 16:14</span></span>

The explanation of the plural - "sepulchres" - will be seen in [Kg1
13:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#030) note.

The burning of spices in honor of a king at his funeral was customary
(compare the marginal references).
