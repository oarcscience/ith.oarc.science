### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#001)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 10:1</span></span>

Is it not because ... - Samuel answers Saul's tacit or expressed wonder,
by telling him why he did as he did. (Compare [Sa1
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#021).)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 10:2</span></span>

How should Saul know that what Samuel said was the word of the Lord?
Samuel gives him a sign, "Thou shalt find two men," etc. (Compare [Jdg
6:36-40](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#036); [Isa
7:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#011); [Joh
6:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#030); [Mar
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#002); [Mar
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#013), etc.)

Zelzah - A place absolutely unknown.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 10:3</span></span>

The plain of Tabor - It should be "the oak or terebinth"" of Tabor"
([Jdg 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#011) note). It has been
ingeniously conjectured that "Tabor" is either a different form of
"Deborah," or a corruption of it, and that the "oak," or "terebinth of
Tabor," is the same as "Allon-bachuth," the oak under which Deborah was
buried, and which lay "beneath Bethel" [Gen
35:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#008). The terebinth, where the three
men came upon Saul, must have been at some point previous to that where
the road leading northward from Jerusalem branches; when they reached
that point they would go on with their offerings to Bethel, he would
pursue his journey to Gibeah.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa1 10:5</span></span>

Hill of God - Rather, "Gibeah" of God, and so in [Sa1
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#010). Two things are clear; "one"
that Saul had got home when he got to Gibeah of God, for there he found
his uncle, and no further journeying is so much as hinted at, and the
same word "Gibeah" describes his home at [Sa1
10:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#026). The "other" that there was a
high place at Gibeah just above the city, from which he met the company
of prophets "coming down." Hence, it is obvious to conclude that the
name "Gibeah of God" (which occurs nowhere else) was sometimes given to
Gibeah of Saul on account of the worship on its high place, or,
possibly, that the name "Gibeah of God" described the whole hill on a
part of which the city Gibeah stood.

Where is the garrison of the Philistines - It seems strange that Samuel
should give this description of Gibeah to Saul, who must have been so
well acquainted with it. Possibly they may be explanatory words inserted
by the narrator with reference to [Sa1
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#002).

Musical instruments were the accompaniments of the prophetic song [Ch1
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#008); [Ch1
25:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#003). The "Psaltery" is a kind of lyre
with ten strings, in the shape of an earthen wine bottle (נבל nebel,
whence νάβλα nabla) which was something like a sugar-loaf or a delta.
The tabret is a kind of drum or tambourine, or timbrel, usually played
by dancing women ([Exo 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#020); [Jdg
11:34](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#034). Compare [Jer
31:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#004)). The pipe חליל châlı̂yl,
literally the "bored" or "pierced" instrument) is a kind of flute used
on occasions of joy and mirth [Isa
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#012); [Kg1
1:40](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#040); [Psa
68:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#025). The "harp" כנור kı̂nnôr, whence
the Greek κινύρα kinura was a stringed instrument, and that played upon
by David [Sa1 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#016); [Sa1
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#009); [Psa
43:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#004); [Psa
57:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#008).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 10:6</span></span>

Will come upon thee - The word rendered "come," means to "come" or "pass
upon," as fire does when it breaks out and spreads [Amo
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#006); hence, it is frequently used of
the Spirit of God passing upon anyone. (See [Jdg
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#019); [Jdg
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#014); below [Sa1
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#010); [Sa1
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#006); [Sa1
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#013).)

Shalt be turned into another man - This is a remarkable expression, and
occurs nowhere else. It describes the change in point of mental power
and energy which would result from the influx of the Spirit of the Lord
[Sa1 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#009). In the case of Samson it
was a supernatural bodily strength; in the case of Saul a capacity for
ruling and leading the people of which before he was destitute, and
which the Spirit worked in him. (Compare [Act
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#008); [Isa
11:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#002).)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa1 10:8</span></span>

Seven days shalt thou tarry ... - The appointment here made is not to be
confounded with that mentioned in marginal reference.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa1 10:12</span></span>

But who is their father - This is a very obscure phrase. If by "father"
be intended the head or leader (compare [Ch1
25:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#006); [Kg2
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#012)) of the prophets, the question
means: "What kind of leader can they have to admit such a person as Saul
into the company?" Some versions read "Who is his father?" in the sense:
"Who would have expected Kish to have a son among the prophets?"
(Compare [Mat 13:54-55](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#054).)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa1 10:14</span></span>

From the order of the narrative, and the mention of Saul's servant, it
looks as if Saul found his uncle at the high place. Perhaps some
solemnity similar to that mentioned in [Sa1
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#019) was going on at this time, in
which the prophets had been taking part.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa1 10:19</span></span>

For the use of "thousand" as equivalent to "family," see [Sa1
23:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#023); [Jdg
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#015) margin. In [Num
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#016) it may mean whole tribes.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa1 10:20</span></span>

Caused ... to come near ... was taken - The Hebrew phrases are exactly
the same as in [Jos 7:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#016), where the
King James Version renders the first has "brought."

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa1 10:21</span></span>

The family of Matri - This name occurs nowhere else among the families
of Benjamin, or in the genealogy of Saul. (See [Sa1
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#001) note.)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">sa1 10:22</span></span>

Among the stuff - Rather, "the baggage." The assembly was like a camp,
and the baggage (impedimenta) of the whole congregation was probably
collected in one place, where the wagons were arranged for protection.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">sa1 10:25</span></span>

The manner of the kingdom - i. e., the just prerogative of the kingdom,
the law, or bill of rights, by which the king's power was limited as
well as secured. It is not improbable that what Samuel wrote was simply
a transcript of [Deu 17:14-20](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#014), which
he "laid up before the Lord," i. e., placed by the side of the ark of
the covenant with the copy of the Law (see [Deu
31:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#026)). It would be ready for
reference if either king or people violated the "law of the kingdom."

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 10:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">sa1 10:26</span></span>

A band of men - Rather, "the host," "men of valor," There seems to be an
opposition intended between the "valiant men" and the "children of
Belial" ([Sa1 10:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#027)).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 10:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">sa1 10:27</span></span>

Presents - The מנחה mı̂nchāh was the token of homage and acknowledgment
from the subject to the sovereign, and from the tributary nation to
their suzerain. (See [Sa2 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#002), [Sa2
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#006); [Jdg
3:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#017); [Kg1
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#021); [Kg2
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#004), etc.; [Psa
72:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#010); [Isa
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#001).) Saul dissembled his resentment,
and waited for the favorable tide which soon came with the invasion of
Nahash.
