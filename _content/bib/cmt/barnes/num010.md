### [Numbers Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#001)

[Numbers 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 10:2</span></span>

The trumpet was a straight instrument, differing in this respect from
the curved horn or cornet; and is represented, among the other spoils of
the temple, on the Arch of Titus. See [Exo
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#023) cut. From Egyptian monuments it
appears that the Jewish trumpet was copied from that used in the armies
of the Pharaohs. The cornet was at first a simple ram's horn [Jos
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#004), and the metal instrument of later
times preserved the original shape.

[Numbers 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">num 10:5</span></span>

Blow an alarm - i. e. along continuous peal. Compare [Num
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#007), ye shall blow, but not sound an
alarm: i. e. blow in short, sharp notes, not in a continuous peal. A
third and a fourth alarm were probably blown as signals.

[Numbers 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">num 10:8</span></span>

The sons of Aaron - As the trumpets were emblematic of the voice of God,
the priests only were to use them. At this time there were only two
"sons of Aaron;" but in later times, when the number of priests was
greater, more trumpets were used; we read of seven in the times of
Joshua and David (see the marginal references.); and of a hundred and
twenty in that of Solomon [Ch2 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#012).

[Numbers 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">num 10:9</span></span>

For examples of the employment of trumpets in war compare marginal
references and [Ch2 20:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#028). By
employment of them was signified the dependence of God's people on His
aid.

[Numbers 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">num 10:10</span></span>

In the day of your gladness - Compare [Num
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#001); [Lev
23:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#024); [Ch2
29:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#027); [Ezr
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#010); [Neh
12:35](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#035), [Neh
12:41](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#041); [Psa
81:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#003).

[Numbers 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">num 10:11</span></span>

At this point commences the second great division of the book, extending
to the close of Num. 14. The remaining verses of the present chapter
narrate the actual break up of the camp at Sinai and the order of the
march.

[Numbers 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">num 10:12</span></span>

The wilderness of Paran - See [Gen
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#006) note. The wilderness is mentioned
here by anticipation. The earliest halting-places, Kibroth-hattaavah and
Hazeroth, were not within its limits [Num
11:35](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#035); [Num
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#016).

[Numbers 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">num 10:13</span></span>

Rather, And they journeyed (or, set forth) in the order of precedence
according to (i. e. established by) the commandment of the Lord, etc.,
and described in [Num 10:14-28](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#014).

[Numbers 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">num 10:14</span></span>

According to their armies - Compare [Num
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#003). There were three tribal hosts in
each camp; and each tribe had of course its subdivisions.

[Numbers 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">num 10:17</span></span>

A more precise determination of the method of executing the order given
in [Num 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#017). The appointed place of
the tabernacle, in the midst of the host, was represented during the
march by the ark, the holy vessels, etc. carried by the Kohathites. The
actual structure of the tabernacle was borne in advance by the
Gershonites and Merarites, immediately behind the camp of Judah; so as
to be set up ready against the arrival of the sacred utensils borne by
the Kohathites. Compare Num. 2; 4,

[Numbers 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">num 10:29</span></span>

Hobab, the son of Raguel - Or Reuel [Exo
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#018). Reuel was probably not identical
with Jethro: and Hobab was the brother-in-law, not the father-in-law, of
Moses; the Hebrew word translated in the King James Version
"father-in-law," signifying simply any relation by marriage ([Exo
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#001) note). Hobab [Jdg
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#016); [Jdg
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#011) eventually accompanied the
Israelites and obtained a settlement with them in the land of Canaan.
Hobab and Jethro may have been brethren and sons of Reuel.

[Numbers 10:31](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">num 10:31</span></span>

Thou mayest be to us instead of eyes - A proverbial expression still in
use in the East. Hobab would indicate the spots where water, fuel, and
pasture might be found, or warn them of the dangers from hurricanes, and
point out localities infested by robbers.

[Numbers 10:33](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">num 10:33</span></span>

Three days' journey - Probably a technical expression for such a
distance as could not be traversed in a single day, and therefore not
without intervals of encampment and due provision: compare [Gen
30:36](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#036); [Exo
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#018); [Exo
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#003); [Exo
8:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#027); [Exo
15:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#022). The technical use of the phrase
"Sabbath-day's journey" for another average distance, [Act
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#012), is similar.

The ark of the covenant of the Lord went before them - From [Num
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#021); [Num
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#017) it would appear that the usual
place of the ark during the march was in the midst of the host. It was
evidently an exceptional case when, in [Jos
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#003), [Jos
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#006), the ark preceded the people into
the bed of the Jordan. Hence, the words "went before them" do not here
imply local precedence. The phrase, or its equivalent, is used of a
leader going out in command of his troops, [Num
27:17](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#017); [Deu
31:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#003); [Sa1
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#016); [Ch2
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#010); and similarly the ark may well
be said to have gone at the head of the Israelites, when it was borne
solemnly in the midst of them as the outward embodiment of the presence
whose sovereign word was their law.

A resting place - literally, "rest." It is commonly understood of each
successive encampment; or, in particular, of the first encampment. Yet
the term would hardly be here employed, did it not carry with it a
higher meaning, pointing to the promised rest of Canaan, for which the
Israelites were now in full march, and from the speedy enjoyment of
which no sentence of exclusion as yet debarred them. Compare the
marginal references.

[Numbers 10:35](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">num 10:35</span></span>

Each forward movement and each rest of the ark was made to bear a
sacramental character. The one betokened the going forth of God against
His enemies; the other, His gathering of His own people to Himself: the
one was the pledge of victory, the other the earnest of repose.

[Num 10:36](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#036) may be translated:
"Restore" (i. e. to the land which their fathers sojourned in), "O Lord,
the ten thousands of the thousands of Israel." (Compare [Psa
85:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#004), where the verb in the Hebrew is
the same.)
