### [Nehemiah Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#001)

[Nehemiah 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">neh 7:1</span></span>

Since the watch of the temple had hitherto been kept by porters,
singers, and Levites 1 Chr. 26:1-19, so now the watch of the entire city
was committed to men of the same three classes, their experience
pointing them out as the most suitable persons.

[Nehemiah 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">neh 7:2</span></span>

My brother Hanani - See [Neh 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#002).

The ruler of the palace - Or, "the governor of the fortress." See the
marginal reference note.

He - i. e. Hananiah.

[Nehemiah 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">neh 7:3</span></span>

Until the sun be hot - An unusual precaution. The ordinary practice in
the East is to open town gates at sunrise.

[Nehemiah 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">neh 7:4</span></span>

The people were few - The number of those who returned with Zerubbabel
was no more than 42,360 [Neh 7:66](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#066).
Less than 2,000 people had come with Ezra Ezra 8:1-20.

[Nehemiah 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">neh 7:5</span></span>

It is argued by some that the entire catalogue which follows Neh. 7:7-73
is not the register of them "which came up 'at the first'," but of the
Jewish people in Nehemiah's time. [Neh
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#007) and [Ezr
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#002) are, however, very positive in
their support of the usual view; and some of the arguments against it
are thought to be met by considering the Nehemiah of [Neh
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#007) and [Ezr
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#002) a person different from Nehemiah
the governor; and "Tirshatha" an official title likely to have belonged
to others besides Nehemiah (see the [Ezr
2:63](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#063) note.)

[Nehemiah 7:70](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#070)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_070">neh 7:70</span></span>

Compared with [Ezr 2:69](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#069) there is
considerable difference between the totals for gold, silver, and
garments. The usual explanation is that of corruption in the one or the
other of the passages.

[Neh 7:73](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#073)

Dwelt in their cities - Nehemiah's quotation from Zerubbabel's register
ends here, and the narration of events in Jerusalem in his own day is
resumed from [Neh 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#003). The narrative
Neh. 8; 10 appears from internal evidence to be by a different author
(see the introduction of the Book of Nehemiah).

The last two clauses of [Neh 7:73](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#073)
should stand as the beginning of Neh. 8 (as in the Septuagint). The text
would then run: "And when the seventh month was come, and the children
of Israel were in their cities, the whole people gathered themselves
together as one man," etc. Compare the margin reference.
