Heritage

### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#001)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 18:1</span></span>

Was knit with the soul of David - The same forcible phrase occurs of
Jacob's love for Benjamin (marginal reference). Jonathan's truly heroic
character is shown in this generous love of David, and admiration of his
great deed.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 18:6</span></span>

The Philistine - Rather as in the margin. The allusion is not to
Goliath, but to one of the expeditions referred to in [Sa1
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#005).

Singing and dancing - Women used to dance to the sound of the timbrel,
and to sing as they danced and played.

(instruments of music The word means, an instrument like the triangle,
or with three cords.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa1 18:7</span></span>

As they played - Or danced with vocal and instrumental music (see [Jdg
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#025) note).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa1 18:8</span></span>

What can he have ... - Rather, "There is only the kingdom left for him."
Compare for the same sentiment, [Kg1
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#022). "A kingdom (says Camden)
brooketh no companion, and majesty more heavily taketh injuries to
heart."

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa1 18:10</span></span>

He prophesied - This, as the effect of the evil spirit coming upon him,
is singular as regards Saul, but is borne out by what we read in [Kg1
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#022). (Compare [Act
16:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#016); [Act
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#015); [Jo1
4:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#001)). It is impossible to give the
sense of "raving" to the word "prophesied," as though a merely natural
state of frenzy were intended. The "prophesying" here was as directly
the effect of the coming of the evil spirit upon Saul, as the
"prophesying" in [Sa1 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#010) was the
effect of the Spirit of God coming upon him. At the same time it is
quite true that "madness" and "prophesyings" were considered as near
akin (see [Jer 29:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#026); [Kg2
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#011)).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa1 18:17</span></span>

Saul had not hitherto fulfilled the promise of which David had heard
(marginal reference); nor was it unnatural that Saul should delay to do
so, until the shepherd's boy had risen to a higher rank.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa1 18:18</span></span>

What is my life - i. e., condition, or means of living ([Pro
27:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#027) margin).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa1 18:19</span></span>

Adriel the Meholathite - The five sons of this marriage perished by the
hands of the Gibeonites (marginal reference), where we learn further
that the name of Adriel's father, or ancestor, was Barzillai. His
birth-place was Meholah, probably the same as Abel-Meholah. (See [Kg1
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#016) note).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa1 18:20</span></span>

The thing pleased him - It partly relieved him from the charge of
breaking his faith.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa1 18:21</span></span>

In the one of the twain - Some prefer "the second time" [Job
33:14](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#014). The first contract had been
broken by giving Merab to Adriel.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">sa1 18:23</span></span>

A poor man and lightly esteemed - Compare [Psa
119:141](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#141). Poor, and therefore unable to
pay a sufficient dowry. See [Sa1
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#025).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 18:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">sa1 18:25</span></span>

An hundred foreskins - This is merely another expression of the spirit
which led to the constant application of the epithet uncircumcised to
the Philistines [Sa1 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#006).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 18:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">sa1 18:26</span></span>

The days were not expired - David was so rapid in his attack upon the
Philistines that he was able to bring the required dowry within the
time, and to receive his wife (Michal), before the time had expired
within which he was to receive Merab.
