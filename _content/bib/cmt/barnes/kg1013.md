### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#001)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 13:1</span></span>

Rather, "in the word of the Lord." The meaning seems to be, not merely
that the prophet was bid to come, but that he came in the strength and
power of God's word, a divinely inspired messenger. (Compare [Kg1
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#002), [Kg1
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#005),[Kg1
13:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#032).)

By the altar - "On the altar;" i, e. on the ledge, or platform, halfway
up the altar, whereupon the officiating priest always stood to
sacrifice. Compare [Kg1 12:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#032) note.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg1 13:2</span></span>

A child shall be born ... Josiah by name - Divine predictions so seldom
descend to such particularity as this, that doubts are entertained, even
by orthodox theologians, with respect to the actual mention of Josiah's
name by a prophet living in the time of Jeroboam. Only one other
instance that can be considered parallel occurs in the whole of
Scripture - the mention of Cyrus by Isaiah. Of course no one who
believes in the divine foreknowledge can doubt that God could, if He
chose, cause events to be foretold minutely by his prophets; but
certainly the general law of his Providence is, that He does not do so.
If this law is to be at any time broken through, it will not be
capriciously. Here it certainly does not appear what great effect was to
be produced by the mention of Josiah's name so long before his birth;
and hence, a doubt arises whether we have in our present copies the true
original text. The sense is complete without the words "Josiah by name;"
and these words, if originally a marginal note, may easily have crept
into the text by the mistake of a copyist. It is remarkable that, where
this narrative is again referred to in Kings (marginal reference), there
is no allusion to the fact that the man of God had prophesied of Josiah
"by name."

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg1 13:3</span></span>

He gave a sign - A sign of this kind - an immediate prophecy to prove
the divine character of a remote prophecy - had scarcely been given
before this. In the later history, however, such signs are not
unfrequent (compare [Kg2 19:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#029); [Isa
7:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014)).

The ashes ... shall be poured out - i. e., "The half-burnt remains of
the offerings shall be ignominiously spilled upon the ground."

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg1 13:5</span></span>

We need not suppose a complete shattering of the altar, but rather the
appearance of a crack or fissure in the fabric, which, extending from
top to bottom, caused the embers and the fragments of the victims to
fall until they reached the ground.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg1 13:7</span></span>

I will give thee a reward - It was customary to honor a prophet with a
gift, if he performed any service that was requested at his hands (see
the marginal references).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg1 13:9</span></span>

Eat no bread, nor drink water - The reason of the command is evident.
The man of God was not to accept the hospitality of any dweller at
Bethel, in order to show in a marked way, which men generally could
appreciate, God's abhorrence of the system which Jeroboam had "devised
of his own heart."

Nor turn again by the same way that thou camest - This command seems to
have been given simply to test the obedience of the prophet by laying
him under a positive as well as a moral obligation.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg1 13:11</span></span>

The truly pious Israelites quitted their homes when Jeroboam made his
religious changes, and, proceeding to Jerusalem, strengthened the
kingdom of Rehoboam [Ch2 10:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2010.htm#016).
This "old prophet" therefore, who, without being infirm in any way, had
remained under Jeroboam, and was even content to dwell at Bethel - the
chief seat of the new worship - was devoid of any deep and earnest
religious feeling.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg1 13:14</span></span>

Under an oak - literally, "under the oak," or "the terebinth-tree."
There was a single well-known tree of the kind, standing by itself in
the vicinity of Bethel, which the author supposed his readers to be
acquainted with.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg1 13:18</span></span>

But he lied unto him - It is always to be remembered that the prophetic
gift might co-exist with various degrees of moral imperfection in the
person possessing it. Note especially the case of Balaam.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg1 13:21</span></span>

Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the Lord - It was his duty
not to have suffered himself to be persuaded. He should have felt that
his obedience was being tried, and should have required, ere he
considered himself released, "the same, or as strong, evidence," as that
on which he had received the obligation. Disobedience to certain
positive commands of God, was one which it was at this time very
important to punish signally, since it was exactly the sin of Jeroboam
and his adherents.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg1 13:22</span></span>

On the anxiety of the Hebrews to be buried with their fathers, see [Gen
47:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#030); [Gen
49:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#029), [Gen
49:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#001),[Gen
49:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#025); [Sa2
19:37](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#037), etc.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 13:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">kg1 13:28</span></span>

The lion had not eaten the carcase, nor torn the ass - These strange
circumstances were of a nature to call men's attention to the matter,
and cause the whole story to be bruited abroad. By these means an
incident, which Jeroboam would have wished hushed up, became no doubt
the common talk of the whole people.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 13:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">kg1 13:30</span></span>

He laid his carcase in his own grave - As Joseph of Arimathaea did the
body of our Lord [Mat 27:60](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#060). The
possession of rock-hewn tombs by families, or individuals, was common
among the Jews from their first entrance into the holy land to their
final expulsion. A sepulchre usually consisted of an underground
apartment, into which opened a number of long, narrow "loculi," or
cells, placed side by side, each adapted to receive one body. The cells
were 6 or 7 feet long, 2 feet wide, and 3 feet high. They were commonly
closed by a stone placed at the end of each. Many such tombs still exist
in Palestine.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 13:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">kg1 13:32</span></span>

Against all the houses of the high places - i. e., more than the two
high places at Dan and Bethel. There were many lesser high places in the
land, several of which would be likely to be in Israel [Kg1
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#004).

In the cities of Samaria - The word Samaria cannot have been employed by
the old prophet, in whose days Samaria did not exist [Kg1
16:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#024). The writer of Kings has
substituted for the term used by him that whereby the country was known
in his own day.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 13:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">kg1 13:33</span></span>

Whosoever would, he consecrated him - i. e., he exercised no discretion,
but allowed anyone to become a priest, without regard to birth,
character, or social position. We may suspect from this that the office
was not greatly sought, since no civil governor who cared to set up a
priesthood would wish to degrade it in public estimation. Jeroboam did
impose one limitation, which would have excluded the very poorest class.
The candidate for consecration was obliged to make an offering
consisting of one young bullock and seven rams [Ch2
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#009).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 13:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">kg1 13:34</span></span>

This persistence in wrong, after the warning given him, brought a
judgment, not only on Jeroboam himself, but on his family. Jeroboam's
departure from the path of right forfeited the crown [Kg1
11:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#038); and in that forfeiture was
involved naturally the destruction of his family, for in the East, as
already observed, when one dynasty supplants another, the ordinary
practice is for the new king to destroy all the males belonging to the
house of his predecessor. See [Kg1
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#029).
