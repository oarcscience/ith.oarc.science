### [1 Chronicles Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#001)

[1 Chronicles 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 16:1</span></span>

The first three verses form part of the narrative commenced at [Ch1
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#025). Compare [Sa2
6:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#017), where the passage is not torn
from its proper context.

[1 Chronicles 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch1 16:4</span></span>

This passage is interposed by the writer of Chronicles between two
sentences of the parallel passage in Samuel. It contains a detailed
account of the service which David instituted at this time, a service
out of which grew the more elaborate service of the temple. The language
of much of the passage is remarkably archaic, and there can be no
reasonable doubt that it is in the main an extract from a record of the
time of David.

[Ch1 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#005)

The occurrence of the name "Jeiel" twice in this list is considered
suspicious. Hence, the first "Jeiel" is thought to be a corrupt reading
for "Aziel" [Ch1 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#020), or "Jaaziel"
[Ch1 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#018).

[Ch1 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#008)

The Psalm here put before us by the Chronicler, as sung liturgically by
Asaph and his brethren on the day of the ark's entrance into Jerusalem,
accords closely with the passages in the present Book of Psalms noted in
the marg reff.

It is, apparently, a thanksgiving service composed for the occasion out
of Psalms previously existing.

[Ch1 16:39](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#039)

This is the first mention that we have of Gibeon as the place at which
the tabernacle of the congregation now rested. Previously it had been at
Nob [Sa1 21:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#001), from where it was
removed probably at the time of the slaughter of the priests by Doeg
[Sa1 22:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#018). It is uncertain whether
Gibeon was regarded as a "high place" before the transfer to it of the
tabernacle: hut thenceforth, until the completion of Solomon's Temple,
it was the "great high place" [Kg1 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#004)
- a second center of the national worship which for above 50 years was
divided between Gibeon and Jerusalem.

[Ch1 16:40](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#040)

Upon the altar of the burnt offering - The original altar of
burnt-offering [Exo 27:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#001) continued
at Gibeon with the tabernacle [Ch2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#003), [Ch2
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#005). David must have erected a new
altar for sacrifice at Jerusalem [Ch1
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#001). The sacrifices commanded by the
Law were, it appears, offered at the former place; at the latter were
offered voluntary additional sacrifices.

[Ch1 16:41](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#041)

The rest ... - Rather, "the rest of the chosen ones, who were mentioned
by name." The "chosen ones" were "mentioned by name" in [Ch1
15:17-24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#017). A portion of them, namely,
those named in [Ch1 16:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#005), conducted
the service in Jerusalem; the remainder were employed in the worship at
Gibeon.
