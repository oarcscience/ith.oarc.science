<p>The narrative here is parallel with that in marginal reference, from which it varies but little, and to which it adds nothing.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#011">Ch2 9:11</A>
<p>Terraces - Rather, as in the margin, "stairs" (see the <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#012">Kg1 10:12</A> note).
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#012">Ch2 9:12</A>
<p>Beside that which she had brought unto the king - It is difficult to assign any sense to these words as they now stand in the Hebrew text. A slight alteration will give the meaning: "Beside that which the king had brought for her;" which is in conformity with <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#013">Kg1 10:13</A>.

<p>Comparing <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#016">Kg1 10:16-17</A>, it follows from the two passages together that the "pound of gold" was equal to 100 shekels.

<p>The footstool (not mentioned in Kings) was an essential appendage to an Oriental throne; it appears everywhere in the Egyptian, Assyrian, and Persian sculptures. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#023">2 Chronicles 9:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">ch2 9:23</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>All the kings of the earth - Rather, "all the kings of the land:" all the monarchs, that is, whose dominions were included in So omon's empire (see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#021">Kg1 4:21</A>).

<p>And out of all lands - An addition to the words in Kings. The principal countries would no doubt be Arabia and Armenia - the former always famous for its excellent breed; the latter mentioned in Ezekiel <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#014">Eze 27:14</A> as trading with horses in the fairs of Tyre. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#029">2 Chronicles 9:29</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_029">ch2 9:29</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The book of Nathan ... - On the "books" here mentioned, see the introduction to Chronicles, the second note.
<p>We hear nothing of Iddo in Kings: but he is mentioned below twice <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#015">Ch2 12:15</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#022">Ch2 13:22</A>. In the latter of these passages he is called not "the seer," but "the prophet." He seems to have been the author of three works:
<p>(1) Visions against Jeroboam;
<p>(2) A book of genealogies; and
<p>(3) A commentary or history.
<p>According to some, he was identical with Oded, the father of Azariah, who prophesied in the reign of Asa (see the <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#001">Ch2 15:1</A> note).
