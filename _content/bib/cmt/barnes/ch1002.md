### [1 Chronicles Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#001)

[1 Chronicles 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 2:1</span></span>

The sons of Israel - The order of the names here approximates to an
order determined by legitimacy of birth. A single change - the removal
of Dan to the place after Benjamin - would give the following result:

\(1\) The six sons of the first wife, Leah.

\(2\) the two sons of the second wife, Rachel.

\(3\) the two sons of the first concubine, Bilhah.

\(4\) the two sons of the second concubine, Zilpah.

Dan's undue prominency may, perhaps, be accounted for by his occupying
the seventh place in the "blessing of Jacob" [Gen
49:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#016).

[1 Chronicles 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 2:6</span></span>

The sons of Zerah - Here, for the first time, the writer of Chronicles
draws from sources not otherwise known to us, recording facts not
mentioned in the earlier Scriptures. Ethan, Heman, Calcol, and Dara,
sons of Zerah, are only known to us from this passage, since there are
no sufficient grounds for identifying them with the "sons of Mahol"
(marginal reference).

[1 Chronicles 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch1 2:7</span></span>

"Achan" [Jos 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#001) seems to have become
"Achar," in order to assimilate the word more closely to the Hebrew term
for "troubler," which was from the time of Achan's sin regarded as the
true meaning of his name [Jos 7:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#025).

[1 Chronicles 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch1 2:15</span></span>

David the seventh - Jesse had eight sons, of whom David was the youngest
[Sa1 16:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#010); [Sa1
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#012). Probably one of the sons shown
to Samuel at Bethlehem did not grow up.

[1 Chronicles 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch1 2:16</span></span>

Sisters - i. e. half-sisters. Abigail and Zeruiah were daughters not of
Jesse, but of a certain Nahash, whose widow Jesse took to wife [Sa2
17:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#025).

From the present passage, and from the fact that Abishai joined David as
a comrade in arms before Joab [Sa1
26:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#006), it would seem that, although
Joab was pre-eminent among the three [Sa2
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#013), [Sa2
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#016), Abishai was the eldest.

[1 Chronicles 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch1 2:17</span></span>

Jether the Ishmeelite - See the marginal note and reference.

[1 Chronicles 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch1 2:18</span></span>

In the remainder of this chapter the writer obtains scarcely any
assistance from the earlier Scriptures, and must have drawn almost
entirely from genealogical sources, accessible to him, which have since
perished.

Azubah was Caleb's wife; Jerioth his concubine. He had children by both;
but those of Azubah are alone recorded.

[1 Chronicles 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch1 2:22</span></span>

Jair, who had three and twenty cities - The places called "Havoth-Jair"
in the earlier Scriptures (see [Num
32:41](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#041) note), which appear to have been
a number of "small towns," or villages, in the Ledjah, the Classical
"Trachonitis."

[1 Chronicles 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ch1 2:23</span></span>

Rather, "And Geshur and Aram (i. e. the Geshurites [Deu
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#014) and Syrians) took the villages of
Jair from them:" recovered, that is, from the new settlers the places
which Jair had conquered.

All these belonged to the sons of Machir - Rather, "All these were sons
of Machir," i. e. Segub and Jair, with their descendants, were reckoned
sons of Machir, rather than sons of Hezron, although only descended from
Machir on the mother's side. The reason of this seems to have been that
they cast in their lot with the Manassites, and remained in their
portion of the trans-Jordanic region.

[1 Chronicles 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">ch1 2:25</span></span>

And Ahijah - There is no "and" in the original. Hence, some would read:
"the sons" were born "of" or "from Ahijah," the first wife of Jerahmeel
(see the next verse).

[1 Chronicles 2:42](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">ch1 2:42</span></span>

A third line of descent from Caleb, the son of Hezron, the issue
probably of a different mother, perhaps Jerioth [Ch1
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#018). The supposed omissions in this
verse have been supplied as follows:

\(1\) "Mesha, the father of Ziph; and the sons of Ziph, Mareshah, the
father of Hebron;" or

\(2\) "Mareshah, the father of Ziph; and the sons of Mareshah, the
father of Ziph, Hebron."

Ziph, like Jorkoam [Ch1 2:44](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#044) and
Beth-zur [Ch1 2:45](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#045), is the name of a
place where the respective chiefs ("fathers") settled. Similarly
Madmannah, Machbenah, and Gibea [Ch1
2:49](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#049), Kirjath-jearim ([Jos
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#017) note), Bethlehem and Beth-gader
(Jedur, [Ch1 2:51](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#051)) are unmistakeable
names of places in the list, names which it is not probable were ever
borne by persons.

[1 Chronicles 2:50](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#050)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">ch1 2:50</span></span>

Caleb the son of Hur - Hur was the son, not the father, of Caleb [Ch1
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#019). The text should perhaps be read:
"These (the list in [Ch1 2:42-49](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#042)) were
the sons of Caleb. The sons of Hur, the first-born of Ephratah, were
Shobal, etc."

[1 Chronicles 2:54](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#054)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">ch1 2:54</span></span>

Ataroth, the house of Joab - Rather, "Ataroth-beth-Joab," probably so
called, to distinguish it from Ataroth-Adar, a city of Benjamin [Jos
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#013). It is uncertain from what Joab
it derived its distinctive appellation.

[1 Chronicles 2:55](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#055)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_055">ch1 2:55</span></span>

Kenites - It is remarkable that Kenites - people of a race quite
distinct from the Israelites [Gen
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#019) - should be attached to, and, as
it were, included in the descendants of Judah. It seems, however, that
the friendly feeling between the two tribes - based on the conduct of
the Kenites at the time of the Exodus [Exo
18:10-19](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#010); [Num
10:29-32](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#029); [Sa1
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#006) - led to their intermixture and
almost amalgamation with the Israelites, Kenite families not only
dwelling among them but being actually regarded as of one blood with
them.
