### [Exodus Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#001)

[Exodus 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">exo 10:4</span></span>

The locusts - The locust is less common in Egypt than in many eastern
countries, yet it is well known, and dreaded as the most terrible of
scourges. They come generally from the western deserts, but sometimes
from the east and the southeast. No less than nine names are given to
the locust in the Bible, of which the word used here is the most common
(ארבה 'arbeh); it signifies "multitudinous," and whenever it occurs
reference is made to its terrible devastations.

[Exodus 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">exo 10:5</span></span>

The face - Literally, cover "the eye of the earth," alluding to the
darkness which follows, when the whole atmosphere is filled on all sides
and to a great height by an innumerable quantity of these insects.

Shall eat every tree - Not only the leaves, but the branches and even
the wood were attacked and devoured. The Egyptians were passionately
fond of trees.

[Exodus 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">exo 10:6</span></span>

Fill thy houses - The terraces, courts, and even the inner apartments
are said to be filled in a moment by a locust storm. Compare [Joe
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#009).

[Exodus 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">exo 10:7</span></span>

For the first time the officers of Pharaoh intervene before the scourge
is inflicted, showing at once their belief in the threat, and their
special terror of the infliction. Also, for the first time, Pharaoh
takes measures to prevent the evil; he does not indeed send for Moses
and Aaron, but he permits them to be brought into his presence.

Let the men go - i. e. the men only, not all the people. See [Exo
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#008).

[Exodus 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">exo 10:9</span></span>

With our young ... - The demand was not contrary to Egyptian usage, as
great festivals were kept by the whole population.

[Exodus 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">exo 10:10</span></span>

Evil is before you - i. e. "your intentions are evil." Great as the
possible infliction might be, Pharaoh held it to be a less evil than the
loss of so large a population.

[Exodus 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">exo 10:13</span></span>

An east wind - See [Exo 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#004). Moses is
careful to record the natural and usual cause of the evil, portentous as
it was both in extent and in connection with its denouncement.

[Exodus 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">exo 10:14</span></span>

Went up - At a distance the locusts appear hanging, as it were, like a
heavy cloud over the land; as they approach they seem to rise, and they
fill the atmosphere overhead upon their arrival.

Over all the land - Travelers mention a cloud of locusts extending over
500 miles, and so compact while on the wing that it completely hid the
sun. This passage describes a swarm unprecedented in extent.

[Exodus 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">exo 10:17</span></span>

This death only - Pliny calls locusts a pestilence brought on by divine
wrath. Pharaoh now recognizes the justice of his servants'
apprehensions, [Exo 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#007).

[Exodus 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">exo 10:19</span></span>

West wind - Literally, "a sea wind," a wind blowing from the sea on the
northwest of Egypt.

Red sea - The Hebrew has the "Sea of Suph": the exact meaning of which
is disputed. Gesenius renders it "rush" or "seaweed;" but it is probably
an Egyptian word. A sea-weed resembling wood is thrown up abundantly on
the shores of the Red Sea. The origin of the name "Red" Sea is
uncertain: (naturalists have connected it with the presence of red
infusoria, [Exo 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#017)).

[Exodus 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">exo 10:21</span></span>

Darkness - This infliction was specially calculated to affect the
spirits of the Egyptians, whose chief object of worship was the Sun-god;
and its suddenness and severity in connection with the act of Moses mark
it as a preternatural withdrawal of light. Yet, it has an analogy in
physical phenomena. After the vernal equinox the southwest wind from the
desert blows some 50 days, not however, continuously but at intervals,
lasting generally some two or three days. It fills the atmosphere with
dense masses of fine sand, bringing on a darkness far deeper than that
of our worst fogs in winter. The consternation of Pharaoh proves that,
familiar as he may have been with the phenomenon, no previous occurrence
had prepared him for its intensity and duration, and that he recognized
it as a supernatural visitation.

[Exodus 10:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">exo 10:23</span></span>

Had light in their dwellings - The sandstorm, if such were the cause,
may not have extended to the district of Goshen; but the expression
clearly denotes a miraculous intervention, whether accomplished or not
by natural agencies.

[Exodus 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">exo 10:24</span></span>

Your flocks and your herds - Pharaoh still exacts what would of course
be a complete security for their return: but the demand was wholly
incompatible with the object assigned for the journey into the
wilderness.
