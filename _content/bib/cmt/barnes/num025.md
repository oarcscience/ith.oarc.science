### [Numbers Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#001)

[Numbers 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 25:1</span></span>

The records of the neighboring cities of the plain, and the
circumstances of the origin of Moab ([Gen
19:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#030) ff) suggest that the people
among whom Israel was now thrown were more than ordinarily licentious.

[Numbers 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 25:2</span></span>

And they called - i. e., "the daughters of Moab called."

[Numbers 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">num 25:3</span></span>

Joined himself - i. e., by taking part in the sacrificial meals as
described in the last verse. Compare [Exo
34:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#015); [Co1
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#018). The worship of Baal was
attended with the grossest impurity, and indeed partly consisted in it
[Hos 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#014); [Hos
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#010).

Baal-peor - i. e., the Baal worshipped at Peer, the place mentioned in
[Num 23:28](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#028) (compare Baal-meon, [Num
32:38](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#038)). (The identification of this
god with Chemosh in [Num 21:29](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#029) is now
given up.)

[Numbers 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">num 25:4</span></span>

Take - i. e., assemble the chiefs of the people to thee (compare the
phrase "took men," in [Num 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#001)). The
offenders were to be first; slain by the hands of "the judges of Israel"
[Num 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#005), and afterward hung up
"against the sun" (i. e., publicly, openly; compare [Sa2
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#012)) as an aggravation of their
punishment. This would be done by impaling the body or fastening it to a
cross. Compare [Deu 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#023) note, and
[Sa2 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#009).

[Numbers 25:6](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">num 25:6</span></span>

A Midianite woman - literally, "the Midianite woman," the particular one
by whom he had been enticed (compare [Num
25:15](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#015) and [Num
31:18](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#018)). Her high rank proves that
Zimri had not fallen in with her by mere chance, but had been
deliberately singled out by the Midianites as one whom they must at any
price lead astray.

Weeping before the door of the tabernacle - The plague [Num
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#009) had already broken out among the
people: and the more God-fearing had assembled at the door of the
tabernacle of God (compare the marginal reference.) to intercede for
mercy, when Zimri committed the fresh and public outrage just described.

[Numbers 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">num 25:8</span></span>

Into the tent - The inner recess in the tent, fashioned archwise, and
appropriated as the sleeping-chamber and women's apartment.

[Numbers 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">num 25:9</span></span>

Twenty and four thousand - Paul [Co1
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#008) says "three and twenty thousand,"
following probably the Jewish tradition which deducted one thousand as
the number slain by the hands of their brethren.

[Numbers 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">num 25:11</span></span>

Hath turned my wrath away - The signal example thus made of a leading
offender by Phinehas was accepted by God as an expiation (literally in
[Num 25:13](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#013) "covering;" see the note at
the typical significance [Lev 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#004)),
and the exterminating wrath which had gone forth against the whole
people was arrested [Psa 106:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#030).

The act of Phinehas must be regarded as exceptional. It was an
extraordinary deed of vengeance, justified by the singular atrocity of
the crime which provoked it; but it does not confer the right to every
man to punish summarily any gross and flagrant breach of divine law
committed in his presence. Compare the act of Mattathias (1 Macc.
2:24-26).

The act was its own justification. Its merit consisted in the evidence
it gave that the heart of Phinehas was right before God. He was "zealous
with God's zeal," and abhorred the presumptuous wickedness of Zimri, as
God abhorred it. He therefore risked his own life by dealing according
to their deserts with two influential and defiant evil-doers; and his
act, done in the face of Moses and the people, and for them, was
accepted by God as a national atonement; and rewarded by the people
(compare the leadership assigned to him in [Num
31:6](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#006); [Jos
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#013)).

[Numbers 25:12](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">num 25:12</span></span>

My covenant of peace - Equivalent to "the covenant of My peace." God
established with Phinehas in particular that covenant which He had made
generally with all his people; and among its blessings peace is
especially mentioned, because of the peace between God and the
congregation which Phinehas had brought about. As an additional gift
there is assigned to him and his seed forever the office of
peace-making, the legitimate function of the priesthood (compare [Eph
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014)); and the covenant was thus to
him a covenant not only of peace but of life (compare the marginal
reference). Phinehas became highpriest after the death of his father
Eleazar, and the office, with a short interruption from the days of Eli
to those of David, when for unknown reasons it was filled by the
descendants of his uncle Ithamar, was perpetuated in his line; nor
indeed is it known to have departed from that line again until the
typical priesthood of the sons of Aaron was merged in the actual
priesthood of the Saviour of mankind.
