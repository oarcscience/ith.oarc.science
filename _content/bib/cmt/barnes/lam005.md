### [Lamentations Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#001)

[Lamentations](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">lam 5:0</span></span>

This final chapter Lam. 5 consists of the same number of verses as there
are letters in the Hebrew alphabet, but they no longer begin with the
letters in regular order. Strict care is shown in the form and
arrangement of the poem, each verse being compressed into a very brief
compass, consisting of two members which answer to one another both in
idea and expression. It is mainly occupied with the recapitulation of
sufferings Lam. 5:2-18, and finally closes with earnest prayer.

[Lamentations 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lam 5:1</span></span>

What is come upon us - literally, "what" has happened "to us:" our
national disgrace.

[Lamentations 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lam 5:2</span></span>

Turned - "transferred." The inheritance was the land of Canaan [Lev
20:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#024).

Aliens - Or, "foreigners:" i. e. the Chaldaeans upon their conquest of
the country.

[Lamentations 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lam 5:3</span></span>

Our mothers are as widows - The particle "as" suggests that the whole
verse is metaphorical. Our distress and desolation is comparable only to
that of fatherless orphans or wives just bereaved of their husbands.

[Lamentations 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lam 5:4</span></span>

Better as in the margin cometh to us for price. The rendering of the the
King James Version spoils the carefully studied rhythm of the original.
The bitterness of the complaint lies in this, that it was their own
property which they had to buy.

[Lamentations 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">lam 5:5</span></span>

Our necks ... - i. e. we were pursued so actively that our enemies
seemed to be leaning over our necks ready to seize us.

We labor - We were wearied, "there was no rest for us:" being chased
incessantly.

[Lamentations 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">lam 5:6</span></span>

"To give the hand" means to submit oneself. Absolutely it was Babylon
that had just destroyed their national existence, but Jeremiah means
that all feelings of patriotism were crushed, and the sole care that
remained was the desire for personal preservation. To secure this the
people would readily have submitted to the yoke either of Egypt or
Assyria, the great powers from which in their past history they had so
often suffered.

[Lamentations 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">lam 5:7</span></span>

And are not; and we ... - Or, they are not; "we have borne their
iniquities." Our fathers who began this national apostasy died before
the hour of punishment.

[Lamentations 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">lam 5:8</span></span>

Servants - i. e. Slaves. A terrible degradation to a high-spirited Jew.

[Lamentations 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">lam 5:9</span></span>

We gat - Or, We get "our bread at the peril of our lives." This verse
apparently refers to those who were left in the land, and who in
gathering in such fruits as remained, were exposed to incursions of the
Bedouin, here called "the sword of the desert."

[Lamentations 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">lam 5:10</span></span>

Our skin ... - Or, is fiery red like an oven because of the fever-blast
"of famine."

[Lamentations 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">lam 5:11</span></span>

They ravished - They humbled.

[Lamentations 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">lam 5:12</span></span>

After the princes had been put to death their bodies were hung up by the
hand to expose them to public contumely. Old age, again, no more availed
to shield men from shameful treatment than the high rank of the princes.
Such treatment of conquered enemies was not uncommon in ancient warfare.

[Lamentations 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">lam 5:13</span></span>

They took the young men to grind - Or, "The young men" have borne the
mill, a menial and laborious task usually performed by slaves (compare
[Isa 47:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#002)).

The children fell under the wood - Or, lads have stumbled under burdens
of wood. By lads are meant youths up to the age of military service;
another form of menial labor.

[Lamentations 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lam 5:14</span></span>

The gate - The gate was the place for public gatherings, for
conversation, and the music of stringed instruments.

[Lamentations 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">lam 5:16</span></span>

Literally, "The crown of our head is fallen," i. e. what was our chief
ornament and dignity is lost; the independence of the nation, and all
that gave them rank and honor.

[Lamentations 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">lam 5:17</span></span>

Is faint ... - Or, has become "faint" - have become "dim." "For this,"
i. e. for the loss of our crown etc.

[Lamentations 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">lam 5:18</span></span>

The foxes - Or, jackals. As these animals live among ruins, and shun the
presence of man, it shows that Zion is laid waste and deserted.

[Lamentations 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">lam 5:19</span></span>

Remainest - Or, reignest. The earthly sanctuary is in ruins, but the
heavenly throne in unchangeable glory.

[Lamentations 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">lam 5:22</span></span>

Literally, "Unless thou hast utterly rejected us," unless "thou art very
wroth against us." This is stated as a virtual impossibility. God's
anger can be but temporary [Psa 30:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#005),
and therefore the very supposition is an indirect expression of hope.

This verse speaks of the possibility of an utter rejection through God's
wrath. Therefore, to remove so painful a thought, and to make the book
more suited for public reading, [Lam
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#021) is repeated in many manuscripts
intended for use in the synagogue. The same rule is observed in the
synagogue with the two last verses of Ecclesiastes, Isaiah, and Malachi.
