### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#001)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 1:1</span></span>

The Moabites, who had once lorded over Israel [Jdg
3:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#012), were reduced to subjection by
David, and treated with extreme severity (marginal reference). In the
time of Ahab they were dependent on the kingdom of Israel, to which it
has been generally supposed that they fell at the separation of Israel
from Judah. The Moabite monument (see [Kg2
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#004)), discovered in 1869, has now
given reason to believe that they then recovered their independence, but
were again reduced by Omri, who, with his son Ahab, is said (in round
numbers) to have "oppressed" them for "forty years." Ahab's death was
seized upon as an occasion for revolt, and Moab (perhaps owing to
Ahaziah's sickness) easily regained her independence.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg2 1:2</span></span>

A lattice - The "upper chamber" had probably a single latticed window,
through which Ahaziah fell. Windows in the East are to this day
generally closed by lattices of interlaced wood, which open outward; so
that, if the fastening is not properly secured, one who leans against
them may easily fall out.

Baal-zebub - literally, "Lord (i. e., averter) of flies." Flies in the
East constitute one of the most terrible of plages [Psa
105:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#031); [Exo
8:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#024); and Orientals would be as likely
to have a "god of flies" as a god of storm fand thunder. To inquire [Kg2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#003) of Baal-zebub was practically to
deny Yahweh. Ahaziah cast aside the last remnant of respect for the old
religion, and consulted a foreign oracle, as if the voice of God were
wholly silent in his own country.

For Ekron see the marginal reference.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg2 1:4</span></span>

Therefore ... - As a punishment for this insult to Yahweh.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 1:8</span></span>

An hairy man - Either in allusion to his shaggy cloak of untanned skin;
or, more probably, an expression descriptive of the prophet's person, of
his long flowing locks, abundant beard, and general profusion of hair.
His costume was that of a thorough ascetic. Generally the Jews wore
girdles of linen or cotton stuff, soft and comfortable. Under the girdle
they wore one or two long linen gowns or shirts, and over these they had
sometimes a large shawl. Elijah had only his leather girdle and his
sheepskin cape or "mantle."

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg2 1:9</span></span>

Then the king sent unto him - i. e., in order to seize and punish him.
Compare [Kg1 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#010); [Kg1
22:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#027).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg2 1:10</span></span>

The charge of cruelty made against Elijah makes it needful to consider
the question: What was Elijah's motive? And the answer is: Sharply to
make a signal example, to vindicate God's honor in a striking way.
Ahaziah had, as it were, challenged Yahweh to a trial of strength by
sending a band of fifty to arrest one man. Elijah was not Jesus Christ,
able to reconcile mercy with truth, the vindication of God's honor with
the utmost tenderness for erring men, and awe them merely by His
presence (compare [Joh 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#006)). In
Elijah the spirit of the Law was embodied in its full severity. His zeal
was fierce; he was not shocked by blood; he had no softness and no
relenting. He did not permanently profit by the warning at Horeb ([Kg1
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#012) note). He continued the
uncompromising avenger of sin, the wielder of the terrors of the Lord,
such exactly as he had shown himself at Carmel. He is, consequently, no
pattern for Christian men [Luk 9:55](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#055);
but his character is the perfection of the purely legal type. No true
Christian after Pentecost would have done what Elijah did. But what he
did, when he did it, was not sinful. It was but executing strict, stern
justice. Elijah asked that fire should fall - God made it fall; and, by
so doing, both vindicated His own honor, and justified the prayer of His
prophet.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg2 1:17</span></span>

The similarity of names in the two royal houses of Israel and Judah at
this time, and at no other, seems to be the consequence of the close
ties which united the two reigning families, and is well noted among the
"undesigned coincidences" of the Old Testament. The accession of the
Israelite Jehoram (Ahab's brother) took place, according to [Kg2
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#001), in the eighteenth year of
Jehoshaphat. Jehoram of Judah perhaps received the royal title from his
father as early as his father's sixteenth year, when he was about to
join Ahab against the Syrians; the same year might then be called either
the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat or the second year of Jehoram.
