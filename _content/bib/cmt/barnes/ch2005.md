### [2 Chronicles Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 5:1</span></span>

This chapter contains one important addition only to the narrative of
Kings (see the marginal references); namely, the account of the
circumstances under which the manifestation of the Divine Presence took
place [Ch2 5:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#011).

[2 Chronicles 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch2 5:4</span></span>

The Levites took up the ark - i. e., such of the Levites as were also
priests (compare [Ch2 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#007); [Kg1
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#003)).

[2 Chronicles 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch2 5:9</span></span>

From the ark - Or, according to a different reading here and according
to [Kg1 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#008), some read, "the ends of
the staves were seen from the Holy place."

There it is unto this day - This should be corrected as in the margin.

[2 Chronicles 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch2 5:13</span></span>

Even the house of the Lord - Or, according to another reading
(Septuagint), which removes the superfluousness of these words - "The
house was filled with a cloud of the glory of the Lord."
