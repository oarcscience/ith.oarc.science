### [Leviticus Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#001)

[Leviticus 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 25:1</span></span>

The sabbatical year and the year of Jubilee belong to that great
sabbatical system which runs through the religious observances of the
Law, but rest upon moral rather than upon formally religious ground. It
is not, therefore, without reason that they are here set apart from the
set times which fell strictly within the sphere of religious
observances.

[Leviticus 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lev 25:3</span></span>

Vineyard - Rather, fruit-garden. The Hebrew word is a general one for a
plantation of fruit-trees.

[Leviticus 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lev 25:4</span></span>

A sabbath of rest - See [Lev 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#003)
note. The express prohibition of sowing and reaping, and of pruning and
gathering, affords a presumption in favor of the sabbatical year
beginning, like the year of Jubilee [Lev
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#009), in the first month of the civil
year [Lev 23:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#024), the seventh of the
sacred year, when the land was cleared of the crops of the preceding
year.

The great material advantage of the institution must have been the
increased fertility of the soil from its lying fallow one year out of
seven, at a time when neither the rotation of crops nor the art of
manuring were understood. It must also have kept up a salutary habit of
economy in the storing of grain. Compare [Gen
41:48-56](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#048). Its great spiritual lesson
was that there was no such thing as absolute ownership in the land
vested in any man, that the soil was the property of Yahweh, that it was
to be held in trust for Him, and not to be abused by overworking, but to
be made the most of for the good of every creature which dwelt upon it.

[Leviticus 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">lev 25:5</span></span>

Vine undressed - That is, "unpruned"; literally "Nazarite vine", the
figure being taken from the unshorn locks of the Nazarite. [Num
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#005).

[Leviticus 25:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">lev 25:6</span></span>

The sabbath of the land shall be meat for you - That is, the produce of
the untilled land (its "increase," [Lev
25:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#007)) shall be food for the whole of
you in common, rich and poor without distinction [Exo
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#011).

[Leviticus 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">lev 25:8</span></span>

The land was to be divided by lot among the families of the Israelites
when the possession of it was obtained. [Num
26:52-56](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#052); [Num
33:54](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#054), etc. At the end of every
seventh sabbatical cycle of years, in the year of Jubilee, each field or
estate that might have been alienated was to be restored to the family
to which it had been originally allotted.

[Lev 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#008)

Seven sabbaths of years - seven weeks of years.

[Lev 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#009)

Cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound - Rather, cause the sound of
the cornet to go through (the land). The word jubile does not occur in
this verse in the Hebrew. The trumpet is the shofar שׁפר shôphār, i. e.
the cornet (rendered "shawm" in the Prayer-Book version of [Psa
98:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#007)), either the horn of some animal
or a tube of metal shaped like one. As the sound of the cornet (see [Lev
25:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#010) note) was the signal of the
descent of Yahweh when He came down upon Sinai to take Israel into
covenant with Himself [Exo 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#013), [Exo
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#016), [Exo
19:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#019); [Exo
20:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#018), so the same sound announced, at
the close of the great day of atonement, after the Evening sacrifice,
the year which restored each Israelite to the freedom and the blessings
of the covenant.

[Lev 25:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#010)

The fiftieth year - The Jubilee probably coincided with each seventh
sabbatical year, and was called the fiftieth, as being the last of a
series of which the first was the preceding Jubilee.

A jubile - Commonly spelled jubilee. The original word first occurs in
[Exo 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#013), where it is rendered
"trumpet," margin "cornet." It most probably denotes the sound of the
cornet, not the cornet itself, and is derived from a root, signifying to
flow abundantly, which by a familiar metaphor might be applied to sound.

[Leviticus 25:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lev 25:14</span></span>

Sell ought - i. e., any piece of ground.

Oppress one another - Rather, overreach one another. (Compare [Sa1
12:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#003)).

[Leviticus 25:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">lev 25:15</span></span>

The number of years of the fruits - i. e. according to the number of
harvests. The average value of a yearly crop might of course be
estimated, and the sabbatical years were to be deducted from the series.

[Leviticus 25:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">lev 25:18</span></span>

In safety - i. e., secure from famine, [Lev
26:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#005); [Deu
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#010).

[Leviticus 25:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">lev 25:23</span></span>

These verses express the principle on which the law of Jubilee, as it
regards the land, was based. The land belonged to Yahweh, and it was He
who allotted it among the families of Israel for their use. No estate
could therefore be alienated in perpetuity, by any human authority, from
the family to whose lot it might fall.

[Lev 25:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#024)

Grant a redemption for the land - i. e. grant power to recover the land
to the original holder who had parted with it.

[Leviticus 25:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">lev 25:25</span></span>

If thy brother be waxen poor - The Israelites never parted with their
land except under the pressure of poverty. Compare the answer of Naboth,
[Kg1 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#003).

[Leviticus 25:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">lev 25:28</span></span>

It shall go out - i. e. it shall be set free.

[Leviticus 25:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">lev 25:30</span></span>

Not go out - Because most of the houses in cities were occupied by
artificers and traders whose wealth did not consist in lands.

[Leviticus 25:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">lev 25:32</span></span>

Rather, And concerning the cities of the Levites, the houses in the
cities of their possession, etc. If one of the Levites redeems a house
in the city, etc. The meaning appears to be, if a Levite redeemed a
house which had been sold to a person of a different tribe by another
Levite, it was to revert in the Jubilee to the latter Levite as its
original possessor. The purchaser of a Levite's house was in fact only
in the condition of a tenant at will, while the fields attached to the
Levitical cities could never be alienated, even for a time.

For the application of the law of Jubilee to lands dedicated to the
service of the sanctuary, see [Lev
27:16-25](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#016).

[Leviticus 25:35](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">lev 25:35</span></span>

Rather, And if thy brother (an Israelite) becomes poor and falls into
decay with thee, thou shalt assist him and let him live with thee like a
resident foreigner. He was not to be regarded as an outcast, but was to
be treated with the same respect and consideration as a resident
foreigner who, like him, could possess no land, but could accumulate
property and live in comfort as a free man. See [Lev
16:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#029) note.

[Leviticus 25:37](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">lev 25:37</span></span>

Lend him thy victuals for increase - i. e. supply him with food for thy
own profit.

[Leviticus 25:38](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">lev 25:38</span></span>

Here, and in [Lev 25:42](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#042), [Lev
25:55](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#055), is expressed the principle
which was to limit and modify the servitude of Hebrew servants.

[Leviticus 25:39](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">lev 25:39</span></span>

The law here appears harmoniously to supplement the earlier one in [Exo
21:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#001). It was another check applied
periodically to the tyranny of the rich. Compare [Jer
34:8-17](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#008).

[Leviticus 25:43](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">lev 25:43</span></span>

Fear thy God - Yahweh was the Lord and Master of His people. To treat a
Hebrew as a slave was therefore to interfere with the rights of Yahweh.
Compare [Rom 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#004).

[Leviticus 25:44](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">lev 25:44</span></span>

Property in foreign slaves is here distinctly permitted. It was a
patriarchal custom [Gen 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#012). Such
slaves might be captives taken in war ([Num
31:6](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#006) following; [Deu
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#014)), or those consigned to slavery
for their crimes, or those purchased of foreign slave-dealers. The price
of a slave is supposed to have varied from thirty to fifty shekels. See
[Lev 27:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#003), note; [Exo
21:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#032), note; [Zac
11:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#012), note; [Mat
26:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#015), note. It was the object of
Moses, not at once to do away with slavery, but to discourage and to
mitigate it. The Law would not suffer it to be forgotten that the slave
was a man, and protected him in every way that was possible at the time
against the injustice or cruelty of his master. See the notes at Exo.
21.

[Lev 25:46](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#046)

Your bondmen forever - i. e. they were not necessarily to be released in
the sabbatical year nor at the Jubilee.

[Leviticus 25:47](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#047)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">lev 25:47</span></span>

A sojourner or stranger - Rather, a foreigner who has settled among you.
See [Lev 16:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#029), note; [Exo
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#010), note.

[Lev 25:54](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#054)

In these years - More properly, by one of these means. The extreme
period of servitude in this case was six years, as when the master was a
Hebrew [Exo 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#002).

Looking at the law of the Jubilee from a simply practical point of view,
its operation must have tended to remedy those evils which are always
growing up in the ordinary conditions of human society. It prevented the
permanent accumulation of land in the hands of a few, and periodically
raised those whom fault or misfortune had sunk into poverty to a
position of competency. It must also have tended to keep alive family
feeling, and helped to preserve the family genealogies.

But in its more special character, as a law given by Yahweh to His
special people, it was a standing lesson to those who would rightly
regard it, on the terms upon which the enjoyment of the land of promise
had been conferred upon them. All the land belonged to Yahweh as its
supreme Lord, every Israelite as His vassal belonged to Him. The voice
of the Jubilee horns, twice in every century, proclaimed the equitable
and beneficent social order appointed for the people; they sounded that
acceptable year of Yahweh which was to bring comfort to all that
mourned, in which the slavery of sin was to be abolished, and the true
liberty of God's children was to be proclaimed [Luk
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#025); [Isa
61:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#002); [Luk
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#019); [Act
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#021); [Rom
8:19-23](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#019); [Pe1
1:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#003).
