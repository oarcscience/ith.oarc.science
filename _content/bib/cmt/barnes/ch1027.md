### [1 Chronicles Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#001)

[1 Chronicles 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 27:1</span></span>

This verse is a general heading to the list [Ch1
27:2-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#002). The heading has been taken
from some fuller and more elaborate description of David's army, whereof
the writer of Chronicles gives us only an abridgement. Omitting the
captains of thousands, the captains of hundreds, and the officers
(probably "scribes") who served the king, he contents himself with
recording the "chief fathers" or heads of the divisions [Ch1
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#001), and the number of Iraelites in
each course.

[1 Chronicles 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch1 27:2</span></span>

Jashobeam - Jashobeam is mentioned in marginal references as the chief
of David's mighty men. He is called in [Ch1
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#011) "the son of Hachmoni." We learn
from [Ch1 27:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#003) that he was of the
tribe of Judah, being descended from Perez (or Pharez), the son of
Judah, from whom David himself sprang. See [Ch1
2:3-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#003).

[1 Chronicles 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch1 27:4</span></span>

Dodai The words "Eleazar, son of," have probably fallen out before Dodai
(or Dodo). According to Jewish tradition, EIeazar [Ch1
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#012) was cousin to David; his father,
Dodai, being Jesse's brother. Mikloth was probably second in command to
Eleazar.

[1 Chronicles 27:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch1 27:5</span></span>

A chief priest - Rather, "the chief priest" - an expression by which is
meant, not the high priest, but probably the high priest's deputy, who
is sometimes called "the second priest" [Kg2
25:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#018).

[1 Chronicles 27:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch1 27:7</span></span>

Asahel died before the courses, as here described, could have been
instituted. Perhaps the arrangements of David in his later years were
based upon institutions belonging to the period of his reign at Hebron.

[1 Chronicles 27:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch1 27:16</span></span>

Gad and Asher are omitted from this list of the tribes. Similarly, Dan
and Zebulon are omitted from the genealogical survey of the tribes 1
Chr. 4-8. We can only suppose that the lists, as they came down to the
writer of Chronicles, were incomplete. The "rulers" or "princes" of the
tribes appear to have been the oldest lineal descendants of the
patriarchs according to the law of primogeniture.

[1 Chronicles 27:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ch1 27:23</span></span>

David's numbering of the people was therefore a military arrangement in
order to fix the amount of his standing army. To the general Oriental
prejudice against numbering possessions, etc., there was added in the
case of the Jews a special objection - a feeling that it would be
irreverent to attempt to count what God had promised should be
countless.

[1 Chronicles 27:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ch1 27:24</span></span>

Because there fell wrath - literally, "And there fell wrath." The
falling of God's wrath was not the cause of Joab's ceasing. His motive
is clearly stated in [Ch1 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#006). See
also the marginal references.

Neither was the number ... - The meaning is, that in the portion of the
chronicles of King David which treated of numbers - the number of the
standing army, of the Levitical and priestly courses, the singers, etc.
- the return of the number of the people made by Joab was not entered.
The disastrous circumstances which followed on the taking of the census
perhaps produced a feeling that God might he further provoked by its
being put on record in the state archives. The numbers which have come
down to us must therefore have been derived from private sources.

[1 Chronicles 27:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">ch1 27:25</span></span>

This section is important as showing that David, the younger son of a
not very opulent family [Sa1 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#011),
[Sa1 16:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#020), had now become a large
landed proprietor, as well as a capitalist, possessed of much moveable
wealth. We may perhaps see the sources of both these kinds of property,
in the successful wars which he had waged [Sa1
27:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#008); [Sa1
30:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#020); [Sa2
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#004), [Sa2
8:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#007), [Sa2
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#012); in the revenue derived from
subject kings [Sa1 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#002), [Sa1
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#014); [Sa1
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#019); and in the purchase and
occupation of lands in different places. Further, he enjoyed, of course,
the usual rights of a Jewish king over the landed property of his
subjects, and was thus entitled to receive a tithe of the produce in
tithes ([Sa1 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#015), [Sa1
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#017)) and in "benevolences." Compare
[Sa1 10:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#027); [Sa1
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#020), etc.

[Ch1 27:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#025)

The castles - Probably the watchtowers in the border districts, exposed
to raids from the plundering tribes of the desert [Ch2
26:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#010); [Ch2
27:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#004).

[Ch1 27:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#028)

In the low plains - Rather, "in the Shephelah," the proper name of the
low tract between the hill country of Judaea and the Mediterranean.

[1 Chronicles 27:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">ch1 27:32</span></span>

A list - supplemental in character - of some chief officers of David,
not mentioned before. The list cannot belong to a very late part of
David's reign, since it contains the name of Ahithophel, who killed
himself during Absalom's rebellion [Sa2
17:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#023).

[Ch1 27:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#033)

Was the king's companion - or, "king's friend," as in [Kg1
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#005). Compare also [Sa2
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#017).

[Ch1 27:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#034)

After Ahithophel - i. e., next in counsel to Ahithophel: inferior to
him, but superior to all others.
