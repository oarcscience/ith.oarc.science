<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">eze 30:1</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Third prophecy Ezek. 30:1-19 against Egypt, probably to be connected with the previous verses (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#010">Eze 30:10</A> with the <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#017">Eze 29:17-21</A> note). Some consider it to belong to the earlier part of Ezek. 29 (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#010">Eze 29:10</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#012">Eze 29:12</A> with <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#005">Eze 30:5-6</A>). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#003">Ezekiel 30:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">eze 30:3</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The time of the pagan - The time when the pagan (Egyptians) shall be judged. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#005">Ezekiel 30:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">eze 30:5</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Libya, and Lydia - Or, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#010">Eze 27:10</A>, Phut and Lud.
<p>The mingled people - Foreigners, who settled in Egypt. The Saite dynasty of Egyptian kings were especially favorable to foreign immigrants. Hophra employed many of them in his armies, and in this way, according to Herodotus, lost the affections of his Egyptian subjects. See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#020">Jer 25:20</A> note.
<p>Chub - The word occurs here only. It was some tribe in alliance with Egypt, either of African race like Lud and Phut, or settlers like the "mingled people." A not-improbable suggestion connects it with Coptos, of which the Egyptian form was Qeb, Qebt or Qabt.
<p>The men of the land that is in league - Rather, the children of the land of the covenant, i. e., of Israel (see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#008">Eze 16:8</A>). After the destruction of Jerusalem Jews withdrew into Egypt <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#007">Jer 43:7</A>. Many of them would naturally enough be found in the Egyptian armies. This is in favor of the later date assigned to this section.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">eze 30:6</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>See the marginal reference note. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#009">Ezekiel 30:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">eze 30:9</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Careless Ethiopians - The Ethiopians, who were dwelling in fancied security <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#015">Zep 2:15</A>, shall tremble at Egypt's ruin. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#013">Ezekiel 30:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">eze 30:13</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Noph - Memphis <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#013">Isa 19:13</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#014">Ezekiel 30:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">eze 30:14</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Zoan - Tanis, a city and nome of Lower Egypt <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#022">Num 13:22</A>. See the marginal reference note.
<p>No - Diospolis. See the marginal reference note. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#017">Ezekiel 30:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">eze 30:17</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Aven - The same as "On" <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#045">Gen 41:45</A>, or "Heliopolis." The word "Aven" means also "transgression" (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#008">Hos 10:8</A>). Some have thought that here too Ezekiel substituted the word "Aven" for "On" to mark the "sin" of idolatry there in full vogue.
<p>Pi-beseth - The Bubastis of Herodotus. The hieroglyphic name is "Pe-bast," the house of Bast (the Egyptian Artemis, the cat-headed goddess). Bubastis was situated on the easternmost, the Pelusian, branch of the Delta. The road from Pelusium to Memphis lay through Bubastis and On. In the days of Herodotus Bubastis was the seat of one of the chief annual festivals of the Egyptians. The Persians took the town and razed the walls. The ruins bear the modern name Tel-Basta. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#018">Ezekiel 30:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">eze 30:18</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Tehaphnehes - See the marginal reference note. "break the yokes of Egypt" i. e., break the yokes imposed by Egypt, or break up the tyrannous dominion of Egypt over other lands. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#020">Ezekiel 30:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">eze 30:20</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Fourth prophecy against Egypt spoken three months before the capture of Jerusalem <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#001">Eze 26:1</A>, and three months after the prophecy of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#001">Eze 29:1</A>. Meantime, Pharaoh-Hophra's attempt on Jerusalem had been foiled, and the Egyptians driven back into their own country (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#005">Jer 37:5</A> note).
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#021">Eze 30:21</A>
<p>I have broken - Especially by the defeat at Carchemish.
<p>A roller - Or, a bandage.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#022">Eze 30:22</A>
<p>The strong - Such power as Egypt yet retained at home and abroad.
<p>That which was broken - The power which Egypt aimed at ineffectually, the conquest of Palestine and Syria.
