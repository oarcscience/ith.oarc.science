### [Deuteronomy Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#001)

[Deuteronomy 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">deu 21:2</span></span>

The elders represented the citizens at large, the judges the magistracy:
priests [Deu 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#005) from the nearest
priestly town, were likewise to be at hand. Thus, all classes would be
represented at the purging away of that blood-guiltiness which until
removed attached to the whole community.

[Deuteronomy 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 21:3</span></span>

The requirements as regards place and victim are symbolic. The heifer
represented the murderer, so far at least as to die in his stead, since
he himself could not be found. As hearing his guilt the heifer must
therefore be one which was of full growth and strength, and had not yet
been ceremonially profaned by human use. The Christian commentators find
here a type of Christ and of His sacrifice for man: but the heifer was
not strictly a sacrifice or sin-offering. The transaction was rather
figurative, and was so ordered as to impress the lesson of [Gen
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#005).

[Deuteronomy 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">deu 21:4</span></span>

Eared - i. e., plowed; compare [Gen
45:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#006) note and references. The word is
derived from the Latin, and is in frequent use by English writers of the
fifteenth and two following centuries.

Strike off the heifer's neck - Rather, "break its neck" (compare [Exo
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#013)). The mode of killing the victim
distinguishes this lustration from the sin-offering, in which there
would be of course shedding and sprinkling of the blood.

[Deuteronomy 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">deu 21:10</span></span>

The regulations which now follow in the rest of this and throughout the
next chapter bring out the sanctity of various personal rights and
relations fundamental to human life and society.

[Deu 21:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#010). The war supposed here
is one against the neighboring nations after Israel had utterly
destroyed the Canaanites (compare [Deu
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#003)), and taken possession of their
land.

[Deuteronomy 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">deu 21:12</span></span>

The shaving the head (a customary sign of purification, [Lev
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#008); [Num
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#007)), and the putting away "the
garment of her captivity," were designed to signify the translation of
the woman from the state of a pagan and a slave to that of a wife among
the covenant-people. Consistency required that she should "pare" (dress,
compare [Sa2 19:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#024)), not "suffer to
grow," her nails; and thus, so far as possible, lay aside everything
belonging to her condition as an alien.

[Deuteronomy 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">deu 21:13</span></span>

Bewail her father and her mother a full month - This is prescribed from
motives of humanity, that the woman might have time and leisure to
detach her affections from their natural ties, and prepare her mind for
new ones.

[Deuteronomy 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">deu 21:14</span></span>

Thou shalt not make merchandise of her - Rather, thou shalt not
constrain her: literally "treat her with constraint," or "treat her as a
slave."

[Deuteronomy 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">deu 21:15</span></span>

Moses did not originate the rights of primogeniture (compare [Gen
25:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#031)), but recognized them, since he
found them pre-existing in the general social system of the East.
Paternal authority could set aside these rights on just grounds [Gen
27:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#033), but it is forbidden here to do
so from mere partiality.

[Deuteronomy 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">deu 21:18</span></span>

The formal accusation of parents against a child was to be received
without inquiry, as being its own proof. Thus the just authority of the
parents is recognized and effectually upheld (compare [Exo
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#012); [Exo
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#015), [Exo
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#017); [Lev
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#009)); but the extreme and
irresponsible power of life and death, conceded by the law of Rome and
other pagan nations, is withheld from the Israelite father. In this, as
in the last law, provision is made against the abuses of a necessary
authority.

[Deuteronomy 21:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">deu 21:22</span></span>

There were four methods of execution in use among the ancient Jews;
stoning ([Exo 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#004); [Deu
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#010), etc.), burning [Lev
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#014); [Lev
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#009), the sword [Exo
32:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#027), and strangulation. The latter,
though not named in Scripture, is regarded by the rabbis as the most
common, and the proper one to be adopted when no other is expressly
enjoined by the Law. Suspension, whether from cross, stake, or gallows,
was not used as a mode of taking life, but was sometimes added after
death as an enhancement of punishment. Pharaoh's chief baker [Gen
40:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#019) was hanged after being put to
death by the sword; and similarly Joshua appears [Jos
10:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#026) to have dealt with the five
kings who made war against Gibeon. Compare also [Num
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#004).

[Deuteronomy 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">deu 21:23</span></span>

He that is hanged is accursed of God - i. e. "Bury him that is hanged
out of the way before evening: his hanging body defiles the land; for
God's curse rests on it." The curse of God is probably regarded as lying
on the malefactor because, from the fact of his being hanged, be must
have been guilty of a especially atrocious breach of God's covenant.
Such an offender could not remain on the face of the earth without
defiling it (compare [Lev 18:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#025), [Lev
18:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#028); [Num
35:34](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#034)). Therefore after the penalty of
his crime had been inflicted, and he had hung for a time as a public
example, the holy land was to be at once and entirely delivered from his
presence. See [Gal 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#013) for Paul's
quotation of this text and his application of it.
