### [Leviticus Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#001)

[Leviticus 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lev 22:2</span></span>

"Speak ... that they so abstain from touching the holy things (i. e. the
sacrificial food of all kinds) of the children of Israel which they
consecrate unto me, that they profane not my holy name." This law
related to the daily life and the ordinary food of the priests.

[Leviticus 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lev 22:3</span></span>

Cut off from my presence - i. e. excluded from the sanctuary. See [Lev
20:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#017).

[Leviticus 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lev 22:4</span></span>

See [Lev 15:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#013).

[Leviticus 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">lev 22:5</span></span>

Creeping things - i. e. dead vermin. Compare [Lev
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#029).

[Leviticus 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">lev 22:6</span></span>

The soul - Rather, the person. Compare the use of the word "body" in the
Prayer Book version of [Psa 53:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#001), and
in the compounds "somebody, nobody".

[Leviticus 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">lev 22:8</span></span>

The pollution in the priests would be an aggravated one, inasmuch as
they would have to forego their sacred functions. Compare [Eze
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#014); [Eze
44:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#031). The general prohibition occurs
in [Lev 11:39](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#039); [Lev
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#015); [Exo
22:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#031).

[Leviticus 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">lev 22:10</span></span>

Stranger - One of another family. See [Exo
29:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#033) note.

[Leviticus 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">lev 22:11</span></span>

This shows how completely a purchased bondsman was incorporated into the
household. See [Exo 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#002), note; [Exo
21:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#020), note.

[Leviticus 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">lev 22:12</span></span>

A stranger - One of another family.

[Leviticus 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lev 22:14</span></span>

Unwittingly - Inadvertently, or "through ignorance." Compare [Lev
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#002) note.

[Leviticus 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">lev 22:15</span></span>

These verses are rather difficult. Their meaning appears to be: "The
holy things of the children of Israel which are heaved before Yahweh"
(see [Lev 7:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#030)) "shall not be
profaned; and they shall incur a sin of trespass who eat of their holy
things (so as to profane them)."

[Leviticus 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">lev 22:19</span></span>

Ye shall offer at your own will a male - Rather, That it may be accepted
(so [Lev 22:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#029)) for you it shall be a
male. See [Lev 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#003). It is the same
phrase as in [Lev 22:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#020), [Lev
22:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#027).

[Leviticus 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">lev 22:22</span></span>

Compare [Lev 21:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#019); [Deu
15:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#021).

[Leviticus 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">lev 22:24</span></span>

The literal meaning of the passage in italics is, and this shall ye not
do in your land. It appears to have been understood by the Jews as a
prohibition of the mutilation of animals.

[Leviticus 22:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">lev 22:25</span></span>

A stranger's hand - The word here rendered "stranger", is not the same
as that in [Lev 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#010), [Lev
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#018) : it means literally, "the son
of the unknown", and probably refers to one dwelling in another land who
desired to show respect to the God of Israel. See [Kg1
8:41](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#041).

[Leviticus 22:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">lev 22:27</span></span>

No victim was to be offered in sacrifice until it was a week old. The
meaning of this law appears to be that the animal should realise a
distinct existence in becoming less dependent on its mother, and able to
provide for its own wants.

[Leviticus 22:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">lev 22:28</span></span>

A law intended to remind the Israelites of the sacredness of the
relation between the parent and its offspring. Compare [Exo
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#019) note.
