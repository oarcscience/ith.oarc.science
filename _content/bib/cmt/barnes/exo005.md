### [Exodus Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#001)

[Exodus 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 5:1</span></span>

Pharaoh - This king, probably Tothmosis II, the great grandson of Aahmes
[Exo 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#008), the original persecutor of
the Israelites, must have been resident at this time in a city, probably
Tanis [Exo 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#005), of Lower Egypt,
situated on the Nile.

The Lord God - Yahweh God of Israel demanded the services of His people.
The demand, according to the general views of the pagans, was just and
natural; the Israelites could not offer the necessary sacrifices in the
presence of Egyptians.

[Exodus 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">exo 5:2</span></span>

I know not the Lord - Either Pharaoh had not heard of Yahweh, or he did
not recognize Him as a God.

[Exodus 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">exo 5:3</span></span>

Three days' journey - See the [Exo
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#018) note.

With pestilence, or with the sword - This shows that the plague was well
known to the ancient Egyptians. The reference to the sword is equally
natural, since the Israelites occupied the eastern district, which was
frequently disturbed by the neighboring Shasous.

[Exodus 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">exo 5:4</span></span>

Let - i. e. hinder.

[Exodus 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">exo 5:6</span></span>

Their officers - Or scribes. Hebrews able to keep accounts in writing,
appointed by the Egyptian superintendents, and responsible to them for
the work; see [Exo 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#014). Subordinate
officers are frequently represented on Egyptian monuments, giving in
written accounts to their immediate superiors.

[Exodus 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">exo 5:7</span></span>

Some of the most ancient buildings in Egypt were constructed of bricks
not burned, but dried in the sun; they were made of clay, or more
commonly of mud, mixed with straw chopped into small pieces. An immense
quantity of straw must have been wanted for the works on which the
Israelites were engaged, and their labors must have been more than
doubled by this requisition.

[Exodus 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">exo 5:12</span></span>

Stubble instead of straw - Rather, for the straw: i. e. to be prepared
as straw. This marks the season of the year, namely, early spring, after
the barley or wheat harvest, toward the end of April. Their suffering
must have been severe: at that season the pestilential sand-wind blows
over Egypt some 50 days, hence, its name - Chamsin. (compare [Gen
41:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#006) note).

[Exodus 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">exo 5:17</span></span>

Ye are idle - The old Egyptian language abounds in epithets which show
contempt for idleness. The charge was equally offensive and ingenious;
one which would be readily believed by Egyptians who knew how much
public and private labors were impeded by festivals and other religious
ceremonies. Among the great sins which, according to Egyptian belief,
involved condemnation in the final judgment, idleness is twice
mentioned.

[Exodus 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">exo 5:23</span></span>

The earnestness of this remonstrance, and even its approach to
irreverence, are quite in keeping with other notices of Moses' naturally
impetuous character. See [Exo 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#013).
