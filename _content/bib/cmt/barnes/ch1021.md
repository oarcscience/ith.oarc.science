### [1 Chronicles Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#001)

[1 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch1 21:0</span></span>

The resemblance to the parallel passage in Samuel is throughout less
close than usual; the additions are more numerous, the supernatural
circumstances of the narrative being brought out into greater
prominence. The history is evidently not drawn from Samuel, but from
some quite separate document, probably a contemporary account of the
occurrence drawn up by Gad.

[1 Chronicles 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 21:1</span></span>

As the books of Scripture are arranged in our Version, Satan is here for
the first time by name introduced to us. He appears not merely as an
"adversary" who seeks to injure man from without, but as a Tempter able
to ruin him by suggesting sinful acts and thoughts from within. In this
point of view, the revelation made of him here is the most advanced that
we find in the Old Testament.

The difficulty in reconciling the statement here, "Satan provoked
David," etc. with that of Samuel, "the Lord moved David," etc. [Sa2
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#001) is not serious. All temptation is
permitted by God. When evil spirits tempt us, they do so by permission
([Job 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#012); [Job
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#006); [Luk
22:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#031), etc.). If Satan therefore
provoked David to number the peopIe, God allowed him. And what God
allows, He may be said to do. (Another view is maintained in the [Sa2
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#001) note).

[1 Chronicles 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch1 21:5</span></span>

In [Sa2 24:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#009) the numbers are
different. The explanation there given is not so generally accepted as
the supposition that the numbers have, in one passage or the other (or
possibly in both), suffered corruption.

[1 Chronicles 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 21:6</span></span>

To omit the Levites would be to follow the precedent recorded in [Num
1:47-49](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#047). The omission of Benjamin must
he ascribed to a determination on the part of Joab to frustrate the
king's intention, whereby he might hope to avert God's wrath from the
people.

[1 Chronicles 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch1 21:12</span></span>

And the angel of the Lord destroying ... - These words are not in
Samuel, which puts the third alternative briefly. They prepare the way
for the angelic appearance [Ch1 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#016),
on which the author is about to lay so much stress.

[1 Chronicles 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch1 21:16</span></span>

Here a picture of awful grandeur takes the place of the bare statement
of the earlier historian [Sa2 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#017).
And here, as elsewhere, the author probably extracts from the ancient
documents such circumstances as harmonize with his general plan. As the
sanctity of the temple was among the points whereon he was most anxious
to lay stress, he gives in full all the miraculous circumstances
attending this first designation of what became the temple site
(marginal reference "k") as a place "holy to the Lord."

David and the elders ... clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces -
Facts additional to the narrative of Samuel; But facts natural in
themselves, and in harmony with that narrative. Similarly, the narrative
in [Ch1 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#020) is additional to the
account in Samuel; but its parts hang together; and there is no
sufficient ground for suspecting it.

[1 Chronicles 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch1 21:18</span></span>

It has been observed that it is only in books of a late period that
Angels are brought forward as intermediaries between God and the
prophets. This, no doubt, is true; and it is certainly unlikely that the
records, from which the author of Chronicles drew, spoke of Gad as
receiving his knowledge of God's will from an angel. The touch may be
regarded as coming from the writer of Chronicles himself, who expresses
the fact related by his authorities in the language of his own day (see
[Zac 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#009), [Zac
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#014), [Zac
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#019); [Zac
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#003); [Zac
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#001); [Zac
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#005); etc.); language, however, which
we are not to regard as rhetorical, but as strictly in accordance with
truth, since Angels were doubtless employed as media between God and the
prophet as much in the time of David as in that of Zechariah.

[1 Chronicles 21:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">ch1 21:25</span></span>

Compare the marginal reference and note. It may also be conjectured that
we should read "six" for "six hundred" here; since, according to the
later Jewish system, six gold shekels were nearly equal in value to
fifty silver ones.

[1 Chronicles 21:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">ch1 21:26</span></span>

He answered him from heaven by fire - This fact is not mentioned by the
author of Samuel, since his object is to give an account of the sin of
David, its punishment, and the circumstances by which that punishment
was brought to a close, not to connect those circumstances with anything
further in the history. With the writer of Chronicles the case is
different. He would probably have omitted the whole narrative, as he did
the sin of David in the matter of Uriah, but for its connection with the
fixing of the temple site 1 Chr. 22. It was no doubt mainly the fact
that God answered him by fire from heaven on this altar, which
determined David, and Solomon after him, to build the temple on the spot
so consecrated.

[1 Chronicles 21:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">ch1 21:30</span></span>

David, knowing that by sacrifice on this altar he had caused the angel
to stay his hand, was afraid to transfer his offerings elsewhere, lest
the Angel should resume his task and pestilence again break out.
