### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#001)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 7:1</span></span>

Thirteen years - The thirteen years, i. e., counting from the end of the
seven [Kg1 6:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#038). Solomon's buildings
thus occupied him twenty years [Kg1
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#010); [Ch2
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#001), from the fourth year of his reign
to the twenty-fourth. The difference in the time taken by the temple and
the palace is to be accounted for,

\(1\) by the long period of preparation which preceded the actual
building of the former [Ch1 22:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#002);
[Kg1 5:13-18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#013); and

\(2\) by the greater size of the palace, which consisted of several
large ranges of buildings. (See the next note.)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg1 7:2</span></span>

Many have supposed that the buildings mentioned in [Kg1
7:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#001), [Kg1
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#008), were three entirely distinct and
separate buildings. But it is perhaps best to consider the "house" of
[Kg1 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#001) as the palace proper -
Solomon's own dwelling-house (see [Kg1
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#008)); the house of [Kg1
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#002), as the state apartments; and the
house for Pharaoh's daughter as the hareem or zenana; and to regard
these three groups of buildings as distinct, though interconnected, and
as together constituting what is else-where termed "the king's house"
[Kg1 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#010).

The house of the forest of Lebanon - This name was probably given from
the supposed resemblance of the mass of cedar pillars, which was its
main feature, to the Lebanon cedar forest. Its length of "a hundred
cubits," or 150 feet, was nearly twice as long as the entire temple
without the porch. Some of the great halls in Assyrian palaces were
occasionally as much as 180 feet.

The breadth "of fifty cubits," or 75 feet, is a breadth very much
greater than is ever found in Assyria, and one indicative of the
employment in the two countries of quite different methods of roofing.
By their use of pillars the Jews, like the Persians, were able to cover
in a very wide space.

Four rows - The Septuagint gives "three rows." If the pillars were
forty-five [Kg1 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#003), fifteen in a row,
there should have been but three rows, as seems to have been the case in
the old palace of Cyrus at Pasargadae. If there were four rows of
fifteen, the number of pillars should have been sixty.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg1 7:4</span></span>

Either three ranges of windows, one above the other, on either side of
the house; or perhaps the three ranges were one in either side wall, and
the third in a wall down the middle of the hall, along the course of the
midmost row of pillars. The windows were directly opposite one another,
giving what we call a through light.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg1 7:5</span></span>

All the doors and posts - The doorways, and the posts which formed them,
seem to be intended. These were square at top, not arched or rounded. In
Assyrian buildings arched doorways were not uncommon. The doorways also,
like the windows, exactly faced one another.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg1 7:6</span></span>

Probably the porch of the "House of the Forest." Porches of columns
immediately in front of columnar chambers were a favorite feature of
Persian architecture. The whole verse should be translated, "And he made
the porch of the pillars in length 50 cubits, and in breadth 30 cubits,
and a porch before them (i. e., the pillars), and pillars, and a base
(or step) before them." Most of the Persepolitan porches had small
pillared chambers at some little distance in front of them.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg1 7:7</span></span>

The porch or gate of justice still kept alive the likeness of the old
patriarchal custom of sitting in judgment at the gate; exactly as the
"Gate of justice" still recalls it at Granada, and the Sublime Porte -
"the Lofty Gate" - at Constantinople.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg1 7:8</span></span>

Like unto this porch - i. e., of similar materials, hewn stone and
cedar. The zenana could not have been a mere portico.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg1 7:9</span></span>

The stones were uniform - all cut to certain fixed measures of length,
breadth, and thickness. They were not squared only on the face which
showed, but also on the sides which fell within the wall and were not
seen. Saws appear in Assyrian sculptures of the age of Sennacherib; and
fragments of an iron saw have been found at Nimrud.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg1 7:10</span></span>

See the [Kg1 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#017) note.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg1 7:12</span></span>

The palace, like the temple, had two courts [Kg1
6:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#036), not, however, one immediately
within the other. The lesser court of the palace seems to have been a
private inner court among the buildings [Kg1
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#008). The greater court was outside all
the buildings, surrounding the palace on every side. Assyrian palaces
had always such an external court, and had generally one or more inner
courts or quadrangles.

Both for the inner court - By a slight alteration of the text, the
meaning would be "as (was done) in the inner court, etc. and in the
porch."

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg1 7:13</span></span>

Hiram - A man who bore the same name as the king of Tyre, a master
workman, known as Hiram Ab, i. e. Master Hiram [Ch2
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#013); [Ch2
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#016).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg1 7:14</span></span>

Hiram's mother, while by birth of the tribe of Dan, had had for her
first husband a man of the tribe of Naphtali. (Compare this verse and
margin reference.)

All his work - The work that he personally did for Solomon seems to have
been limited to metal-work, and indeed to works in brass. (See below,
[Kg1 7:45](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#045), and compare [Ch2
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#016).)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg1 7:15</span></span>

These famous pillars, which were broken in pieces by the Babylonians
when they destroyed Jerusalem [Kg2
25:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#013); [Jer
52:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#017), were probably for ornament,
standing by themselves under or in front of the porch. It is certain
that the Phoenicians used isolated metal columns as sacred ornaments, so
that Hiram would be familiar with such a mode of ornamentation. Eighteen
cubits appear to have been the height of the shaft only. Adding the
capital [Kg1 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#016), [Kg1
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#019), the entire metal pillar was 27
cubits high; and if it had a stone base of eight cubits, which would not
be greatly out of proportion, the height of 35 cubits (52 12 feet, [Ch2
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#015)) would have been reached. The
height of some of the Persepolitan columns, with which these pillars may
be best compared, is 67 feet. The circumference of 12 cubits (18 feet)
implies a diameter of about 5 feet 9 inches at the base, which would
make the column somewhat heavy in appearance. Egyptian pillars were,
however, even thicker in proportion to their height. On the supposition
that a portion of the original text has fallen out, this verse has been
thus completed: "He cast two pillars of brass; eighteen cubits was the
height of the one pillar, and eighteen cubits was the height of the
other pillar; and a line of twelve cubits compassed the one pillar, and
a line of twelve cubits compassed the other pillar."

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg1 7:16</span></span>

The general character of the "chapiters" or capitals, their great size
in proportion to the shaft, which is as one to two, and their
construction of two quite different members, remind us of the pillars
used by the Persians in their palaces, which were certainly more like
Jachin and Boaz than any pillars that have reached us from antiquity.
The ornamentation, however, seems to have been far more elaborate than
that of the Persian capitals.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg1 7:17</span></span>

Nets ... - Rather "Nets chequerwise, and festoons chainwise," - probably
a fine network over the whole, and chainwork hanging in festoons
outside.

Seven for the one chapiter - The Septuagint reading is preferable. "A
net for the one chapiter and a net for the other chapiter." Compare [Kg1
7:41](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#041).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg1 7:18</span></span>

The pomegranate was one of the most common ornaments in Assyria. It was
used on quivers, on spear-shafts, and maceheads, in patterns on doorways
and pavements, etc. It is doubtful whether a symbolic meaning was
attached to it, or whether it was merely selected as a beautiful natural
form.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg1 7:19</span></span>

There is a cornice of (so-called) lilywork at Persepolis, consisting of
three ranges of broadish rounded leaves, one over the other. Lilies are
also represented with much spirit on a bas-relief from Koyunjik.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg1 7:20</span></span>

In this verse also a portion of the original text is supposed to have
fallen out in consequence of the repetition of words. The full phrase of
the original has been retained in [Kg1
7:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#016). It may be restored thus: "And
the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the one
chapiter, and two hundred in rows round about upon the other chapiter."
The "four hundred" [Kg1 7:42](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#042); [Ch2
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#013), are obtained by counting the
pomegranates of both pillars together. In [Jer
52:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#023), is an account of the
arrangement of a single row of pomegranates, whereof each pillar had
two.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg1 7:21</span></span>

The Septuagint in the parallel passage (margin reference), translate
Jachin and Boaz by Κατόρθωσις Katorthōsis and Ἰσχύς Ischus - "Direction"
and "Strength." The literal meaning of the names is given in the margin.
The meaning was probably "God will establish in strength" (i. e. firmly)
the temple and the religion connected with it.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg1 7:23</span></span>

The "molten sea "of Solomon, so called from its great size, took the
place of the laver of the tabernacle [Exo
30:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#018), which was required for the
ablutions of the priests. It was ten cubits, or fully fifteen feet, in
diameter at top, and therefore forty-seven feet in circumference, with a
depth of 5 cubits, or 7 12 feet. As a vessel of these dimensions, if
hemispherical, would certainly not hold 2,000 [Kg1
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#026), much less 3,000 [Ch2
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#003) baths, the bath equaling 8 12
gallons, it is now generally supposed that the bowl bulged considerably
below the brim, and further, that it had a "foot," - or basin which
received the water as it was drawn out by taps from the bowl. The "2,000
baths" may give the quantity of water ordinarily supplied to the "sea;"
the "3,000 baths" the utmost that the laver could anyhow take. Bowls of
a considerable size are represented in the Assyrian bas-reliefs; but
none of such dimensions as Solomon's. The largest mentioned by the
Greeks held only 5,400 gallons, less than one-third of the contents of
the "molten sea," even according to the lowest estimate.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg1 7:24</span></span>

Knops - literally, "gourds," - i. e. a boss or ball ornament encircled
the rim of the bowl in two rows.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg1 7:25</span></span>

Josephus charged Solomon with a breach of the Commandment [Exo
20:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#004), on account of the oxen here
and the lions for his throne. The charge expresses the prohibition which
some Jews have conceived the Commandment to urge against the arts of
sculpture and painting.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg1 7:26</span></span>

The palm or hand-breadth seems to have a little exceeded three inches.

With flowers of lilies - Rather, "in the shape of a lily flower." The
rim was slightly curved outward, like the rim of an ordinary
drinking-cup, or the edge of a lily blossom. See [Ch2
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#005) margin.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg1 7:27</span></span>

Ten bases of brass - These were for the ten lavers ([Kg1
7:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#038). See [Ch2
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#006)). In general terms the bases were
square stands, 6 feet each way, and 4 12 feet high, elaborately
ornamented on their four sides, and resting upon four wheels, 2 14 feet
in diameter. Each stand supported a laver 6 feet high, which contained
40 baths [Kg1 7:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#038), or about 340
gallons.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">kg1 7:28</span></span>

Borders - Rather, "panels" (so [Kg1
7:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#032), [Kg1
7:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#035)), a set of square compartments
between the "ledges" or borders, or mouldings. Below the panelling, with
its ornamentation of lions, oxen (the two animal forms which occur most
frequently in Assyrian decoration), and cherubim, was a space decorated
with "additions of thin work" [Kg1
7:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#029).

Upon the "ledges" [Kg1 7:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#029) which
surrounded the top of the base there was a stand for the laver, distinct
from the upper surface of the base.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">kg1 7:30</span></span>

Plates of brass - Rather, "brazen axletrees."

The "undersetters" (literally, "shoulders") are conjectured to have been
four brackets, or bars, proceeding from the four upper corners of the
bases, and stretching upward to the outer rim of the laver, which thus
rested partly upon them.

At the side of every addition - Rather, "each opposite garlands." The
laver was ornamented with a garland at the place where the support
reached it.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">kg1 7:31</span></span>

It seems impossible to determine what is meant by the "mouth" of the
laver, or what by its "chapiter."

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">kg1 7:32</span></span>

With the diameter (2 14 ft.) of the wheel here, may be compared that of
the earliest Assyrian chariot-wheels, which was under 3 feet; and that
of the front wheels seen in representations of Assyrian close carriages,
which scarcely exceed 14th of the height of the entire vehicle. The
wheels of these moveable lavers appear to have been a little less than
15th of the height of the whole structure.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">kg1 7:34</span></span>

The undersetters were cast with the base, not afterward attached to it,
and were therefore stronger and better able to support the laver.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">kg1 7:35</span></span>

A round compass - A circular elevation, half a cubit high, rather than a
circular depression, half a cubit deep. Compare [Kg1
7:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#029). The "ledges" and "borders" of
the top of the base were its "hands" and its "panels." These "hands,"
distinct from the "shoulders" [Kg1
7:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#030), were probably supports, adorned
with engraved plates [Kg1 7:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#036), either
of the elevated circle on which the laver stood, or of the lower part of
the laver itself. Both panels and "hands" were "of the same," i. e. of
one piece with the base, cast at the same time.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">kg1 7:36</span></span>

According to the proportion of every one - i. e. "as large as the room
left for them allowed," implying that the panels were smaller than those
on the sides of the base, and allowed scant room for the
representations.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">kg1 7:38</span></span>

Every laver was four cubits - Assuming height to be intended, and taking
the cubit at 20 inches, the entire height of the lavers as they stood
upon their wheeled stands would seem to have been 13 ft. 9 in. It is
evident, therefore, that the water must have been drawn from them, as
from the "molten sea," through cocks or taps.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:40](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">kg1 7:40</span></span>

Lavers - Rather, according to the true reading, "pots." (Compare [Kg1
7:45](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#045); [Ch2
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#016).) The "pots" were the caldrons in
which it was usual to boil the peace-offerings. See [Sa1
2:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#013),

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:46](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#046)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">kg1 7:46</span></span>

Succoth and Zarthan - See [Jdg 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#022);
[Jdg 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#005), note.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:47](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#047)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">kg1 7:47</span></span>

The brass of which the two pillars, Jachin and Boaz, the brass sea, and
the various vessels were made had been taken by David from two cities
belonging to Hadadezer, king of Zobah [Ch1
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#008).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:48](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#048)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">kg1 7:48</span></span>

See the note to [Kg1 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#020) and notes at
[Ch2 4:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#019).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:49](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#049)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">kg1 7:49</span></span>

See the notes to [Exo 25:31-38](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#031). The
"bowls" of [Kg1 7:50](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#050) were the "bowls"
for the tables [Exo 37:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo037.htm#016), large vases
containing oil for the lamps.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:51](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#051)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">kg1 7:51</span></span>

The things which David had dedicated - Not only the things described in
[Ch1 28:14-18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#014), but also the spoil of
the nations which he had subdued (margin reference), and also the
vessels of gold, silver, and brass, sent him by Toi king of Hamath, on
his victory over Hadadezer. Solomon now brought these into the temple
treasury. A sacred treasury had been established at least as early as
the time of Saul, to which Saul himself, Abner, Joab, and others, had
contributed [Ch1 26:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#028).
