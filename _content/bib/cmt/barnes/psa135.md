### [Psalms Chapter 135](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 135:0</span></span>

This psalm has no title in Hebrew; and the author, and the occasion on
which it was written, are alike unknown. It is general in its character,
though its imagery is taken mostly from Hebrew history.

The sole design of the psalm is to excite to the praise of God; or to
show reasons for that praise. As grounds or reasons for this, the
psalmist refers to the fact that God is good, [Psa
135:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#003); to the fact that he had chosen
Jacob for himself, [Psa 135:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#004); to the
greatness of God as seen in the works of nature, [Psa
135:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#005); to the history of the Hebrew
people, [Psa 135:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#008); to the
inability of idols to aid, [Psa
135:13-18](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#013); and, in view of all this,
he calls on all classes of the people to praise the Lord, [Psa
135:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#019).

[Psalms 135:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 135:1</span></span>

Praise ye the Lord - Hebrew, Hallelu-jah. Literally, "Praise Jah," an
abridged name for Yahweh. See the notes at [Psa
68:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#004).

Praise ye the name of the Lord - The same as praising God himself.

Praise him, O ye servants of the Lord - You who are especially
designated or appointed to this service, [Psa
134:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#001).

[Psalms 135:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 135:2</span></span>

Ye that stand in the house of the Lord - See the notes at [Psa
134:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#001). That is, those who were
appointed to conduct the services of religion, the priests and Levites.

In the courts of the house of our God - The areas, or parts assigned for
different classes of worshippers around the tabernacle and the temple.
See the notes at [Mat 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#012); notes at
[Psa 92:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#013).

[Psalms 135:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 135:3</span></span>

Praise the Lord, for the Lord is good - See [Psa
107:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#001).

Sing praises unto his name, for it is pleasant - See [Psa
33:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#001); [Psa
92:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#001). The idea here is, that it is a
source of happiness, and that it is proper in itself.

[Psalms 135:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 135:4</span></span>

For the Lord hath chosen Jacob unto himself - The descendants of Jacob.
He has selected them from among all the inhabitants of the earth to be
his special people.

And Israel for his peculiar treasure - The word here rendered treasure,
means that which is acquired; property; wealth. They were what God
possessed, owned, or claimed among all the people of the earth as
especially his own. He had chosen them; he had redeemed them; he had
made them his own, and he regarded them with the interest with which
anyone looks on his own property, the fruit of his own toil. See [Exo
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005); [Deu
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#006); [Deu
32:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#009); [Kg1
8:53](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#053).

[Psalms 135:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 135:5</span></span>

For I know - I, as the representative of Israel, and speaking in the,
name of the people. This is said as the foundation or the reason for
praise. It was the thorough conviction of the psalmist that God was
great above all who were claimed to be gods, and that he only was worthy
of worship.

That the Lord is great - See the notes at [Psa
95:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#003).

And that our Lord is above all gods - All that are worshipped as gods.

[Psalms 135:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 135:6</span></span>

Whatsoever the Lord pleased - God is an absolute sovereign. He has
formed a plan, and has carried it out. He has made the world as he
chose, and he has ordered all its arrangements according to his own
pleasure. As a universal sovereign, he has a right to universal
adoration. See the notes at [Psa
115:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#003).

In heaven, and in earth ... - These are put for the universe; these are
the universe. In these places - in all worlds - on the land and in the
ocean - even in the profound depths of the sea, there is nothing which
has not been placed there by his will, and which he has not arranged
according to his eternal plan.

[Psalms 135:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 135:7</span></span>

He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth - The word
rendered vapors means literally risings; things raised up; and it may be
applied, therefore, to vapors or clouds. The Septuagint, the Latin
Vulgate, and Luther render it clouds. It is among the proofs of the
divine wisdom and power that he causes them to ascend contrary to the
common law which drags all things down toward the earth. The arrangement
by which this is done is among the most wise and wonderful of all the
works of God. See [Job 26:8](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#008), note;
[Job 38:25-28](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#025), notes.

He maketh lightnings for the rain - To accompany the rain. See the notes
at [Job 28:26](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#026).

He bringeth the wind out of his treasuries - Where he has, as it were,
treasured it up, to be used when there should be occasion for it. See
the notes at [Job 38:22](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#022).

[Psalms 135:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 135:8</span></span>

Who smote the firstborn of Egypt - As the last and the greatest of the
plagues brought upon the Egyptians; the chief and crowning judgment
under which they were made willing that the children of Israel should
go, and which was in fact the judgment which secured their freedom. This
is selected here evidently for this reason, instead of recounting all
the plagues which were brought upon the Egyptians.

Both of man and beast - [Exo 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#005).
Margin, as in Hebrew, From man unto beast. That is, including both;
smiting both.

[Psalms 135:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 135:9</span></span>

Who sent tokens and wonders - Tokens: that is, signs or evidences of the
divine power. Wonders: things suited to impress the mind with awe;
things outside of the ordinary course of events; things not produced by
natural laws, but by the direct power of God. The allusion here is, of
course, to the plagues of Egypt, as recorded in Exodus. See the notes at
[Psa 105:27-36](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#027).

[Psalms 135:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 135:10</span></span>

Who smote great nations ... - To wit, those specified in the following
verse.

[Psalms 135:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 135:11</span></span>

Sihon king of the Amorites ... - These are specimens of what was done,
or instances of the mighty kings who were subdued. It is not pretended
that all were enumerated. The subjugation of these nations and kings
showed the power of God, and laid the foundation for praise.

[Psalms 135:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 135:12</span></span>

And gave their land for an heritage ... - See the notes at [Psa
111:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#006).

[Psalms 135:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 135:13</span></span>

Thy name, O Lord, endureth for ever - Thou art the ever-living, the
unchanging God. The generations of people pass away; the kingdoms of the
earth change; the idols perish, but thou art the same. The object here
seems to be to bring the image or the idea of God before the mind as he
was when he performed these great works, as a God interposing in behalf
of his people, and as worthy of praise. The idea is that he is the same
now that he was then; and as he then impressed the world with a sense of
his majesty and power, and as he then interposed in behalf of his people
by mighty signs and wonders, we should feel that, being an unchangeable
God, he can do it now, and is now equally worthy. of confidence,
adoration, and praise.

And thy memorial - Thy remembrance; the memory of thyself. That is, What
thou hast done to secure a remembrance among people is of such a nature
as to make the same impression to all coming time. The events were such
that the memory of them should never pass away from mankind.

Throughout all generations - Margin, as in Hebrew, To generation and
generation. There never will be a generation on the earth, in the latest
periods, to which the memory of these things should not be transmitted.

[Psalms 135:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 135:14</span></span>

For the Lord will judge his people - He will interpose in their behalf
by his judgments, or by directing the course of events in their favor.
This language is copied literally from [Deu
32:36](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#036) : "For the Lord shall judge his
people, and repent himself for his servants." It is there a part of the
song of Moses after the journey through the wilderness, after smiting
the kings of the Amorites and of Bashan; and when, delivered from their
enemies, the Israelites had come to the borders of the promised land,
Deut. 31. The language was, therefore, especially appropriate to the
design of this psalm.

And he will repent himself concerning his servants - In behalf of his
people. That is, he will do as if he repented, or had changed his mind.
He will stay his judgments. He will not suffer his people to be
destroyed. He will not permit the judgments which seemed to threaten
their entire ruin to be carried out to the full. They shall be arrested
midway as if God had then changed his mind. Of course, all this is
language accommodated to human weakness, and to the manner of speaking
among people.

[Psalms 135:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 135:15</span></span>

The idols of the heathen are silver and gold ... - To show more fully
the propriety of praising God, and him alone as God, the psalmist
instituted a comparison between him and idols, showing that the gods
worshipped by the pagan lacked every ground of claim to divine worship
and homage. They were, after all that could be done to fashion, to
decorate, and to adorn them, nothing but silver and gold, and could have
no better claim to worship than silver and gold as such. They had,
indeed, mouths, eyes, ears, but they could neither speak, see, hear, nor
breathe. The passage here is substantially the same as in [Psa
115:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#004); and the one was evidently
copied from the other, though in the latter the description is in some
respects amplified; but which was the original it is impossible to
determine. See the notes at that passage.

[Psalms 135:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 135:19</span></span>

Bless the Lord, O house of Israel ... - This passage, also, is evidently
an imitation of the passage in [Psa
115:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#009). The form in Ps. 115,
however, is rather an exhortation to trust in the Lord, and an assurance
that God would bless the classes spoken of, than a call on them to bless
the Lord. Still the same classes of persons are referred to; the house
of Israel; the house of Aaron; and those who feared the Lord. The
passage needs no further illustration than what is found in the notes at
[Psa 115:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#009). It is an earnest call
on all classes of the people to bless and praise the Lord. It is
language expressive of overflowing joy; the utterance of a heart full of
exalted conceptions of the majesty, the glory, and the mercy of God; of
a heart which feels to the utmost the fitness of praise, and desires
that all classes of people - priests and people - that all created
things should unite in the praise of Yahweh. Who, in reading the psalm,
can fail to catch the feelings of the psalmist, and to say Amen and
amen!
