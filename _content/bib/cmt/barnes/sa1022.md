### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#001)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 22:1</span></span>

To the cave Adullam - Or rather "of Adullam." Adullam was the name of a
town of Judah in the "Shephelah," not far from Bethlehem, and below it.
Innumerable caverns, one nearly 100 feet long, are excavated in the soft
limestone hills in the neighborhood of Beit-Jibrin. (The cave is placed
by Ganneau and Conder on the hill (500 feet high) over 'Aid el Ma or
Miyeh.) David's brethren and kinsmen joined him partly from sympathy
with him, and partly because their own lives were in jeopardy front
Saul's furious enmity.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 22:2</span></span>

Discontented - See the margin. (Compare [Sa1
30:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#006); [Sa2
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#008).) The phrase here denotes those
who were exasperated by Saul's tyranny.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 22:3</span></span>

Mizpeh of Moab - A good conjecture connects it with "Zophim" (a word of
the same root as Mizpeh) on the top of Pisgah [Num
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#014). It is probable that David's
descent from Ruth the Moabitess may have had something to do with his
seeking an asylum for Jesse, Ruth's grandson, in the land of her birth.
It would be very easy to get to the Jordan from the neighborhood of
Bethlehem, and cross over near its embouchure into the Dead Sea.

Come forth, and be with you - The construction of the Hebrew is very
strange. The Vulgate, Syriac, and Arabic seem to have read "dwell"
instead of "come forth."

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa1 22:4</span></span>

He brought them before ... - The Septuagint renders it "he persuaded
(the face of) the king."

In the hold - Where David was after he left the cave of Adullam,
probably in the land of Moab.

The phrase "all the while," would indicate that David sojourned a
considerable time in Moab.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa1 22:5</span></span>

The prophet Gad - Mentioned here for the first time. One may conjecture
that Samnel had sent him privately from Naioth to tell David not to
abide in the hold. Whether he stayed with David or returned to the
College of the prophets does not appear. For later notices of him see
marginal references.

The forest of Hareth is unknown.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 22:6</span></span>

Under a tree in Ramah - Rather, "under the tamarisk-tree on the high
place," where he always held such meetings. It was a kind of parliament
in the open air, and all his tribesmen gathered round him. (Compare [Jdg
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#005).)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa1 22:7</span></span>

Ye Benjamites - Showing how isolated the tribes still were, and how for
the most part Saul was surrounded by his own tribesmen only.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa1 22:10</span></span>

He inquired of the Lord ... - This was not true, but Ahimelech's going
to fetch the sword from behind the ephod might have given occasion to
the belief on Doeg's part that he had put on the ephod to inquire of the
Lord for David.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa1 22:14</span></span>

Goeth at thy bidding - Better, "has access to thy (private) audience,"
or council (compare [Sa2 23:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#023),
margin).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa1 22:15</span></span>

Did I then begin ... - Some lay the stress upon the word "begin," as
though Ahimelech's justification was that he had often before inquired
of the Lord for David when employed on the king's affairs. But it is
much better to understand the words as Ahimelech's solemn denial of
having inquired of the Lord for David, a duty which he owed to Saul
alone as king of Israel. The force of the word "begin" lies in this,
that it would have been his first act of allegiance to David and
defection from Saul. This he strenuously repudiates, and adds, "thy
servant knew nothing of all this" conspiracy between Jonathan and David
of which Saul speaks: he had acted quite innocently.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa1 22:18</span></span>

We are not to suppose that Doeg killed them all with his own hand. He
had a band of men under his command, many or all of whom were perhaps
foreigners like himself, and very likely of a Bedouin caste, to whom
bloodshed would be quite natural, and the priests of the Lord of no more
account than so Early sheep or oxen.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa1 22:19</span></span>

Both men and women ... - The language employed in the case of the
Amalekites [Sa1 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#003) and of Jericho
[Jos 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#021). Nothing could be more
truculent than Saul's revenge.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa1 22:20</span></span>

Abiathar - He may have remained at Nob to take care of the sanctuary
when the other priests went to Saul, and so escaped. He continued
David's faithful friend throughout his reign [Sa1
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#009); [Sa1
30:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#007); [Sa2
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#024), [Sa2
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#029), [Sa2
15:35](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#035), but gave offence by taking
Adonijah's part against Solomon [Kg1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#007), [Kg1
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#019), [Kg1
1:42](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#042), and in consequence was deprived
of the high priesthood [Kg1 2:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#026).
In [Mar 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#026), he is spoken of as the
High Priest who gave the showbread to David. Perhaps he was the
instigator of this act of kindness to David; and for this cause, as well
as his constancy to David, is mentioned by our Lord instead of
Ahimelech. It is also possible that, as sagan to his father, he may have
performed most of the priestly functions, as Hophni and Phinehas did in
the lifetime of Eli. Abiathar did not actually join David until he went
to Keilah (marginal reference).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 22:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">sa1 22:23</span></span>

The characteristic generosity of David's disposition breaks out in these
words. He never forgot a friend. (Compare [Sa2
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#026); [Sa2
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#001), etc.) David acknowledges that
Saul's enmity against Abiathar is the consequence of his enmity against
himself, and therefore David makes common cause with him.
