### [Jeremiah Chapter 32](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#001)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 32:0</span></span>

The Chaldaeans were already besieging the city, the prophet was in
prison for foretelling its certain capture, and yet he bought with all
the proper legal solemnities an estate, of which [Lev
25:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#025) he had the right of redemption.
The price apparently was small, but was more than the land commercially
was worth. Jeremiah was now verging on 60, and only 10 of the 70 years
of the captivity had passed by. But though the estate was not worth the
purchase, the opportunity was precious as a means of assuring the people
that (God would certainly bring them back. Jeremiah records, [Jer
32:16-25](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#016) how his heart misgave him,
upon which Jer. 32:26-44 God unfolds to hint the full meaning of the
sign, and assures him of the certainty of Israel's restoration.

[Jeremiah 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 32:1</span></span>

The siege of Jerusalem began in Zedekiah's ninth year [Jer
39:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#001), but was temporarily raised upon
the approach of an Egyptian army. See Jer. 37; 38.

[Jeremiah 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 32:2</span></span>

The prison - Or, the guard, a part of the king's palace, probably where
the royal guard had its quarters.

[Jeremiah 32:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 32:3</span></span>

For the prophecies on which the charge was grounded see [Jer
21:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#004), [Jer
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#009).

[Jeremiah 32:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 32:5</span></span>

I visit - In the sense of punishment. See [Jer
39:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#006); [Jer
52:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#011).

[Jeremiah 32:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 32:7</span></span>

Hanameel was strictly the first-cousin of Jeremiah. In Hebrew all the
terms of relationship are used in a more loose way than with us.

[Jeremiah 32:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 32:8</span></span>

The right of inheritance is thine - Hanameel therefore had no children,
and at his death the land would have been Jeremiah's by right of birth.
According to the Law [Num 35:5](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#005), it
must have been part of the suburbs of Anathoth, within less than a mile,
which was all the priests and Levites might cultivate.

[Jeremiah 32:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 32:9</span></span>

Seventeen shekels of silver - literally, as in the margin, probably a
legal formula. Jeremiah bought Hanameel's life-interest up to the year
of Jubilee, and no man's life was worth much in a siege like that of
Jerusalem. As Jeremiah had no children, at his death the land would
devolve to the person who would have inherited it had Jeremiah not
bought it. He therefore bought what never was and never could have been
of the slightest use to him, and gave for it what in the growing urgency
of the siege might have been very serviceable to himself. Still, as the
next heir. it was Jeremiah's duty to buy the estate, independently of
the importance of the act as a sign to the people; and evidently he gave
the full value.

[Jeremiah 32:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 32:10</span></span>

Translate: And I wrote the particulars of the purchase in the deed ...
And I took the purchase-deed, both that which was sealed containing the
oiler and the conditions, and that which was open etc. There were two
indentures, of which one was called the purchase-deed, and was signed by
the purchaser and the witnesses. It was then sealed, not in our sense of
appending a seal in place of signatures, but to close it up. The open
deed was probably an exact copy, and was that intended for common use.
In case its authenticity was called in question, the sealed copy would
have to be produced before the judge, the seal opened, and if its
contents agreed with those of the open deed, the decision would be in
the buyer's favor.

By the offer is probably meant the specification. The conditions,
literally, the statutes, would be the stipulations and terms of the
sale, e. g. as to its restoration at the year of jubile, its price etc.
The placing of the deeds in jar was of course intended to preserve them
from damp during the long years of the exile.

[Jeremiah 32:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 32:15</span></span>

Possessed - bought.

[Jeremiah 32:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 32:17</span></span>

(27). Too hard - literally, too wonderful.

[Jeremiah 32:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 32:18</span></span>

Recompensest - The recompence is placed in the bosom, because, in the
East, the garments are so arranged as to form a pocket there. Thus then,
men must receive and carry with them God's requital for their deeds.

[Jeremiah 32:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 32:20</span></span>

The sense is, who hast set, i. e., performed [Exo
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#002) signs etc., and hast continued
working them unto this day, both in lsrael and among men (i. e., the
pagan).

[Jeremiah 32:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 32:23</span></span>

Possessed - See [Jer 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#010) note.

[Jeremiah 32:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jer 32:24</span></span>

The mounts - See [Jer 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#006) note.

[Jeremiah 32:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jer 32:25</span></span>

For - See the margin. It is enough to place the command side by side
with the state of Jerusalem to show how contrary it is to all the rules
of human prudence. The prophet is sure that God will explain to him his
difficulty.

[Jeremiah 32:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jer 32:26</span></span>

The answer is divided into two parts;

\(a\) [Jer 32:26-35](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#026), the sins of Judah
are shown to be the cause of her punishment:

\(b\) [Jer 32:36-44](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#036), this punishment
was not for Judah's destruction, but for her amendment.

[Jer 32:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#028)

I will give - Or, I am giving.

[Jer 32:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#030)

From their youth - God's mighty deeds for Israel began in Egypt [Jer
32:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#020), and so did Israel's sin.

[Jer 32:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#034), [Jer
32:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#035)

These verses are repeated from [Jer
7:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#030), but with two important
variations. Baal is put for Tophet, and to Molech instead of in the
fire. Molech the king and Baal the lord are different names of the
sun-god, but in altered relations. Molech is the sun as the mighty fire,
which in passing through the signs of the Zodiac burns up its own
children. It is an old Canaanite worship, carried by the Phoenicians to
all their colonies, and firmly established in Palestine at the time when
the Israelites conquered the country.

[Jer 32:39](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#039)

One heart, and one way - Compare [Jer
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#013). Under the new covenant they will
with one consent walk in the one narrow path of right-doing [Mat
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#014). Forever, i. e., every day,
constantly.

[Jer 32:40](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#040)

God's new covenant [Jer 31:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#031) is on
God's side, I will not turn away from them to do them good, i. e., I
will never cease from doing them good. On their side, I will put My fear
in their hearts that they depart not from Me. In these two conditions
consists the certainty of the eternal duration of the covenant [Mat
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#020).

[Jer 32:41](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#041)

Assuredly - literally, in truth, i. e., in verity, in reality. It refers
to God's firm purpose, rather than to the safety and security of the
people. The new covenant is one of grace, indicated by God's rejoicing
over His people, and "planting them with His whole heart."

[Jer 32:43](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#043)

Fields - literally, The field, the open unenclosed country [Jer
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#017). In [Jer
32:44](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#044) fields refers to the several
portions of it which belonged to individuals, and of which the
boundaries were shown by landmarks.

[Jer 32:44](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#044)

Subscribe evidences - See [Jer 32:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#010).
In order to bring the certainty of the return from exile more vividly
before the mind, the prophet enumerates the several subdivisions of the
territory of the kings of Judah.
