### [Deuteronomy Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#001)

[Deuteronomy 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 27:1</span></span>

Moses in a third discourse Deut. 27-30, proceeds more specifically to
dwell upon the sanctions of the Law. In these chapters he sets before
Israel in striking and elaborate detail the blessings which would ensue
upon faithfulness to the covenant, and the curses which disobedience
would involve. Deut. 27 introduces this portion of the book by enjoining
the erection of a stone monument on which the Law should be inscribed as
soon as the people took possession of the promised inheritance [Deu
27:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#001); and by next prescribing the
liturgical form after which the blessings and cursings should be
pronounced Deut. 27:11-26.

[Deuteronomy 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">deu 27:2</span></span>

The stones here named are not those of which the altar [Deu
27:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#005) was to be built, but are to serve
as a separate monument witnessing to the fact that the people took
possession of the land by virtue of the Law inscribed on them and with
an acknowledgment of its obligations.

[Deuteronomy 27:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 27:3</span></span>

All the words of this law - i. e. all the laws revealed from God to the
people by Moses, regarded by the Jews as 613 (compare [Num
15:38](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#038) note). The exhibition of laws in
this manner on stones, pillars, or tables, was familiar to the ancients.
The laws were probably graven in the stone ("very plainly," [Deu
27:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#008) is by some rendered "scoop it out
well"), as are for the most part the Egyptian hieroglyphics, the
"plaister" being afterward added to protect the inscription from the
weather.

[Deuteronomy 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">deu 27:4</span></span>

In mount Ebal - Compare the marginal references. The Samaritan
Pentateuch and Version read here Gerizim instead of Ebal; but the
original text was probably, as nearly all modern authorities hold,
altered in order to lend a show of scriptural sanction to the Samaritan
temple on Mount Gerizim.

The erection of the altar, the offering thereon burnt-offerings and
peace-offerings [Deu 27:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#006), the
publication of the Law in writing, form altogether a solemn renewal of
the covenant on the entrance of the people into the promised land, and
recall the ceremonies observed on the original grant of the covenant at
Sinai (compare [Exo 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#005)). And Ebal
(the mount of "barrenness "),the mount of cursing, was the fitting spot
on which to celebrate them. For the curses were the penalties under
which the children of Israel bound themselves to keep the Law. Suitably
also was the same place selected as that in which were to be set up both
the monumental stones containing the Law, and the altar at which the
covenant was to be renewed. We must note too the fact that [Deu
27:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#015) ff set out verbatim the curses
only, the blessings being omitted. The law because of man's sinfulness
brings on him first and chiefly a curse: compare [Deu
31:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#016); [Gal
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#010).

[Deuteronomy 27:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">deu 27:11</span></span>

Compare [Jos 8:32-35](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#032). The solemnity
was apparently designed only for the single occasion on which it
actually took place.

[Deu 27:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#012), [Deu
27:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#013)

The tribes appointed to stand on Gerizim to bless the people all sprang
from the two wives of Jacob, Leah and Rachel. All the four tribes which
sprang from the handmaids Zilpah and Bilhah are located on Ebal. But in
order, as it would seem, to effect an equal division, two tribes are
added to the latter from the descendants of the wives, that of Reuben,
probably because he forfeited his primogeniture [Gen
49:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#004); and of Zebulun, apparently
because he was the youngest son of Leah.

The transaction presents itself as a solemn renewal of the covenant made
by God with Abraham and Isaac, but more especially with Jacob and his
family. Accordingly the genealogical basis of the "twelve patriarchs"
(compare [Act 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#012); [Rev
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#004) ff), the sons of Jacob, is here
assumed. The tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh are merged in the name of
Joseph, their father; and Levi regains on this occasion his place
collaterally with the others. "The Levites" of [Deu
27:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#014) are no doubt "the priests the
Levites" (compare [Jos 8:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#033)), in whom
the ministerial character attaching to the tribe was more particularly
manifested. It is noteworthy that the group of tribes which stood on
Gerizim far exceeded the other in numbers and in importance, thus
perhaps indicating that even by the Law the blessing should at length
prevail.

[Deu 27:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#015)

The "Amen" attested the conviction of the utterers that the sentences to
which they responded were true, just, and certain; so in [Num
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#022), and in our own Commination
Office, which is modelled after this ordinance of Moses.

[Deu 27:15-26](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#015)

Twelve curses against transgressions of the covenant. The first eleven
are directed against special sins which are selected by way of example,
the last comprehensively sums up in general terms and condemns all and
every offence against God's Law. Compare the marginal references.
