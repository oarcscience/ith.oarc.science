### [Jeremiah Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#001)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 22:0</span></span>

This prophecy Jer. 22, like the preceding [Jer
21:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#011), states the conditions upon
which it was still possible for the house of David to ensure a long era
of prosperity. It belongs therefore to the beginning of Jehoiakim's
reign.

[Jeremiah 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 22:1</span></span>

Go down - i. e., from the temple to the king's house. Compare [Ch2
23:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#020).

[Jeremiah 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 22:6</span></span>

Omit and. "Thou art a Gilead unto me, a summit of Lebanon."

Yet surely - literally, if not, the form of an oath with the imprecation
omitted. For the full form see [Num
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#023).

A wilderness, and cities - Omit and. The meaning is: If the house of
David does not hear God's words, though it be now grand as Lebanon, God
will make it a wilderness, even uninhabited cities; the house of David
being regarded as equivalent to the kingdom of Judah.

[Jeremiah 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 22:7</span></span>

Prepare - i. e., consecrate, see [Jer
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#004) note.

Thy choice cedars - The chief members of the royal lineage and the
leading officers of state.

[Jeremiah 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 22:10</span></span>

In the two foregoing prophecies Jeremiah stated the general principle on
which depend the rise and downfall of kings and nations. He now adds for
Zedekiah's warning the history of three thrones which were not
established.

The first is that of Shallum the successor of Josiah, who probably took
the name of Jehoahaz on his accession (see the marginal references
notes).

[Jer 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#010)

The dead - i. e., Josiah [Ch2 35:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#025).

That goeth away - Rather, that is gone away.

[Jeremiah 22:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 22:13</span></span>

Far worse is the second example. Shallum was no heartless tyrant like
Jehoiakim, who lived in splendor amid the misery of the nation, and
perished so little cared for that his body was cast aside without
burial.

His chambers - Really, his upper chambers. From the absence of machinery
the raising of materials for the upper stories was a difficult task,
especially when massive stones were used.

His work - Giveth him not his wages.

[Jeremiah 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 22:14</span></span>

Large chambers - spacious upper chambers.

It is cieled - Or, roofing it.

Vermilion - The pigment which gives the deep red color still bright and
untarnished on many ancient buildings.

[Jeremiah 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 22:15</span></span>

i\. e., Will thy buildings make thy reign continue? These words imply
that Jehoiakim was looking forward to, and taking measures to secure, a
long continuance of power (compare [Hab
2:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#009). If so, Jeremiah probably wrote
this prophecy before Jehoiakim revolted [Kg2
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#001); and it, therefore, probably
belongs to the same date as [Jer
36:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#030), written in the interval between
Nebuchadnezzars first conquest of Jerusalem, and Jehoiakim's rebellion,
and when Jeremiah was out of the reach of the tyrant's power.

Closest thyself in cedar - Rather, viest "in cedar;" i. e., viest with
Solomon.

Did not thy father eat and drink ... - i. e., he was prosperous and
enjoyed life. There is a contrast between the life of Josiah spent in
the discharge of his kingly duties, and that of Jehoiakim, busy with
ambitious plans of splendor and aggrandisement.

[Jeremiah 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 22:17</span></span>

Covetousness - literally, gain. Besides exacting forced labor Jehoiakim,
to procure the necessary means for the vast expenses he incurred, put
innocent people to death on various pretexts, and escheated their
property.

[Jeremiah 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 22:18</span></span>

Boldly by name is the judgment at length pronounced upon Jehoiakim.
Dreaded by all around him, he shall soon lie an unheeded corpse, with no
one to lament. No loving relative shall make such wailing as when a
brother or sister is carried to the grave; nor shall he have the respect
of his subjects, Ah Lord! or, Ah his glory!

[Jeremiah 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 22:19</span></span>

The burial of an ass - i. e., he shall merely be dragged out of the way,
and left to decay unheeded. Nothing is known of the fulfillment of this
prophecy.

[Jeremiah 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 22:20</span></span>

The third example, Jehoiachin. With him all the best and noblest of the
land were dragged from their homes to people the void places of Babylon.

The passages - Really, Abarim, a range of mountains to the south of
Gilead, opposite Jericho (see [Num
27:12](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#012); [Deu
32:49](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#049)). Jeremiah names the chief
ranges of mountains, which overlook the route from Jerusalem to Babylon,
in regular order, beginning with Lebanon upon the north, then Bashan on
the northeast, and lastly Abarim on the southeast.

Thy lovers - i. e., the nations in alliance with Judah, especially
Egypt, whose defeat at Carchemish [Jer
46:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#002) gave all western Asia into the
power of Nebuchadnezzar.

[Jeremiah 22:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 22:21</span></span>

Prosperity - literally, as in the margin. God spake thus not once only,
but whenever Judah was at peace.

[Jeremiah 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 22:22</span></span>

Shall eat up all thy pastors - literally, shall depasture ([Jer
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#016) note) thy pastors. Those who used
to drive their flocks to consume the herbage shall themselves be the
first prey of war. The "pastors" mean not the kings only, but all in
authority.

[Jeremiah 22:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 22:23</span></span>

Lebanon is the usual metaphor for anything splendid. and is here put for
Jerusalem, but with special reference to the kings whose pride it was to
dwell in palaces roofed with cedar [Jer
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#014).

How gracious shalt thou be - Or, How wilt thou groan!

[Jeremiah 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jer 22:24</span></span>

The words "king of Judah," belong to Coniah, and prove that he was king
regnant when the prophet wrote. The prophet gives him the name by which
he was known when in a private station [Ch1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#016) as he had done previously with
Jehoahaz. These two kings bore their royal names for so short a time
that they probably never got into general use.

The signet - The badge of office. To part with it, was to part with the
royal authority.

[Jeremiah 22:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jer 22:26</span></span>

Mother - See [Jer 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#018). It was her
relationship, not to the dead king, but to the king regnant, which made
her powerful.

[Jeremiah 22:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jer 22:28</span></span>

Idol - Rather, vessel. Is Coniah a mere piece of common earthenware in
which the potter has no pleasure, and therefore breaks it? It is a
lamentation over Jehoiachin's hard fate, and that of his seed. This and
the two following verses may have been written after the king had been
carried into captivity.

[Jeremiah 22:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jer 22:29</span></span>

Earth - On the repetition compare [Jer
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#004) note.

[Jeremiah 22:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">jer 22:30</span></span>

Childless - No child to sit on David's throne. See [Ch1
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#017) note.

Jeconiah was the last king of David's line. His uncle indeed actually
reigned after him, but perished with his sons long before Jeconiah's
death (literally 10): and yet from so dead a trunk, from a family so
utterly fallen, that spiritual King came forth whose name is "Yahweh our
righteousness" [Jer 23:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005).
