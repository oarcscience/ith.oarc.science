### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#001)

The last words of David - i. e., his last Psalm, his last "words of
song" [Sa2 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#001). The insertion of this
Psalm, which is not in the Book of Psalms, was probably suggested by the
insertion of the long Psalm in 2 Sam. 22.

David the son of Jesse said ... - The original word for "said" is used
between 200 and 300 times in the phrase, "saith the Lord," designating
the word of God in the mouth of the prophet. It is only applied to the
words of a man here, and in the strikingly similar passage [Num
24:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#003), [Num
24:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#015), and in [Pro
30:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#001); and in all these places the
words spoken are inspired words. The description of David is divided
into four clauses, which correspond to and balance each other.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa2 23:4</span></span>

Comparisons illustrating the prosperity of the righteous king.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa2 23:5</span></span>

Although my house ... - The sense of this clause (according to the the
King James Version) will be that David comparing the actual state of his
family and kingdom during the later years of trouble and disaster with
the prophetic description of the prosperity of the righteous king, and
seeing how far it falls short, comforts himself by the terms of God's
covenant [Sa2 7:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#012) and looks
forward to Messiah's kingdom. The latter clause, "although he make it
not to grow," must then mean that, although at the present time the
glory of his house was not made to grow, yet all his salvation and all
his desire was made sure in the covenant which would be fulfilled in due
time. But most modern commentators understand both clauses as follows:
"Is not my house so with God that He has made with me an everlasting
covenant," etc.? "For all my salvation and all my desire, will He not
cause it to spring up?" namely, in the kingdom of Solomon, and still
more fully in the kingdom of Christ.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa2 23:8</span></span>

The duplicate of this passage is in 1 Chr. 11, where it is in immediate
connection with David's accession to the throne of Israel, and where the
mighty men are named as those by whose aid David was made king. The
document belongs to the early part of David's reign. The text of [Sa2
23:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#008) is perhaps to be corrected by
comparison with [Ch1 11:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#011).

Chief among the captains - There is great doubt about the exact meaning
of this phrase.

\(1\) the title is given to two other persons, namely, to Abishai in
[Sa2 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#018); [Ch1
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#020), and to Amasa in [Ch1
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#018).

\(2\) the word translated "captain," is of uncertain meaning, and the
orthography repeatedly fluctuates throughout this and the duplicate
passage in 1 Chr. 11, between "Shalish" a captain, and "Sheloshah"
three.

\(3\) if, however, the text of Chronicles be taken as the guide, then
the sense of "captain" will not come into play, but the word will be a
numeral throughout, either "three" or "thirty," and will describe
David's band of thirty mighty men, with a certain triad or triads of
heroes who were yet more illustrious than the thirty.

In the verse before us, therefore, for "chief among the captains," we
should render, "chief of the thirty."

Eight hundred - The parallel passage in 1 Chronicles has "three
hundred," as in [Sa2 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#018). Such
variations in numerals are very frequent. Compare the numbers in Ezra 2
and Neh. 7.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 23:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa2 23:9</span></span>

Gone away - Rather, went up to battle ([Sa2
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#019); [Kg2
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#021), etc.) against them. These words
and what follows as far as "troop" [Sa2
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#011) have fallen out of the text in
Chronicles. The effect of this is to omit EIeazar's feat, as here
described, to attribute to him Shammah's victory, to misplace the flight
of the Israelites, and to omit Shammah altogether from the list of
David's mighty men.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 23:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa2 23:11</span></span>

Hararite - Interpreted to mean "mountaineer," one from the hill country
of Judah or Ephraim.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa2 23:13</span></span>

The feat at Bethlehem by three of the thirty was the occasion of their
being formed into a distinct triad; Abishai [Sa2
23:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#018), Benaiah [Sa2
23:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#020), and a third not named, were
probably the three.

In the harvest time - An error for "to the rock" (compare the marginal
reference).

The troop of the Philistines - The word rendered "troop" occurs in this
sense only here (and, according to some, in [Sa2
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#011)), and perhaps in [Psa
68:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#011). In 1 Chr. 11, as in [Sa2
23:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#016) the reading is "host" or "camp,"
which may be the true reading here.

Pitched - The same Hebrew word as "encamped" in [Ch1
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#015).

Valley of Rephaim - Or Giants. See [Sa2
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#016) note.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa2 23:14</span></span>

In an hold - In "the hold" [Ch1 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#016)
close to the cave of Adullam (marginal reference note). It shows the
power and daring of the Philistines that they should hold a post so far
in the country as Bethlehem.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 23:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa2 23:15</span></span>

A cistern of deep, clear, cool water, is called by the monks, David's
Well, about three-quarters of a mile to the north of Bethlehem. Possibly
the old well has been filled up since the town was supplied with water
by the aqueduct.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 23:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa2 23:16</span></span>

Brake through the host - Their camp was pitched in the valley of Rephaim
[Sa2 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#013); [Ch1
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#015). It follows from this that the
way from Adullam to Bethlehem lay through or across the valley of
Rephaim.

Poured it out unto the Lord - It was too costly for his own use, none
but the Lord was worthy of it. For libations, see [Jdg
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#020) note.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa2 23:17</span></span>

Better as in [Ch1 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#019).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa2 23:18</span></span>

Three - "The three" [Sa2 23:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#022). It was
Abishai's prowess on this occasion that raised him to be chief of this
triad.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 23:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa2 23:19</span></span>

i\. e., "Was he not the most honorable of the three of the second order,
howbeit, he attained not to the three," the triad, namely, which
consisted of Jashobeam, Eleazar, and Shammah. That two triads are
mentioned is a simple fact, although only five names are given.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 23:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa2 23:20</span></span>

Benaiah the son of Jehoiada - He commanded the Cherethites and
Pelethites all through David's reign [Sa2
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#018); [Sa2
20:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#023), and took a prominent part in
supporting Solomon against Adonijah when David was dying, and was
rewarded by being made captain of the host in the room of Joab [Kg1
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#008), [Kg1
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#026), [Kg1
1:32-40](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#032); [Kg1
2:25-35](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#025); [Kg1
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#004). It is possible that Jehoiada his
father is the same as Jehoiada [Ch1
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#027), leader of the Aaronites, since
"Benaiah the son of Jehoiada" is called a "chief priest" [Ch1
27:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#005).

Two lion-like men - The Hebrew word אריאל 'ărı̂y'êl, means literally
"lion of God," and is interpreted to mean "an eminent hero." Instances
occur among Arabs and Persians of the surname "lion of God" being given
to great warriors. Hence, it is supposed that the same custom prevailed
among the Moabites. But the Vulgate has "two lions of Moab," which seems
to be borne out by the next sentence.

Slew a lion ... - Rather, THE lion, one of those described above as "a
lion of God," if the Vulgate Version is right. Apparently in a severe
winter a lion had come up from its usual haunts to some village in
search of food, and taken possession of the tank or cistern to the
terror of the inhabitants, and Benaiah attacked it boldly and killed it.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 23:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">sa2 23:23</span></span>

David set him over his guard - "Made him of his privy council," would be
a better rendering. See [Sa1 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#014)
note. This position, distinct from his office as captain of the
Cherethites and Pelethites, is clearly indicated [Ch1
27:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#034).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 23:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">sa2 23:24</span></span>

etc. The early death of Asahel [Sa2
2:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#032) would make it very likely that
his place in the 30 would be filled up, and so easily account for the
number 31 in the list. Compare throughout the list in 1 Chr. 11.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 23:36](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">sa2 23:36</span></span>

It is remarkable that we have several foreigners at this part of the
list: Igal of Zobah, Zelek the Ammonite, Uriah the Hittite, and perhaps
Nahari the Beerothite. The addition of Zelek to the mighty men was
probably the fruit of David's war with Ammon [Sa2
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#012); 10; [Sa2
12:26-31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#026).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 23:39](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">sa2 23:39</span></span>

Thirty and seven in all - This reckoning is correct, though only 36
"names" are given, the names of only two of the second triad being
recorded, but 31 names are given from [Sa2
23:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#024) to the end, which, added to the
two triads, or six, makes 37. Joab as captain of the whole host stands
quite alone. In [Ch1 11:41-47](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#041); after
Uriah the Hittite, there follow sixteen other names, probably the names
of those who took the places of those in the former list, who died from
time to time, or who were added when the number was less rigidly
restricted to thirty.
