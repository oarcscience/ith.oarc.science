------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Exodus Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#001)

[Exodus 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 24:1</span></span>

Are placed by some with great probability between [Exo
24:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#008).

[Exodus 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">exo 24:4</span></span>

Twelve pillars - As the altar was a symbol of the presence of Yahweh, so
these twelve pillars represented the presence of the Twelve tribes with
whom He was making the covenant.

[Exodus 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">exo 24:5</span></span>

Young men of the children of Israel - See [Exo
19:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#022); [Exo
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#001); [Lev
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#005).

Burnt offerings ... peace offerings - The burnt offerings Lev. 1 figured
the dedication of the nation to Yahweh, and the peace offerings Lev. 3
their communion with Yahweh and with each other.

[Exodus 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">exo 24:6</span></span>

He sprinkled - Rather, he cast. See [Lev
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#005).

[Exodus 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">exo 24:7</span></span>

The book of the covenant - See [Exo
20:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#022) note. The people had to repeat
their assent to the book of the covenant before the blood was thrown
upon them. Compare [Kg2 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#002), [Kg2
23:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#021); [Ch2
34:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#030).

[Exodus 24:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">exo 24:8</span></span>

The blood which sealed the covenant was the blood of burnt offerings and
peace offerings. The sin-offering Lev. 4 had not yet been instituted.
That more complicated view of human nature which gave to the
sin-offering its meaning, had yet to be developed by the law, which was
now only receiving its ratification. The covenant between Yahweh and His
people therefore took precedence of the operation of the law, by which
came the knowledge of sin. [Rom 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#020).

Upon the people - Either upon the elders or those who stood foremost;
or, upon the twelve pillars representing the Twelve tribes, as the first
half had been cast upon the altar, which witnessed to the presence of
Yahweh. The blood thus divided between the two parties to the covenant
signified the sacramental union between the Lord and His people. Cf.
[Psa 50:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#005); [Zac
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#011).

[Exodus 24:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">exo 24:9</span></span>

It would appear that Moses, Aaron with his two sons, and seventy of the
elders [Exo 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#007) went a short distance
up the mountain to eat the meal of the covenant (compare [Gen
31:43-47](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#043)), which must have consisted
of the flesh of the peace offerings [Exo
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#005). Joshua accompanied Moses as his
servant [Exo 24:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#013).

[Exodus 24:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">exo 24:10</span></span>

And they saw the God of Israel - As they ate the sacrificial feast, the
presence of Yahweh was manifested to them with special distinctness. In
the act of solemn worship, they perceived that He was present with them,
as their Lord and their Deliverer. It is idle to speculate on the mode
of this revelation. That no visible form was presented to their bodily
eyes, we are expressly informed, [Deu
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#012); see [Exo
33:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#020); compare [Isa
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#001). The latter part of this verse may
be read: "under His feet, it was like a work of bright sapphire stone,
and like the heaven itself in clearness." On the sapphire, see [Exo
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#018); compare [Eze
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#026). The pure blue of the heaven
above them lent its influence to help the inner sense to realize the
vision which no mortal eye could behold.

[Exodus 24:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">exo 24:11</span></span>

He laid not his hand - i. e. He did not strike them. It was believed
that a mortal could not survive the sight of God [Exo
33:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#020); [Gen
32:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#030); [Jdg
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#022); [Jdg
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#022) : but these rulers of Israel
were permitted to eat and drink, while they were enjoying in an
extraordinary degree the sense of the divine presence, and received no
harm.

[Exodus 24:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">exo 24:12</span></span>

Many Jews understand the "tables of stone" to denote the Ten
Commandments; "a law," the law written in the Pentateuch; and the
"commandments" (or "the commandment"), the oral or traditional law which
was in after ages put into writing in the Mishna and the Gemara. But it
is more probable that the Ten Commandments alone are spoken of, and that
the meaning is, "the tables of stone with the law, even the
commandment."

[Exodus 24:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">exo 24:18</span></span>

During this period of forty days, and the second period when the tables
were renewed, Moses neither ate bread nor drank water. Compare marginal
references. In like manner, Elijah fasted for forty days, when he
visited the same spot [Kg1 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#008). The
two who met our Saviour on the Mount of Transfiguration [Mat
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#003), the one representing the law,
the other representing the Prophets, thus shadowed forth in their own
experience the Fast of Forty days in the wilderness of Judaea.
