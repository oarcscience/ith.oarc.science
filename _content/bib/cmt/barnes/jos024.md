### [Joshua Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#001)

[Joshua 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 24:1</span></span>

Shechem, situated between those mountains, Ebal and Gerizim, which had
already been the scene of a solemn rehearsal of the covenant soon after
the first entry of the people into the promised land [Jos
8:30-35](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#030), was a fitting scene for the
solemn renewal on the part of the people of that covenant with God which
had been on His part so signally and so fully kept. The spot itself
suggested the allusions to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, etc., in Joshua's
address; and its associations could not but give special force and
moving effect to his appeals. This address was not made to the rulers
only but to the whole nation, not of course to the tribes assembled in
mass, but to their representatives.

[Joshua 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#002)

The other side of the flood - Better "On the other side of the river,"
i. e. the Euphrates. See the marginal reference.

They served other gods - Possibly the "images," or teraphim, which we
find their ancestor Laban calling "his gods" (see the marginal
reference); and of which it would seem that there were, as Joshua spoke,
some secret devotees among the people [Jos
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#014), [Jos
24:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#025). It is not stated that Abraham
himself was an idolater, though his fathers were. Jewish tradition
asserts that Abraham while in Ur of the Chaldees was persecuted for his
abhorrence of idolatry, and hence, was called away by God from his
native land. The reference in the text to the original state of those
who were the forefathers of the nation, is made to show that they were
no better than others: God chose them not for their excellences but of
His own mere motion.

[Joshua 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jos 24:15</span></span>

Choose - Service of God in sincerity and truth can only result from a
free and willing allegiance of the heart. This accordingly is what
Joshua invites, as Moses had done before him ([Deu
30:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#015) ff).

[Joshua 24:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jos 24:25</span></span>

Made a covenant with the people - i. e. he solemnly ratified and renewed
the covenant of Sinai, as Moses had done before him [Deu
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#001). As no new or different covenant
was made, no sacrifices were necessary.

[Joshua 24:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jos 24:26</span></span>

Consult the marginal references.

That was by the sanctuary of the Lord - i. e. the spot where Abraham and
Jacob had sacrificed and worshipped, and which might well be regarded by
their posterity as a holy place or sanctuary. Perhaps the very altar of
Abraham and Jacob was still remaining.

[Joshua 24:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">jos 24:33</span></span>

(Eleazar's burial-place is placed by Conder not at Tibneh but in the
village of 'Awertah.)
