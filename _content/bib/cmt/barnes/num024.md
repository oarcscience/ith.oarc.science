### [Numbers Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#001)

[Numbers 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 24:2</span></span>

Balaam gazed over the camp of Israel that stretched before him, and
allowed the spectacle to work its own influence upon him.

[Numbers 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">num 24:3</span></span>

Whose eyes are open - i. e., opened in inward vision, to discern things
that were hidden from ordinary beholders.

[Numbers 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">num 24:4</span></span>

The "falling" of which Balaam speaks was the condition under which the
inward opening of his eyes took place. It indicates the force of the
divine inspiration overpowering the seer. The faithful prophets of the
Lord do not appear to have been subject to these violent illapses [Dan
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#017); [Rev
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#017).

In Balaam and in Saul [Sa1 19:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#024) the
word of God could only prevail by first subduing the alien will, and
overpowering the bodily energies which the will ordinarily directs.

[Numbers 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">num 24:6</span></span>

As gardens by the river's side - Balaam's language reflects the famous
artificial gardens along the banks of his own river, the Euphrates.

As the trees of lign aloes which the Lord hath planted - The latter
words contain an apparent reference to Paradise (compare [Gen
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#008)). The aloe, imported from China
and the far distant east, furnished to the ancients one of the most
fragrant and precious of spices; compare [Psa
45:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#008); [Pro
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#017),

As cedar trees beside the waters - i. e., as the noblest of trees
branching forth in the fairest of situations: an image of majestic
beauty, as that of the last verse was of rare fecundity.

[Numbers 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">num 24:7</span></span>

Balaam's native soil was ordinarily irrigated by water fetched from the
neighboring Euphrates, and carried in buckets suspended from the two
ends of a pole. Thus the metaphor would import that Israel should have
his own exuberant and unfailing channels of blessing and plenty. Some
take the word to be predictive of the future benefits which, through the
means of Israel, were to accrue to the rest of the world.

Agag - The name, apparently hereditary (compare 1 Sam. 15) to the
chieftains of Amalek, means "high." The words point to the Amalekite
kingdom as highly prosperous and powerful at the time (compare [Num
24:20](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#020)); but also to be far excelled by
the future glories of Israel. The Amalekites never in fact recovered
their crushing defeat by Saul ([Sa1
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#002) ff), though they appear again as
foes to Israel in the reign of David ([Sa1
27:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#001) and 30). The remnant of them
was destroyed in the reign of Hezekiah [Ch1
4:43](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#043).

[Numbers 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">num 24:14</span></span>

I will advertise thee - i. e., "I will advise thee," words which refer
to the ensuing prophecy.

[Numbers 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">num 24:16</span></span>

And knew, the knowledge of the Most High - With the addition of these
words, which point to the greater importance and the more distinctly
predictive character of what follows, the introduction to this last
parable is the same as the introduction to the preceding parable.

[Numbers 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">num 24:17</span></span>

Render, I see him, though he be not now: I behold him, though he be not
near. Balaam here describes what is actually before him in inward
vision.

Him - i. e., the prince, represented in the succeeding words by the Star
and Scepter. The star has among all nations served as a symbol of regal
power and splendour: and the birth and future glory of great monarchs
were believed by the ancients to be heralded by the appearance of stars
or comets: compare also [Isa 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#012);
[Dan 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#010); [Rev
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#016), [Rev
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#020); [Rev
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#001); [Rev
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#001).

The corners of Moab - literally, "the two sides of Moab," i. e., the
length and breadth of the land: compare [Jer
48:45](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#045).

Destroy all the children of Sheth - Rather, "overthrow the sons of
tumult," i. e., the warriors of Moab, whose valour and fierceness is
frequently referred to elsewhere (compare [Exo
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#015); [Isa
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#004); [Isa
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#006), etc.) Compare [Jer
48:45](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#045).

[Numbers 24:18](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">num 24:18</span></span>

Seir - The older name of the mountain-land, south of Moab, and east of
the Arabah, which the Edomites inhabited [Gen
32:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#003); [Gen
36:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#008).

[Numbers 24:19](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">num 24:19</span></span>

Destroy him that remaineth of the city - i. e., shall destroy those of
every city that had previously escaped. The phrase tersely describes a
conqueror who first defeats his enemies in battle, and then hunts out
the fugitives until he has cut off all of every place (compare [Kg1
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#016)).

The victories of David were a partial accomplishment of the predictions
[Num 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#014), [Num
24:18](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#018), but did not exhaust them.

It is apparent that Edom and Moab are named by Balaam, as they are also
by the prophets (compare e. g., [Isa
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#014)), as representatives of the
pagan nations [Num 24:8](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#008) who were
hostile to the theocracy. As Jacob therefore figures as a constant type
of the kingdom of Messiah in the prophets, so do Edom and Joab of the
enemies of that kingdom; and in the threatened ruin of Edom and Moab is
indicated the eventual destruction of all that resist the kingdom of God
in its power.

The "Star" and "Sceptre" of the prophecy, like the "Sceptre" and
"Lawgiver" of [Gen 49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010), point also
naturally to a line of princes rather than to an individual; or rather
are emblems of the kingdom of Israel generally. Thus, the victories of
David and his successors, generation after generation, over Edom and
Moab, are unquestionably recurring and progressive accomplishments of
what Balaam foretold; but in addition the prophecy reaches forward to
some further and culminating accomplishment; and that too in "the latter
days" [Num 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#014), the ordinary
prophetic designation for the time of the Messiah (compare the marginal
references).

To a Christian the connection between the Star and Seeptre of Balaam and
the Star of the king of the Jews, which the wise men saw [Mat
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#002), is self-evident.

[Numbers 24:20](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">num 24:20</span></span>

When he looked - i. e., in spirit, as he saw the Star [Num
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#017).

Amalek was the first of the nations - Rather, is pre-eminent among the
neighboring nations: compare the same expression in [Amo
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#001). Hence, the force of the words
[Num 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#007) "higher than Agag," i. e.,
than the king of this powerful nation (compare [Num
14:45](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#045); [Exo
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#008)). This rank, due to the warlike
prowess of the tribe, Balaam contrasts with its approaching downfall and
extinction.

[Numbers 24:21](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">num 24:21</span></span>

The Kenites - First mentioned [Gen
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#019) as one of the tribes whose
territory was promised to Abraham. In [Jdg
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#016), where we read of them as moving
with the children of Judah, to establish themselves in the pastures
south of Arad, Moses' father-in-law is spoken of as a Kenite (compare
[Jdg 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#011)). It appears therefore,
since Moses' father-in-law was a prince or priest of Midian ([Exo
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#015) ff), that the Kenites must have
been of Midianite extraction, and so descended from Abraham through
Keturah [Gen 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#002).

But it seems unlikely that the Kenites of [Gen
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#019), who were to be dispossessed by
the descendants of Abraham, were identical with those of whom Balaam
speaks, and who were, because of good offices rendered at the time of
the Exodus, always regarded as kinsmen and friends by Israel (compare
[Sa1 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#006); [Sa1
27:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#010)). Rather, is it probable that
the Kenites of [Gen 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#019) were a
Canaanite people, who derived their name from the city Kain, which fell
eventually within the borders of the tribe of Judah [Jos
15:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#022); and that the descendants of
Hobab, who appear in [Jdg 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#016) as
making war in this very district, possessed themselves of this city, and
with it of the name Kenite also. This they would seem to have already
done when Balsam uttered his prediction; and in the next verse it is, as
the margin correctly indicates, not of the Kenite, but of Kain the city,
that he speaks. Nor is it surprising to find them in possession of their
new abode in the promised land, while the Israelites were yet in their
tents. It may well be that this roving band of Midianites had already
entered Canaan, perhaps along the shores of the Dead Sea, and by routes
impracticable for the huge host of Israel, and had, as a kind of
advanced guard, made a beginning of the conquest of the country.

From [Ch1 2:54-55](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#054), we learn that the
Rechabites were a branch of the Kenites; and the name Salmaites, always
given to the Kenites in the Targums, connects them with Salma, the son
of Caleb, there mentioned. Jer. 35 shows how tenaciously, for many
centuries, they held fast the nomadic habits of their race.

Strong is thy dwellingplace, and thou puttest thy nest in a rock -
Render, Strong (or firm) be thy dwelling-place, and put thou thy nest in
the rock (or cliff). In the Hebrew there is a play on the words ken,
"nest," and Kain, the name of the Kenites' abode. This nest in the cliff
might be the city of Hazazon-tamar or Engedi, if that be (as is likely)
the "city of palm-trees," from which they went up subsequently [Jdg
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#016). But there is another site, about
10 miles south of Engedi, to which Balaam's words would be more
appropriate, on the summit of the cliff rising perpendicularly from the
level of the western shore of the Dead Sea, where was afterward built
the city of Masada, the scene of the closing tragedy of the Jewish-Roman
war. It is not likely that such a natural fortress would ever have been
unoccupied, or even excluded from a place in the list of the cities of
Judah. Nor is there any site in the Holy land which a rude but warlike
people might more fittingly designate as either Ken, the Nest, or Kain,
the Possession.

[Numbers 24:22](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">num 24:22</span></span>

Render, For Kain shall surely not be destroyed (literally "be for
destruction") until Asshur, etc. The words are not, as they appear in
the King James Version, a prediction of evil to the Kenites, but a
promise, on the contrary, of safety to be long continued to them
(compare [Num 10:32](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#032); [Jer
35:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#019)).

[Numbers 24:23](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">num 24:23</span></span>

When God doeth this - The eventual carrying away of the allies of Israel
by Assyria presented itself to Balaam as the ruin of all peace and
safety upon earth. One prediction was howerer, yet wanting, and is next
given, namely, that the conquerors of the Kenites should fare no better
than the Kenites themselves.

[Numbers 24:24](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">num 24:24</span></span>

Chittim - i. e., Cyprus, the nearest of the western islands, the only
one visible from Palestine, and so the representative to Balsam and to
Israel of all those unknown western regions across the Mediterranean
Sea, from which were at length to come the conquerors of the mighty
empires of the East. Compare [Isa
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#001), [Isa
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#012); [Jer
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#010).

Eber - i. e., the descendants of Shem. Of these Asshur was one (compare
marginal references), and is here specified by name, since the Assyrians
attained, in the empires of Babylon and Nineveh, to an extraordinary
grandeur, and were destined to a most signal and irretrievable fall.

He also - i. e., the conqueror of Asshur and Eber who should come across
the sea. It is not revealed from where the blow should come that should
overthrow in its turn the power that prevailed over the great monarchies
of the East.

[Numbers 24:25](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">num 24:25</span></span>

Returned to his own place - i. e., among the Midianites to plot by new
means against the people of God, and to perish in his sin [Num
31:8](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#008), [Num
31:16](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#016); [Rev
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#014).
