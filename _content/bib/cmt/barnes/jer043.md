### [Jeremiah Chapter 43](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 43:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 43:1</span></span>

These captains belonged to the party who had all along resisted
Jeremiah's counsels, and had led Zedekiah astray. Now however that
events had proved that the prophet's counsels had been wise and true,
they cannot for shame find fault with him, but they affirm that he is
under the influence of Baruch, a traitor who has sold himself to the
Chaldaeans, and seeks only the hurt of the people.

[Jeremiah 43:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 43:4</span></span>

All the people - Many, nevertheless, would be unwilling agents,
compelled to do what their unscrupulous leaders forced upon the
community.

[Jeremiah 43:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 43:5</span></span>

All the remnant of Judah that were returned - In this way, the utter
depopulation of the land was completed. Thus was fulfilled the
predictions of [Jer 24:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#008), and the
sole hope of the nation now centered in the exiles at Babylon [Jer
24:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#005).

[Jeremiah 43:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 43:7</span></span>

Tahpanhes - See the [Jer 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#016) note.

[Jeremiah 43:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 43:8</span></span>

On arriving at the frontiers of Egypt, the captains would be compelled
to halt in order to obtain the king's permission to enter his country.
Jeremiah therefore takes the opportunity to predict, first, the downfall
of Egypt; and secondly, that of the false gods.

[Jeremiah 43:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 43:9</span></span>

Brickkiln - Possibly, a pavement of brick. Jeremiah was to take a few
large stones, such, nevertheless, as he could carry in his hand, and
build with them, in the propylaea before the royal palace, something
that would serve to represent the dais upon which the seat of kings was
usually placed. By hiding them in the clay is meant plastering them over
with mortar.

[Jeremiah 43:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 43:10</span></span>

My servant - See [Jer 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#009) note.

That I have hid - i. e., that I have embedded in the mortar by the
instrumentality of my prophet.

Pavilion - Rather, canopy. It probably means the parasol held over
kings, which had a tall and thick pole, grasped with both hands, and in
the early times a somewhat small circular top.

[Jeremiah 43:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 43:11</span></span>

According to each man's destiny, he will either die of famine,
pestilence, or in battle; or he will be led captive; or be put to death
by the executioner.

[Jeremiah 43:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 43:12</span></span>

I will kindle - Or, "he shall kindle."

He shall burn them ... - i. e., he shall burn the temples, and carry
away the gods.

And he shall array - literally, "And he shall wrap himself in the land
of Egypt as the shepherd wrappeth himself in his cloak, and shall (go
forth thence in peace;" i. e., With as great ease as a shepherd throws
his cloak round him when going forth to watch his flock by night in the
field, so easily shall the king of Babylon take possession of all the
glory of Egypt, throw it round him, and depart without anyone resisting
his progress.

[Jeremiah 43:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 43:13</span></span>

Images - Rather, pillars (compare the [Isa
19:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#019) note), obelisks.

Beth-shemesh - Heliopolis, famous for its obelisks.
