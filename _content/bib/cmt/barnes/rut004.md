### [Ruth Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#001)

[Ruth 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rut 4:1</span></span>

The gate is the place of concourse, of business, and of justice in
Oriental cities (see [Jdg 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#015) note;
[Gen 34:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#020); [Deu
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#018)).

Ho, such a one! - Indicating that the name of the kinsman was either
unknown or purposely concealed [Sa1
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#002); [Kg2
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#008).

[Ruth 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rut 4:2</span></span>

Every city was governed by elders (see [Deu
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#012); [Jdg
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#014)). For the number "ten," compare
[Exo 18:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#025). Probably the presence of,
at least, ten elders was necessary to make a lawful public assembly, as
among modern Jews ten (a minyon) are necessary to constitute a
synagogue.

[Ruth 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rut 4:3</span></span>

According to the law [Lev 25:25-28](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#025), if
any Israelite, through poverty, would sell his possession, the next of
kin (the גאל gā'al) had a right to redeem it by paying the value of the
number of years remaining until the jubilee (see the marginal
reference). This right Boaz advertises the גאל gā'al of, so as to give
him the option which the law secured to him of redeeming "our brother
Elimelech's" land, i. e. our kinsman's, according to the common use of
the term brother, for near relation (see [Gen
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#008); [Gen
24:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#027); [Lev
25:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#025); [Num
27:4](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#004); [Jdg
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#001)).

[Ruth 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rut 4:4</span></span>

See the margin; a phrase explained by the act of removing the end of the
turban, or the hair, in order to whisper in the ear (see [Sa1
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#015) : [Sa2
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#027)).

[Ruth 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rut 4:5</span></span>

Observe the action of the Levirate law. If there had been no one
interested but Naomi, she would have sold the land unclogged by any
condition, the law of Levirate having no existence in her case. But
there was a young widow upon whom the possession of the land would
devolve at Naomi's death, and who already had a right of partnership in
it, and the law of Levirate did apply in her case. It was, therefore,
the duty of the גאל gā'al to marry her and raise up seed to his brother,
i. e. his kinsman. And he could not exercise his right of redeeming the
land, unless he was willing at the same time to fulfill his obligations
to the deceased by marrying the widow. This he was unwilling to do.

[Ruth 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rut 4:6</span></span>

I mar mine own inheritance - The meaning of these words is doubtful.
Some explain them by saying that the גאל gā'al had a wife and children
already, and would not introduce strife into his family. Others think
that there was a risk (which he would not incur) of the go'el's own name
being blotted out from his inheritance [Rut
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#010). Others take the word translated
as "mar" in a sense of wasting or spending. If he had to find the
purchase-money, and support Naomi and Ruth, his own fortune would be
broken down, if, as is likely, he was a man of slender means. Boaz,
being "a mighty man of wealth," could afford this.

Redeem thou my right ... - Literally, redeem my redemption - perform
that act of redemption which properly belongs to me, but which I cannot
perform.

[Ruth 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rut 4:7</span></span>

In former time in Israel - Showing that the custom was obsolete in the
writer's days. The letter of the law (see the marginal reference) was
not strictly followed. It was thought sufficient for the man to pull off
his own shoe and give it to the man to whom he ceded his right, in the
presence of the elders of his city.

[Ruth 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rut 4:11</span></span>

See the margin. There is something of a poetical turn in this speech of
the elders, and something prophetic in the blessing pronounced by them.
It is unique and obscure. The Greek Version (lxx) is unintelligible.
Jerome seems to have had a slightly different reading, since he applies
both clauses to Ruth. "May she be a pattern of virtue in Ephratah, and
have a name famous in Bethlehem." The meaning of "be famous" seems to
be, Get thyself a name which shall be celebrated in Bethlehem, as the
head of a powerful and illustrious house: literally it is, "proclaim a
name," i. e. cause others to proclaim thy name, as in [Rut
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#014).

[Ruth 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rut 4:14</span></span>

Without a kinsman - i. e. Boaz, not the infant Obed.

[Ruth 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rut 4:17</span></span>

Obed - i. e. serving, with allusion to the service of love and duty
which he would render to his grandmother Naomi.

[Ruth 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rut 4:18</span></span>

It is probable that there was a family book for the house of Pharez, in
which their genealogies were preserved, and important bits of history
were recorded; and that the Book of Ruth was compiled from it. (See the
note at [Gen 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#004))

[Ruth 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">rut 4:21</span></span>

Salmon begat Boaz - Matthew has preserved the additional interesting
information that the mother of Boaz was Rahab Josh. 2; 6. It is possible
that the circumstance that the mother of Boaz was a Canaanite may have
made him less indisposed to marry Ruth the Moabitess. As regards the
whole genealogy in [Rut 4:18-22](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#018), it
should be remarked that it occurs four times in Scripture, namely, here,
[Ch1 2:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#010); [Mat
1:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#003); and [Luk
3:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#032), and is of course of singular
importance as being the genealogy of our Lord. One or two difficulties
in it still remain unsolved.
