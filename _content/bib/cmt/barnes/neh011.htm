<p>To bring one of ten - Artificial enlargements of capitals by forcible transfers of population to them, were not unusual in ancient times. About 500 B.C., Syracuse became a great city in this way. Tradition ascribed the greatness of Rome, in part, to this cause.

<p>See the margin reference notes. Both accounts appear to be extracts from a public official register which Nehemiah caused to be made of his census. The census itself seems to have been confined to the dwellers at Jerusalem. The subjoined table exhibits the differences between the accounts of the entire population of Jerusalem as given in Nehemiah and in Chronicles:
<p>
<p> 1 Chron Nehemiah  Tribes of Judah    Of Pharez  468  Of Zerah 690   Tribe of Benjamin 956 928  Tribe of Levi    Priests 1760 1192  Levites  284  Porters 212 172  
<p>According to Nehemiah's numbers, supplemented from Chronicles, the entire adult male population of the city was 3,734, which would give a total population of 14,936. According to Chronicles, supplemented from Nehemiah, the adult males were 4,370, and consequently the entire population, would have been 17,480. As the Nethinims and the Israelites of Ephraim and Manasseh <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#003">Ch1 9:3</A> are not included in either list, we may conclude that the actual number of the inhabitants, after the efforts recorded in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#001">Neh 11:1-2</A>, was not much short of 20,000.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#016">Neh 11:16</A>
<p>The outward business of the house of God - Such as the collection of the newly-imposed tax <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#032">Neh 10:32</A>, the providing of the regular sacrifices, the renewal of vestments, and the like.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#017">Neh 11:17</A>
<p>The principal to begin the thanksgiving - i. e., "the precentor," or "leader of the choir."
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#020">Nehemiah 11:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">neh 11:20</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The returned community, though consisting mainly of members of the two tribes, represented the entire people of Israel. The ground, however, which they occupied, was not the whole land, but that which had constituted the kingdom of Judah. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#021">Nehemiah 11:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">neh 11:21</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Ophel, the southern spur of the temple hill, having a wall of its own <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#027">Neh 3:27</A> might be reckoned either in Jerusalem or outside it. Here it is made a separate place. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#022">Nehemiah 11:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">neh 11:22</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The business intended was probably the internal business, as distinct from the "outward business" <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#016">Neh 11:16</A> : a part of which was the apportionment of the royal bounty among the members of the choir <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#023">Neh 11:23</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#023">Nehemiah 11:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">neh 11:23</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The goodwill of Artaxerxes toward the ministers employed in the temple service, had been previously shown by his exempting them from taxation of every kind <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#024">Ezr 7:24</A>. Now, it would seem, he had gone further and assigned to the singers an allowance from the royal revenue. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#024">Nehemiah 11:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">neh 11:24</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>It is difficult to say what office Pethahiah filled. So far as we know, the only regular officers under the Persian system of government were the satrap, the subsatrap, the permanent royal secretary, the commandant, and the occasional commissary. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#025">Nehemiah 11:25</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_025">neh 11:25</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Kirjath-arba - i. e., Hebron. In the absence of the Hebrews during the captivity, the place had recovered its old name <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#013">Jos 15:13</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#026">Nehemiah 11:26</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_026">neh 11:26</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Many of the places mentioned in these verses are mentioned in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#027">Jos 15:27-39</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#021">Jos 18:21-28</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#036">Nehemiah 11:36</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_036">neh 11:36</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Of the Levites were divisions - i. e., "the Levites were scattered among various towns both in Judah and Benjamin."
