<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_000">sol 7:0</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The Shulamite complies with the request of her attendants, and as she glides before them in the dance, they sing in further commendation of her beauty of form and grace of movement. The description in the original consists, like <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#001">Sol 4:1-5</A>, of five stanzas nearly coinciding with the verses in the text. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#001">Song of Solomon (Canticles) 7:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">sol 7:1</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Thy feet with shoes - Or, thy steps in the sandals: the bride's feet are seen in motion in the dance. "Joints" might be rendered circling movements.
<p>Prince's daughter - Or, daughter of a noble; the bride is of honorable though not of kingly birth.
<p>Like jewels - The image suggested is that of large well-formed pearls or other jewels skillfully strung or linked together. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#002">Song of Solomon (Canticles) 7:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">sol 7:2</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Or, Thy lap is like a moon-shaped bowl where mixed wine faileth not." The wine in the bowl rising to the brim adds to the beauty of the vessel, and gives a more pleasing image to the eye. Some interpret, "thy girdle is like a moon-shaped bowl," or "bears a moon-shaped ornament" (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#018">Isa 3:18</A>).
<p>Set about with lilies - The contrast is one of colors, the flowers, it may be, representing the purple of the robe. "The heap of wheat is not seen because covered by the lilies." 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#004">Song of Solomon (Canticles) 7:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">sol 7:4</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>A tower of ivory - The tower of ivory, the allusion being to some particular tower, built probably by Solomon <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#021">Kg1 10:21</A>.
<p>Fishpools in Heshbon - Or, simply pools. Among the ruins to the south of Heshbon still remain a number of deep wells cut in the rock, and a large reservoir of water. The simile well sets forth the appearance of a large clear liquid eye (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#012">Sol 5:12</A> note).
<p>Gate of Bath-rabbim - Perhaps the gate looking toward Rabbath-Ammon on the north side of the city, though this does not agree with the wells above mentioned; or, the gate of the city "full of people" <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#001">Lam 1:1</A>; or, an expression indicating the gate itself as the scene of numerous gatherings.
<p>Nose - Better perhaps "face "or "brow."
<p>The tower of Lebanon - Possibly "the house of the forest of Lebanon" or part of it <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#002">Kg1 7:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#019">Kg1 9:19</A>, built by Solomon in the early part of his reign; or possibly a watchtower erected by David to overawe Damascus after his war with Hadadezer <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#006">Sa2 8:6</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#005">Song of Solomon (Canticles) 7:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">sol 7:5</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Compare and contrast with <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#015">Sol 5:15</A>. The rendering in the margin takes "Carmel" as the name of a color, equivalent to "carmine" (rendered "crimson" in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#007">Ch2 2:7</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#014">Ch2 2:14</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#014">Ch2 3:14</A>). This interpretation is favored by the parallelism with "purple," but removes a beautiful image.
<p>Purple - A deep violet black.
<p>The king ... - Rather, "A king is bound in the tresses or windings of thy hair." These last words indicate the king's approach. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#006">Song of Solomon (Canticles) 7:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">sol 7:6</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>A brief dialogue; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#006">Sol 7:6-9</A> are spoken by the king, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#009">Sol 7:9</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#010">Sol 7:10</A> by the bride.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#006">Sol 7:6</A>
<p>A general sentiment.
<p>How fair, and what a charm hast thou,
<p>O love! Among delightsome things!
<p>Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#007">Sol 2:7</A>, note; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#006">Sol 8:6-7</A>, note.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#007">Sol 7:7</A>
<p>This thy stature - The king now addresses the bride, comparing her to palm, vine, and apple-tree for nobility of form and pleasantness of fruit; and the utterances of her mouth to sweetest wine.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#009">Sol 7:9</A>
<p>For my beloved, that goeth down sweetly - Words of the bride interrupting the king, and finishing his sentence, that goeth smoothly or pleasantly for my beloved. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#031">Pro 23:31</A>.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#010">Sol 7:10</A>
<p>His desire is toward me - All his affection has me for its object. The bride proceeds to exercise her power over his loving will.
