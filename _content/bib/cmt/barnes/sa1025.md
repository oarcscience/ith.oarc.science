### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#001)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 25:1</span></span>

In his house at Ramah - Probably in the court or garden attached to his
dwelling-house. (Compare [Ch2 33:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#020);
[Kg2 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#018); [Joh
19:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#041).)

The wilderness of Paran - The Septuagint has the far more probable
reading "Maon." The wilderness of Paran lay far off to the south, on the
borders of the wilderness of Sinai [Num
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#012); [Kg1
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#018), whereas the following verse
[Sa1 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#002) shows that the scene is laid
in the immediate neighborhood of Maon. If, however, Paran be the true
reading, we must suppose that in a wide sense the wilderness of Paran
extended all the way to the wilderness of Beersheba, and eastward to the
mountains of Judah (marginal references).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 25:2</span></span>

Carmel - Not Mount Carmel on the west of the plain of Esdraelon, but the
Carmel close to Maon (marginal references).

Shearing his sheep - Which was always a time of open-handed hospitality
among flock-masters [Gen 38:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#012);
[Sa2 13:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#023).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 25:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 25:6</span></span>

That liveth in prosperity - The Hebrew is obscure, and is variously
interpreted. The simplest rendering is, "And ye shall say thus about
(his) life," i. e., with reference to his life, health, circumstances,
etc.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa1 25:11</span></span>

The mention of water indicates a country where water was scarce (compare
[Jos 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#019)). Or "bread and water" may
be equivalent to "meat and drink."

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 25:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa1 25:14</span></span>

Railed on them - The marginal reading, "flew upon them," is nearer to
the original.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 25:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa1 25:16</span></span>

A wall - To protect them from the attacks of the Bedouins, etc. They had
been as safe with David's men around them as if they had been dwelling
in a walled town.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 25:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa1 25:18</span></span>

Two bottles - Rather, "two skins," each of which would contain many
gallons. These leather vessels varied in size according to the skin they
were made of, and the use they were to be put to. The smaller and more
portable kind, which may not improperly be called bottles, were made of
the skin of a kid: larger ones of the skin of a he-goat. The Arabs
invariably to this day carry their milk, water, etc., in such leather
vessels. One skin of wine was a handsome present from Ziba, sufficient
for David's household [Sa2 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#001). The
provisions were all ready to Abigail's hand, having been provided for
the sheep-shearing feast.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 25:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa1 25:20</span></span>

The covert of the hill - Probably a defile or glen, literally a "secret
place," as in [Sa1 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#002). She was
riding down into this glen from one side, while David and his men were
descending the opposite hill. It is perhaps mentioned that she came by
this "secret place," because she chose this path to escape the
observation of her husband or of anyone else.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 25:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa1 25:21</span></span>

In vain - i. e., under false expectation.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 25:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">sa1 25:22</span></span>

The concluding phrase denotes the utter destruction of a family, and is
rightly explained to mean "every male," perhaps with the idea, "down to
the very meanest member of the household."

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 25:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">sa1 25:26</span></span>

The passage should be rendered as follows: "And now my lord, as the Lord
liveth, and as thy soul liveth," it is "the Lord" that "hath withholden
thee from coming" into blood-guiltiness (as in [Sa1
25:33](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#033)), "and from saving thyself with
thine own hand;" and "now" all "thine enemies" shall be as Nabal (whom
she considers as utterly impotent to hurt David, and as already
thoroughly humbled before him), and (so shall be) all "that seek evil to
my Lord."

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 25:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">sa1 25:28</span></span>

For the Lord will make ... a sure house - Compare [Sa1
2:35](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#035), and [Sa2
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#016); [Kg1
11:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#038). Abigail's firm persuasion of
David's kingdom stands upon the same footing as Rahab's conviction of
God's gift of Canaan to the Israelites [Jos
2:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#009). Both testified to God's
revelation and their own faith. This is doubtless the reason why
Abigail's speech is recorded.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 25:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">sa1 25:29</span></span>

In the bundle - Rather, "the bag," in which anything precious, or
important to be preserved, was put, and the bag was then tied up
(compare [Gen 42:35](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#035)).

The souls ... shall he sling out - The comparison is especially
appropriate as addressed to David, whose feat with his sling was so
celebrated [Sa1 17:49](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#049).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 25:37](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">sa1 25:37</span></span>

He became as a stone - Probably his violent anger at hearing it brought
on a fit of apoplexy to which he was disposed by the drunken revel of
the night before. After lying senseless for ten days he died.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 25:40](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">sa1 25:40</span></span>

There is no note of the exact interval that elapsed between Nabal's
death and David's hearing of it, or, again, between David's hearing of
it and his message to Abigail; nor is there any reason to suppose that
the marriage took place with unbecoming haste. The widow of such a
husband as Nabal had been could not, however, be expected to revere his
memory. After the usual mourning of seven days, she would probably feel
herself free to act as custom allowed. (See [Sa2
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#026).)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 25:43](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">sa1 25:43</span></span>

In the list of David's wives Ahinoam is mentioned first [Sa2
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#002); [Ch1
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#001). But this may be only because her
son was the first-born. David's now taking two wives was an indication
of his growing power and importance as a chieftain. The number was
increased to six when he reigned in Hebron [Ch1
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#001), and still further when he became
king of all Israel [Sa2 5:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#012). See
[Sa1 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#002) note.

Of Jezreel - Not the well-known city of Samaria, which gave its name to
the plain of Esdraelon, but a town of Judah, near Carmel (marginal
reference).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 25:44](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">sa1 25:44</span></span>

Saul's giving Michal to Phalti was intended to mark the final rupture of
his own relations with David (compare [Jdg
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#020); [Sa2
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#007); [Sa2
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#021)). Phalti or Phaltiel Was
compelled by Abner to restore Michal to David [Sa2
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#015).

Gallin - A city of Benjamin, and in the neighborhood of another town
called Laish.
