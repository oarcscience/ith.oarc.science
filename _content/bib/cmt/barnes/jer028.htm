<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#001">Jeremiah 28:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">jer 28:1</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>In the beginning ... Zedekiah - Probably a gloss put into the margin to explain "the same year," from where it has crept into the text.
<p>Gibeon - A city of priests <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#017">Jos 21:17</A>. Hananiah was probably a priest as well as a prophet. He chose either a Sabbath or a new moon, that he might confront Jeremiah not only in the presence of the priests, but also of all the people. He used <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#002">Jer 28:2</A> the solemn formula which claims direct inspiration. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#003">Jeremiah 28:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">jer 28:3</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Within two full years - literally, In yet two years even days. Hananiah probably was induced to fix this date by the expectation that the confederacy then on foot would defeat Nebuchadnezzar. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#004">Jeremiah 28:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">jer 28:4</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Jeconiah - Zedekiah not being popular, the people would have preferred the young king, who had not reigned long enough to make enemies. Probably also Zedekiah had started for Babylon <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#059">Jer 51:59</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#006">Jeremiah 28:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">jer 28:6</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Jeremiah's own wishes concurred with Hananiah's prediction, but asserts that that prediction was at variance with the language of the older prophets.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#009">Jer 28:9</A>
<p>Then shall the prophet ... - Or, "shall be known as the prophet whom the Lord hath truly sent." 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#010">Jeremiah 28:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">jer 28:10</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The multitude would see in Hananiah's act a symbol of deliverance. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#016">Jeremiah 28:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">jer 28:16</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>I will cast thee - Rather, I send thee away. God had not sent Hananiah to prophesy, but He does now send him away to die.
<p>Taught rebellion - As Nebuchadnezzar was Yahweh's servant, to teach rebellion against him was to teach rebellion against his Master.
