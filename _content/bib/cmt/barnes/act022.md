### [Acts Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#001)

[Acts 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 22:1</span></span>

Men, brethren, and fathers - This defense was addressed to the Jews, and
Paul commenced it with an expression of sincere respect for them.
Stephen began his defense with the same form of address. See the notes
on [Act 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#002).

My defence - Against the charges brought against me. Those charges were,
that he had endeavored to prejudice people everywhere against the Jews,
the Law, and the temple, [Act 21:28](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#028).
In order to meet this charge, Paul stated:

\(1\) That he was a Jew by birth, and had enjoyed all the advantages of
a Jewish education, [Act 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#003);

\(2\) He recounted the circumstances of his conversion, and the reason
why he believed that he was called to preach the gospel, [Act
22:4-16](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#004);

\(3\) He proceeded to state the reasons why he went among the Gentiles,
and evidently intended to vindicate his conduct there, [Act
22:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#017); but at this point, at the
name Gentiles, his defense was interrupted by the enraged multitude, and
he was not permitted to proceed.

What would have been his defense, therefore, had he been suffered to
finish it, it is impossible to know with certainty. On another occasion,
however, he was permitted to make a similar defense, and perhaps to
complete the train of thought which he had purposed to pursue here. See
Acts 22.

[Acts 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 22:2</span></span>

The Hebrew tongue - See the notes on [Act
21:40](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#040).

[Acts 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 22:3</span></span>

Born in Tarsus - See the notes on [Act
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#011).

Brought up in this city - In Jerusalem, sent there for the advantage of
more perfect instruction in the Law.

At the feet of Gamaliel - As a scholar or disciple of Gamaliel. The
phrase to sit at the feet of one is expressive of the condition of a
disciple or learner. Compare [Deu
33:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#003); [Luk
10:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#039). It is probable that the
expression arose from the fact that the learners occupied a lower place
or seat than the teacher. On the character and rank of Gamaliel, see the
notes on [Act 5:34](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#034). Paul mentions his
having been instructed in this manner in order to show that he was
entitled to the full privileges of a Jew, and that he had had every
opportunity to become fully acquainted with the nature of the Law.

According to the perfect manner - κατὰ ἀκρίβειαν kata akribeian . By
strict diligence or exact care; or in the utmost rigor and severity of
that instruction. No pains were Spared to make him understand and
practice the Law of Moses.

The law of the fathers - The law of our fathers; that is, the law which
they received and handed down to us. Paul was a Pharisee, and the law in
which he had been taught was not only the written Law of Moses, but the
traditional law which had been handed down from former times. See the
notes on [Mat 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#006).

And was zealous toward God - [Gal
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#014). He had a constant burning zeal
for God and His Law, which was expressed not only by scrupulous
adherence to its forms, but by persecuting all who opposed it, [Act
22:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#004).

[Acts 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 22:4</span></span>

And I persecuted - [Act 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#003).

This way - Those who were of this mode of worshipping God; that is,
Christians. See the notes on [Act 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#002).

Unto the death - Intending to put them to death. He did not probably put
any to death himself, but he committed them to prison; he sought their
lives; he was the agent employed in arresting them; and when they were
put to death, he tells us that he gave his voice against them [Act
26:10](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#010); that is, he joined in, and
approved of their condemnation.

Delivering into prisons ... - [Act
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#003).

[Acts 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 22:5</span></span>

As also the high priest ... - See the notes on [Act
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#002).

All the estate of the elders - Greek: all the presbytery; that is, the
whole body of the Sanhedrin, or Great Council of the nation.

Unto the brethren - The Jewish brethren who were at Damascus. Paul here
speaks as a Jew, and regards his countrymen as his brethren.

[Acts 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 22:6</span></span>

See the notes on [Act 9:3-7](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#003).

[Act 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#006)

As I made my journey - As I was on my journey.

About noon - [Act 26:13](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#013), "at mid-day."
This circumstance is omitted by Luke in his account in Acts 9: Paul
mentions it as being the more remarkable since it occurred at mid-day,
to show that he was not deluded by any meteoric or natural appearances,
which usually occur at night.

[Act 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#011)

The glory of that light - The splendor, the intense brilliancy of the
light. See this and its effects explained in the notes on [Act
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#008).

[Acts 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 22:12</span></span>

See the notes on [Act 9:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#017).

[Acts 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 22:14</span></span>

Shouldest know his will - His will in the plan of salvation, and in
regard to your future life.

And see that Just One - The Messiah. See the notes on [Act
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#014). As Paul was to be an apostle,
and as it was the special office of an apostle to bear witness to the
person and deeds of the Lord Jesus (see the notes on [Act
1:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#021)), it was necessary that he
should see him, that thus he might be a competent witness of his
resurrection.

Shouldest hear the voice of his mouth - Shouldst hear and obey his
commands.

[Acts 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 22:15</span></span>

For thou shalt be his witness ... - As an apostle - to testify to all
people that the Messiah has come, that he has died, that he has risen,
and that he is the Saviour of the world.

Of what thou hast seen and heard - Of the remarkable proof which has
been furnished you of the divine mission and character of the Lord
Jesus.

[Acts 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">act 22:16</span></span>

And now why tarriest thou? - Why dost thou delay, or wait any longer?
These words are not recorded by Luke in Acts 9, where he has given an
account of the conversion of Paul; but there is nothing here
contradictory to his statement.

And wash away thy sins - Receive baptism as emblematic of the washing
away of sins. It cannot be intended that the external rite of baptism
was sufficient to make the soul pure, but that it was an ordinance
divinely appointed as expressive of the washing away of sins, or of
purifying the heart. Compare [Heb
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#022). Sinners are represented in the
Scriptures as defiled or polluted by sin. "To wash away the sins"
denotes "the purifying of the soul from this polluted influence," [Co1
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#011); [Rev
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#005); [Rev
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#014); [Isa
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#016); [Psa
51:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#002), [Psa
51:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#007).

Calling on the name of the Lord - For pardon and sanctification, [Rom
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#013), "Whosoever shall call upon the
name of the Lord shall be saved." It was proper that this calling on the
name of the Lord should be connected with the ordinance of baptism. That
ordinance was emblematic of a purifying which the Lord only could
produce. It is proper that the rite of baptism should be attended with
extraordinary prayer; that he who is to be baptized should make it the
occasion of special and very solemn religious exercises. The external
rite will avail nothing without the pardoning mercy of God.

[Acts 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">act 22:17</span></span>

When I was come again to Jerusalem - That is, three years after his
conversion. See [Gal 1:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#017).

While I prayed in the temple - Paul, like other converts to Christianity
from among the Jews, would naturally continue to offer his devotions in
the temple. We meet with repeated instances of their continuing to
comply with the customs of the Jewish people.

I was in a trance - Greek: ecstasy. See the notes on [Act
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#010). It is possible that he may here
refer to what he elsewhere mentions [Co2
12:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#001) as "visions and revelations of
the Lord." In that place he mentions his being "caught up to the third
heaven" [Co2 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#002) and "into paradise,"
where he heard words which it was "not lawful (marg. possible) for a man
to utter," [Co2 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#004). It is not
certain, however, that he alludes in this place to that remarkable
occurrence. The narrative would rather imply that the Lord Jesus
appeared to him in the temple in a remarkable manner, in a vision, and
gave him a special command to go to the Gentiles. Paul had now stated
the evidence of his conversion, which appears to have been satisfactory
to them - at least they made no objection to his statement; he had
shown, by his being in the temple, his respect for their institutions;
and he now proceeds to show that in his other conduct he had been
directed by the same high authority by which he had been called into the
ministry, and that the command had been given to him in their own temple
and in their own city.

[Acts 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 22:18</span></span>

And saw him - Evidently, the Lord Jesus, [Act
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#014). He had received his commission
from him, and he now received a distinct command to go to the Gentiles.

For they will not receive - The inhabitants of Jerusalem, probably
including both Jews and Christians. The Jews would not listen to him
because he had become, in their view, an apostate, and they would hate
and persecute him. The Christians would not be likely to receive him,
for they would remember his former persecutions, and would be suspicious
of him because he had been so long in Arabia, and had not sooner
connected himself with them. See the notes on [Act
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#026), "And when Saul was come to
Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself to the disciples; but they were
all afraid of him, and believed not that he was a disciple."

[Acts 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 22:19</span></span>

And I said, Lord - This shows that it was the Lord Jesus whom Paul saw
in a trance in the temple. The term "Lord" is usually applied to him in
the Acts . See the notes on [Act 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#024).

They know - Christians know; and they will therefore be not likely to
receive to their fellowship their former enemy and persecutor.

Beat in every synagogue - Beating, or scourging, was often done in the
synagogue. See the notes on [Mat
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#017). Compare [Act
26:11](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#011). It was customary for those who
were converted to Christianity still to meet with the Jews in their
synagogues, and to join with them in their worship.

[Acts 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 22:20</span></span>

The blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed - See [Act
7:58](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#058); [Act
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#001).

I also was standing by - [Act 7:58](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#058).

And consenting unto his death - [Act
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#001).

And kept the raiment - The outer robes or garments, which were usually
laid aside when they engaged in running or labor. See [Act
7:58](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#058). All this showed that, though
Paul was not engaged in stoning Stephen, yet he was with them in spirit,
and fully accorded with what they did. These circumstances are mentioned
here by him as reasons why he knew that he would not be received by
Christians as one of their number, and why it was necessary, therefore,
for him to turn to the Gentile world.

[Acts 22:21](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 22:21</span></span>

And he said unto me, Depart - Because the Christians at Jerusalem would
not receive him.

Far hence - Paul traveled far in the pagan nations. A large part of his
ministry was spent in remote countries, and in the most distant regions
then known. See [Rom 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#019).

[Acts 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 22:22</span></span>

And they gave him audience - They heard him patiently.

Unto this word - The word "Gentile."

Away with such a fellow - Greek: "take such a man from the earth," that
is, "put him to death." It is language of strong indignation and
abhorrence. The reasons of their induction were, not that they supposed
that the Gentiles could not be brought into covenant with God, for they
would themselves compass sea and land to make one proselyte, but:

\(1\) That they believed that Paul taught that they might be saved
without conforming to the Law of Moses; and,

\(2\) His speech implied that the Jews were more hardened than the
Gentiles, and that he had a greater prospect of success in bringing them
to God than he had in regard to the Jews.

[Acts 22:23](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 22:23</span></span>

Cast off their clothes - Their outer garments. Probably they did it now
intending to stone him, [Act 7:58](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#058).

And threw dust into the air - As expressive of them abhorrence and
indignation. This was a striking exhibition of rage and malice. Paul was
guarded by Roman soldiers so that they could not injure him; and their
only way of expressing their wrath was by menaces and threats, and by
these tokens of furious indignation. Thus, Shimei expressed his
indignation against David by cursing him, throwing stones at him, and
casting dust, [Sa2 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#013).

[Acts 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 22:24</span></span>

The castle - The castle of Antonia. He would be there removed entirely
from the wrath of the Jews.

Should be examined - ἀνετάζεσθαι anetazesthai." The word "examine" with
us commonly means "to inquire, to question, to search for, to look
carefully into a subject." The word used here is commonly applied to
metals whose nature is tested, or examined by fire; and then it mean to
subject to torture or torments, in order to extort a confession where
persons were accused of crime. It was often resorted to among the
ancients. A common mode has been by the rack, but various kinds of
torments have been invented in order to extort confessions of guilt from
those who were accused. The whole practice has been one of the most
flagrant violations of justice, and one of the foulest blots on human
nature. In this case, the tribune saw that Paul was accused violently by
the Jews; he was probably ignorant of the Hebrew language, and had not
understood the address of Paul; he supposed from the extraordinary
excitement that Paul must have been guilty of some flagrant offence, and
he therefore resolved to subject him to torture to extort from him a
confession.

By scourging - By the scourge or whip. Compare [Heb
11:36](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#036). This was one mode of torture,
in order to extort a secret from those who were accused.

[Acts 22:25](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 22:25</span></span>

Bound him with thongs - With cords, preparatory to scourging.

Is it lawful ... - It was directly contrary to the Roman law to bind and
scourge a Roman citizen. See the notes on [Act
16:36-37](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#036).

[Acts 22:28](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">act 22:28</span></span>

With a great sum obtained I this freedom - The freedom or privilege of
Roman citizenship. From this it would seem that the privilege of being a
Roman citizen might be purchased, unless perhaps he refers to the
expenses which were necessarily attendant in passing through the proper
forms of becoming a Roman citizen. The argument of the tribune in this
case is this: "I obtained this privilege at a great price. Whence did
you, Paul, thus poor and persecuted, obtain the means of becoming a
Roman citizen?" Paul had informed him that he was a native of Tarsus
[Act 21:39](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#039); and the chief captain
supposed that that was not a free city, and that Paul could not have
derived the privilege of citizenship from his birth.

But I was free born - I was born a Roman citizen, or I am such in virtue
of my birth. Various opinions have been formed on the question in what
way or for what reasons Paul was entitled to the privileges of a Roman
citizen. Some have supposed that Tarsus was a Roman colony, and that he
thus became a Roman citizen. But of this there does not appear to be
sufficient proof. Pliny says ([Act
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#027)) that it was a free city. Appian
says that it was endowed with the privileges of a free city by Augustus
Caesar after it had been greatly afflicted and oppressed by wars. Dio
Chrysost. says to the people of Tarsus, "He (Augustus) has conferred on
you everything which anyone could bestow on his friends and companions,
a country (that is, a free country), laws, honor, authority over the
river (Cydranus) and the neighboring sea." Free cities were permitted in
the Roman empire to use their own laws, customs, and magistrates, and
they were free from being subject to Roman guards. They were required
only to acknowledge the supremacy and authority of the Roman people, and
to aid them in their wars. Such a city was Tarsus; and, having been born
there, Paul was entitled to these privileges of a free man. Many critics
have supposed that this privilege of Roman citizenship had been
conferred on some of the ancestors of Paul in consequence of some
distinguished military service. Such a conferring of the rights of
citizenship was not unusual, and possibly might have occurred in this
case. But there is no direct historical proof of it; and the former fact
that he was born in a free city, will amply account for his affirmation
that he was free born. Compare the notes on [Act
16:37](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#037).

[Acts 22:29](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">act 22:29</span></span>

Then straightway - Immediately. They saw that by scourging him they
would have Violated the Roman law, and exposed themselves to its
penalty.

Which should have examined him - Who were about to torture him by
scourging him, [Act 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#024).

Because he had bound him - Preparatory to scourging him. The act of
binding a Roman citizen with such an intent, untried and uncondemned,
was unlawful. Prisoners Who were to be scourged were usually bound by
the Romans to a pillar or post; and a Similar custom prevailed among the
Jews. That it was unlawful to bind a man with this intent, who was
uncondemned, appears from an express declaration in Cicero (against
Verres): "It is a heinous sin to bind a Roman citizen; it is wickedness
to beat him; it is next to parricide to kill him, and what Shall I say
to crucify him?"

[Acts 22:30](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">act 22:30</span></span>

On the morrow - After he had arrested Paul. Paul was still a prisoner;
and if suffered to go at liberty among the Jews, his life would have
been in danger.

And commanded the chief priests ... - Summoned a meeting of the
Sanhedrin, or Great Council of the nation. He did this, as he was
prevented from scourging Paul, in order to know what he had done, and
that he might learn from the Jews themselves the nature of the charge
against him. This was necessary for the safety of Paul and for the ends
of justice. This should have been done without any attempt to torture
him in order to extort a confession.

And brought Paul down - From the elevated castle of Antonia. The council
assembled commonly in the house of the high priest.

And set him before them - He brought the prisoner to their bar, that
they might have have an opportunity to accuse him, and that thus the
chief captain might learn the real nature of the charge against him.
