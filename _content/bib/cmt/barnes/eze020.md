### [Ezekiel Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#001)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 20:0</span></span>

The prophecies of this section Eze. 20-23 were delivered nearly a year
after those of the former [Eze 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#001).
Ezekiel in reply to other inquiries from the chieftains of the people,
sets forth their national history, the national judgment, and the hope
of divine mercy. This leads up to the prediction of the kingdom of the
Messiah.

[Ezekiel 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 20:1</span></span>

The elders of Israel - These were as in [Eze
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#001), some of Ezekiel's fellow-exiles,
designated in general terms by the name of Israel, though more properly
belonging to the kingdom of Judah.

[Ezekiel 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 20:3</span></span>

Enquire - As to the hope of deliverance from the Babylonians.

[Ezekiel 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 20:4</span></span>

Wilt thou judge them? - We should rather say, Wilt thou not judge them?
i. e., wilt thou not pronounce sentence upon them? Compare [Eze
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#002).

[Ezekiel 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 20:5</span></span>

The children of Israel in Egypt were warned to abstain from the idolatry
of the pagan. This purpose they lost sight of, yet God spared them and
brought them into another state of probation.

[Eze 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#005)

Lifted up mine hand - i. e., sware, because the hand was lifted up in
adjuration.

[Eze 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#008)

Idols of Egypt - These incidental notices show the children of Israel in
Egypt to have been addicted to idolatry. Compare [Jos
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#014).

[Eze 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#009)

I wrought for my name's sake - Lest it should appear to the Egyptians
that Yahweh was a God who would, but could not, save.

[Ezekiel 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 20:10</span></span>

The probation in the wilderness. The promise was forfeited by those to
whom it was first conditionally made, but was renewed to their children.

[Eze 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#011)

The "statutes" were given on Mount Sinai, and repeated by Moses before
his death ([Exo 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#001) ff; [Deu
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#008)).

In them - Or, through them: and in [Eze
20:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#013).

[Eze 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#012)

See [Exo 31:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#013). The Sabbath was a sign
of a special people, commemorative of the work of creation, and hallowed
to the honor of Yahweh, the covenant-God. As man honored God by keeping
the Sabbath holy, so by the Sabbath, God "sanctified" Israel and marked
them as a holy people. Therefore to profane the Sabbath was to abjure
their Divine Governor.

[Eze 20:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#013)

My sabbaths they greatly polluted - Not by actual non-observance of the
sabbatical rest in the wilderness, but in failing to make the day holy
in deed as well as in name by earnest worship and true heart service.

[Eze 20:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#018)

The book of Deuteronomy contains the address to "the children" of those
who perished in the wilderness. The whole history of Israel was a
repetition of this course. The covenant was made with one generation,
broken by them, and then renewed to the next.

[Eze 20:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#025)

The "judgments whereby they should not live" are those spoken of in [Eze
20:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#018), and are contrasted with the
judgments in [Eze 20:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#013), [Eze
20:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#021), laws other than divine, to
which God gives up those whom He afflicts with judicial blindness,
because they have willfully closed their eyes, [Psa
81:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#012); [Rom
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#024).

[Eze 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#026)

To pass through - The word also means to "set apart," as the firstborn
to the Lord [Exo 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#012). They were
bidden to "set apart" their firstborn males to the Lord. They "caused
them to pass through the fire" to Moloch. An instance of their
perversion of God's laws.

[Ezekiel 20:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">eze 20:27</span></span>

The probation in the land of Canaan from their entry to the day of
Ezekiel.

[Eze 20:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#027)

Yet in this - It was an aggravation of their guilt that they defiled
with idolatry the land given them for their glory.

[Eze 20:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#029)

Bamah - The Hebrew word for "high place." Another instance of the
perversion of God's laws. When the Israelites first entered Canaan they
were to set up the "tabernacle" on a "high place," and upon this and
upon no other they were to worship Yahweh ([Sa1
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#012) ff; [Kg1
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#004)). But the Israelites followed the
custom of the country, and set up idol-worship on every high hill, and
the word "high place" ("Bannah," plural "Bamoth") became a by-word
(compare "Bamoth-Baal," [Jos 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#017)).
"Bamoth" occurs on the Moabitic stone, which records the erection of
high places in honor of Chemosh. The name "Bamah" was thus a brand of
the divine displeasure, and a memorial of the people's guilt.

[Eze 20:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#030), [Eze
20:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#031)

The present state of the people. Those who came to inquire were the
representatives of the whole people though belonging to the exiles.

[Ezekiel 20:32](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">eze 20:32</span></span>

God's future dealings with His people:

\(1\) in judgment [Eze 20:32-38](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#032);

\(2\) in mercy [Eze 20:39-44](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#039).

[Eze 20:32](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#032)

The inquirers had thought that if Jerusalem were taken, and the whole
people became sojourners in a foreign land, they would cease to be a
separate nation. In their love for idolatry some may have even desired
this. But more probably they thought that this very consequence
precluded the possibility of such a catastrophe. God answers that He
will not allow them to become as the pagan, but this will only subject
them to severer trial and stricter rule.

[Eze 20:33](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#033)

The expressions "a mighty hand, stretched out arm" carry back the
thoughts to Egyptian bondage [Deu
4:34](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#034); [Deu
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#015); but then it was for deliverance,
now for judgment "with fury poured out."

[Eze 20:35](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#035)

The wilderness of the people - A time of probation will follow, as
before in the wilderness of Sin, so in the "wilderness of the nations"
among whom they will sojourn (not the Babylonians) "after" that
captivity. This period of their probation is not over. The dispersion of
the Jews did not cease with the return under Zerubbabel; but in our
Saviour's time they were living as a distinct people in all the
principal places in the civilized world; and so they live now. God is
yet pleading with them "face to face," calling them personally to
embrace those offers which as a nation they disregarded.

[Eze 20:37](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#037)

To pass under the rod - i. e., to be gathered into the flock [Mic
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#014).

The bond - The shepherd collects the flock, and separates the sheep from
the goats, which are rejected. Compare [Rom
11:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#007).

[Eze 20:39](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#039)

Strong irony. Some prefer another rendering: "Go ye, serve ye every one
his idols, yet hereafter ye shall surely hearken unto me, and shall no
more pollute My Holy Name etc." In this way, this verse is introductory
to what follows.

[Eze 20:40](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#040)

This points to the consummation indicated by the vision of the temple.

In the mountain of the height - Or, Upon a very high mountain [Eze
40:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#002). Compare [Isa
2:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002).

The house of Israel, all of them - All the separation between Israel and
Judah shall cease. This points to times yet future, when in Messiah's
kingdom Jews and Gentiles alike shall be gathered into one kingdom - the
kingdom of Christ. Jerusalem is the Church of Christ [Gal
4:26](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#026), into which the children of
Israel shall at last be gathered, and so the prophecy shall be fulfilled
[Rev 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#002).

[Ezekiel 20:45](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#045)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">eze 20:45</span></span>

This paragraph is in the Hebrew text, Septuagint and Vulgate the
beginning of Ezek. 21 to which it belongs, as it contains a prophecy
delivered in a form which is there explained. It may, however, be
regarded as a link between the foregoing and following prophecies, being
a general introduction to seven words of judgment about to be pronounced
in development of that which has just been delivered.

[Eze 20:46](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#046)

In this verse occur three Hebrew synonyms for "south," denoting:

\(1\) the region on the right, Teman [Sa1
23:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#024);

\(2\) the region of dryness, Negeb [Jos
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#004);

\(3\) the region of brightness, Darom [Deu
33:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#023).

The variety of terms helps the force of the application. Chebar is in
the north of Babylonia; from the north the Chaldaeans came upon Judaea
(see the [Eze 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#004) note).

[Eze 20:47](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#047)

Forest of the south - The land of Israel. See [Eze
21:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#001).

[Eze 20:49](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#049)

Parables - Compare [Eze 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#002). The
meaning of the prophet was clear enough, if those whom he addressed had
chosen to understand.
