<p>Since the watch of the temple had hitherto been kept by porters, singers, and Levites 1 Chr. 26:1-19, so now the watch of the entire city was committed to men of the same three classes, their experience pointing them out as the most suitable persons. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#002">Nehemiah 7:2</A></p>

<p>My brother Hanani - See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#002">Neh 1:2</A>.
<p>The ruler of the palace - Or, "the governor of the fortress." See the marginal reference note.
<p>He - i. e. Hananiah.

<p>Until the sun be hot - An unusual precaution. The ordinary practice in the East is to open town gates at sunrise.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">neh 7:4</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The people were few - The number of those who returned with Zerubbabel was no more than 42,360 <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#066">Neh 7:66</A>. Less than 2,000 people had come with Ezra Ezra 8:1-20. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#005">Nehemiah 7:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">neh 7:5</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>It is argued by some that the entire catalogue which follows Neh. 7:7-73 is not the register of them "which came up 'at the first'," but of the Jewish people in Nehemiah's time. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#007">Neh 7:7</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#002">Ezr 2:2</A> are, however, very positive in their support of the usual view; and some of the arguments against it are thought to be met by considering the Nehemiah of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#007">Neh 7:7</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#002">Ezr 2:2</A> a person different from Nehemiah the governor; and "Tirshatha" an official title likely to have belonged to others besides Nehemiah (see the <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#063">Ezr 2:63</A> note.) 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#070">Nehemiah 7:70</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_070">neh 7:70</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Compared with <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#069">Ezr 2:69</A> there is considerable difference between the totals for gold, silver, and garments. The usual explanation is that of corruption in the one or the other of the passages.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#073">Neh 7:73</A>
<p>Dwelt in their cities - Nehemiah's quotation from Zerubbabel's register ends here, and the narration of events in Jerusalem in his own day is resumed from <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#003">Neh 7:3</A>. The narrative Neh. 8; 10 appears from internal evidence to be by a different author (see the introduction of the Book of Nehemiah).
<p>The last two clauses of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#073">Neh 7:73</A> should stand as the beginning of Neh. 8 (as in the Septuagint). The text would then run: "And when the seventh month was come, and the children of Israel were in their cities, the whole people gathered themselves together as one man," etc. Compare the margin reference.
