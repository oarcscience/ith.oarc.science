### [2 Chronicles Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 7:1</span></span>

The fire came down from heaven - As in the time of Moses on the
dedication of the tabernacle [Lev 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#024)
The fact is omitted from the narrative of Kings; but omission is not
contradiction.

[2 Chronicles 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch2 7:8</span></span>

Solomon kept the feast - i. e., Solomon kept at this same time, not the
Feast of the Dedication only, but also the Feast of tabernacles. The
former lasted seven days, from the 8th of Tisri to the 15th, the latter
also seven days, from the 15th to the 22nd. On the day following the
people were dismissed [Ch2 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#010).

[2 Chronicles 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 7:11</span></span>

The narrative now runs parallel with [Kg1
9:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#001), but is more full, and presents
less of verbal agreement. [Ch2 7:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#013)
are additional to the earlier record.

[2 Chronicles 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch2 7:12</span></span>

An house of sacrifice - This expression does not elsewhere occur. Its
meaning, however, is clear. God declares that Solomon's Temple is the
place whereunto all Israelites were commanded to bring their
burnt-offerings and sacrifices (see [Deu
12:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#005)).

[2 Chronicles 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch2 7:15</span></span>

The prayer that is made in this place - literally, as in the margin. The
unsual phrase includes the two cases of prayers offered in [Ch2
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#024) and toward [Ch2
6:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#034), [Ch2
6:38](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#038) the sanctuary.
