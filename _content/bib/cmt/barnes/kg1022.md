### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#001)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 22:1</span></span>

Three years - These must be counted from the close of the second
campaign of Ben-hadad [Kg1 20:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#034). They
were not full years, as is evident from the next verse. Probably the
first year is that of Ben-hadad's dismissal after his defeat; the second
is a year of actual peace; while the third is that in which Jehoshaphat
paid his visit, and the Ramoth-Gilead expedition took place. The pause,
here noticed, in the war between Israel and Syria was perhaps the result
of a common danger. It was probably in the year following Ben-hadad's
dismissal by Ahab, that the first great Assyrian expedition took place
into these parts. Shalmaneser II relates that on his first invasion of
southern Syria, he was met by the combined forces of Ben-hadad, Ahab,
the king of Hamath, the kings of the Hittites, and others, who gave him
battle, but suffered a defeat.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg1 22:2</span></span>

This visit indicates an entire change in the relations which we have
hitherto found subsisting between the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. The
common danger to which the two kingdoms were exposed from the growing
power of Syria had probably induced them to forget their differences.
Jehoshaphat's eldest son, Jehoram, was married to Athaliah, the daughter
of Ahab: but apparently the bond between the two families had not
hitherto led to any very close intimacy, much less to any joint military
expeditions. Jehoshaphat seems to have taken no part in the former
Syrian wars of Ahab, nor did he join in the great league against the
Assyrians ([Kg1 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#001) note). His visit
now was probably one of mere friendliness, without any political object.
Ahab, however, turned the visit to political advantage. From this time
until the displacement of Ahab's dynasty by Jehu, very intimate
relations subsisted between the two kingdoms ([Kg1
22:49](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#049); [Kg2
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#007); [Kg2
8:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#028); [Ch2
20:36](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#036), etc.).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg1 22:3</span></span>

By the terms of Ahab's covenant with Ben-hadad, Ramoth in Gilead ought,
long ere this, to have been restored [Kg1
20:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#034). Hence, the claim "is ours," i.
e., "it belongs to us of right though the Syrians still hold possession
of it."

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg1 22:4</span></span>

Ahab, well aware of the military strength of Syria, and feeling that he
cannot now expect divine aid [Kg1
20:42](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#042); [Kg1
21:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#021), asks the aid of Jehoshaphat,
whose military resources were very great [Ch2
17:12-19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#012). Jehoshaphat's answer is one
of complete acquiescence, without reserve of any kind (compare [Ch2
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#003)). Jehoshaphat was afterward
rebuked for thus consenting to "help the ungodly" [Ch2
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#002). He probably acted not merely
from complaisance, but from a belief that the interests of his own
kingdom would be advanced by the step which he agreed to take. The power
of Syria was at this time very menacing.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg1 22:5</span></span>

Jehoshaphat, with characteristic piety [Kg1
22:43](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#043) takes advantage of his position
as Ahab's friend and ally, to suggest inquiry of the Lord (Yahweh)
before the expedition is undertaken. Lest Ahab should consent in word
and put off the inquiry in act, he asks to have the prophets called in
at once: "today."

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg1 22:6</span></span>

The prophets - i. e., In all probability the prophets attached to the
worship of the calves; not real prophets of Yahweh. This seems evident
both from Jehoshaphat's dissatisfaction [Kg1
22:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#007), and from the strong antagonism
apparent between the true Yahweh-prophet Micaiah, and these self-styled
"prophets of the Lord" [Kg1 22:22-25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#022).

The Lord shall deliver it - In the Hebrew the word here used for "Lord"
is אדני 'ǎdonāy. Later (i. e., in [Kg1
22:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#011)) Lord or יהוה yehovâh is
used. It would seem as if the idolatrous prophets shrank from employing
the latter title until they found that Jehoshaphat insisted on learning
the will of Yahweh in the matter.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg1 22:7</span></span>

Jehoshaphat was dissatisfied. These men - creatures of Ahab, tainted
with the worship of calves if not with Baal-worship - had promised
victory, but not in the name of Yahweh. Jehoshaphat, therefore, asked,
"Is there not here a true prophet of Yahweh besides these 400 professed
prophets?"

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg1 22:8</span></span>

There is yet one man, Micaiah - Elijah, it appears, had withdrawn again
after the events of the last chapter, and there was no known prophet of
Yahweh within reach of Samaria except Micaiah.

He doth not prophesy good concerning me but evil - Whether the tradition
in [Kg1 20:41](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#041) note be true or not, it
is certain that Ahab had imprisoned him [Kg1
22:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#026), and probable that the
imprisonment was on account of threatening prophecies. Ahab suggests to
Jehoshaphat that Micaiah is one who allows his private feelings to
determine the utterances which he delivers as if from Yahweh. Hence, the
force of Jehoshaphat's answer, "Let not the king say so;" i. e., "Let
not the king suppose that a prophet would be guilty of such impiety," -
an impiety from which even Balaam shrank [Num
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#018).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg1 22:9</span></span>

An officer - More properly, as in the margin, "a eunuch." Eunuchs seem
to have been first introduced among the Israelites by David ([Ch1
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#001) note). They were a natural
accompaniment of the seraglio of Solomon. The present passage is the
first which shows that, after the separation of the kingdom, the kings
of Israel employed them (compare [Kg2
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#006); [Kg2
9:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#032)).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg1 22:10</span></span>

Sat each on his throne - Or, "were sitting." They had removed from the
banquet [Ch2 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#002) to the void place,
or empty space at the entrance of the gate [Rut
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#001); [Sa2
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#002), where Ahab daily sat to hear
complaints and decide causes. Each was seated upon his throne, the
Oriental kings having portable thrones, which they took with them upon
their journeys.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg1 22:11</span></span>

Horns of iron - The horn in Scripture is the favorite symbol of power;
and pushing with the horn is a common metaphor for attacking and
conquering enemies (see [Deu 33:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#017);
Compare [Psa 44:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#005); [Dan
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#004)). Zedekiah, in employing a
symbolic action, was following the example of a former Israelite prophet
[Kg1 11:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#030).

Thus saith the Lord - Or, יהוה yehovâh. Zedekiah lays aside the
unmeaningful "Lord" אדני 'ǎdonāy of the general company of Israelite
prophets [Kg1 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#006), and professes to
have a direct message from Yahweh to Ahab. He may have believed his own
words, for the "lying spirit" [Kg1
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#022) may have seemed to him a
messenger from Yahweh. All the rest followed his example [Kg1
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#012).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg1 22:13</span></span>

And the messenger spake unto him ... - There seems to have been a
widespread notion among the irreligious and the half-religious of the
ancient world, that their prophets were not the mere mouth-pieces of the
god, but that they were persons who had power with the god, and could
compel, or at least induce, Him to work their will (compare [Num
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#010); [Isa
30:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#010)). They saw that the prophet's
word was accomplished; they did not understand that if he falsified his
message the accomplishment would no longer follow.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg1 22:14</span></span>

Micaiah, as a true prophet of Yahweh, of course rejected the counsel
offered him, which he felt to be at once wicked and foolish. Compare
also the resolution of Balaam, marginal reference.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg1 22:15</span></span>

And he answered him ... - Micaiah speaks the exact words of the 400 in
so mocking and ironical a tone, that the king cannot mistake his
meaning, or regard his answer as serious. The king's rejoinder implies
that this mocking manner was familiar to Micaiah, who had used it in
some former dealings with the Israelite monarch. Hence, in part, the
king's strong feeling of dislike (compare [Kg1
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#008)).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg1 22:17</span></span>

Thus adjured, Micaiah wholly changes his tone. Ahab cannot possibly
mistake the meaning of his vision, especially as the metaphor of "sheep
and shepherd" for king and people was familiar to the Israelites from
the prayer of Moses [Num 27:17](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#017).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg1 22:18</span></span>

See [Kg1 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#008). Ahab implies that he
believes Micaiah to have spoken out of pure malevolence, without any
authority for his prediction from God. By implication he invites
Jehoshaphat to disregard this pseudo-prophecy, and to put his trust in
the unanimous declaration of the 400. Micaiah, therefore, proceeds to
explain the contradiction between himself and the 400, by recounting
another vision.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg1 22:19</span></span>

David's Psalms had familiarised the Israelites with Yahweh sitting upon
a throne in the heavens ([Psa 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#007);
[Psa 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#004); [Psa
45:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#006); [Psa
103:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#019), etc.); but to be allowed to
see in vision the ineffable glory of the Almighty thus seated, was a
rare favor. It was granted to Isaiah, to Daniel (marginal references),
to Ezekiel [Eze 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#026), and in Christian
times to Stephen [Act 7:56](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#056), and John
[Rev 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#002).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg1 22:21</span></span>

A spirit - "The spirit " - which some explain as "the evil spirit" - i.
e. Satan; others as simply "the spirit" who should "persuade."

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg1 22:22</span></span>

The difficulties which attach to this passage are considerable. On the
one hand, it is hard to suppose one of the holy Angels a "lying spirit;"
on the other, hard to find Satan, or an evil spirit, included among "the
host of heaven" [Kg1 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#019) and acting
as the minister of God. Still, [Job
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#006); [Job
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#001), lend countenance to the latter
point, and [Th2 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#011) to the former.
But it may be doubted whether we ought to take literally, and seek to
interpret exactly, each statement of the present narrative. Visions of
the invisible world can only be a sort of parables; revelations, not of
the truth as it actually is, but of so much of the truth as can be shown
through such a medium. The details of a vision, therefore, cannot safely
be pressed, anymore than the details of a parable. Portions of each must
be accommodations to human modes of thought, and may very inadequately
express the realities which they are employed to shadow forth to us.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg1 22:24</span></span>

Smote Micaiah on the cheek - As Micaiah had been brought from prison
[Kg1 22:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#026), it is probable that his
hands were bound.

The prophet, thus standing before the great ones of the earth, bound and
helpless, bearing testimony to the truth, and for his testimony smitten
on the face by an underling, whose blow he receives without either shame
or anger, is a notable type of our Lord before Caiaphas suffering the
same indignity.

Which way ... - Zedekiah's meaning may perhaps be expounded as follows:

"The Spirit of Yahweh certainly came to me, and inspired me with the
answer which I gave. If He afterward went to thee, as thou sayest that
He did, perhaps thou canst tell us - as all the secrets of the invisible
world are, thou pretendest, open to thee - which way He took."

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg1 22:25</span></span>

Micaiah addresses himself not so much to Zedekiah's question, as to the
main point which lies in dispute - which of them, namely, is a true
prophet. "When the news, i. e., of Ahab's death, caused by his following
thy counsels, reaches Samaria, and thou hast to hide thyself from the
vengeance of Ahaziah or Jezebel, then, in that day, thou wilt know
whether I or thou be the true prophet."

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg1 22:26</span></span>

Carry him back - literally, "cause him to return." Micaiah had been in
custody before, and was brought by Ahab's messenger from his prison.

The governor of the city - This is one out of several notices respecting
what may be called the "constitution" of the Israelite kingdom. The king
consulted on important matters a Council of elders [Kg1
20:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#007). The general administration was
carried on by means of the governors of provinces [Kg1
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#014) and of cities [Kg2
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#005). The governors of cities, like
the monarch, were assisted and checked by councils of elders, the wise
men of the several towns [Kg1 21:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#008);
[Kg2 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#005). Thus Samaria, as we see
from the present passage, was under a special governor, who, among his
other duties, had the control of the public prison, and directed the
treatment of the prisoners.

The king's son - The phrase seems to designate a state office, rather
than relationship to the sovereign. Compare [Ch2
28:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#007).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg1 22:27</span></span>

Feed him with bread of affliction ... - Micaiah is to be once more put
in prison, but, in order to punish him for his uncomplying spirit, upon
a poorer and scantier diet than he had been previously allowed. This is
to continue until Ahab returns in peace. Ahab introduces this expression
purposely, in order to show his entire disbelief of Micaiah's prophecy.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg1 22:29</span></span>

It might have been expected that Jehoshaphat would have withdrawn from
the expedition when he heard Micaiah denounce it. He had, however,
rashly committed himself to take part in the war by a solemn promise,
before he bethought himself of inquiring what was the will of God in the
matter. Now he was ashamed to draw back, especially as Ahab, whom the
prophecy chiefly threatened, was resolved to brave it. He may also have
had a personal affection for Ahab, and so have been loth to desert him
in his need. Compare [Ch2 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#002).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">kg1 22:30</span></span>

I will disguise myself - Ahab had probably heard of Ben-hadad's order to
his captains [Kg1 22:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#031).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">kg1 22:31</span></span>

Commanded - "Had commanded." Ben-hadad delivers his order in the
hyperbolical style common in the East. His meaning is, "Make it your
chief object to kill or take the king of Israel." Apparently, his own
defeat and captivity were still rankling in his mind, and he wished to
retaliate on Ahab, the humiliation which he considered himself to have
suffered. He shows small appreciation of the generosity which had spared
his life and restored him to his kingdom.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">kg1 22:32</span></span>

Surely it is the king of Israel - This was a natural supposition, as
Jehoshaphat alone wore royal robes.

And Jehoshaphat cried out - Jehoshaphat called to his men for help,
using perhaps his own special battle-cry, which would be distinct from
that of Ahab, and would probably be known to the Syrians.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">kg1 22:34</span></span>

At a venture - literally, as in the margin, i. e. without intent to kill
the king.

Between the joints of the harness - literally, as in the margin. The
"joints" were probably pieces of armor which attached the breast-plate
to the helmet or to the greaves. The arrow entered between the
breastplate and one of these "joints." breastplates made of metal scales
were common both in Egypt and Assyria.

Turn thine hand - literally, "turn thy hands." The driver of a chariot,
both in Egypt and Assyria, held the reins with his two hands.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">kg1 22:35</span></span>

The battle increased - See the margin; i. e. the tide of battle rose
higher. Compare [Isa 8:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#007).

The king was stayed up in his chariot - The king's wound made it
impossible for him to remain standing without help; he therefore had
himself supported in his chariot by attendants, in order that his
soldiers might not lose heart, as they would be sure to do, if they knew
of his peril. Ahab must not be denied the credit of right princely
fortitude on this occasion.

The midst of the chariot - literally, as in the margin. The "bosom" of
the chariot is the rounded front, with the portion of the standing board
that adjoined it. Here the blood would naturally collect, forming a
pool, in which the king and his charioteer must have stood.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">kg1 22:36</span></span>

About the going down of the sun - i. e. as soon as Ahab was dead. The
abandonment of the expedition and dispersion of the army on the death of
the king is thoroughly Oriental.

The Septuagint version reads [Kg1
22:36-37](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#036), "Every man to his city, and
every man to his own country, for the king is dead: And they came to
Samaria," etc.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">kg1 22:38</span></span>

They washed his armour - Rather, "the harlots bathed in it." The "pool
of Samaria," which was stained with Ahab's blood by the washing of his
chariot in it, was, according to Josephus, the usual bathing-place of
the Samaritan harlots. A large tank or reservoir, probably identical
with this pool, still remains on the slope of the hill of Samaria,
immediately outside the walls.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:39](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">kg1 22:39</span></span>

The ivory house - So called from the character of its ornamentation.
Ivory was largely used in the ancient world as a covering of wood-work,
and seems to have been applied, not only to furniture, but to the doors
and walls of houses.

Nothing is known of the cities built by Ahab; but the fact is important
as indicating the general prosperity of the country in his time, and his
own activity as a ruler. Prosperity, it is plain, may for a while
co-exist with causes - such as, the decay of religions - which are
sapping the vital power of a nation, and leading it surely, if slowly,
to destruction.

The book of the chronicles ... - See above, [Kg1
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#019); [Kg1
15:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#031); [Kg1
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#005), [Kg1
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#014), [Kg1
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#020), [Kg1
16:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#027).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:41](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">kg1 22:41</span></span>

The writer returns to the history of the kingdom of Judah (connect this
verse with [Kg1 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#024)), sketching
briefly a reign much more fully given by the writer of Chronicles 2 Chr.

On the general piety of Asa, see above, [Kg1
15:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#011) and references. Jehoshaphat
seems to have been a still better king, for he did not, like Asa, fall
away in his old age [Ch2 16:2-12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#002).

The high places were not taken away - This seems to contradict [Ch2
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#006). Probably the writer of
Chronicles refers to the desire and intention of the monarch, while the
author of Kings records the practical failure of his efforts.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">kg1 22:44</span></span>

This refers probably to an early period in Jehoshaphat's reign - about
his eighth or his ninth year - when he closed the long series of wars
between the two kingdoms by a formal peace, perhaps at once cemented by
a marriage between Jehoram and Athaliah ([Kg1
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#002) note).

The book of the chronicles ... - Compare [Kg1
22:39](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#039) note. The biographer of
Jehoshaphat appears to have been Jehu, the son of Hanani [Ch2
20:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#034).

In the time of Solomon, Hadad [Kg1
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#014), according to the Septuagint,
"reigned over Edom." It appears by the present passage that the country
had been again reduced either by Jehoshaphat, or by an earlier king, and
was dependent on the kingdom of Judah, being governed by a "deputy" or
viceroy, who, however, was allowed the royal title (compare [Kg2
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#009), [Kg2
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#012), [Kg2
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#026)). This government of dependencies
by means of subject-kings was the all but universal practice in the East
down to the time of Cyrus (the [Kg1
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#021) note).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:48](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#048)

The expression, "ships of Tharshish," probably designates ships of a
particular class, ships (i. e.) like those with which the Phoenicians
used to trade to Tharshish (Tartessus, [Kg1
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#022) note). Compare the use of
"India-man" for a vessel of a certain class. Jehoshaphat's fleet was
constructed at Ezion-Gaber, on the Red Sea [Ch2
20:36](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#036), where Solomon had previously
built a navy [Kg1 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#026). Being
lord-paramount of Edom, Jehoshaphat had the right of using this harbor.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:49](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#049)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">kg1 22:49</span></span>

[Ch2 20:35-36](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#035), explains that the two
kings conjointly built the fleet with which the Ophir trade ([Kg1
9:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#028) note) was to be re-opened.
Ahaziah had thus an interest in the ships; and when they were wrecked,
attributing, as it would seem, the calamity to the unskillfulness of his
ally's mariners, he proposed that the fleet should be manned in part by
Israelite sailors - men probably accustomed to the sea, perhaps trained
at Tyre. This proposal Jehoshaphat refused, either offended at the
reflection on his subjects' skill, or accepting the wreck of the ships,
which Eliezer had prophesied, as a proof that God was against the entire
undertaking.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">kg1 22:51</span></span>

Two years - According to our reckoning, not much more than a
twelve-month year.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">kg1 22:52</span></span>

In the way of his mother - In this phrase, which does not occur anywhere
else, we see the strong feeling of the writer as to the influence of
Jezebel (compare [Kg1 16:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#031)).

Verses [Kg1 22:51-53](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#051). It would be of
advantage if these verses were transferred to the Second Book of Kings,
which would thus open with the commencement of Ahaziah's reign. The
division of the books does not proceed from the author. See the
introduction to the Book of Kings
