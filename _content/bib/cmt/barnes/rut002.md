### [Ruth Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#001)

[Ruth 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rut 2:1</span></span>

A kinsman - More literally "an acquaintance"; here (and in the feminine,
[Rut 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#002)) denoting the person with
whom one is intimately acquainted, one's near relation. The next kinsman
of [Rut 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#020), etc. גאל gā'al, is a
wholly different word.

Boaz - Commonly taken to mean, "strength is in him" (compare [Kg1
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#021)).

[Ruth 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rut 2:7</span></span>

The house - The shed or booth where they took their meals, and were
sheltered from the sun in the heat of the day (see [Gen
33:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#017)).

[Ruth 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rut 2:8</span></span>

The grammatical forms of the verbs "go hence" and "abide," are unique
and Chaldaic. They are supposed to indicate the dialect used at
Bethlehem in the time of Boaz.

[Ruth 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rut 2:9</span></span>

After them - i. e. "after my maidens." The fields not being divided by
hedges, but only by unplowed ridges, it would be easy for her to pass
off Boaz's land without being aware of it, and so find herself among
strangers where Boaz could not protect her.

[Ruth 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rut 2:10</span></span>

She fell on her face - With Oriental reverence (compare [Gen
33:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#003), and the marginal reference).

[Ruth 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rut 2:12</span></span>

The similarity of expression here to [Gen
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#001), and in [Rut
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#011) to [Gen
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#001), makes it probable that Boaz had
the case of Abraham in his mind.

The Lord God of Israel - "Jehovah the God of Israel." Compare [Jos
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#014), where, as here, the force of
the addition, the God of Israel, lies in the person spoken of being a
foreigner (see [Jdg 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#021) note).

[Ruth 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rut 2:14</span></span>

To dip the morsel, or sop, whether it were bread or meat, in the dish
containing the vinegar (compare [Mat
26:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#023); [Mar
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#020) : [Exo
25:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#029); [Num
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#013)) was, and still is, the common
custom in the East.

Parched or "roasted" corn - Grain was the common food of the country
then (compare [Sa1 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#017); [Sa1
25:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#018); [Sa2
17:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#028)) as it is now.

And left - Or "reserved" [Rut 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#018).
Rather, "had some over" (compare [Luk
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#017)). [Rut
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#018) tells us that she took to her
mother-in-law what she had left over.

[Ruth 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rut 2:17</span></span>

And beat out that she had gleaned - Namely, with a stick, as the word
implies (compare [Deu 24:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#020); [Isa
27:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#012)). This method is still commonly
practiced. Ruth gleaned enough to support herself and her mother-in-law
for five days [Exo 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#016).

[Ruth 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rut 2:20</span></span>

Blessed be he of the Lord ... - We may gather from Naomi's allusion to
the dead that both her husband and son had been faithful servants of
Jehovah, the God of Israel. His kindness to the dead consisted in
raising up (as Naomi hoped) an heir to perpetuate the name; and, in
general, in His care for their widows.

One of our next kinsmen - The word here is גאל gā'al, the redeemer, who
had the right:

\(1\) of redeeming the inheritance of the person;

\(2\) of marrying the widow;

\(3\) of avenging the death. (See [Lev
25:25-31](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#025), [Lev
25:47-55](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#047); [Deu
25:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#005); [Deu
19:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#001).)

Since these rights belonged to the next of kin, גאל gā'al came to mean
the nearest kinsman.
