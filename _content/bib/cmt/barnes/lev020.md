### [Leviticus Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#001)

[Leviticus 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 20:1</span></span>

The crimes which are condemned in Lev. 18; 19 on purely spiritual
ground, have here special punishments allotted to them as offences
against the well-being of the nation.

[Leviticus 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lev 20:2</span></span>

Molech, literally, "the King", called also Moloch, Milcom, and Malcham,
was known in later times as "the abomination of the Ammonites" [Kg1
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#005). He appears to have been the
fire-god of the eastern nations; related to, and sometimes made
identical with, Baal, the sun-god. The nature of the rite and of the
impious custom called passing children through the fire to Molech is
very doubtful. The practices appear to have been essentially connected
with magical arts, probably also with unlawful lusts, and with some
particular form of profane swearing. The rite in the time of Moses
belonged to the region rather of magic than of definite idolatrous
worship, and may have been practiced as a lustral charm, or
fire-baptism, for the children of incest and adultery.

[Lev 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#002)

Stone him with stones - The commonest form of capital punishment. It was
probably preferred as being the one in which the execution was the act
of the whole congregation.

[Lev 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#003)

Defile my sanctuary - i. e. pollute the people as identified with their
sanctuary.

[Leviticus 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lev 20:14</span></span>

The burning under the sentence of the Law took place after the death of
the criminal by stoning, or strangling. [Jos
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#025).

[Leviticus 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">lev 20:17</span></span>

Cut off ... - See [Exo 31:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#014) note. The
more full expression here used probably refers to some special form of
public excommunication, accompanied, it may be, by expulsion from the
camp.

[Leviticus 20:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">lev 20:20</span></span>

They shall die childless - Either the offspring should not be regarded
as lawfully theirs, nor be entitled to any hereditary privileges, or
they should have no blessing in their children.

[Leviticus 20:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">lev 20:22</span></span>

The ground is here again stated on which all these laws of holiness
should be obeyed. See [Lev 18:24-30](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#024)
note.

[Lev 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#024)

Compare the margin reference.

[Lev 20:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#025), [Lev
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#026)

The distinction between clean and unclean for the whole people, and not
for any mere section of it, was one great typical mark of "the kingdom
of priests, the holy nation." See the [Lev
11:42](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#042) note.

[Lev 20:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#025)

Any manner of living thing that creepeth - Rather, any creeping thing;
that is, any vermin. See [Lev
11:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#020). The reference in this verse
is to dead animals, not to the creatures when alive.
