### [Judges Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#001)

[Judges 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 2:1</span></span>

The angel of the Lord (not an angel). - The phrase is used nearly 60
times to designate the Angel of God's presence. See [Gen
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#007) note. In all cases where "the
angel of the Lord" delivers a message, he does it as if God Himself were
speaking, without the intervening words "Thus saith the Lord," which are
used in the case of prophets. (Compare [Jdg
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#008); [Jos
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#002).)

When the host of Israel came up from Gilgal in the plain of Jericho,
near the Jordan [Jos 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#019) to Shiloh
and Shechem, in the hill country of Ephraim, the Angel who had been with
them at Gilgal [Exo 23:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#020); [Exo
33:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#001); [Jos
5:10-15](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#010) accompanied them. The mention
of Gilgal thus fixes the transaction to the period soon after the
removal of the camp from Gilgal, and the events recorded in Judg. 1:1-36
(of which those related in Judg. 1:1-29 took place before, and those in
[Jdg 1:30-36](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#030), just after that
removal). It also shows that it was the conduct of the Israelites,
recorded in Judg. 1 as in [Jos
16:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#001); 17, which provoked this
rebuke.

[Judges 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jdg 2:2</span></span>

The two articles of the covenant here specified (compare margin
references) are those which the Israelites had at this time broken. The
other important prohibition [Deu 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#003)
is not specified by the Angel, and this is an indication that at the
time the Angel spoke, intermarriages with the pagan spoken of [Jdg
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#006) had not taken place; and this
again is another evidence of the early date of this occurrence.

[Judges 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jdg 2:3</span></span>

"Wherefore I also said" - Rather because ye have done the things
mentioned in [Jdg 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#002), "I have now
said (i. e. I now protest and declare) that I will not drive them out
from before you" (compare [Jdg 19:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#029)).
And it was the annonncement of this resolution by the Angel that caused
the people to weep.

The word thorns in this verse is supplied by the King James Version from
the similar passage in Joshua (see the marginal reference). Other
versions adopt a different reading of the original text, and prefer the
sense "they shall be to you for adversaries" (compare the last words of
[Num 33:55](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#055)).

[Judges 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jdg 2:5</span></span>

Bochim - i. e. weepers. It was near Shechem, but the site is unknown.
Compare the names given to places for similar reasons in [Gen
35:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#008); [Gen
50:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#011).

[Judges 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jdg 2:7</span></span>

If Joshua was about 80 at the entrance into Canaan, 30 years would bring
us to the close of his life. The "elders" would be all that were old
enough to take part in the wars of Canaan [Jdg
3:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#001); and therefore, reckoning from
the age of 20 to 70, a period of about 50 years may be assigned from the
entrance into Canaan to the death of the elders, or 20 years after the
death of Joshua.

The great works of the Lord - The overthrow of the Canaanite nations.

[Judges 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jdg 2:8</span></span>

The servant of the Lord - This is a title especially given to Moses [Deu
34:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#005); [Jos
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001). In later books, the phrase "the
servant of God" is used [Ch1 6:49](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#049);
[Neh 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#029); [Dan
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#011); [Rev
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#003). It is applied to Joshua only
here and in [Jos 24:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#029). It is spoken
of David (Ps. 18, title), and generally of the prophets; and, like the
analogous phrase, "man of God," is transferred by Paul to the ministers
of Christ under the New Testament [Ti2
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#024); [Jam
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#001).

[Judges 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jdg 2:10</span></span>

All that generation - i. e. the main body of those who were grown-up men
at the time of the conquest of Canaan.

[Judges 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jdg 2:11</span></span>

And the children of Israel - Here begins the narrative of what really
did happen "after the death of Joshua," but of which Judg. 1 conveys no
hint. Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua [Jdg
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#007). But when Joshua was dead ... "the
children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord, and served Baalim,
and forsook the God of their fathers." And then follows from [Jdg
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#014) to the end of the chapter, a
summary of the whole contents of the book.

Did evil in the sight of the Lord - Through this book and all the
historical books, this is the regular phrase for falling into idolatry.
It occurs seven times in Judges, as descriptive of the seven apostasies
of Israel, which drew down upon them the seven servitudes under

\(1\) Chushan-Rishathaim,

\(2\) Eglon,

\(3\) Jabin,

\(4\) Midian,

\(5\) the tyranny of Abimelech,

\(6\) the Ammonites,

\(7\) the Philistines.

The recurrence of the phrase marks the hand of one author and of one
book. For the opposite phrase, see [Kg1
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#005), [Kg1
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#011), etc.

The plural of Baal, "Baalim," refers to the numerous images of Baal
which they set up and worshipped, as does the plural form, "Ashtaroth"
[Jdg 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#013), to those of the female
divinity, Astarte.

[Judges 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jdg 2:12</span></span>

Provoked the Lord to anger - A frequent expression in connection with
idolatry, especially in Deuteronomy, in the Books of the Kings, and in
Jeremiah.

[Judges 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jdg 2:14</span></span>

Consult the marginal references. The phrase, "he sold them into the
hands etc.," is first found in [Deu
32:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#030).

[Judges 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jdg 2:16</span></span>

Nevertheless - (rather "and") the Lord raised up judges This is the
first introduction of the term judge, which gives its name to the book.
(See the introduction to the Book of Judges.)

[Judges 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jdg 2:18</span></span>

It repented the Lord - Rather, "the Lord was moved with compassion," or
"was grieved," "because of their groanings." (Compare [Jdg
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#015).)

[Judges 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jdg 2:20</span></span>

This verse is connected with [Jdg
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#013). The intermediate verses refer to
much later times; they have the appearance of being the reflections of
the compiler interspersed with the original narrative. But [Jdg
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#020) catches up the thread only to let
it fall immediately. All that follows, down to the end of [Jdg
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#007), seems to be another digression,
closing with words like those of [Jdg
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#013).

It does not appear how this message was given to Israel, whether by
Angel, or prophet, or Urim, nor indeed is it certain whether any message
was given. The words may be understood as merely explaining what passed
through the divine mind, and expressing the thoughts which regulated the
divine proceeding.
