### [Proverbs Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#001)

[Proverbs 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 8:1</span></span>

A companion picture to that in Prov. 7, and serving in some measure to
generalize and idealize it. Wisdom also calls [Pro
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#005) to the "simple" and the "fools,"
and they have to choose between her voice and that of the temptress.

[Proverbs 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 8:2</span></span>

The full enumeration of localities points to the publicity and openness
of Wisdom's teaching (see [Pro 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#020)
note), as contrasted with the stealth and secrecy and darkness which
shroud the harlot's enticements [Pro
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#009).

[Proverbs 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 8:4</span></span>

Men ... sons of man - The two words are used, which, like viri and
homines, describe the higher and the lower, the stronger and the weaker.
Compare the [Psa 49:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#002) note.

[Proverbs 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 8:6</span></span>

Excellent - literally, "princely things." The word is not the same as in
marginal reference, and is elsewhere always used of persons (compare
"captain" in [Sa1 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#016); [Sa2
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#002)). The poetic style of this part of
the book applies it here to the things taught, or to the character of
the teaching.

[Proverbs 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 8:8</span></span>

Words of the ideal Wisdom, which find their highest fulfillment in that
of the Incarnate Word. Compare [Luk
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#022); [Mat
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#019).

[Proverbs 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 8:12</span></span>

Wisdom first speaks warnings ([Pro
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#024) note), next promises ([Pro
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#001) note); but here she neither
promises nor threatens, but speaks of her own excellence. "Prudence" is
the "subtilty" (see the margin), the wiliness of the serpent [Gen
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#001), in itself neutral, but capable of
being turned to good as well as evil. Wisdom, occupied with things
heavenly and eternal, also "dwells with" the practical tact and insight
needed for the life of common men. "Witty inventions" are rather
counsels. The truth intended is, that all special rules for the details
of life spring out of the highest Wisdom as their source.

[Proverbs 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 8:15</span></span>

Not only the common life of common men, but the exercise of the highest
sovereignty, must have this Wisdom as its ground. Compare with this
passage [Pro 8:15-21](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#015) the teaching of
[Kg1 3:5-14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#005). The word rendered
"princes" [Pro 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#015) is different from
that in [Pro 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#016); the first might,
perhaps, be rendered "rulers."

[Proverbs 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 8:18</span></span>

Durable riches - i. e., Treasure piled up for many years; ancient
wealth.

[Proverbs 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 8:19</span></span>

Gold - The "choice, fine gold" of margin reference. The "fine gold" in
the second clause is a different word, and perhaps represents gold
extracted from the ore.

[Proverbs 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 8:22</span></span>

A verse which has played an important part in the history of Christian
dogma. Wisdom reveals herself as preceding all creation, stamped upon it
all, one with God, yet in some way distinguishable from Him as the
object of His love [Pro 8:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#030). John
declares that all which Wisdom here speaks of herself was true in its
highest sense of the Word that became flesh [Joh
1:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001) : just as Apostles afterward
applied Wisd. 7:22-30 to Christ (compare [Col
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015); [Heb
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003)).

Possessed - The word has acquired a special prominence in connection
with the Arian controversy. The meaning which it usually bears is that
of "getting" [Gen 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#001), "buying" [Gen
47:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#022), "possessing" [Jer
32:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#015). In this sense one of the oldest
divine names was that of "Possessor of heaven and earth" [Gen
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#019), [Gen
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#022). But the idea of thus "getting"
or "possessing" involved, as a divine act in relation to the universe,
the idea of creation, and thus in one or two passages the word might be
rendered, though not accurately, by "created" (e. g., [Psa
139:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#013)). It would seem accordingly as
if the Greek translators of the Old Testament oscillated between the two
meanings; and in this passage we find the various renderings ἔκτισε
ektise "created" (Septuagint), and ἐκτήσατο ektēsato "possessed"
(Aquila). The text with the former word naturally became one of the
stock arguments of the Arians against the eternal co-existence of the
Son, and the other translation was as vehemently defended by the
orthodox fathers. Athanasius receiving ἔκτισεν ektisen, took it in the
sense of appointing, and saw in the Septuagint a declaration that the
Father had made the Son the "chief," the "head," the "sovereign," over
all creation. There does not seem indeed any ground for the thought of
creation either in the meaning of the root, or in the general usage of
the word. What is meant in this passage is that we cannot think of God
as ever having been without Wisdom. She is "as the beginning of His
ways." So far as the words bear upon Christian dogma, they accord with
the words of [Joh 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001), "the Word was
with God." The next words indeed assert priority to all the works of
God, from the first starting point of time.

[Proverbs 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 8:23</span></span>

I was set up - Rather, "I was anointed" (compare [Psa
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#006) margin: [Ch2
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#015)). The image is that of Wisdom
anointed, as at her birth, with "the oil of gladness."

Or ever the earth was - literally, "from the times before the earth."

[Proverbs 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 8:24</span></span>

Compare Gen. 1; Job 22; [Job 26:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#001);
38: A world of waters, "great deeps" lying in darkness, this was the
picture of the remotest time of which man could form any conception, and
yet the co-existence of the uncreated Wisdom with the eternal Yahweh was
before that.

[Proverbs 8:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">pro 8:25</span></span>

Compare [Psa 90:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#002). What the Psalmist
said of Yahweh, the teacher here asserts of Wisdom; she was before the
everlasting hills.

[Proverbs 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">pro 8:26</span></span>

The highest part of the dust of the world - literally, "the head of the
dusts of the world;" an image of either:

\(1\) the dry land, habitable, fit for cultivation, as contrasted with
the waters of the chaotic deep; or

\(2\) man himself. Compare [Ecc 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#020).

[Proverbs 8:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 8:27</span></span>

A compass - Better as in the margin and [Job
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#014) (see the note), i. e., the great
vault of heaven stretched over the deep seas.

[Proverbs 8:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">pro 8:30</span></span>

As one brought up with him - i. e., As his foster child. Others take the
word in the original in another sense, "I was as his artificer," a
rendering which falls in best with the special point of the whole
passage, the creative energy of Wisdom. Compare Wisdom [Pro
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#021), [Pro
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#022).

Daily - Heb. "day by day." As the Creator rejoiced in His workmanship
[Gen 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#004), [Gen
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#010), [Gen
1:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#012), so Wisdom rejoiced in the
exuberance of her might and strength.

[Proverbs 8:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">pro 8:31</span></span>

Wisdom rejoices yet more in the world as inhabited by God's rational
creatures. (compare [Isa 45:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#018)).
Giving joy and delight to God, she finds her delight among the sons of
men. These words, like the rest, are as an unconscious prophecy
fulfilled in the Divine Word, in whom were "hid all the treasures of
Wisdom." Compare the marginal reference: in Him the Father was well
pleased; and yet His "joy also is fulfilled," not in the glory of the
material universe, but in His work among the sons of men.

[Proverbs 8:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">pro 8:32</span></span>

The old exhortation with a new force. The counsels are no longer those
of prudence and human experience, but of a Wisdom eternal as Yahweh,
ordering all things.

[Proverbs 8:34](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">pro 8:34</span></span>

The image is suggested probably by the Levites who guarded the doors of
the sanctuary [Psa 134:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#001); [Psa
135:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#002). Not less blessed than theirs is
the lot of those who wait upon Wisdom in the temple not made with hands.

[Proverbs 8:35](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">pro 8:35</span></span>

Wisdom then is the only true life. The Word, the Light, is also the Life
of man [Joh 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#004). The eternal life is
to know God and Christ [Joh 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#003).
