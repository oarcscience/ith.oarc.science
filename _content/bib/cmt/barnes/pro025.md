### [Proverbs Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#001)

[Proverbs 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 25:1</span></span>

A new section.

Copied out - In the sense of a transfer from oral tradition to writing.

[Proverbs 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 25:2</span></span>

The earthly monarch might be, in some respects, the type of the
heavenly, but here there is a marked contrast. The king presses further
and further into all knowledge; God surrounds Himself as in "thick
darkness," and there are secrets unrevealed even after the fullest
revelation.

[Proverbs 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 25:3</span></span>

The other side of the thought of [Pro
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#002). What the mind of God is to the
searchers after knowledge, that the heart of the true and wise king is
to those who try to guess its counsels.

[Proverbs 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 25:5</span></span>

The interpretation of the proverb of [Pro
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#004). The king himself, like the Lord
whom he represents, is to sit as "a refiner of silver" [Mal
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#003).

[Proverbs 25:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 25:6</span></span>

The pushing, boastful temper is, in the long run, suicidal. It is wiser
as well as nobler to take the lower place at first in humility, than to
take it afterward with shame. Compare [Luk
14:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#008), which is one of the few
instances in which our Lord's teaching was fashioned, as to its outward
form, upon that of this book.

[Proverbs 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 25:8</span></span>

The general meaning is: It is dangerous to plunge into litigation. At
all times, there is the risk of failure, and, if we fail, of being at
the mercy of an irritated adversary. Without the italics, the clause may
be rendered, "lest thou do something (i. e., something humiliating and
vexatious) at the end thereof."

[Proverbs 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 25:9</span></span>

An anticipation of the highest standard of ethical refinement [Mat
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#015), but with a difference. Here the
motive is prudential, the risk of shame, the fear of the irretrievable
infamy of the betrayer of secrets. In the teaching of Christ the precept
rests upon the divine authority and the perfect example.

[Proverbs 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 25:11</span></span>

Apples of gold - Probably the golden colored fruit set in baskets (i.
e., chased vessels of open worked silver); so is a word spoken upon its
wheels (i. e., moving quickly and quietly on its way). The proverb may
have had its origin in some kingly gift to the son of David, the work of
Tyrian artists, like Hiram and his fellows. Others gazed on the cunning
work and admired, but the wise king saw in the costly rarity a parable
of something higher. "A word well set upon the wheels of speech"
excelled it. Ornamentation of this kind in the precious metals was
known, even as late as in the middle ages, as oeuvre de Salomon.

[Proverbs 25:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 25:12</span></span>

The theme of this proverb being the same as that of [Pro
25:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#011), its occurrence suggests the
thought that rings used as ornaments for ears, or nose, or forehead, and
other trinkets formed part of the works of art spoken of in the
foregoing note, and that the king had something at once pointed and wise
to say of each of them.

[Proverbs 25:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 25:13</span></span>

A picture of the growing luxury of the Solomonic period. The "snow in
harvest" is not a shower of snow or hail, which would be terrifying and
harmful rather than refreshing (compare [Sa1
12:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#017)); but, rather, the snow of
Lebanon or Hermon put into wine or other drink to make it more
refreshing in the scorching heat of May or June at the king's summer
palace on Lebanon ([Kg1 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#019), note;
[Sol 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#004), note). More reviving even
than the iced wine cup was the faithful messenger. Contrast [Pro
10:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#026).

[Proverbs 25:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 25:14</span></span>

The disappointment caused by him who promises much and performs little
or nothing, is likened to the phenomena of an eastern climate; the
drought of summer, the eager expectation of men who watch the rising
clouds and the freshening breeze, the bitter disappointment when the
breeze dies off, and the clouds pass away, and the wished for rain does
not come.

[Proverbs 25:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 25:15</span></span>

A soft tongue - Winning and gentle speech does what it seems at first
least capable of doing; it overcomes obstacles which are as bones that
the strongest jaws would fail to crush.

[Proverbs 25:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 25:16</span></span>

Hast thou found honey? - Compare [Jdg
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#008); [Sa1
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#027). The precept extends to the
pleasure of which honey is the symbol.

[Proverbs 25:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 25:17</span></span>

Let thy foot be seldom in the house of thy friend, etc. Though thy
visits were sweet as honey, he may soon learn to loathe them.

[Proverbs 25:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 25:18</span></span>

Maul - A heavy sledge hammer. The word is connected with "malleus:" its
diminutive "mallet" is still in use.

[Proverbs 25:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 25:19</span></span>

Stress is to be laid on the uselessness of the "broken tooth" and the
"foot out of joint," or tottering, rather than on the pain connected
with them. The King James Version loses the emphasis and point of the
Hebrew by inverting the original order, which is "a broken ... joint is
confidence" etc.

[Proverbs 25:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pro 25:20</span></span>

Examples of unwisdom and incongruity sharpen the point of the proverb.
Pouring vinegar upon nitre or potash utterly spoils it. The
effervescence caused by the mixture is perhaps taken as a type of the
irritation produced by the "songs" sung out of season to a heavy heart.

The verb rendered "taketh away" may have the sense (as in [Eze
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#011)) of "adorning oneself," and the
illustration would then be, "as to put on a fine garment in time of cold
is unseasonable, so is singing to a heavy heart."

[Proverbs 25:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 25:21</span></span>

A precept reproduced by Paul [Rom
12:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#020); the second clause of which
seems at first sight to suggest a motive incompatible with a true
charity. [Lev 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#012) suggests an
explanation. The high priest on the Day of Atonement was to take his
censer, to fill it with "coals of fire," and then to put the incense
thereon for a sweet-smelling savor. So it is here. The first emotion in
another caused by the good done to him may be one of burning shame, but
the shame will do its work and the heart also will burn, and prayer and
confession and thanksgiving will rise as incense to the throne of God.
Thus, "we shall overcome evil with good."

[Proverbs 25:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 25:23</span></span>

The marginal reading is far more accurate and gives a better sense. The
northwest wind in Palestine commonly brings rain, and this was probably
in the thought of the writer.

[Proverbs 25:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 25:24</span></span>

Compare the [Pro 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#009) note.

[Proverbs 25:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">pro 25:25</span></span>

The craving of wanderers for news from the home that they have left is
as a consuming thirst, the news that quenches it as a refreshing
fountain.

[Proverbs 25:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">pro 25:26</span></span>

Falling down before - i. e., Yielding and cringing. To see this instead
of stedfastness, is as grievous as for the traveler to find the spring
at which he hoped to quench his thirst turbid and defiled.

[Proverbs 25:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 25:27</span></span>

So for men ... - A difficult sentence, the text of which is probably
defective. The words are not in the original. Many commentators render:
so to search into weighty matters is itself a weight, i. e., people soon
become satiated with it as with honey. Possibly a warning against an
over-curious searching into the mysteries of God's word or works.
