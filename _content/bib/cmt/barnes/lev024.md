### [Leviticus Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#001)

[Leviticus 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 24:1</span></span>

The oil for the lamps of the tabernacle and the meal for the showbread
were to be offerings from the Congregation, like the meal for the
Pentecostal loaves, [Lev 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#017). It
appears that the responsibility of keeping up the lights rested on the
high priest, but the actual service might be performed, on ordinary
occasions, by the common priests. Compare margin reference.

[Lev 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#005)

Each cake or loaf of unleavened bread [Lev
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#011) was to contain about six pounds
and a quarter (see [Exo 29:40](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#040) note) of
fine flour. The material was the same, both in quality and in quantity,
with that of each one of the wave-loaves of Pentecost [Lev
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#017). In the service of the temple
the preparation and arrangement of the cakes was committed to the
Levites [Ch1 9:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#032); [Ch1
23:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#029); [Ch2
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#011).

[Lev 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#006)

Two rows, six on a row - Rather, two piles, six in a pile. On the table,
see [Exo 25:23-30](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#023).

[Lev 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#007)

The frankincense as a memorial (like the handful of the meat-offering,
[Lev 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#002)), was most likely cast upon
the altar-fire as "an offering made by fire unto the Lord," when the
bread was removed from the table on the Sabbath-day [Lev
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#008); [Sa1
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#006). The frankincense was put into
small gold cups, one of which was placed upon each pile of bread. (See
[Exo 25:23-30](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#023) note.)

[Lev 24:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#008)

Being taken from the children of Israel - Each cake represented the
offering of a tribe.

[Lev 24:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#009)

See [Lev 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#003) note. It could have been
only by a stretch of the law that Ahimelech gave a portion of the
showbread to David and his men, on the ground that they were free from
ceremonial defilement. [Sa1 21:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#004);
[Mat 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#004).

The showbread was a true meat-offering (see [Exo
25:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#029)). The special form in which it
was offered, especially in its being brought into the tabernacle and in
its consisting of twelve loaves, distinguish it as an offering made on
behalf of the nation.

[Leviticus 24:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">lev 24:12</span></span>

The offender may already have been pronounced guilty by the rulers (see
[Exo 18:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#021)), and the case was
referred to Moses in order that the punishment might be awarded by the
divine decree. No law had as yet been enacted against blasphemy except
by implication. See [Exo 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#017); [Exo
22:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#028).

[Leviticus 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lev 24:14</span></span>

Lay their hands upon his head - As a protest against the impiety of the
criminal, symbolically laying the guilt upon his head. Compare the
washing of hands, [Deu 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#006); [Mat
27:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#024).

Let all the congregation stone him - See [Lev
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#002) note.

[Leviticus 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">lev 24:16</span></span>

Stranger - i. e. foreigner. See [Lev
16:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#029) note.
