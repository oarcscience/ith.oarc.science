### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#001)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 12:2</span></span>

My sons are with you - Possibly, however, a tinge of mortified feeling
at the rejection of himself and his family, mixed with a desire to
recommend his sons to the favor and goodwill of the nation, is at the
bottom of this mention of them.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 12:3</span></span>

His anointed - i. e., king Saul. The title Messiah, Χριστὸς Christos,
unctus, or anointed, had been given to the High Priests ([Lev
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#003) : compare also [Sa1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#010), [Sa1
2:35](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#035)); but this is the earliest
instance of an actual king of Israel bearing the title of God's Christ,
and thus typifying the true Messiah or Christ of God.

Any bribe - literally, a "ransom," the fine paid by a criminal in lieu
of bonds or death [Exo 21:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#030), applied
to the bribe paid to an unjust judge to induce him to acquit the guilty.
(Compare [Amo 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#012).)

To blind ... - See the margin. The phrase is used of one who averts his
eyes, as refusing assistance, or as showing contempt, or, as here, as
winking at what is wrong.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 12:6</span></span>

Advanced - In the sense of appointing them to their office. It is,
literally, "made" (see the margin; [Kg1
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#031); [Heb
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#002)). Samuel's purpose is to impress
the people with the conviction that Yahweh was their God, and the God of
their fathers; that to Him they owed their national existence and all
their national blessings, and that faithfulness to Him, to the exclusion
of all other worship [Sa1 12:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#021) was
the only safety of the newly-established monarchy. Observe the constant
reference to the Exodus as the well-known turning-point of their
national life (see [Sa1 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#008); [Sa1
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#006)).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa1 12:9</span></span>

According to the present arrangement of the Book of Judges, and the
common chronology, the oppression of Sisera must have occurred about 200
years after the entrance into Canaan. But Samuel here places it as the
first great servitude, before that under Eglon king of Moab, or that
from which Shamgar delivered them. And this is in accordance with the
internal evidence of the Book of Judges itself. It is also the order of
[Jdg 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#011), except that there the
Ammonites [Jdg 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#013) are placed before
the Philistines.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa1 12:11</span></span>

Bedan - No such name occurs among the Judges who delivered Israel. Some
versions and commentators read "Barak," the form of the letters of both
words being in Hebrew somewhat similar.

And Samuel - There is nothing improper or out of place in Samuel
mentioning his own judgeship. It had supplied a remarkable instance of
God's deliverance [Sa1 7:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#012); and,
as it was the last as well as one of the very greatest deliverances, it
was natural he should do so. The passage in [Heb
11:32](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#032) is quite as favorable to the
mention of Samuel here as to that of "Samson," which some propose to
read instead of "Samuel."

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa1 12:17</span></span>

Wheat harvest - Between May 15 and June 15. Jerome's testimony (that of
an eye-witness) "I have never seen rain in the end of June, or in July,
in Judaea" is borne out by modern travelers.
