*Notes on the Bible*, by Albert Barnes, \[1834\], at Intangible Textual
Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [1 Chronicles Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#001)

Compare the marginal references and notes. The writer here adds one or
two touches, and varies in one or two of the numbers.

[1 Chronicles 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch1 19:2</span></span>

Hanun - A Philistine king of this name is mentioned in the Assyrian
inscriptions as paying tribute to Tiglath-pileser and warring with
Sargon.

[1 Chronicles 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 19:6</span></span>

A thousand talents of silver - The price is not given in Samuel. On the
practice of hiring troops about this time in western Asia, see [Kg1
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#018); [Kg2
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#006); [Ch2
25:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#006).

[1 Chronicles 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch1 19:7</span></span>

They hired thirty and two thousand chariots - The reading is corrupt.
Such a number as 32,000 chariots alone was never brought into battle on
any occasion. Compare the numbers in [Exo
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#007); [Kg1
10:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#026); [Ch2
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#003). The largest force which an
Assyrian king ever speaks of encountering is 3,940. The words "and
horsemen" have probably fallen out of the text after the word "chariots"
(compare [Ch1 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#006)). The 32,000 would
be the number of the warriors serving on horseback or in chariots; and
this number would agree closely with [Sa2
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#006), as the following table shows:

[Sa2 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#006) Men Syrians of Beth-rehob
and Zobah 20,000 Syrians of Ish-tob 12,000 Syrians of Maachah 1,000
Total 33,000 [Ch1 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#007) Men Syrians of
Zobah, etc. 32,000 Syrians of Machah ( number not given) 1,000 Total
33,000
