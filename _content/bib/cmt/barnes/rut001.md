### [Ruth Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#001)

[Ruth 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rut 1:1</span></span>

In the days when the Judges ruled - "Judged." This note of time, like
that in [Rut 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#007); [Jdg
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#001); [Jdg
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#006), indicates that this Book was
written after the rule of the judges had ceased. The genealogy [Rut
4:17-22](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#017) points to the time of David as
the earliest when the Book of Ruth could have been written.

A famine - Caused probably by one of the hostile invasions recorded in
the Book of Judges. Most of the Jewish commentators, from the mention of
Bethlehem, and the resemblance of the names Boaz and Ibzan, refer this
history to the judge Ibzan [Jdg 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#008),
but without probability.

The country of Moab - Here, and in [Rut
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#002), [Rut
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#022); [Rut
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#003), literally, "the field" or
"fields." As the same word is elsewhere used of the territory of Moab,
of the Amalekites, of Edom, and of the Philistines, it would seem to be
a term pointedly used with reference to a foreign country, not the
country of the speaker, or writer; and to have been specially applied to
Moab.

[Ruth 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rut 1:4</span></span>

Marriages of Israelites with women of Ammon or Moab are nowhere in the
Law expressly forbidden, as were marriages with the women of Canaan [Deu
7:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#001). In the days of Nehemiah the
special law [Deu 23:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#003) was
interpreted as forbidding them, and as excluding the children of such
marriages from the congregation of Israel [Neh
13:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#001). Probably the marriages of
Mahlon and Chilion would be justified by necessity, living as they were
in a foreign land. Ruth was the wife of the older brother, Mahlon [Rut
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#010).

[Ruth 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rut 1:8</span></span>

Accompanying their mother-in-law to the borders of their own land would
probably be an act of Oriental courtesy. Naomi with no less courtesy
presses them to return. The mention of the mother's house, which the
separation of the women's house or tent from that of the men
facilitates, is natural in her mouth, and has more tenderness in it than
father's house would have had; it does not imply the death of their
fathers [Rut 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#011).

[Ruth 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rut 1:11</span></span>

See marginal references and notes. The Levirate law probably existed
among the Moabites, and in Israel extended beyond the brother in the
strict sense, and applied to the nearest relations, since Boaz was only
the kinsman of Elimelech [Rut 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#012).

[Ruth 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rut 1:14</span></span>

The kiss at parting as well as at meeting is the customary friendly and
respectful salutation in the East. The difference between mere kindness
of manner and self-sacrificing love is most vividly depicted in the
words and conduct of the two women. Ruth's determination is stedfast to
cast in her lot with the people of the Lord (compare the marginal
references and [Mat 15:22-28](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#022)).

[Ruth 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rut 1:19</span></span>

And they said - i. e. the women of Bethlehem said. "They" in the Hebrew
is feminine.

[Ruth 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rut 1:20</span></span>

See the margin. Similar allusions to the meaning of names are seen in
[Gen 27:36](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#036); [Jer
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#003).

The Almighty - שׁדי shadday (see the [Gen
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#001) note). The name "Almighty" is
almost unique to the Pentateuch and to the Book of Job. It occurs twice
in the Psalms, and four times in the Prophets.

[Ruth 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">rut 1:21</span></span>

The Lord hath testified against me - The phrase is very commonly applied
to a man who gives witness concerning (usually against) another in a
court of justice [Exo 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#016); [Sa2
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#016); [Isa
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#009). Naomi in the bitterness of her
spirit complains that the Lord Himself turned against her, and was
bringing her sins up for judgment.
