### [1 Chronicles Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#001)

[1 Chronicles 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 29:1</span></span>

The palace - The original word here used is the Hebrew form of a Persian
word, and generally designates the residence of the Persian monarch [Est
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#002), [Est
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#005); [Est
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#003), [Est
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#008); [Neh
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#001); [Dan
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#002). It is only here and in [Ch1
29:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#019) that it is applied to the
temple.

[1 Chronicles 29:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch1 29:2</span></span>

Glistering stones - Rather, "colored stones;" or, "dark stones" - stones
of a hue like that of the antimony wherewith women painted their eyes.

Marble stones - or, "white stones" - perhaps "alabaster," which is found
near Damascus. On the use made of the "stones" in building the temple,
see [Ch2 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#006) note.

[1 Chronicles 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch1 29:3</span></span>

Of mine own proper good - i. e., from his own private estate. He makes
the offering publicly in order to provoke others by his example [Ch1
29:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#005).

[1 Chronicles 29:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch1 29:4</span></span>

The numbers here have also suffered to some extent from the carelessness
of copyists (compare the [Ch1 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#014)
note). The amount of silver is not indeed improbable, since its value
would not exceed three millions of our money; but as the gold would
probably exceed in value thirty millions, we may suspect an error in the
words "three thousand."

[1 Chronicles 29:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch1 29:5</span></span>

To consecrate his service - literally, as in the margin, "to fill his
hand," i. e., "to come with full hands to Yahweh." The words contain an
appeal to the assembly for voluntary offerings.

[1 Chronicles 29:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch1 29:7</span></span>

The word here translated "dram" is regarded by most critics as the
Hebrew equivalent of the Persian "daric," or ordinary gold coin, worth
about 22 shillings of British money (circa 1880's). Not, however, that
the Jews possessed darics in David's time: the writer wished to express,
in language that would be intelligible to his readers, the value of the
gold subscribed, and therefore he translated the terms employed in his
documents, whatever they were, into terms that were in use in his own
day. The doric became current in Palestine soon after the return from
the captivity [Ezr 2:69](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#069); [Ezr
8:27](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#027); [Neh
7:70-72](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#070).

[1 Chronicles 29:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch1 29:8</span></span>

Compare [Exo 35:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#027). The same spirit
prevailed now as at the setting up of the tabernacle. Each offered what
he had that was most precious.

[1 Chronicles 29:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch1 29:9</span></span>

The people rejoiced for that they offered willingly - i. e., the
munificence of the princes and officers [Ch1
29:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#006) caused general joy among the
people.

[1 Chronicles 29:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch1 29:18</span></span>

Keep this forever ... - i. e., "Preserve forever this spirit of liberal
and spontaneous giving in the hearts of Thy people, and establish their
hearts toward Thee."

[1 Chronicles 29:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch1 29:20</span></span>

Worshipped the Lord, and the king - The same outward signs of reverence
were accorded by the customs of the Jews (as of the Oriental nations
generally) to God and to their monarchs (see [Kg1
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#031)). But the application of the
terms to both in the same passage, which occurs nowhere in Scripture but
here, is thought to indicate a time when a long servitude under despotic
lords had orientalized men's mode of speech.

[1 Chronicles 29:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch1 29:21</span></span>

With their drink offerings - i. e., with the drink-offerings appropriate
to each kind of burnt-offering, and required by the Law to accompany
them (see [Num 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#005), [Num
15:7](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#007),[Num
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#010), etc.).

Sacrifices - or, "thank-offerings," as the same word is translated in
[Ch2 29:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#031); [Ch2
33:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#016). Of "peace-offerings for
thanksgivings" only a small part was the priest's; the sacrificer and
his friends feasted on the remainder [Lev
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#015), [Lev
7:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#029), [Lev
7:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#034).

[1 Chronicles 29:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch1 29:22</span></span>

King the second time - Solomon's first appointment was at the time of
Adonijah's rebellion (marginal reference). As that appointment was
hurried and, comparatively speaking, private, David now thought it best
formally to invest Solomon a second time with the sovereignty, in the
face of all Israel. For a similar reason a second and public appointment
of Zadok alone to the high priest's office took place. Abiathar was not
as yet absolutely thrust out; but it may be doubtful whether he was ever
allowed to perform high priestly functions after his rebellion [Kg1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#007); [Kg1
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#027).

[1 Chronicles 29:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ch1 29:23</span></span>

The throne of David is called here "the throne of the Lord," as in [Ch1
28:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#005) it is called "the throne of the
kingdom of the Lord," because God had set it up and had promised to
establish it.

[1 Chronicles 29:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">ch1 29:28</span></span>

See [Kg1 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#001) note.

[1 Chronicles 29:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">ch1 29:29</span></span>

On the character of the works alluded to, see Introduction to
Chronicles.

Gad the seer - Gad is not given here the same title as Samuel. Samuel's
title is one, apparently, of higher dignity, applied only to him and to
Hanani [Ch2 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#007), [Ch2
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#010). Gad's is a far commoner title;
it is applied to his contemporaries Asaph [Ch2
29:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#030), Heman [Ch1
25:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#005), and Jeduthun [Ch2
35:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#015), to Iddo [Ch2
9:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#029); [Ch2
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#015), to Jehu, the son of Hanani [Ch2
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#002), and to the prophet Amos [Amo
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#012). When "seers" are spoken of in
the plural, it is the term almost universally used, only one instance
[Isa 30:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#010) occurring to the contrary.

[1 Chronicles 29:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">ch1 29:30</span></span>

The times that went over him - i. e., the events that happened to him.
Compare [Psa 31:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#015).

All the kingdoms of the countries - The kingdoms, i. e., of Moab, Ammon,
Damascus, Zobah, etc. See the full phrase in [Ch2
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#010). Some account of these kingdoms
would necessarily have been given in any history of David's reign.
