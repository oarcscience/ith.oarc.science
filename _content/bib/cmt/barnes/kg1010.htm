<p>Doubt has arisen whether the "queen of Sheba" was an Ethiopian or an Arabian princess. Both countries profess to have traditions on the subject connecting the queen of Sheba with their history; and in both countries, curiously enough, government by queens was common. But the claims of Arabia decidedly preponderate. The Arabian Sheba was the great spice country of the ancient world; whereas Ethiopia furnished no spices. The Arabian Sheba was an important kingdom. Sheba in Ethiopia was a mere town, subject to Meroe. And it may be doubted whether the Cushite Sheba of Scripture <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#007">Gen 10:7</A> is not rather to be sought on the shores of the Persian Gulf (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#007">Gen 10:7</A> note), from where no one supposes "the queen of Sheba" to have come. If Ophir be placed in Arabia, there will be an additional reason for regarding Sheba as in the same quarter, because then Solomon's trade with that place will account for his fame having reached the Sabaean princess.
<p>"The fame of Solomon concerning the name of the Lord," has been variously explained, and is confessedly very obscure. May it not mean what we should call "his religious fame," as distinct from his artistic, literary, military, or political fame - "his fame with respect to God and the things of God" - or, in other words, "his moral and religious wisdom?" (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#006">Kg1 10:6</A>).
<p>Hard questions - Or "riddles" <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#012">Jdg 14:12</A>, though not exactly riddles in our sense. The Orientals have always been fond of playing with words and testing each other's wit and intelligence by verbal puzzles of various kinds. This spirit seems to have been particularly rife in Solomon's time, for Josephus records other encounters with Hiram of Tyre and another Tyrian called Abdemonus.

<p>And the meat of his table - Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#022">Kg1 4:22-23</A>. The scene here described receives very apt illustration from the Assyrian banquet scenes, where we have numerous guests sitting, dressed handsomely in fringed robes, with armlets upon their arms, and bracelets round their wrists, attendants standing behind them, and magnificent drinking-cups, evidently of a costly metal, in the hands of the guests, which are filled from a great wine-bowl at one end of the chamber.
<p>And his ascent by which he went up - A rendering preferable to "the burnt-offering which he cffered in." The "ascent" was probably a private way by which the king passed from his palace on the western hill, across the ravine (Tyropoeum) and up the eastern hill, to the west side of the temple area (compare the marginal reference). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#009">3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">kg1 10:9</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Blessed be the Lord thy God - This acknowledgment of Yahweh falls below the confessions of Hiram <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#012">Ch2 2:12</A> and Cyrus <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#003">Ezr 1:3</A>. It does not imply more than an admission of His power as a local deity; namely, that He is the God of the Jews and of their country.

<p>Strabo relates that the Sabaeans were enormously wealthy, and used gold and silver in a most lavish manner in their furniture, their utensils, and even on the walls, doors, and roofs of their houses. That the gold of Sheba should be given to Solomon was prophesied by the writer of Ps 72 (see the marginal reference). The immense abundance of spices in Arabia, and especially in the Yemen or Sabaean country, is noted by many writers. According to Strabo, the spice-trade of Arabia was in the hands of two nations, the Sabaeans and the Gerrhaeans. The spices in which they dealt seem to have been only in part the produce of Arabia itself; some of the most important kinds, as the cinnamon and the cassia, must have been imported from India, since Arabia does not yield them. The chief precious stones which Arabia now yields are the onyx and the emerald. Anciently she is said to have produced other gems. Pearls, too, were readily procurable in Arabia from the Persian Gulf fishery. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#011">3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">kg1 10:11</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The navy of Hiram - i. e., Solomon's navy in the Red Sea, which was chiefly manned by subjects of Hiram. (see the marginal reference).
<p>Almug-trees - Probably the sandal-wood tree (pterocarpus santalinus). The wood is very heavy, hard, and fine grained, and of a beautiful garnet color, which, according to the rabbinical writers, was the color of the algum. One of the names of the red sandal-wood, in its own native country (India) is "valguka," a word of which "algum" is a natural corruption. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#012">3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">kg1 10:12</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Pillars - The Hebrew word signifies ordinarily a "prop" (margin). It is generally supposed to mean in this place a "railing," or "balustrade," a sense which connects and harmonises the present passage with the parallel passage in Chronicles (marginal reference), where Solomon is said to have made of the almug-wood "stairs" for the temple and for his own house.
<p>Harps - The Jewish harp &#1499;&#1504;&#1493;&#1512;  k&#305;&#770;nno&#770;r was of a triangular shape, and had ordinarily ten strings. It probably resembled the more ancient harp of the Assyrians, which was played with a plectrum, as was (ordinarily) the "kinnor."
<p>Psalteries - The psaltery, or viol. Hebrew: &#1504;&#1489;&#1500;  nebel; Greek: &#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;  nabla, was a stringed instrument played with the hand; perhaps a lyre, like those on Hebrew coins, the sounding-board of which is shaped like a jug; or, perhaps, a sort of guitar, with a hollow jug-shaped body at the lower end. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#014">3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">kg1 10:14</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Six hundred threescore and six talents of gold - About 3,646, 350 of our money. Solomon's annual revenue exceeded that of Oriental empires very much greater in extent than his, and must have made him one of the richest, if not the very richest, of the monarchs of his time. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#015">3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">kg1 10:15</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>There is no mention in the original of "spice merchants." Two classes of traders are spoken of; but both expressions are general.
<p>Kings of Arabia - Rather, "kings of the mingled people" (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#024">Jer 25:24</A>). These were probably tribes half Jewish, half Arabian, on the borders of the western desert. They are regarded as Arabs by the author of Chronicles (marginal reference).
<p>Governors - The word used here is thought to be of Aryan origin. It appears to have been a title given by the Persians to petty governors, inferior to the great satraps of provinces. We find it borne by, among others, Tatnai <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#006">Ezr 5:6</A>, Zerubbabel <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#001">Hag 1:1</A>, and Nehemiah <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#014">Neh 5:14</A>. It can scarcely have been in use among the Jews so early as Solomon, and we must therefore suppose it to have been substituted by the writer of Kings for some corresponding Semitic title. The empire of Solomon was not a state governed from a single center by an organisation of satrapies or provinces (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#021">Kg1 4:21</A> note). But exceptionally, in some parts of the empire, the kings had been superseded by "governors" (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#024">Kg1 20:24</A>). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#016">3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">kg1 10:16</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The "targets" seem to have been long shields protecting the whole body, while the "shields" of the next verse were bucklers of a smaller size, probably round, and much lighter. They may be compared with the Assyrian long shield, and the ordinary Assyrian round shield. As the amount of gold used in each of the larger shields was only 600 shekels - worth from 650 to 700 of our money - and that used in the smaller ones was only half as much it is evident that the metal did not form the substance of the shields, but was laid as a coating or plating over them. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#017">3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">kg1 10:17</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>These shields, together with the 500 taken by David from Hadadezer <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#007">Sa2 8:7</A> were hung round the outer walls of a building, reckoned as belonging to the "house of the Forest of Lebanon," but separate from it, and called sometimes "the Tower of David" <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#004">Sol 4:4</A>, or from its use "the armoury" <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#004">Sol 4:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#008">Isa 22:8</A>. The practice of hanging shields outside walls for ornamentation seems to have existed at Tyre <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#010">Eze 27:10-11</A>, Rome, Athens, and elsewhere. Traces of it are thought to be found in the Assyrian sculptures. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#018">3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">kg1 10:18</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>It is, on the whole, probable that the substance of the throne was wood, and that the ivory, cut into thin slabs, and probably carved in patterns, was applied externally as a veneer. This is found to have been the practice in Assyria. The gold was probably not placed over the ivory, but covered other parts of the throne. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#019">3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">kg1 10:19</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Representations of thrones are frequent in the Egyptian and Assyrian sculptures. They have no steps up to them, but frequently stand upon square bases. The back appears to be flat at the top, not rounded. Assyrian thrones have "stays" or arms on either side, and they stand generally upon lion's feet. They are always accompanied by a footstool.
<p>Lions stood beside the stays - The arms of Assyrian thrones are occasionally supported by figures of animals. The throne of Rameses II at Medinet Abou has a sphinx at the side and a lion below the sphinx. The figure of the lion is naturally adopted by any imaginative race as an emblem of sovereignty. In the present case its adoption seems to have grown directly out of the poetic imagery of inspired prophets, who, living before the time of Solomon, had compared Israel <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#024">Num 23:24</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#009">Num 24:9</A>, and more particularly Judah <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#009">Gen 49:9</A>, to a lion. The "twelve lions" of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#020">Kg1 10:20</A> were probably intended to be emblematic of the twelve tribes. Josephus adds to the description of Solomon's throne here given, that the seat was supported by a golden ox or bull, with its head turned over its shoulder. As the lion was especially emblematic of Judah, so was the ox or bull of Ephraim. (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#016">Hos 4:16</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#011">Hos 10:11</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#018">Jer 31:18</A>, etc.) 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#020">3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">kg1 10:20</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Solomon's throne, as described, is certainly grander than any of which we have a representation, either in Assyria or Egypt. Much more, then, would it transcend the thrones in inferior kingdoms. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#022">3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">kg1 10:22</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>This is given as the reason of the great plentifulness of silver in the time of Solomon. The "navy of Tharshish" (not the same as the navy of Ophir, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#026">Kg1 9:26</A>) must therefore have imported very large quantities of that metal. Tharshish, or Tartessus, in Spain, had the richest silver mines known in the ancient world, and had a good deal of gold also; apes and ivory were produced by the opposite coast of Africa; and, if north Africa did not produce "peacocks," which is uncertain, she may have produced the birds called here "tukkiyim," which some translate "parrots," others "guinea-fowl" - the latter being a purely African bird. The etymology of the Hebrew words here rendered "ivory," "apes," and "peacocks," is uncertain; but even if of Indian origin, the Jews may have derived their first knowledge of ivory, apes, and peacocks, through nations which traded with India, and may thus have got the words into their language long before the time of Solomon. The names once fixed would be retained, whatever the quarter from where the things were procured afterward.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">kg1 10:23</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>See the marginal references. By "all the earth" we are, of course, only to understand the kings or people of neighboring nations. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#025">3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:25</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_025">kg1 10:25</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>His present - i. e., his tribute (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#021">Kg1 4:21</A> note). A statement illustrated by Egyptian and Assyrian sculptures on slabs and obelisks. Tribute-bearers from the subject kings, bring not only the fixed rate of bullion, but a tribute in kind besides, consisting of the most precious products of their respective countries. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#026">3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:26</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_026">kg1 10:26</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#026">Kg1 4:26</A> note. Until the time of Solomon, war-chariots had not been in use among the Jews, except to a very small extent <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#004">Ch1 18:4</A>. Hence, it was necessary for him to put himself on an equality in this respect with neighboring powers.
<p>Cities for chariots - They were probably fortresses upon the borders of his territory, in which he maintained the standing army necessary for the support of his dominion. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#027">3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:27</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_027">kg1 10:27</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Made silver as stones - This strong hyperbole marks in the most striking way the great wealth and prosperity of the capital during Solomon's reign. The lavish expenditure which impoverished the provinces, and produced, or helped to produce, the general discontent that led to the outbreak under Jeroboam, enriched the metropolis, which must have profited greatly by the residence of the court, the constant influx of opulent strangers, and the periodical visits of all Israelites not hindered by some urgent reason at the great festivals.
<p>The "sycomore-trees in the vale" (Shephelah) are mentioned also in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#028">Ch1 27:28</A>. Like the olives and the vines, they were placed by David under a special overseer, on account of their value. The tree meant seems to be the sycomore proper, or "fig-mulberry," which is still common in Palestine, and is highly esteemed both on account of its fruit and its timber. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#028">3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:28</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_028">kg1 10:28</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The word translated "linen yarn" is thought now by Hebraists to mean "a troop" or "company." If the present reading is retained, they would translate the passage - "As for the bringing up of Solomon's horses out of Egypt, a band of the king's merchants fetched a band (or troop) of horses at a price." But the reading is very uncertain. The Septuagint had before them a different one, which they render "and from Tekoa." Tekoa, the home of Amos <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001">Amo 1:1</A>, was a small town on the route from Egypt to Jerusalem, through which the horses would have naturally passed. The monuments of the 18th and of later dynasties make it clear that the horse, though introduced from abroad, became very abundant in Egypt. During the whole period of Egyptian prosperity the corps of chariots constituted a large and effective portion of the army. That horses were abundant in Egypt at the time of the Exodus is evident from <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#003">Exo 9:3</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#009">Exo 14:9</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#023">Exo 14:23</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#028">Exo 14:28</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#016">Deu 17:16</A>. That they continued numerous in later times appears from frequent allusions, both in the Historical Books of Scripture and in the prophets, as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#006">Kg2 7:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#024">Kg2 18:24</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#009">Isa 36:9</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#015">Eze 17:15</A>, etc. The monuments show that the horse was employed by the Egyptians in peace no less than in war, private persons being often represented as paying visits to their friends in chariots. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#029">3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:29</A></p>

<p>Taking the shekel at about three shillings of our money, six hundred silver shekels would be equal to about 90; and 150 shekels to 22 British pounds and 10 shillings. "Average" price seems to be in each case intended; and we may account for the comparatively high price of the chariot by supposing that by "chariot" is intended the entire equipage, including car, harness, and trained horses, of which there would be two at least, if not three. The "horses" mentioned separately from the chariots are not chariot-horses, but chargers for the cavalry.
<p>The kings of the Hittites - See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#006">Kg2 7:6</A> note. The kings intended were probably Solomon's vassals, whose armies were at his disposal if he required their aid.
