### [Numbers Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001)

[Numbers 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 1:1</span></span>

A month had passed away since the setting up of the tabernacle [Exo
40:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#002), [Exo
40:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#017) : and the Sinaitic legislation
was now complete (compare [Lev 27:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#034)).

A census ("sum") was commanded, to be based not upon any fresh
registration of individuals, but upon that which had accompanied the
previous collection of the offerings. Compare [Exo
30:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#011), etc.; [Exo
38:25-28](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#025). The offerings had been
probably tendered by the people in groups, and if certificates of
registration were furnished to such groups, the new census might be
easily carried out by means of these documents, and got through [Num
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#018) in a single day. The present
registration enrolled persons "after their families, by the house of
their fathers;" and was superintended not by the Levites (see [Exo
38:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#021) and note), but by [Num
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#004) an assessor for each tribe to act
in the business with Moses and Aaron. The purpose now in view was not
religious only. The census now taken would serve as a basis for various
civil and military arrangements.

[Numbers 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">num 1:5</span></span>

The princes of the tribes, selected [Num
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#004) under divine direction, were for
the most part the same persons as those chosen a few months previously
at the counsel of Jethro [Exo
18:21-26](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#021). Nahshon, prince of Judah, is
mentioned in [Exo 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#023), and Elishama,
in [Ch1 7:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#026). The peers of men like
these were no doubt entitled, among their fellows, to the epithet
"renowned," [Num 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#016).

[Numbers 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">num 1:20</span></span>

The enrollment, being taken principally for military purposes (compare
[Num 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#003), [Num
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#020)), would naturally be arranged by
hundreds, fifties, etc. (cf. [Kg2 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#009),
[Kg2 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#011), [Kg2
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#013)). In eleven tribes the number
enrolled consists of complete hundreds. The difference, in this respect,
observable in the case of the tribe of Gad here [Num
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#025), and of the tribe of Reuben at
the later census [Num 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#007), is
probably to be accounted for by the pastoral, and consequently nomadic,
habits of these tribes, which rendered it difficult to bring all their
members together at once for a census. Judah already takes precedence of
his brethren in point of numbers (compare [Gen
49:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#008) note), and Ephraim of Manasseh
(compare [Gen 48:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#019)).

[Numbers 1:47](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#047)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">num 1:47</span></span>

When a census of the tribe of Levi takes place. [Num
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#015); [Num
26:62](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#062), "all" the males are counted
from a month old and upward, and not, as in the other tribes, those only
who were of age for service in the field.

[Num 1:48](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#048)

had spoken - Render spake. The formal appointment is only now made, in
reward for their zeal [Exo 32:26-29](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#026),
though reference to their future office appears previously in [Lev
25:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#032) ff, and they had already acted
as assistants to the priests (compare [Exo
38:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#021)).
