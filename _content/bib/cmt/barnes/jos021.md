### [Joshua Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#001)

[Joshua 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 21:1</span></span>

A list of the Levitical cities, varying in some particulars from that
given in this chapter, is also, given in 1 Chr. 6:54-81.

[Joshua 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jos 21:4</span></span>

Thirteen cities - This number is said to be too great for the single
family of Aaron. But it appears 1 Chr. 24 that the two surviving sons of
Aaron, Eleazar and Ithamar, had together 24 sons, the heads of the
priestly families. Since Aaron was 123 years old when he died [Num
33:39](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#039), his sons' grandchildren and
great grandchildren were no doubt living in the elapsing years of
Joshua's course, and had to he provided with dwellings. They might
altogether number several thousands. The "cities" of Canaan were for the
most part small; as is manifest from the astonishing number of them in
proportion to the area of the land, more particularly in the south,
where the portion of the priests was situated. The priests or Levites
would not occupy the whole of the dwellings in any city, nor all its
"fields," nor necessarily and always all its "villages" (compare [Jos
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#012)). Non-Levites, to whom the
cultivation of their land, and other secular concerns, were entrusted,
no doubt resided in the Levitical cities or their precincts. It appears,
further, that several of the cities here enumerated were only wrested
from the Canaanites at a later date.

[Joshua 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jos 21:5</span></span>

The non-priestly Kohathites had been diminished by the destruction of
Korah and his company Num. 16. On comparing [Num
26:57](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#057) following with [Num
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#027) ff, two of the families of the
Kohathites seem to have disappeared altogether. Hence, it is not
surprising that the rest of the Kohathites were sufficiently
accommodated in ten cities.

[Joshua 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jos 21:9</span></span>

The thirteen priestly cities (see the marginal references) were all in
the tribes of Judah, Simeon, and Benjamin. Thus, as Calvin remarks, God
so overruled it that the priestly families were placed upon the spot
which He had determined before hand to choose as the site of His temple.

[Joshua 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jos 21:20</span></span>

Of the cities of the non-priestly Kohathites, for Kibzaim we find
Jokmeam in [Ch1 6:68](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#068). This is perhaps
another name for the same place, since both names may be derived from
roots having a similar meaning; and for Gath-rimmon in [Ch1
6:70](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#070), Bileam is given, and probably
correctly; Gath-rimmon having apparently been repeated inadvertently
from the preceding verse. Bileam is but another form of Ibleam [Jos
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#011).

[Joshua 21:27](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jos 21:27</span></span>

Compare [Jos 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#018), etc. Of the cities
of the Gershonites, for Beesh-terah read (Beeshterah.) The name is a
contraction of Beth-Ashterah ("house of Ashterah") and the city is
undoubtedly the Ashtaroth or Astaroth of Og [Jos
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#004); [Deu
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#004); [Ch1
6:71](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#071).

[Joshua 21:34](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">jos 21:34</span></span>

Merarite cities. Some of these places are not found in the list of
Zebulonite cities in [Jos 19:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#010).
The text is considered corrupt.

[Joshua 21:42](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">jos 21:42</span></span>

After this verse, the Septuagint introduces a passage (in part a
repetition from [Jos 19:49-50](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#049)),
recording the grant of a special inheritance to Joshua, and also that he
buried at Timnath-serah the flint-knives with which he had circumcised
([Jos 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#002) note) the people after the
passage of Jordan. The latter statement, which has the authority of the
Septuagint only, is a Jewish legend of early date.

[Joshua 21:43](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">jos 21:43</span></span>

There is no real inconsistency between the declarations of these verses
and the fact that the Israelites had not as yet possessed themselves of
all the cities allotted to the various tribes Judg. 1:21-36 - nor did at
any time, subdue the whole extent of country promised to them [Num
34:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#001). God had fulfilled all His
part of the covenant. It was no part of His purpose that the native
population should be annihilated suddenly [Deu
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#022); but they were delivered into the
hand of Israel, and their complete dispossession could have been
effected at any time by that divine aid which was never wanting when
sought. At the time referred to in the text, the Canaanites were
discouraged, broken in strength, holding fast in isolated spots only up
and down the land in the very midst of the tribes of God's people. The
conquest of Canaan was already "ex parte Dei" a perfect work; just as in
the New Testament the triumph of the individual Christian and of the
Christian Church in their warfare is often spoken of as accomplished in
view of the divine will that it should be so, and of divine grace that
it may be so. It was therefore, only the inertness and pusillanimity of
the Israelites which prevented the completion of the conquest when the
allotment of Canaan was made by Joshua; as it was their subsequent
backslidings which caused God to turn the tide of victory against them
and even to cast them out of the land promised to their forefathers and
actually won in the campaigns of Joshua. See the introduction to the
Book of Joshua.
