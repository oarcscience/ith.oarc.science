### [Leviticus Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#001)

[Leviticus](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">lev 8:0</span></span>

Lev. 8; 9; 10: The Service of the Sancuary Inaugurated

This is the only historical portion of the Book of Leviticus, with the
exception of [Lev 24:10-23](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#010).

[Leviticus 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lev 8:2</span></span>

A bullock ... two rams ... a basket - compare [Exo
29:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#001). This shows the coherence of
this part of Leviticus with the latter part of Exodus. The basket of
unleavened bread used on this occasion appears to have contained:

\(1\) cakes or loaves of the ordinary unleavened bread;

\(2\) cakes of oiled bread, rather, oil bread (see [Lev
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#001), [Lev
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#004)); and

\(3\) oiled wafers (see [Lev 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#004), [Lev
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#006)).

Rabbinical tradition says that there were six cakes of each sort.

[Leviticus 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lev 8:3</span></span>

Gather ... - Rather, gather all the assembly together toward the
entrance of the tent of meeting. See [Lev
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#013). The whole body of the people
were summoned on this occasion, and the elders probably occupied the
first places. The elders are especially called together in an
unequivocal manner to receive directions to provide the first sacrifices
for the nation to be offered by the newly consecrated priests [Lev
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#001), and the body of the people
afterward assemble as they do here [Lev
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#005). The spot designated was the
portion of the court in front of the tabernacle (see [Lev
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#003) note). Toward this space the
people were commanded to assemble to witness the great national ceremony
of the consecration of the priesthood, the solemn setting apart of one
of their families, the members of which were henceforth to stand as
mediators between them and Yahweh in carrying out the precepts of the
ceremonial law. Those who could do so, may have come into the court, and
a great number of others may have occupied the heights which overlooked
the enclosure of the court. As the series of ceremonies was repeated
every day during a week [Lev 8:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#033), it
is natural to suppose that some of the people attended on one day and
some on another.

[Leviticus 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">lev 8:6</span></span>

Washed them with water - Moses caused them to bathe entirely (compare
[Lev 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#004)), not merely to wash their
hands and feet, as they were to do in their daily ministrations. See the
marginal reference. This bathing, which the high priest had also to go
through on the day of atonement, was symbolic of the spiritual cleansing
required of all [Co2 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#001), but
especially of those who had to draw near to God to make reconciliation
for the sins of the people [Heb 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#026);
[Mat 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#015).

[Leviticus 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">lev 8:7</span></span>

See the notes at Exo. 28.

[Lev 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#009)

The holy crown - The golden plate of the mitre was so called as the
distinctive badge of the high priest's consecration. See [Lev
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#012).

[Leviticus 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">lev 8:10</span></span>

Moses first anointed with the holy oil [Exo
30:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#025) the tabernacle and all therein,
that is, the ark of the covenant, the table of showbread, the
candlestick and the golden altar, with all the articles that belonged to
them.

[Leviticus 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">lev 8:11</span></span>

Sprinkled ... the altar seven times - The altar of burnt-offering was
distinguished by this sevenfold sprinkling with the holy oil. The number
of the covenant was thus brought into connection with those acts of
sacrifice by which the covenant between Yahweh and the worshipper was
formally renewed and confirmed.

[Leviticus 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">lev 8:12</span></span>

As investing the priest with official garments was a recognition before
men of the official position of the person (see [Exo
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#003) note), so the anointing him with
oil was an acknowledgment that all fitness for his office, all the
powers with which he would rightly fulfill its duties, must come from
the Lord.

So, again, with the sanctification of the holy things. Each of them was
intended by divine wisdom to convey a spiritual meaning to the mind of
man. They were means of grace to the devout worshipper. The oil poured
upon them was a recognition of this fact, and at the same time it made
them holy and set them apart from all profane and ordinary uses. On
kindred grounds, though to express another idea, the altar was to be
sanctified also by blood. See [Lev
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#015) note.

[Leviticus 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">lev 8:13</span></span>

Aaron's sons - The common priests. Nothing is said here, or in [Exo
29:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#007), of the anointing of the common
priests, though it is expressly commanded in [Exo
28:41](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#041); [Exo
40:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#015), and is evidently implied as a
fact in [Lev 7:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#036); [Lev
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#007); [Num
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#003). It would seem that the anointing
of the common priests consisted in some rite common to them and the high
priest [Exo 40:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#015), and this was the
sprinkling mentioned in [Lev 8:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#030).
Compare further [Lev 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#007) with [Lev
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#012).

[Leviticus 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lev 8:14</span></span>

Moses as the mediator of the covenant of the Law [Gal
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#019); [Heb
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#006) was called to perform the priestly
functions, in consecrating those on whom henceforth those functions were
to devolve, and in inaugurating the legal order of sacrifices. See [Exo
40:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#023) note. The sin-offering was now
offered for the first time. The succession in which the sacrifices
followed each other on this occasion, first the sin-offering, then the
burnt-offering, and lastly the peace-offering, has its ground in the
meaning of each sacrifice, and became the established custom in later
ages. The worshipper passed through a spiritual process. He had
transgressed the Law, and he needed the atonement signified by the
sin-offering: if his offering had been made in truth and sincerity, he
could then offer himself as an accepted person, as a sweet savour, in
the burnt-offering; and in consequence, he could enjoy communion with
the Lord and with his brethren in the peace-offering.

[Lev 8:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#014)

See the marginal references. The flesh of the sin-offering could not be
eaten by any but a legally consecrated priest ([Lev
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#025) note). Moses therefore could not
eat of it himself, though he was, for the occasion, performing the
duties of a priest. Those whom he was consecrating could not eat it, not
only because they were not yet duly installed, but because the sacrifice
was offered on their behalf, and the body of the victim stood to them in
the same relation as that of the regular sin-offering afterward stood to
the high priest.

[Lev 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#015)

Purified the altar ... sanctified it, to make reconciliation upon it -
The altar had been sanctified by the anointing oil [Lev
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#011) like the priests who were to
officiate at it; it was now, like them, sanctified by blood, in
acknowledgment of the alienation of all nature, in itself, from God, and
the need of a reconciliation to Him of all things by blood. [Col
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#020); [Heb
9:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#021). See [Lev
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#011); [Exo
28:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#038).

[Lev 8:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#018)

Atonement having been made, Aaron and his sons were now permitted, by
the laying on of their hands, to make themselves one with the victim,
which was to be sent up to Yahweh as "a burnt sacrifice for a sweet
savour, an offering made by fire unto the Lord." All was done strictly
according to the ritual [Lev 1:3-9](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#003),
except that Moses performed the duties of the priest.

[Lev 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#022)

The ram of consecration - The sacrifice of this ram was by far the most
unique part of the whole ceremony. The words may be literally rendered
"the ram of the fillings", and the name has been supposed to have
reference to the ceremony in which Moses filled the hands of the
priests; see [Lev 8:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#027). The offering
was in the highest sense "the sacrifice of completion or fulfilling", as
being the central point of the consecrating rite. The final perfection
of the creature is consecration to the Lord.

[Lev 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#023), [Lev
8:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#024)

Before casting forth the blood round the altar in the usual manner,
Moses took a portion of the blood and put some of it on the right
extremities of each of the priests. This, being performed with the blood
of the peace-offering, has been supposed to figure the readiness of the
priest who is at peace with Yahweh to hear with the ear and obey the
divine word, to perform with the hand the sacred duties of his office,
and to walk with the feet in the way of holiness.

[Lev 8:25-28](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#025)

In the rite of filling the hands of the priests, Moses took the portions
of the victim which usually belonged to the altar, with the right
shoulder (or leg); he placed upon them one cake of each of the three
kinds of unleavened bread contained in the basket (see [Lev
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#002) note), and then put the whole
first upon the hands of Aaron and in succession upon the hands of his
sons: in each case, according to Jewish tradition, he put his own hands
under the hands of the priest, moving them backwards and forwards, so as
to wave the mass to and fro.

In this remarkable ceremony the gifts of the people appear to have been
made over to the priests, as if in trust, for the service of the altar.
The articles were presented to Yahweh and solemnly waved in the hands of
the priests, but not by their own act and deed. The mediator of the Law,
who was expressly commissioned on this occasion, was the agent in the
process.

[Lev 8:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#025)

The rump - See [Lev 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#009) note.

[Lev 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#029)

The heave-shoulder was the ordinary perquisite of the officiating
priest, but the wave-breast appears to have been awarded to Moses as the
servant of Yahweh now especially appointed for the priestly service.

[Lev 8:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#030)

The sprinkling was on their garments as well as their persons, because
it belonged to them in reference to the office with which they had been
formally invested by putting on the garments. (See [Exo
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#003) note). The union of the two
symbols of the atoning blood and the inspiring unction appears to be a
fit conclusion of the entire rite.

[Lev 8:33-36](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#033)

The rites of consecration were to last a whole week, and thus, like the
longer of the annual festivals, were connected in an emphatic manner
with the sabbatical number of the covenant. During this period the
priests were not to leave the holy precinct for the sake of any worldly
business; and the whole series of ceremonies, including the sacrifice of
the Ram of consecration, was to be gone through on each day. Compare the
marginal references.

[Lev 8:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#033)

Rather, ye shall not go away from the entrance of the tent. With this
agree Cranmer, the Geneva Bible, etc. The meaning is evidently that they
were not to go out of the court, as is more clearly expressed in [Lev
8:35](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#035).

[Lev 8:35](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#035)

That ye die not - See [Exo 28:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#035) note.
