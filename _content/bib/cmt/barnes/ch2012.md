### [2 Chronicles Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 12:0</span></span>

This chapter runs parallel with Kings (see the marginal reference), but
considerably enlarges the narrative.

[2 Chronicles 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 12:1</span></span>

All Israel with him - i. e., "all Judah and Benjamin" - all the
Israelites of those two tribes.

[2 Chronicles 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 12:2</span></span>

Shishak ... came up ... because they had transgressed - The writer
speaks from a divine, not a human, point of view. Shishak's motive in
coming up was to help Jeroboam, and to extend his own influence.

[2 Chronicles 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 12:3</span></span>

twelve hundred chariots - This number is not unusnal (compare [Exo
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#007); [Kg1
10:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#026)). Benhadad brought 1,200
chariots into the field against Shalmaneser II; and Ahabhad at the same
time a force of 2,000 chariots (compare the [Kg1
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#001) note).

The Lubims or "Libyans" [Dan 11:43](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#043),
were a people of Africa, distinct from the Egyptians and the Ethiopians
dwelling in their immediate neighborhood. They were called Ribu or Libu
by the Egyptians. See [Gen 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#013).

Sukkiims - This name does not occur elsewhere. The Septuagint, who
rendered the word "Troglodytes," regarded the Sukkiim probably as the
"cave-dwellers" along the western shore of the Red Sea; but the
conjecture that the word means "tent-dwellers" is plausible, and would
point rather to a tribe of Arahs (Scenitae).

[2 Chronicles 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch2 12:4</span></span>

See 1 the Kings 14:25 note.

[2 Chronicles 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 12:6</span></span>

They said, The Lord is righteous - i. e., they acknowledged the justice
of the sentence which had gone forth against them [Ch2
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#005).

[2 Chronicles 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 12:7</span></span>

Compare the repentance of Ahab (marginal reference) and that of the
Ninevites [Jon 3:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#005) which produced
similar revocations of divine decrees that had been pronounced by the
mouth of a prophet.

Some deliverance - Rather, "deliverance for a short space" (see the
margin). Because of the repentance, the threat cf immediate destruction
was withdrawn; but the menace was still left impending, that the people
might be the more moved to contrition and amendment.

[2 Chronicles 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch2 12:8</span></span>

That they may know my service, and the service of the kingdom - i. e.,
that they may contrast the light burthen of the theocracy with the heavy
yoke of a foreign monarch.

[2 Chronicles 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 12:14</span></span>

He prepared not his heart ... - See the margin. Rehoboam's sin was want
of earnestness and consistency.
