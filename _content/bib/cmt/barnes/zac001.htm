<p>In the eighth month - o. The date joins on Zechariah's prophecy to those of Haggai. Two months before, "in the sixth month" <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#001">Hag 1:1</A>, had Haggai, conjointly with Zechariah <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#001">Ezr 5:1-2</A>, exhorted Zerubbabel and the people to resume the intermitted building of the temple. These had used such diligence, notwithstanding the partial discouragement of the Persian Government, that God gave them "in the seventh month" <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#003">Ezr 5:3-5</A>, the magnificent promise of the later glory of the temple through the coming of Christ <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#001">Hag 2:1-9</A>. Still, as Haggai too warned them, the conversion was not complete. So Zechariah in the eighth, as Haggai in the ninth <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#010">Hag 2:10-14</A> month, urges upon them the necessity of thorough and inward repentance, as the condition of partaking of those promises.
<p>Osorius: "Thrice in the course of one saying, he mentions the most holy name of God; partly to instruct in the knowledge of Three Persons in one Nature, partly to confirm their minds more strongly in the hope of the salvation to come."

<p>Wroth was the Lord against your fathers with wrath - o, that is, a wrath which was indeed such, whose greatness he does not further express, but leaves to their memories to supply. Cyril: "Seest thou how he scares them, and, setting before the young what befell those before them, drives them to amend, threatening them with the like or more grievous ills, unless they would wisely reject their fathers' ways, esteeming the pleasing of God worthy of all thought and care. He speaks of great wrath. For it indicates no slight displeasure that He allowed the Babylonians to waste all Judah and Samaria, burn the holy places and destroy Jerusalem, remove the elect Israel to a piteous slavery in a foreign land, severed from sacrifices, entering the holy court no more nor offering the thank-offering, or tithes, or first-fruits of the law, but precluded by necessity and, fear even from the duty of celebrating his prescribed and dearest festivals. The like we might address to the Jewish people, if we would apply it to the mystery of Christ. For after they had "killed the prophets" and had "crucified the Lord of glory" Himself, they were captured and destroyed; their famed temple was levelled, and Hosea's words were fulfilled in them; "The children of Israel shall abide many days without a king and without a prince, without a sacrifice and without an image, without an ephod and without teraphim" . 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#003">Zechariah 1:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">zac 1:3</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Therefore say thou - Literally, "And thou sayest," that is, this having been so, it follows that thou sayest or must say, "Turn ye unto Me." In some degree they had turned to God, for whose sake they had returned to their land; and again when, after some negligence <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#002">Hag 1:2-11</A>, they renewed the building of the temple, and God had said, "I am with you" <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#013">Hag 1:13</A>. But there needed yet a more inward, more complete turning, whereon God promises a yet nearer presence, as Malachi repeats the words <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#007">Mal 3:7</A>, and James exhorts, "Draw nigh to God and He will draw nigh to you" <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#008">Jam 4:8</A>. Those who have turned to God need ever to turn more into the center of the narrow way. As the soul opens itself more to God, God, whose communication of Himself is ever hindered only by our closing the door of our hearts against Him, enters more into it. "If a man love Me, he will keep My words, and My Father will love him, and We will come unto him, and make Our abode with him" <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#023">Joh 14:23</A>.
<p>Osorius: "People are said to be converted, when leaving behind them deceitful goods, they give their whole mind to God, bestowing no less pains and zeal on divine things than before on the nothings of life."
<p>Conc. Trid. Sess. vi. c. 5: "When it is said in Holy Scripture, "Turn unto Me and I will turn unto you," we are admonished as to our own freedom; when we answer, "Turn us, Lord, unto Thee, and we shall be turned," we confess that we are forecome by the grace of God." 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#004">Zechariah 1:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">zac 1:4</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Be ye not like your fathers - Strangely infectious is the precedent of ill. Tradition of good, of truth, of faith, is decried; only tradition of ill and error are adhered to. The sin of Jeroboam was held sacred by every king of Israel: "The statutes of Omri were diligently kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab" <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#016">Mic 6:16</A>. "They turned back and were treacherous like their forefathers; they turned themselves like a deceitful bow" <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#057">Psa 78:57</A>, is God's summary of the history of Israel. Cyril: "Absurd are they who follow the ignorances of their fathers, and ever plead inherited custom as an irrefragable defense, though blamed for extremest ills. So idolaters especially, being called to the knowledge of the truth, ever bear in mind the error of their fathers and, embracing their ignorance as an hereditary lot, remain blind."
<p>The former prophets - The prophets spake God's words, as well in their pastoral office as in predicting things to come, in enforcing God's law and in exhorting to repentance, as in announcing the judgments on disobedience. The predictive as well as the pastoral office were united in Nathan <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#004">Sa2 7:4-16</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#001">Sa2 12:1-14</A>, Gad <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#005">Sa1 22:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#011">Sa1 24:11</A>, Shemaiah <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#002">Ch2 11:2-4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#005">Ch2 12:5-8</A>, Azariah 2 Chr. 15, Hanani <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#007">Ch2 16:7-9</A>, Elijah <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#001">Kg1 17:1</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#014">Kg1 17:14</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#001">Kg1 18:1</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#041">Kg1 18:41</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#019">Kg1 21:19</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#021">Kg1 21:21</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#023">Kg1 21:23</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#029">Kg1 21:29</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#004">Kg2 1:4</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#016">Kg2 1:16</A>, Elisha <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#017">Kg2 3:17-18</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#016">Kg2 4:16</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#027">Kg2 5:27</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#001">Kg2 7:1-2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#010">Kg2 8:10-13</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#014">Kg2 13:14-19</A>, Micaiah the son of Imla, whose habitual predictions against Ahab induced Ahab to say <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#008">Kg1 22:8</A>, "I hate him, for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil." The specific calls to conversion here named and their fruitlessness, are summed up by Jeremiah as words of all the prophets. For ten years he says, "The word of the Lord hath come unto me, and I have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking, and ye have not hearkened. And the Lord hath sent unto you all His servants the prophets, rising early and sending; but ye have not hearkened nor inclined your ear to hear. They said, Turn ye again now every one from his evil ways and from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that the Lord hath given unto you and to your fathers forever and ever; and go not after other gods to serve and worship them, and provoke Me not to anger with the works of your hands, and I will do you no hurt. But ye have not hearkened unto Me, saith the Lord; that ye might provoke Me to anger with the works of your hands to your own hurt. Therefore, thus saith the Lord of hosts, Because ye have not heard My words ..." <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#003">Jer 25:3-8</A>. The prophetic author of the book of Kings sums up in like way, of "all the prophets and all the seers." "The Lord testified against Israel and against Judah by the hand of all the prophets and all the seers, saying, Turn ye from your evil ways and keep My commandments, My statutes, according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by My servants the prophets, and they did not hear, and hardened their neck, like the neck of their fathers" <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#013">Kg2 17:13</A>.
<p>The characteristic word, "turn from your evil ways and the evil of your doings" occurring in Jeremiah, it is probable, that this summary was chiefly in the mind of Zechariah, and that he refers not to Isaiah, Joel, Amos etc., (as all the prophets were preachers of repentance), but to the whole body of teachers, whom God raised up, analogous to the Christian ministry, to recall people to Himself.
<p>The title, "the former prophets," contrasts the office of Haggai and Zechariah, not with definite prophets before the captivity, but with the whole company of those, whom God sent as He says, so unremittingly.
<p>And they hearkened not unto Me - Jerome: "They heard not the Lord warning through the prophets, attended not - not to the prophets who spake to them but - not to Me, saith the Lord. For I was in them who spake and was despised. Whence also the Lord in the Gospel saith, "He that receiveth you, receiveth Me" <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#040">Mat 10:40</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#005">Zechariah 1:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">zac 1:5</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Your fathers, where are they? - The abrupt solemnity of the question seems to imply an unexpected close of life which cut short their hopes, plans, promises to self. "When they said, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction cometh upon them" <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#003">Th1 5:3</A>. Yet not they only but the prophets too, who ministered God's Word to them, these also being human beings, passed away, some of them before their time as people, by the martyr's death. Many of them saw not their own words fulfilled. But God's word which they spake, being from God, passed not away. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#006">Zechariah 1:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">zac 1:6</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Only My words and My decrees - Which God spake by them, "did not they overtake them?" (as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#007">Psa 2:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#002">Zep 2:2</A>). Pagan reminiscence of God's justice acknowledged , "Rarely hath punishment with limping tread parted with the forerunning miscreant." "All these curses," Moses foretells, "shall come upon thee and overtake thee, until thou art destroyed" <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#045">Deu 28:45</A>.
<p>And they returned to God and said - The history of the Jews in Babylon is omitted in Holy Scripture, except as to His special dealings with Daniel and his three companions. Yet Jeremiah confesses in words, what Zechariah had apparently in his mind; "The Lord hath done that which He purposed; He hath fulfilled His word, which He commanded in the days of old" <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#017">Lam 2:17</A>. The Lamentations are one long confession of deserved punishment, such as Daniel too made in the name of his people with himself <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#004">Dan 9:4-16</A>.
<p>It was one long waiting for God and for the restoration of His visible worship. Yet repentance was a condition of their restoration. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#007">Zechariah 1:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">zac 1:7</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>On the twenty-fourth day - Exactly five months after the building of the temple was resumed <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#015">Hag 2:15</A>, and two months after Haggai's last prophecy <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#020">Hag 2:20</A>. The series of visions, leading onward, from the first deliverance from the enemies who oppressed them, to the Coming of Christ, is given as a reward to their first whole-hearted endeavor to restore their worship of Him. The visions are called the "word of the Lord," because they were prophecy, made visible to the eye, conveying the revelation to the soul, and in part explained by Him. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#008">Zechariah 1:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">zac 1:8</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>I saw in the night - that is, that following on "the twenty-fourth day." The darkness of the night perhaps was chosen, as agreeing with the dimness of the restored condition. Night too is, Dionysius), "through the silence of the senses and of the fancy, more suited for receiving divine revelations."
<p>A man riding upon a red horse - The man is an angel of God, appearing in form of man, as Daniel says, "The man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, touched me" <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#021">Dan 9:21</A>. He is doubtless the same who appeared to Joshua in form of man, preparing thereby for the revelation of God manifest in the flesh - He, before whom Joshua fell on his face and in him worshiped God, through whom also God required the same tokens of reverence as He had from Moses. "Joshua lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold there stood a man over against him with a sword drawn in his hand, who said, as Captain of the Lord's host am I come" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#013">Jos 5:13-15</A>. See the note on "the Angel of the Lord" in Dr. Pusey's Daniel the Prophet, pp. 519-525). He rides here, as Leader of the host who follow Him; to Him the others report, and He instructs the Angel who instructs the prophet. Red, being the color of blood, symbolizes doubtless "the vengeance of God to be inflicted on the enemies of the Jews for their sins committed against the Jews" (Dionysius), exceeding the measure of chastisement allowed by God. It probably was Michael <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#013">Dan 10:13</A>, who is entitled in Daniel, "your prince <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#021">Dan 10:21</A>, the great prince which standeth up for the children of thy people" .
<p>And he was standing - Almost as we say, stationary, abiding in that one place. The description is repeated <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#010">Zac 1:10</A> apparently as identifying this angel, and so he and the "angel of the <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#011">Zac 1:11</A> Lord" are probably one.
<p>The myrtle trees - from their fragrance and lowness, probably symbolize the Church, as at once yielding a sweet odor, and in a low estate, or lowly. The natural habits of the myrtle make it the fitter symbol.
<p>And behind him - The relation of the Angel as their chief is represented by their following him. This is consistent with their appearing subsequently as giving report to him. The red and white horses are well-known symbols of war and glory, whence He who sits on "the white horse" <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#002">Rev 6:2</A> in the revelations, "went forth conquering and to conquer." The remaining color is somewhat uncertain. If it be ashen gray, it would correspond to the pale horse  of the revelations, and the union of the two colors, black and white, is calculated to be a symbol of a chequered state of things, whereas a mingled color like "chestnut" is not suggestive of any symbol. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#009">Zechariah 1:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">zac 1:9</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>What are these? - He asks, not who, but what they import.
<p>The angel that talked with me - Literally, "spake in me." The very rare expression seems meant to convey the thought of an inward speaking, whereby the words should be borne directly into the soul, without the intervention of the ordinary outward organs. God says to Moses, "If there is a prophet among you, I, the Lord, will make Myself known unto him in a vision, I will speak (literally) in him in a dream. My servant Moses is not so - In him will I speak mouth to mouth <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#006">Num 12:6-9</A>;" and Habakkuk says of the like inward teaching, "I will watch to see, what He will speak in me" . It is the characteristic title of one attendant-angel, who was God's expositor of the visions to Zechariah (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#013">Zac 1:13-14</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#019">Zac 1:19</A>, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#002">Zac 2:2</A> Hebrew) <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#003">Zac 2:3</A>; (7) <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#001">Zac 4:1</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#004">Zac 4:4-5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#005">Zac 5:5</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#010">Zac 5:10</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#004">Zac 6:4</A>). Dionysius: "By his ministry God showed me things to come, in that that angel formed in the spirit and imaginative power of Zechariah phantasms or images of things which were foreshown him, and gave him to understand what those images signified." 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#010">Zechariah 1:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">zac 1:10</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>And the man answered - To the question addressed to the attendant-angel. He himself took the word.
<p>These are they whom the Lord sent to walk up and down - Satan says of himself that he came "from going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down in it" <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#002">Job 2:2</A>. As he for evil, so these for good. Their office was not a specific or passing duty, as when God sent His angels with some special commission, such as those recorded in Holy Scripture. It was a continuous conversation with the affairs of people, a minute course of visiting, inspecting our human deeds and ways, a part of the "wonderful order" , in which God has "ordained and constituted the services of angels and men." Nor is it said that the angels were limited, each to his own special province, as we learn through Daniel, that certain great angels, princes among them, had the charge of empires or nations, even of the pagan . These angels had apparently only the office of inspecting and reporting to angels of a higher order, themselves a subordinate order in the heavenly Hierarchy. Nor are they spoken of, as executing any judgments of God, or as pacifying the earth; they may have been so employed; but they are only said to have reported the state in which they found it.
<p>These answered the unexpressed inquiry of the angel of the Lord, as he had answered the unuttered question of the angel, attendant on Zechariah. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#011">Zechariah 1:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">zac 1:11</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Sitteth still and is at rest - At rest, as the word seems to express, from its accustomed state of tumult and war. Wars, although soon to break out again, were in the second year of Darius for the time suspended. The rest, in which the world was, suggests the contrast of the yet continuing unrest allotted to the people of God. Such rest had been promised to Israel, on its return from the captivity, but had not yet been fulfilled. Through the hostility of the Samaritans the building of the temple had been hindered and was just recommenced; the wall of Jerusalem was yet broken down <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#003">Neh 1:3</A>; its fire-burned gates not restored; itself was a waste <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#003">Neh 2:3</A>; its houses unbuilt <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#004">Neh 7:4</A>. This gives occasion to the intercession "of the Angel of the Lord." 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#012">Zechariah 1:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">zac 1:12</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>And the Angel of the Lord answered - the implied longing, by intercession with God. As the angel-interpreter in Job had  "the office of no mere created angel, but one, anticipative of His, who came at once to redeem and justify," so the Angel of the Lord, in whom God was, exercised at once a mediatorial office with God, typical of our Lord's high priest's prayer John 17, and acted as God.
<p>These seventy years - The seventy years of the captivity, prophesied by Jeremiah <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#011">Jer 25:11-12</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#010">Jer 29:10</A>, were on the eve of their conclusion at the time of Daniel's great prayer of intercession <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#002">Dan 9:2</A>; they ended with the capture of Babylon, and the edict of Cyrus, permitting the Jews to return <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#022">Ch2 36:22-23</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001">Ezr 1:1</A>. Yet there seems to have been a secondary fulfillment, from the destruction of the temple and city, in Zedekiah's eleventh year <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#002">Kg2 25:2</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#008">Kg2 25:8-9</A>, 588 b.c. to the second year of Darius, 519 b.c. Such double fulfillments of prophecy are not like alternative fulfillments. They are a more intricate and fuller, not an easier fulfillment of it. Yet "these 70 years" do not necessitate such a double fulfillment. It might express only a reverent wonder, that the 70 years being accomplished, the complete restoration was not yet brought to pass. Cyril: "God having fixed the time of the captivity to the 70th year, it was necessary to be silent, so long as the time was not yet come to an end, that he might not seem to oppose the Lord's will. But, when the time was now come to a close and the fear of offending was removed, he, knowing that the Lord cannot lie, entreats and ventures to enquire whether His anger has come to an end, as had those who sinned; or whether, fresh sins having accrued, there shall be a further delay, and their forlorn estate shall be yet further extended. They then who worship God have a good and not uncertain hope, that, if they should offend from infirmity, yet have they those who should entreat for them, not people only, but the holy angels themselves, who render God gracious and propitious, soothing His anger by their purity, and in a manner winning the grieved judge. Then the Angel entreated for the synagogue to the Jews; but we, who believe and have been sanctified in the Spirit <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#001">Jo1 2:1-2</A>, "have an Advocate with the Father Jesus Christ the righteous, and He is the propitiation for our sins," and as the inspired Paul writes, "God hath set Him forth as a propitiation through faith, freeing from sin those who come to Him" <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025">Rom 3:25</A>.

<p>And the Lord answered the angel that talked with me - Either directly, at the intercession of the angel of the Lord, or mediately through an answer first given to him, and by him communicated to the subordinate angel. Neither is expressed.
<p>Good words - As God had promised, "after seventy years shall be accomplished at Babylon, I will visit you and perform My good word unto you, causing you to return to this place" <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#010">Jer 29:10</A>; and Joshua says, "There failed not ought of any good word which the Lord spake unto the house of Israel" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#043">Jos 21:43</A> (45 English) add <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#014">Jos 23:14-15</A>).
<p>Comfortable words - Literally, "consolations" (as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#018">Isa 57:18</A>). Perhaps the Angel who received the message had, from their tender compassion for us, whereby they "joy over one sinner that repenteth" <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#010">Luk 15:10</A>, a part in these consolations which he conveyed.

<p>Cry thou - The vision was not for the prophet alone. What he saw and heard, that he was to proclaim to others. The vision, which he now saw alone, was to be the basis and substance of his subsequent preaching <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#002">Jon 1:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#002">Isa 40:2</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#006">Isa 40:6</A>, whereby he was to encourage his people to persevere.
<p>I am jealous for Jerusalem - Literally, "I have been," not now only but in time past even when I did not show it, "and am jealous", with the tender love which allows not what it loves to be injured . The love of God, until finally shut out, is unchangeable, He pursues the sinner with chastisements and scourges in His love, that he may yet be converted and live . But for God's love to him and the solicitations of His grace, while yet impenitent and displeasing Him, he could not turn and please Him.
<p>And for Zion - Which especially He had chosen to put His Name there, and there to receive the worship of His people; "the hill which God desired to dwell in" <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#016">Psa 68:16</A>, "which He loved" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#068">Psa 78:68</A>; add <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#013">Psa 132:13-14</A>). Dionysius: "With great and special love have I loved the people of the Jews and what pertained to them, and out of that love have I so diligently and severely corrected her excesses, that she may be more careful for the time to come, as a husband corrects most sharply a wife most dear to him, if she be unfaithful. Whence in the book of Maccabees it is written, "It is a token of His great goodness, when wicked doers are not suffered any long time, but are immediately punished. For not as with other nations, whom the Lord patiently forbeareth to punish, till they be come to the fullness of their sins, so dealeth He with us; lest, being come to the height of sin, afterward He should take vengeance of us. And therefore He never withdraweth His mercy from us, and though He punisheth with adversity, yet doth He never forsake His people" (2 Macc. 6:13-16).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">zac 1:15</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>I am sore displeased - literally "with great anger am I angered against the nations which are at ease." The form of the words shows that the greatness of the displeasure of God against those who oppress His people, is proportionate to the great and tender love toward themselves. God had been angered indeed with His people; with their enemies He was "angered with a great anger;" and that the more, because they were at ease, in unfeeling self-enjoyment amid the miseries of others.
<p>I was a little displeased - Little, in comparison with our deserts; little in comparison with the anger of the human instruments of His displeasure; little in comparison with theirs, who, in their anger, sought their own ends.
<p>They helped forward the affliction - o "He is wroth with the nations at ease, because He delivered His people to be corrected, but they used cruelty toward those delivered; He wills them to be amended as a son by a schoolmaster; they set themselves to slay and punish them, as an enemy. Like that in Isaiah, "I gave them into thy hands; thou didst show them no mercy; upon the ancients hast thou very heavily laid thy yoke" <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#006">Isa 47:6</A>.
<p>Or it may be, "helped for evil," in order to bring about evil, as in Jeremiah, "Behold I set My face against you for evil, and to destroy all Judah" <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#011">Jer 44:11</A>, that is, as we should say, they were the instruments of God, , "cooperated in the execution of My justice toward you, but cruelly and with perverse intention. For although the Assyrians and Chaldaeans wasted the Jewish people, God so ordaining in as far as He willed through them to punish in the present the sins of His people, yet they did it, not in view of God and out of zeal for righteousness, but out of pride covetousness and with the worst ends. Hence God says by Isaiah, "Woe to Asshur, the rod of Mine anger, and the staff in his hand is Mine indignation. Howbeit he thinketh not so, but his heart is to destroy and cut off nations not a few" <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005">Isa 10:5</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#007">Isa 10:7</A>.

<p>Therefore - This being so, since God was so jealous for His people, so displeased with their persecutors, "thus saith the Lord," Dionysius, "I who "in wrath remember mercy, am returned" <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#002">Hab 3:2</A>, not by change of place, who am uncircumscribed, not existing in place, to the people of Judah and Jerusalem in mercies, manifoldly benefiting them by various effects of My love." The single benefits, the rebuilding of His House, and so the restoration of His public worship, and the rebuilding of Jerusalem, are but instances of that all-containing mercy, His restored presence in tender mercies. "I am returned," God says, although the effects of His return were yet to come.
<p>A line shall be stretched forth over Jerusalem - Before, when it stood, this had been done to destroy <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#013">Kg2 21:13</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#011">Isa 34:11</A>; now, when destroyed, to rebuild .
<p>Osorius: "The temple was built then, when the foundations of the walls were not yet laid. In man's sight it would have seemed more provident that the walls should be first builded, that then the temple might be builded more securely. To God, in whom alone is the most firm stay of our life and salvation, it seemed otherwise. For it cannot be that he, to whom nothing is dearer fhan zeal for the most holy religion, should be forsaken of His help."

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">zac 1:17</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Cry yet - A further promise; not only should Jerusalem be rebuilt, but should as we say, overflow with good ; and God, who had seemed to cast off His people, should yet comfort her, and should show in act that He had chosen her. "love." In all the cases, which Gesenius cites as meaning "love" <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#002">Gen 6:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#030">Sa1 20:30</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#015">Sa2 15:15</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#029">Pro 1:29</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#031">Pro 3:31</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#029">Isa 1:29</A>, the sense would be injured by rendering, "loved") Zechariah thrice  repeats the promise, given through Isaiah <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#001">Isa 14:1</A> to Jerusalem, before her wasting by the Chaldaeans, reminding the people thereby, that the restoration, in the dawn whereof they lived, had been promised two centuries before. Yet, against all appearances. My cities shall overflow with good, as being God's; yet would the Lord comfort Zion; yet would He choose Jerusalem.
<p>Osorius: "What is the highest of all goods? what the sweetest solace in life? what the subject of joys? what the oblivion of past sorrow? That which the Son of God brought upon earth, when He illumined Jerusalem with the brightness of His light and heavenly discipline. For to that end was the city restored, that in it, by the ordinance of Christ, for calamity should abound bliss; for desolation, fullness; for sorrow, joy; for want, affluence of heavenly goods."
<p>This first vision having predicted the entire restoration, the details of that restoration are given in subsequent visions.

<p>And I lifted up mine eyes - o. Cyril on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#001">Zac 2:1</A> : "Not those of the body (for such visions are invisible to the eyes of the flesh), but rather the inner eyes of the heart and mind." It seems as though, at the close of each vision, Zechariah sank in meditation on what had been shown him; from which he was again roused by the exhibition of another vision.
<p>I saw four horns - The mention of the horns naturally suggests the thought of the creatures which wielded them; as in the first vision that of the horses following the chiefs, implies the presence of the riders upon them. And this the more, since the word "fray them away" implies living creatures, liable to fear. Cyril: "The horn, in inspired Scripture, is always taken as an image of strength, and mostly of pride also, as David said to some, "I said unto the fools, Deal not so foolishly, and to the ungodly, Lift not up the horns. Lift not up your horns on high and speak not with a stiff neck" <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#004">Psa 75:4</A>. The prophet then sees four horns, that is, four hard and warlike nations, who could easily uproot cities and countries." 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#019">Zechariah 1:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">zac 1:19</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>These are the horns which have scattered - o "The four horns which scattered Judah, Israel and Jerusalem, are four nations, Babylonians, Medes and Persians, Macedonians and Romans; as the Lord, on the prophet's enquiry, explains here, and Daniel unfolds most fully Dan. 2; who in the vision of the image with golden head, silver breast, belly and thighs of brass, feet of iron and clay, explained it of these four nations, and again in another vision of four beasts Dan. 7, lion, bear, leopard and another unnamed dreadful beast, he pointed out the same nations under another figure. But that the Medes and Persians, after the victory of Cyrus, were one kingdom, no one will doubt, who reads secular and sacred literature. When this vision was beheld, the kingdom of the Babylonians had now passed away, that of the Medes and Persians was instant; that of Greeks and Macedonians and of the Romans was yet to come.
<p>What the Babylonians, what the Medes and Persians, what the Greeks that is, the Macedonians, did to Judah, Israel and Jerusalem, a learned man acknowledgeth, especially under Antiochus, surnamed Epiphanes, to which the history of the Maccabees belongs. After the Coming of our Lord and Saviour, when Jerusalem was encompassed, Josephus, a native writer, tells most fully, what the Israelites endured, and the Gospel fore-announced. These horns dispersed Judah almost individually, so that, bowed down by the heavy weight of evils, no one of them raised his head." Though these were successive in time, they are exhibited to Zechariah as one. One whole are the efforts against God's Church; one whole are the instruments of God, whether angelic or human, in doing or suffering, to repel them. Zechariah then exhibits these hostile powers as past and gone, as each would be at the end, having put forth his passing might, and perishing. They scattered, each in its day, and disappeared; for the next displaced it.
<p>The long schism being ended, Judah and Israel are again one; and Jerusalem, the place of God's worship, belongs to Israel as well as to Judah.
<p>The explanation of the number four, as symbolizing contemporaneous attacks from the four quarters of the heavens, fails in matter of fact, that, in these later times, the Jews suffered always from one power at a time. There was no such fourfold attack. In Zechariah's time all around was Persian.
<p>Osorius: "Those horns, broken by the angels' ministry, portended that no guilt against the church of Christ should be unpunished. Never will there be wanting fierce enemies from east, west, north, or south, whom God will strengthen, in order by them to teach His own. But when He shall see His work finished, that is, when He shall have cleansed the stains of His own and brought back His Church to her former purity, He will punish those who so fiercely afflicted her."
<p>Spiritually, (Jerome), "those who destroy vices, build up virtues, and all the saints who, possessing these remedies, ever build up the Church, may be called 'builders.' Whence the Apostle says, "I, as a wise builder, laid the foundation" <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#010">Co1 3:10</A>; and the Lord, when wroth, said that He would "take away from Jerusalem artificer and wise man" <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#003">Isa 3:3</A>. And the Lord Himself, Son of the Almighty God and of the Creator of all, is called "the son of the carpenter" <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#055">Mat 13:55</A>.
