### [Isaiah Chapter 44](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#001)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 44:0</span></span>

It has already been observed (the note at [Isa
43:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#028)), that the commencement of this
chapter is properly a continuation and completion of the argument
commenced there; and that the division should have been made at what is
now the close of the fifth vcrsc of this chapter. This chapter may be
divided into the following parts:

I. The assurance that though they had sinned [Isa
43:23-28](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#023) God would have mercy on them,
and would restore them to his favor, and to their land [Isa
44:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#001). They had nothing to fear [Isa
44:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#001) : God would bless their
offspring, and they should grew and flourish like willows by the waters
[Isa 44:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#003), and there should be among
them a general turning to the Lord, and devotion to his service [Isa
44:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#005).

II\. An argument to show that Yahweh was the true God; and a severe and
most sarcastic reproof of idolatry - designed to reprove idolaters, and
to lead the people to put their confidence in Yahweh [Isa
44:6-20](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#006). This argument consists of the
following parts -

1\. A solemn assertion of Yahweh himself, that there was no other God
[Isa 44:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#006).

2\. An appeal to the fact that he only had foretold future events, and
that he only could do it [Isa 44:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#007).

3\. A sarcastic statement of the manner in which idols were made, and of
course, the folly of worshipping them [Isa
44:9-20](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#009).

III\. The assurance that Yahweh would deliver his people from all their
calamities and oppressions [Isa
44:21-28](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#021). This part contains:

1\. The assurance that he would do it, and that their sires were blotted
out [Isa 44:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#021).

2\. A calling upon the heavens and the earth to rejoice over so great
and glorious an event [Isa 44:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#023).

3\. An appeal to what Yahweh had done, and could do, as an evidence that
he could deliver his people, to wit: he had formed the heavens - he had
made the earth without aid - he made diviners mad - he frustrated the
plans of the wise, and he had confirmed the promises which he had made
by his servants [Isa 44:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#024); he said
to Jerusalem that it should be inhabited, and the cities of Judah that
they should be rebuilt; he had dried up the rivers; and he had raised up
Cyrus for the express purpose of delivering his people [Isa
44:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#026); and by all this, it should
be known that he would visit, and vindicate, and restore them.

[Isaiah 44:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 44:1</span></span>

Yet now hear - This should be read in immediate connection with the
previous chapter. 'Notwithstanding you have sinned, yet now hear the
gracious promise which is made in regard to your deliverance.'

[Isaiah 44:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 44:2</span></span>

Thus saith the Lord that made thee - (See the note at [Isa
43:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#001)).

And formed thee from the womb - This is equivalent to the declaration
that he was their Maker, or Creator. It means, that from the very
beginning of their history as a people, he had formed and moulded all
their institutions, and directed all things in regard to them - as much
as he is the former of the body from the commencement of its existence.
It may be observed that the words, 'from the womb,' are joined by some
interpreters with the phrase, 'that formed thee,' meaning, that he had
been the originator of all their customs, privileges, and laws, from the
beginning of their history; and by others with the phrase, 'will help
thee,' meaning, that from the commencement of their existence as a
nation, he had been their helper. According to the Masoretic marks of
distinction, the former is the true sense. So the Septuagint, Aben Ezra,
Kimchi, Lowth, etc.; but Jerome, Luther, and some others, prefer the
latter mode.

Fear not - (See the note at [Isa
41:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#010)). Though you have sinned as a
people [Isa 43:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#023), [Isa
43:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#027), and though all these heavy
judgments have come upon you [Isa
43:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#028), yet you have no reason to fear
that God will finally abandon and destroy you.

And thou Jeshurun - (וישׁרוּן vayeshurûn). This word occurs but four
times in the Bible, as a poetical name for the people of Israel,
apparently expressing affection and tenderness ([Deu
32:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#015); [Deu
33:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#005), [Deu
33:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#026); and in this place). It is, says
Gesenius (Commentary in loc.), 'a flattering appellation
(schmeichelwort) for Israel,' and is probably a diminutive from ישׁור
yāshûr = ישׁר yāshâr, the passive form in an intransitive verb with an
active signification. The ending ון ôn, he adds, is terminatio charitiva
- a termination indicating affection, or kindness. In his Lexicon, he
observes, however (as translated by Robinson), that 'it seems not
improbable that it was a diminutive form of the name ישׂראל yı̂s'râ'ēl,
which was current in common life for the fuller form ישׂיאלוּן
yı̂s'râ'ēlûn, title of affection for Israel, but, like other common words
of this sort, contracted, and more freely inflected, so as at the same
time to imply an allusion to the signification of right or uprightness,
contained in the root ישׁר yâshar.' Jerome renders it, Rectissime -
'Most upright.' The Septuagint renders it, Ἠγαπημένος Ἰσραήλ Ēgapēmenos
Israēl - 'Beloved Israel.' The Syriac renders it, 'Israel.' So also the
Chaldee. It is, doubtless, a title of affection, and probably includes
the notion of uprightness, or integrity.

[Isaiah 44:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 44:3</span></span>

For I will pour water - Floods, rivers, streams, and waters, are often
used in the Scriptures, and especially in Isaiah, to denote plenteous
divine blessings, particularly the abundant influences of the Holy
Spirit (see the note at [Isa 35:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#006)).
That it here refers to the Holy Spirit and his influences, is proved by
the parallel expressions in the subsequent part of the verse.

Upon him that is thirsty - Or rather, 'on the thirsty land.' The word
צמא tsâmē' refers here rather to land, and the figure is taken from a
burning sandy desert, where waters would be made to burst out in copious
streams (see [Isa 35:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#006)). The sense
is, that God would bestow blessings upon them as signal and marvelous,
as if floods of waters were made to descend on the dry, parched, and
desolated earth.

And floods - The word נוזלים nôzelı̂ym, from נזל nâzal, "to flow," to run
as liquids, means properly flowings, and is used for streams and rivers
[Exo 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#008); [Psa
78:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#016); [Pro
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#015); Jer. 18 It means here that the
spiritual influences which would descend on the afflicted, desolate,
comfortless, and exiled people, would be like torrents of rain poured on
the thirsty earth. This beautiful figure is common in the Scriptures:

He shall come down like rain upon the grass,

And as showers that water the earth.

[Psa 72:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#006)

My doctrine shall drop as the rain

My speech shall distil as the dew

As the small rain upon the tender herb,

And as the showers upon the grass.

[Deu 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#002)

I will pour my Spirit upon thy seed - (See [Isa
59:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#021)). This is in accordance with the
promises everywhere made in he Bible to the people of God (see [Gen
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#007); [Gen
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#015); [Gen
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#018); [Gen
17:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#007); [Exo
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#006); [Deu
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#009); [Psa
89:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#004); [Isa
43:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#005)). It may be regarded, first, as a
promise of the richest blessings to them as parents - since there is to
a parent's heart no prospect so consoling as that which relates to his
offspring; and, secondly, as an assurance of the perpetuity of their
religion; of their return from captivity, and their restoration to their
own land.

[Isaiah 44:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 44:4</span></span>

And they shall spring up - The idea is, that as plants and trees planted
by water-courses, and in well-watered fields, grow and flourish, so
should their children grow in virtue, hope, piety, and zeal.

As among the grass - They shall spring up and flourish as the grass does
when abundantly watered from heaven. On the meaning of the unusual form
of the word בבים bebēyn, in the Hebrew ("in among"), see Vitringa and
Rosenmuller. The ב (b) here is undoubtedly an error of the transcriber
for כ (k) ("as") - an error which, from the similarity of the letters,
might be readily made. The Septuagint reads it, Ὡς Hōs - 'As.' The
Chaldee reads it, כ (k) ("as").

As willows by the water-courses - Willows are usually planted in such
places, and grow rapidly and luxuriantly. It denotes here, abundant
increase, vigor and beauty; and means that their posterity would be
greatly blessed of God. A similar figure to denote the prosperity and
happiness of the righteous occurs in [Psa
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#003) :

And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water,

That bringeth forth his fruit in his season;

His leaf also shall not wither.

These two verses teach us:

1\. That God will pour his blessings on the children of his people - a
promise which in all ages, when parents are faithful, is abundantly
fulfilled.

2\. That one of the richest blessings which can be imparted to a people
is, that God's Spirit should descend on their children.

3\. That the Spirit of God alone is the source of true happiness and
prosperity to our children. All else - property, learning,
accomplishment. beauty, vigor, will be vain. It is by his blessing only
- by the influence of piety - that they will spring forth as among the
grass, and like willows by the streams of water.

4\. Parents should pray earnestly for a revival of religion. No better
description can be given of a revival than that given here - the Spirit
of God descending like streams and floods on the young; and their
springing forth in the graces of piety as among the grass, and growing
in love to God and love to mankind like willows by the water-courses.
Who would not pray for such a work of grace? What family, what
congregation, what people can be happy without it?

[Isaiah 44:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 44:5</span></span>

One shall say - It shall be common to say this, or a profession of
religion shall be common. The various expressions in this verse mean
substantially the same thing - that there should prevail among the
people a disposition to make a profession of attachment to Yahweh in
every proper public manner. It is in immediate connection with what is
said in the previous verses, that he would pour his Spirit upon them,
and especially on their children. The effect would be, that many would
make a public profession of religion. This refers, doubtless, in the
main, to the period after their return from the captivity, and to the
general prevalence of religion then. But it is also true of the people
of God at all times - especially under the Messiah. God pours his Spirit
like gentle dews, or rains, on the families of his people; and the
effect is, that many publicly profess attachment to him.

I am the Lord's - I belong to Yahweh; I devote myself to him. This
expresses the true nature of a profession of religion - a feeling that
we are not our own, but that we belong to God. It is, that we not only
feel that we are bound to worship him, but that we actually belong to
him; that our bodies and spirits, and all that we have and are, are to
be sacredly employed in his service (see [Co1
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#020); [Co2
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#005); [Co2
5:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#014)). Nothing, in few words, can
more appropriately describe the true nature of a profession of religion
than the expression used here (אני ליהוה layhovâh 'ānı̂y) 'For Yahweh am
I' - 'I am wholly, and entirely, and forever for Yahweh, to obey him; to
do his will; to suffer patiently all that be appoints; to live where he
directs; to die when, where, and how he pleases; to moulder in the grave
according to his will; to be raised up by his power; and to serve him
forever in a better world.'

And another shall call himself by the name of Jacob - The Chaldee
renders this, 'He shall pray in the name of Jacob.' The idea seems to
be, that he should call himself a friend of Jacob - an Israelite. He
should regard himself as belonging to the same family and the same
religion, as Jacob; as worshipping the same God; and as maintaining the
same belief. To call oneself by the same name as another, is indicative
of friendship and affection; and is expressive of a purpose to be united
to him, and to identify our interest with his. The idea is that which
one would express by saying, that he cast in his interest with the
people of God, or he became identified with them; as we now say, a man
calls himself by the name of Christ, that is, a Christian. Jerome
renders this, 'He shall call by the name of Jacob.' that is, sinners to
repentance (compare the note at [Isa
43:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#007); [Isa
48:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#001); [Psa
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#006)).

And another shall subscribe with his hand unto the Lord - The Septuagint
renders this, 'And another shall write with his hand (χειρί cheiri), I
am of God.' Lowth, 'On his hand,' Aquila and Symmachus, (Χειρά Cheira).
Lowth supposes that the allusion here is to the marks which were made
indelible by puncture with ink on the hand or on other parts of the
body. He supposes that the mark thus indelibly impressed was the name of
the person, or the name of the master if he was a slave, or some
indication by which it might be known to whom he belonged. In this way,
the soldier marked himself with the name of his commander; the idolater,
with the name of his god; and in this way, Procopius says, that the
early Christians marked themselves. On this passage he says, 'Because
many marked their wrists or their arms with the sign of the cross, or
with the name of Christ' (see [Rev
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#004); Spencer, De Leg. Heb. ii. 20).

But all this is too refined, and is evidently a departure from the true
sense of the passage. The mark, or writing, was not on the hand, but
with it - literally, 'and this shall write his hand to Yahweh; 'and the
figure is evidently taken from the mode of making a contract or bargain,
where the name is subscribed to the instrument. It was a solemn compact
or covenant, by which they enrolled themselves among the worshippers of
God, and pledged themselves to his service. The manner of a contract
among the Hebrews is described in [Jer
32:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#010), [Jer
32:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#012), [Jer
32:44](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#044). A public, solemn, and recorded
covenant, to which the names of princes, Levites, and priests, were
subscribed, and which was sealed, by which they bound themselves to the
service of God, is mentioned in [Neh
9:38](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#038). Here it denotes the solemn
manner in which they would profess to be worshippers of the true God;
and it is expressive of the true nature of a profession of religion.

The name is given in to God. It is enrolled by the voluntary desire of
him who makes the profession among his friends. It is done, after the
manner of solemn compacts among men, in the presence of witnesses [Heb
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#001). Among Christians, it is sealed
in a solemn manner by baptism, and the Lord's supper. It has, therefore,
all the binding force and obligation of a solemn compact; and every
professor of religion should regard his covenant with God as the most
sacred of all compacts, and as having a more solemn obligation than any
other. And yet, how many professors are there who would shrink back with
horror from the idea of breaking a compact with man, who have no alarm
at the idea of having proved unfaithful to their solemn pledge that they
would belong wholly to God, and would live to him alone! Let every
professor of religion remember that his profession has all the force of
a solemn compact that he has voluntarily subscribed his name, and
enrolled himself among the friends of God; and that there is no
agreement of a more binding nature than that which unites him in public
profession to the cause and the kingdom of the Saviour.

And surname himself by the name of Israel - Shall call himself an
Israelite, and shall be a worshipper of the same God. The word rendered
'shall surname' (כנה kânâh, not used in the Qal, in the Piel כנה kinnâh)
means to address in a friendly and soothing manner; to speak kindly to
anyone. Gesenius renders it, 'And kindly, soothingly names the name of
Israel.' But the idea is probably that expressed in our translation. The
word sometimes denotes a giving of flattering titles to anyone, by way
of compliment [Job 32:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#021) :

Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person;

Neither let me give flattering titles unto man.

For I know not to give flattering titles;

In so doing my Maker would soon take me away.

In [Isa 45:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#004), it is rendered, 'I have
surnamed thee (Cyrus), though thou hast not known me.' The word does not
occur elsewhere. It conveys the idea of an honorable title; and means
here, I think, that he would call himself by the honorable appellation
of Israel - or an Israelite - a worshipper of the God o f Jacob. It
implies that a profession of the true religion is honorable, and that it
is and should be esteemed so by him who makes it. It is observable,
also, that this verse contains an instance of the parallelism in the
Hebrew writings where the alternate members correspond to each other.
Here the first and third members, and the second and the fourth
correspond to each other (see the Introduction, Section 8).

[Isaiah 44:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 44:6</span></span>

Thus saith the Lord - This commences, as I suppose (see Analysis), the
argument to prove that Yahweh is the only true God, and that the idols
were vanity. The object is, to show to the Jews, that he who had made to
them such promises of protection and deliverance was able to perform
what he had pledged himself to do.

The King of Israel - (See the notes at [Isa
41:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#021)).

And his Redeemer - (See the notes at [Isa
43:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#001)).

The Lord of hosts - (See the notes at [Isa
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#009)).

I am the first - (See the notes at [Isa
41:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#004)).

And I am the last - In [Isa 41:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#004), this
is expressed 'with the last;' in [Rev
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#008), 'I am Alpha and Omega.' The sense
is, that God existed before all things, and will exist forever.

And besides me there is no God - This is repeatedly declared ([Deu
4:35](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#035), [Deu
4:39](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#039); see the note at [Isa
43:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#010)). This great truth it was
God's purpose to keep steadily before the minds of the Jews; and to keep
it in the world, and ultimately to diffuse it abroad among the nations,
was one of the leading reasons why he selected them as a special people,
and separated them from the rest of mankind.

[Isaiah 44:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 44:7</span></span>

And who, as I - This verse contains an argument to prove that he is God.
In proof of this, he appeals to the fact that he alone can predict
future events, and certainly declare the order, and the time in which
they will come to pass (see the notes at [Isa
41:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#021); [Isa
44:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#009)).

Shall call - That is, call forth the event, or command that to happen
which he wills - one of the highest possible exhibitions of power. See a
similar use of the word call in [Isa
46:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#002); [Isa
48:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#015).

And shall declare it - Declare, or announce with certainty the future
event.

And set it in order - Arrange it; secure the proper succession and place
(see the notes at [Isa 41:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#022)). The
word used here (ערך ‛ârak) denotes properly "to place in a row; set in
order; arrange." It is of the same signification as the Greek τάσσω
tassō or τάττω tattō, and is applied to placing the wood upon the altar
in a proper manner ([Gen 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#009)); or to
placing the showbread in proper order on the table [Lev
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#008); and especially to setting an
army in order, or putting it in battle array [Gen
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#008); [Jdg
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#020), [Jdg
20:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#022); [Sa1
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#002). Here it means, that God would
arrange the events in a proper order - as an army is marshalled and
arrayed for battle. There should be no improper sequences of events; no
chance; no hap-hazard; no confusion. The events which take place under
his government, occur in proper order and time, and so as best to
subserve his plans.

For me - In order to execute my plans, and to promote my glory. The
events on earth are for God. They are such as he chooses to ordain, and
are arranged in the manner which he chooses.

Since I appointed the ancient people - 'From my constituting the people
of old;' that is, God had given them intimations of future events from
the very period when he in times long past, had selected and appointed
them as his people. They were, therefore, qualified to be his witnesses
[Isa 44:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#008).

And the things that are coming, let them show - (See the notes at [Isa
41:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#022)).

[Isaiah 44:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 44:8</span></span>

Fear ye not, neither be afraid - (see the notes at [Isa
41:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#010)). The word rendered here 'be
afraid,' occurs nowhere else in the Bible. There can be no doubt,
however, in regard to its meaning. The Septuagint renders it, Μηδέ
πλανᾶσθε Mēde planasthe - 'Neither be deceived.' All the other ancient
versions express the sense to fear, to be afraid (Gesenius' Lexicon on
the word ירה yârahh).

Have not I told thee from that time - Have I not fully declared from the
very commencement of your history as a people, in the main what shall
occur?

Ye are even my witnesses - (See the notes at [Isa
43:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#012)).

Is there a God besides me? - This is a strong mode of affirming that
there is no God besides Yahweh (see the note at [Isa
44:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#006)).

Yea, there is no God - Margin, 'Rock' (צור tsûr). The word rock is often
applied to God (see the note at [Isa
30:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#029); compare [Deu
32:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#004), [Deu
32:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#030); [Psa
19:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#014); [Psa
31:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#002); [Psa
42:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#009); et soepe al. The idea is taken
from the fact that a lofty rock or fastness was inaccessible by an
enemy, and that those who fled there were safe.

[Isaiah 44:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 44:9</span></span>

They that make a graven image - A graven image is one that is cut, or
sculptured out of wood or stone, in contradistinction from one that is
molten, which is made by being cast. Here it is used to denote an image,
or an idol-god in general. God had asserted in the previous verses his
own divinity, and he now proceeds to show, at length, the vanity of
idols, and of idol-worship. This same topic was introduced in [Isa
40:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#018) (see the notes at that
passage), but it is here pursued at greater length, and in a tone and
manner far more sarcastic and severe. Perhaps the prophet had two
immediate objects in view; first, to reprove the idolatrous spirit in
his own time, which prevailed especially in the early part of the reign
of Manasseh; and secondly, to show to the exile Jews in Babylon that the
gods of the Babylonians could not protect their city, and that Yahweh
could rescue his own people. He begins, therefore, by saying, that the
makers of the idols were all of them vanity. Of course, the idols
themselves could have no more power than their makers, and must be
vanity also.

Are all of them vanity - (See the note at [Isa
41:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#029)).

And their delectable things - Margin, 'Desirable.' The sense is, their
valued works, their idol-gods, on which they have lavished so much
expense, and which they prize so highly.

Shall not profit - Shall not be able to aid or protect them; shall be of
no advantage to them (see [Hab 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#018)).

And they are their own witnesses - They can foretell nothing; they can
furnish no aid; they cannot defend in times of danger. This may refer
either to the worshippers, or to the idols themselves - and was alike
true of both.

They see not - They have no power of discerning anything. How can they
then foresee future events?

That they may be ashamed - The same sentiment is repeated in [Isa
44:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#011), and in [Isa
45:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#016). The sense is, that shame and
confusion must await all who put their trust in an idol-god.

[Isaiah 44:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 44:10</span></span>

Who hath formed a god - The Septuagint reads this verse in connection
with the close of the previous verse, 'But they shall be ashamed who
make a god, and all who sculpture unprofitable things.' This
interpretation also, Lowth, by a change in the Hebrew text on the
authority of a manuscript in the Bodleian library, has adopted. This
change is made by reading כי kı̂y instead of מי mı̂y in the beginning of
the verse. But the authority of the change, being that of a single MS.
and the Septuagint, is not sufficient. Nor is it necessary. The question
is designed to be ironical and sarcastic: 'Who is there,' says the
prophet, 'that has done this? Who are they that are engaged in this
stupid work? Do they give marks of a sound mind? What is, and must be
the character of a man that bas formed a god, and that has made an
unprofitable graven image?

[Isaiah 44:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 44:11</span></span>

Behold, all his fellows - All that are joined in making, and in
worshipping it, are regarded as the fellows, or the companions (חברין
chăbērâyn) of the idol-god (see [Hos
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#017) - 'Ephraim is joined to idols').
They and the idols constitute one company or fellowship, intimately
allied to each other.

Shall be, ashamed - Shall be confounded when they find that their idols
cannot aid them.

And the workmen - The allusion to the workmen is to show that what they
made could not be worthy of the confidence of people as an object of
worship.

They are of men - They are mortal people; they must themselves soon die.
It is ridiculous, therefore, for them to attempt to make a god that can
defend or save, or that should be adored.

Let them all be gathered together - For purposes of trial, or to urge
their claims to the power of making an object that should be adored (see
the note at [Isa 41:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#001)).

Let them stand up - As in a court of justice, to defend their cause (see
the note at [Isa 41:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#021)).

They shall fear - They shall be alarmed when danger comes. They shall
find that their idol-gods cannot defend them.

[Isaiah 44:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 44:12</span></span>

The smith with the tongs - The prophet proceeds here to show the folly
and absurdity of idolatry; and in order to this he goes into an extended
statement [Isa 44:12-19](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#012) of the manner
in which idols were usually made. Lowth remarks, 'The sacred writers are
generally large and eloquent on the subject of idolatry; they treat it
with great severity, and set forth the absurdity of it in the strongest
light. But this passage of Isaiah far exceeds anything that was ever
written on the subject, in force of argument, energy of expression, and
elegance of composition. One or two of the Apocryphal writers have
attempted to imitate the prophet, but with very ill success (Wisd.
13:11-19; 15:7; etc.; Baruch 6) Horace, however, has given a description
of the making of idols, which, for severity of satire, and pungency of
sarcasm, has a strong resemblance to this description in Isaiah:

Olim truncus eram ficulnus, inutile lignum;

Cum faber, incertus scamnum faceretne Priapum

Maluit esse Deum.

Sat. I. viii. 1-3.

Lowth renders the phrase 'the smith with the tongs,' 'The smith cutteth
off a portion of iron.' Noyes, 'The smith prepareth an axe' The
Septuagint, 'The carpenter sharpeneth (ὤζυνε ōzune) iron' (σίδηρον
sidēron), that is, an axe. So also the Syriac. Gesenius renders it, 'The
smith makes an axe.' Many other renderings of the passage have been
proposed. The idea in this verse is, I think, that the prophet describes
the commencement of the process of making a graven image. For that
purpose, he goes back even to the making of the instruments by which it
is manufactured, and in this verse he describes the process of making an
axe, with a view to the cutting down of the tree, and forming a god.
That he does not here refer to the making of the idol itself is apparent
from the fact that the process here described is that of working in
iron; but idols were not made of iron, and that here described
especially ([Isa 44:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#011) ff) is one made
of wood. The phrase used here, therefore, refers to the process of
axe-making with a view to cutting down a tree to make a god; and the
prophet describes the ardor and activity with which it is done, to show
how much haste they were in to complete it. The literal translation of
this phrase is, 'The workman (חרשׁ chârash, st. const. for חרשׁ chârâsh)
of iron (maketh) an axe.'

Both worketh in the coals - And he works the piece of iron of which he
is making an axe in the coals. He blows the coals in order to produce an
intense heat (see [Isa 54:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#016)) -
'Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire.'

And fashioneth it with hammers - Forms the mass of iron into an axe.
Axes were not cast, but made.

And worketh it with the strength of his arms - Or, he works it with his
strong arms - referring to the fact that the arm of the smith, by
constant usage, becomes exceedingly strong. A description remarkably
similar to this occurs in Virgil when he is describing the Cyclops:

Illi inter sesc magna vi brachia tollunt

In numerum; versantque tenaci forcipe ferrum.

Georg. iv. 174, 175.

Heaved with vast strength their arms in order rise,

And blow to blow in measured chime replies;

While with firm tongs they turn the sparkling ore,

And Etna's caves with ponderous anvils roar.

Sotheby.

Yea, he is hungry - He exhausts himself by his hard labor. The idea is,
that he is so anxious to have it done, so engaged, so diligent, that he
does not even stop to take necessary refreshment.

And his strength faileth - He works until he is completely exhausted.

He drinketh no water - He does not intermit his work even long enough to
take a draught of water, so hurried is he. While the iron is hot, he
works with intense ardor, lest it should grow cool, and his work be
retarded - a very graphic description of what all have seen in a
blacksmith's shop. The Rev. John Williams states that when the South Sea
islanders made an idol, they strictly abstained from food; and although
they might be, and were sometimes, three days about the work, no water,
and he believes no food, passed their lips all the time. This fact would
convey a satisfactory elucidation of an allusion not otherwise easily
explained (Pictorial Bible).

[Isaiah 44:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 44:13</span></span>

The carpenter - The axe is made [Isa
44:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#012), and the carpenter now proceeds
to the construction of the god.

Stretcheth out his rule - For the purpose of laying out his work, or
measuring it. The word rendered here 'rule,' however (קו qâv), means
properly "a line"; and should be so rendered here. The carpenter
stretches out a line, but not a rule.

He marketh it out with a line - He marks out the shape; the length, and
breadth, and thickness of the body, in the rough and unhewn piece of
wood. He has an idea in his mind of the proper shape of a god, and he
goes to work to make one of that form. The expression 'to mark out with
a line,' is, however, not congruous. The word which is used here, and
which is rendered 'line' (שׂרד s'ered) occurs nowhere else in the Bible.
Lowth and Kimchi render it, 'Red ochre.' According to this the reference
is to the chalk, red clay, or crayon, which a carpenter uses on a line
to mark out his work. But according to Gesenius, the word means an awl,
or a stylus, or engraver; with which the artist sketches the outlines of
the figure to be sculptured. A carpenter always uses such an instrument
in laying out and marking his work.

He fitteth it with planes - Or rather with chisels, or carving-tools,
with which wooden images were carved. Planes are rather adapted to a
smooth surface; carving is performed with chisels. The word is derived
from קצע qâtsa‛, 'to cut off.' The Chaldee renders it, אזמל 'azemēl - 'A
knife.' The Septuagint renders this, 'Framed it by rule, and glued the
parts together.'

Marketh it out with the compass - From חוּג chûg, "to make a circle," to
revolve, as compasses do. By a compass he accurately designates the
parts, and marks out the symmetry of the form.

According to the beauty of a man - Perhaps there may be a little sarcasm
here in the thought that a god should be made in the shape of a man. It
was true, however, that the statues of the gods among the ancients were
made after the most perfect conceptions of the human form. The statuary
of the Greeks was of this description, and the images of Apollo, of
Venus, and of Jupiter, have been celebrated everywhere as the most
perfect representations of the bureau form.

That it may remain in the house - To dwell in a temple. Such statues
were usually made to decorate a temple; or rather perhaps temples were
reared to be dwelling places of the gods. It may be implied here, that
the idol was of no use but to remain in a house. It could not hear, or
save. It was like a useless piece of furniture, and had none of the
attributes of God.

[Isaiah 44:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 44:14</span></span>

He heweth him down cedars - In the previous verses, the prophet had
described the formation of an axe with which the work was to be done
[Isa 44:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#012), and the laying out, and
carving of the idol [Isa 44:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#013). In
this verse he proceeds to describe the material of which the idol was
made, and the different purposes [Isa
44:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#015) to which that material was
applied. The object is to show the amazing stupidity of those who should
worship a god made of the same material from which they made a fire to
warm themselves, or to cook their food. For a description of cedars, see
the notes at [Isa 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#010).

And taketh - Takes to himself; that is, makes use of.

The cypress - (תרזה tı̂rzâh). This word occurs nowhere else in the Bible.
It is probably derived from a root (תרז târaz) signifying to be hard, or
firm. Hence, it probably means some species of wood that derived its
name from its hardness or firmness. Jerome translates it, Ilex (a
species of oak) - 'the holm-oak.' It was an evergreen. This species of
evergreen, Gesenius says, was abundant in Palestine.

And the oak - The oak was commonly used for this purpose on account of
its hardness and durability.

Which he strengtheneth for himself - Margin, 'Taketh courage.' The word
אמץ 'ı̂mmēts means properly "to strenthen," to make strong, to repair, to
replace, to harden. Rosenmuller and Gesenius suppose that it means here
to choose, that is, to set fast, or appoint; and they appeal to [Psa
80:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#015), [Psa
80:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#017), 'thou madest strong for
thyself.' Kimchi supposes that it means, that he gave himself with the
utmost diligence and care to select the best kinds of wood for the
purpose. Vitringa, that he was intent on his work, and did not leave the
place, but refreshed himself with food in the woods without returning
home, in order that be might accomplish his design. Others interpret it
to mean that he girded himself with strength, and made use of his most
intense efforts in felling the trees of the forest. Lowth renders it,
'Layeth in good store of the trees of the forest.' It may mean that he
gave himself with great diligence to the work; or may it not mean that
he planted such trees, and took great pains in watering and cultivating
them for this purpose?

He planteth an ash - (ארן 'oren). The Septuagint renders it, Πίτυν Pitun
- 'Pine.' Jerome also renders it, Pinum. Gesenius supposes the name was
given from the fact that the tree had a tall and slender top, which,
when it vibrated, gave forth a tremulous, creaking sound (from רנן
rânan). This derivation is, however, somewhat fanciful. Most
interpreters regard it as the ash - a well-known tree. In idolatrous
countries, where it is common to have idols in almost every family, the
business of idol-making is a very important manufacture. Of course,
large quantities of wood would be needed; and it would be an object to
procure that which was most pure, or as we say, 'clear stuff,' and which
would work easily, and to advantage. It became important, therefore, to
cultivate that wood, as we do for shipbuilding, or for cabinet-work, and
doubtless groves were planted for this purpose.

And the rain doth nourish it - These circumstances are mentioned to show
the folly of worshipping a god that was formed in this manner. Perhaps
also the prophet means to intimate that though the man planted the tree,
yet that be could not make it grow. He was dependent on the rains of
heaven; and even in making an idol-god he was indebted to the
providential care of the true God. Men, even in their schemes of
wickedness, are dependent on God. Even in forming and executing plans to
oppose and resist him, they can do nothing without his aid. He preserves
them, feeds them, clothes them; and the instruments which they use
against him are those which he has nurtured. On the rain of heaven; on
the sunbeam and the dew; on the teeming earth, and on the elements which
he has made, and which he controls, they are dependent; and they can do
nothing in their wicked plans without abusing the bounties of his
Providence, and the expressions of his tender mercy.

[Isaiah 44:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 44:15</span></span>

Then shall it be for a man to burn - It will afford materials for a
fire. The design of this verse and the following is, to ridicule the
idea of a man's using parts of the same tree to make a fire to cook his
victuals, to warm himself, and to shape a god. Nothing could be more
stupid than the conduct here referred to, and yet it is common all over
the pagan world. It shows the utter debasement of the race, that they
thus of the same tree make a fire, cook their food, and construct their
gods.

[Isaiah 44:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 44:16</span></span>

With part thereof he eateth flesh - That is, he prepares flesh to eat,
or prepares his food.

He roasteth roast - He roasts meat.

[Isaiah 44:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 44:18</span></span>

They have not known nor understood - They are stupid, ignorant, and
blind. Nothing could more strikingly show their ignorance and stupidity
than this idol worship.

He hath shut their eyes - God hath closed their eyes. Margin, 'Daubed.'
The word used here, טה ṭah from טוה ṭûah denotes properly "to spread
over"; to besmear; to plaster; as, e. g., a wall with mortar [Lev
14:42](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#042); [Ch1
29:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#004); [Eze
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#010); [Eze
22:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#028). Here it means to cover over the
eyes so as to prevent vision; and hence, metaphorically, to make them
stupid, ignorant, dull. It is attributed to God in accordance with the
common statement of the Scriptures, that he does what he permits to be
done (see the notes at [Isa 6:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#009)).
It does not mean that God had done it by any physical, or direct agency,
but that it had occurred under the administration of his Providence. It
is also true that the Hebrew writers sometimes employ an active verb
when the signification is passive, and when the main idea is, that
anything was in fact done. Here the main point is not the agent by which
this was done, but the fact that their eyes were blinded - and perhaps
all the force of the verb טה ṭah used here would be expressed if it was
rendered in an impersonal, or in a passive form, 'it is covered as to
their eyes,' that is, their eyes are shut, without suggesting that it
was done by God. So the Septuagint renders it, Ἀπημαυρώθησαν
Apēmaurōthēsan - 'They are blind,' or involved in darkness.

So the Chaldee, מטמטמן meṭmeṭemân (also in the plural) - 'Their eyes are
obscured' or blind. It cannot be proved from this text that God is, by
direct agency, the author by whom it was done. It was not uncommon to
shut up, or seal up the eyes for various purposes in the East, and
unquestionably the prophet alludes to some such custom. 'It is one of
the solemnities at a Jewish wedding at Aleppo, according to Dr. Russell,
who mentions it as the most remarkable thing in their ceremonies at that
time. It is done by fastening the eyelids together with a gum, and the
bridegroom is the person, he says, if he remembered right, that opens
the bride's eyes at the appointed time. It is also used as a punishment
in those countries. So Sir Thomas Roe's chaplain, in his account of his
voyages to East India, tells us of a son of the Great Mogul, whom he had
seen, and with whom Sir Thomas had conversed, that had before that time
been cast into prison by his father, where his eyes were sealed up, by
something put before them, which might not be taken off for three years;
after which time the seal was taken away, that he might with freedom
enjoy the light, though not his liberty.' (Harmer's Obs. vol. iii., pp.
507, 508. Ed. Lond. 8vo, 1808.)

[Isaiah 44:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 44:19</span></span>

And none considereth in his heart - Margin, 'Setteth to.' He does not
place the subject near his heart or mind; he does not think of it. A
similar phrase occurs in [Isa 46:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#008) :
'Bring it again to mind.' It is a phrase drawn from the act of placing
an object near us, in order to examine it closely; and we express the
same idea by the phrase 'looking at a thing,' or 'looking at it
closely.' The sense is, they had not attentively and carefully thought
on the folly of what they were doing - a sentiment which is as true of
all sinners as it was of stupid idolaters.

An abomination - A name that is often given to an idol [Kg2
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#005), [Kg2
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#007); [Kg2
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#013). The meaning is, that an idol
was abominable and detestable in the sight of a holy God. It was that
which he could not endure.

Shall I fall down to the stock of a tree? - Margin, 'That which comes
of.' The word בוּל bûl means properly "produce, increase," and here
evidently a stock or trunk of wood. So it is in the Chaldee.

[Isaiah 44:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 44:20</span></span>

He feedeth on ashes - There have been various interpretations of this.
Jerome renders it, 'A part of it is ashes;' the Chaldee, 'Lo! half of
the god is reduced to ashes;' the Septuagint, 'Know thou that their
heart is ashes.' The word rendered here 'feedeth' (רעה ro‛eh) means
properly "to feed, graze, pasture"; and then, figuratively, to delight,
or take pleasure in any person or thing [Pro
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#020); [Pro
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#014); [Pro
28:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#007); [Pro
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#003). In [Hos
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#001), 'Ephraim feedeth on wind,' it
means to strive after something vain or unprofitable; to seek that which
will prove to be vain and unsatisfactory. So here it means, that in
their idol-service they would not obtain that which they sought. It
would be like a man who sought for food, and found it to be dust or
ashes; and the service of an idol compared with what man needed, or
compared with the true religion, would be like ashes compared with
nutritious and wholesome diet. This graphic description of the effect of
idolatry is just as true of the ways of sin, and of the pursuits of the
world now. It is true of the frivolous and the fashionable; of those who
seek happiness in riches and honors; of all those who make this world
their portion, that they are feeding on ashes - they seek that which is
vain, unsubstantial, unsatisfactory, and which will yet fill the soul
itself with disgust and loathing.

A deceived heart hath turned him aside - This is the true source of the
difficulty; this is the fountain of all idolatry and sin. The heart is
first wrong, and then the understanding, and the whole conduct is turned
aside from the path of truth and duty (compare [Rom
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#028)).

A lie in my right hand - The right hand is the instrument of action. A
lie is a name often given to an idol as being false and delusive. The
sense is, that that which they had been making, and on which they were
depending, was deceitful and vain. The work of their right hand - the
fruit of their skill and toil, was deceptive, and could not save them.
The doctrine is, that that which sinners rely on to save their souls;
that which has cost their highest efforts as a scheme to save them, is
false and delusive. All schemes of religion of human origin are of this
description: and all will be alike deceptive and ruinous to the soul.

[Isaiah 44:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 44:21</span></span>

Remember these - Remember these things which are now said about the
folly of idolatry, and the vanity of worshipping idols. The object of
the argument is, to turn their attention to God, and to lead them to put
their trust in him.

Thou art my servant - (See the notes at [Isa
42:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#019); [Isa
43:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#001)).

[Isaiah 44:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 44:22</span></span>

I have blotted out - The word used here (מחח mâchâh), means properly "to
wipe away," and is often applied to sins, as if the account was wiped
off, or as we express it, blotted out ([Psa
51:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#003), [Psa
51:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#011); see the note at [Isa
43:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#025)). The phrase, 'to blot out sins
like a cloud,' however, is unusual, and the idea not very obvious. The
true idea would be expressed by rendering it, 'I have made them to
vanish as a thick cloud;' and the sense is, as the wind drives away a
thick cloud, however dark and frowning it may be, so that the sky is
clear and serene, so God had caused their sins to disappear, and had
removed the storm of his anger. Nothing can more strikingly represent
sin in its nature and consequences, than a dense, dark, frowning cloud
that comes over the heavens, and shuts out the sun, and fills the air
with gloom; and nothing can more beautifully represent the nature and
effect of pardon than the idea of removing such a cloud, and leaving the
sky pure, the air calm and serene, and the sun pouring down his beams of
warmth and light on the earth. So the soul of the sinner is enveloped
and overshadowed with a dense cloud; but pardon dissipates that cloud,
and it is calm, and joyful, and serene.

And as a cloud - The Chaldee render this, 'As a flying cloud.' The
difference between the two words rendered here 'thick cloud,' and
'cloud' ( עב ‛âb and ענן ‛ânân) is, that the former is expressive of a
cloud as dense, thick, compact; and the latter as covering or veiling
the heavens. Lowth renders the latter word 'Vapour;' Noyes, 'Mist.' Both
words, however, usually denote a cloud. A passage similar to this is
found in Demosthenes, as quoted by Lowth: 'This decree made the danger
then hanging over the city pass away like a cloud.

Return unto me - Since your sins are pardoned, and such mercy has been
shown, return now, and serve me. The argument here is derived from the
mercy of God in forgiving them, and the doctrine is, that the fact that
God has forgiven us imposes the strongest obligations to devote
ourselves to his service. The fact that we are redeemed and pardoned is
the highest argument why we should consecrate all our powers to him who
has purchased and forgiven us.

[Isaiah 44:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">isa 44:23</span></span>

Sing, O ye heavens - (see [Isa 42:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#010)).
It is common in the sacred writings to call on the heavens, the earth,
and all created things, to join in the praise of God on any great and
glorious event (see [Psa 96:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001), [Psa
96:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#011); [Psa
148:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#001)) The occasion of the joy here
was the fact that God had redeemed his people - a fact, in the joy of
which the heavens and earth were called to participate. An apostrophe
such as the prophet here uses is common in all writings, where inanimate
objects are addressed as having life, and as capable of sharing in the
emotions of the speaker. Vitringa has endeavored to show that the
various objects here enumerated are emblematic, and that by the heavens
are meant the angels which are in heaven; by the lower parts of the
earth, the more humble and obscure republics of the pagan; by the
mountains, the greater and more mighty kingdoms; by the forest, and the
trees, large and spacious cities, with their nobles. So Grotius also
interprets the passage. But the passage is a highly-wrought expression
of elevated feeling; the language of poetry, where the prophet calls on
all objects to exult; - an apostrophe to the highest heavens and the
lowest part of the earth - the mountains and the forests - the most
sublime objects in nature - to exult in the fact that the Jewish people
were delivered from their long and painful captivity, and restored again
to their own land.

The Lord hath done it - Has delivered his people from their captivity in
Babylon. There is, however, no impropriety in supposing that the eye of
the prophet also rested on the glorious deliverance of his people by the
Messiah; and that he regarded one event as emblematic of, and
introductory to the other. The language used here will certainly
appropriately express the feelings which should be manifested in view of
the plan of redemption under the Messiah.

Shout, ye lower parts of the earth - The foundations of the earth; the
parts remote from the high heavens. Let the highest and the lowest
objects shout; the highest heavens, and the depths of the earth. The
Septuagint renders it, Τὰ Θεμέλια τῆς γῆς Ta Themelia tēs gēs - 'The
foundations of the earth.' So the Chaldee.

Ye mountains - So in [Psa 148:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#009), [Psa
148:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#013) : 'Mountains and all hills;
fruitful trees and all cedars - let them praise the name of the Lord.'

O forest, and every tree therein - Referring either to Lebanon, as being
the most magnificent forest known to the prophet; or to any forest as a
great and sublime object.

[Isaiah 44:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">isa 44:24</span></span>

Thy Redeemer - (See the note at [Isa
43:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#001)).

And he that formed thee from thee womb - (See the note at [Isa
44:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#002)).

That stretcheth forth the heavens - (See the note at [Isa
40:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#022)).

That spreadeth abroad the earth - Representing the earth, as is often
done in the Scriptures, as a plain. God here appeals to the fact that he
alone had made the heavens and the earth, as the demonstration that he
is able to accomplish what is here said of the deliverance of his
people. The same God that made the heavens is the Redeemer and Protector
of the church, and therefore the church is safe.

[Isaiah 44:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">isa 44:25</span></span>

That frustrateth - Hebrew, 'Breaking:' that is, destroying, rendering
vain. The idea is, that that which necromancers and diviners relied on
as certain demonstration that what they predicted would be fulfilled,
God makes vain and inefficacious. The event which they predicted did not
follow, and all their alleged proofs that they were endowed with divine
or miraculous power he rendered vain.

The tokens - Hebrew, אתות 'othôth - 'Signs.' This word is usually
applied to miracles, or to signs of the divine interposition and
presence. Here it means the things on which diviners and soothsayers
relied; the tricks of cunning and sleight-of-hand which they adduced as
miracles, or as demonstrations that they were under a divine influence.
See the word more fully explained in the notes at [Isa
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#002).

The liars - Deceivers, boasters - meaning conjurers, or false prophets
(compare [Jer 50:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#036); see also the note
at [Isa 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#006)).

And maketh diviners mad - That is, makes them foolish, or deprives them
of wisdom. They pretend to foretell future events, but the event does
not correspond with the prediction. God orders it otherwise, and thus
they are shown to be foolish, or unwise.

That turneth wise men backward - Lowth renders this, 'Who reverseth the
devices of the sages.' The sense is, he puts them to shame. The idea
seems to be derived from the fact that when one is ashamed, or
disappointed, or fails of performing what he promised, he turns away his
face (see [Kg1 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#016), margin) The 'wise
men,' here denote the sages; the diviners, the soothsayers; and the
sense is, that they were not able to predict future events, and that
when their prediction failed, they would be suffused with shame.

And maketh their knowledge foolish - He makes them appear to be fools.
It is well known that soothsayers and diviners abounded in the East; and
it is not improbable that the prophet here means that when Babylon was
attacked by Cyrus, the diviners and soothsayers would predict his
defeat, and the overthrow of his army, but that the result would show
that they were utterly incapable of predicting a future event. The whole
passage here has reference to the taking of Babylon by Cyrus, and should
be interpreted accordingly.

[Isaiah 44:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">isa 44:26</span></span>

That confirmeth the word of his servant - Probably the word 'servant'
here is to be taken in a collective sense, as referring to the prophets
in general who had foretold the return of the Jews to their own land,
and the rebuilding of Jerusalem. Or it may be, that the prophet refers
more particularly to himself as having made a full prediction of this
event. The parallel expression, 'his messengers,' however, is in the
plural number, and thus it is rendered probable that the word here
refers to the prophets collectively. The idea is, that it was a
characteristic of God to establish the words of his servants the
prophets, and that their predictions in regard to the return from the
captivity in a special manner would be fulfilled.

The counsel of his messengers - The prophets whom he had sent to
announce future events, and to give counsel and consolation to the
nation.

That saith to Jerusalem - Jerusalem is here supposed to be lying in
ruins, and the people to be in captivity in Babylon. In this situation,
God is represented as addressing desolate Jerusalem, and saying, that it
should be again inhabited, and that the cities of Judah should be
rebuilt.

The decayed places - Margin, 'Wastes.' No land, probably, was ever more
completely desolated than the land of Judea when its inhabitants were
carried to Babylon.

[Isaiah 44:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">isa 44:27</span></span>

That saith to the deep, Be dry - Lowth supposes, that this refers to the
fact that Cyrus took Babylon by diverting from their course the waters
of the river Euphrates, and thus leaving the bed of the river dry, so
that he could march his army under the walls of the city (see the notes
at Isa. 13; 14) With this interpretation, also, Vitringa, John II
Michaelis, Grotius, Rosenmuller, and some others, accord. Gesenius
supposes that it is a description of the power of God in general; and
some others have referred it to the dividing of the waters of the Red
Sea when the Hebrews came out of Egypt, as in [Isa
43:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#016). The most obvious
interpretation is that of Lowth, Vitringa, etc., by which it is supposed
that it refers to the drying up of the Euphrates and the streams about
Babylon, when Cyrus took the city. The principal reasons for this
interpretation are, first, that the entire statement in these verses has
reference to the events connected with the taking of Babylon; secondly,
that it is strikingly descriptive of the manner in which the city was
taken by Cyrus; and thirdly, that Cyrus is expressly mentioned [Isa
44:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#028), as being concerned in the
transaction here referred to. The word rendered 'deep' (צוּלה tsûlâh)
denotes properly anything sunk; the depth of the sea; an abyss. 'But it
may be applied to a deep river, and especially to the Euphrates, as a
deep and mighty stream. In [Jer 51:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#036),
the word 'sea' is applied to the Euphrates:

'I will dry up her sea,

And make her springs dry.'

Cyrus took the city of Babylon, after having besieged it a long time in
vain, by turning the waters of the river into a vast lake, forty miles
square, which had been constructed in order to carry off the superfluous
waters in a time of inundation. By doing this, he laid the channel of
the river almost dry, and was thus enabled to enter the city above and
below, under the walls, and to take it by surprise. The Septuagint
renders the word 'deep' here by Ἀβύσσῳ Abussō - 'Abyss.' The Chaldee,
'Who says to Babylon, Be desolate, and I will dry up your streams.'

I will dry up thy rivers - Referring doubtless to the numerous canals or
artificial streams by which Babylon and the adjacent country were
watered. These were supplied from the Euphrates, and when that was
diverted from its usual bed, of course they became dry.

[Isaiah 44:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">isa 44:28</span></span>

That saith of Cyrus - This is the first time in which Cyrus is expressly
named by Isaiah, though he is often referred to. He is mentioned by him
only in one other place expressly by name [Isa
45:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001). He is several times mentioned
elsewhere in the Old Testament [Ch2
26:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#022); [Ezr
1:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001), [Ezr
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#007); [Ezr
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#007); [Ezr
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#003); [Ezr
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#013), [Ezr
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#017); [Dan
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#021); [Dan
6:28](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#028); [Dan
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#001). He began his reign about 550
b.c., and this prophecy was therefore delivered not far from a hundred
and fifty years before he ascended the throne. None but God himself, or
he whom God inspired, could have mentioned so long before, the name of
him who should deliver the Jewish people from bondage; and if this was
delivered, therefore, by Isaiah, it proves that he was under divine
inspiration. The name of Cyrus (כורשׁ kôresh; Greek Κῦrος Kuros) the
Greek writers say, means 'the sun.' It is contracted from the Persian
word khorschid, which in that language has this signification. Cyrus was
the celebrated king of the Medes and Persians, and was the son of
Cambyses the Persian, and of Mandane, daughter of Astyages, king of the
Medes. For an account of his character and reign, see the notes at [Isa
41:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#002), where I have anticipated all
that is needful to be said here.

He is my shepherd - A shepherd is one who leads and guides a flock, and
then the word denotes, by a natural and easy metaphor, a ruler, or
leader of a people. Thus the name is given to Moses in [Isa
43:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#002); compare [Psa
77:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#020), and [Eze
34:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#023). The name here is given to Cyrus
because God would employ him to conduct his people again to their own
land. The word 'my' implies, that he was under the direction of God, and
was employed in his service.

And shall perform all my pleasure - In destroying the city and kingdom
of Babylon; in delivering the Jewish captives; and in rebuilding
Jerusalem, and the temple.

Even saying to Jerusalem - That is, I say to Jerusalem. The Vulgate, and
the Septuagint renders this as meaning God, and not Cyrus, and doubtless
this is the true construction. It was one of the things which God would
do, to say to Jerusalem that it should be rebuilt.

And to the temple - Though now desolate and in ruins, yet it shall be
reconstructed, and its foundation shall be firmly laid. The phrase 'to
Jerusalem,' and 'to the temple,' should be rendered 'of,' in accordance
with a common signification of the preposition ל (l), and as it is
rendered in the former part of the verse when speaking of Cyrus (compare
[Gen 20:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#013); [Jdg
9:54](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#054)). It was indeed under the
direction of Cyrus that the city of Jerusalem was rebuilt, and the
temple reconstructed [Ezr 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001); but
still it was to be traced to God, who raised him up for this purpose.
That this passage was seen by Cyrus is the testimony of Josephus, and is
morally certain from the nature of the case, since, otherwise, it is
incredible that he should have aided the Jews in returning to their own
land, and in rebuilding their city and temple (see the Introduction,
Section 2). This is one of the numerous instances in the Bible, in which
God claims control and jurisdiction even over pagan princes and
monarchs, and in which he says that their plans are under his direction,
and made subservient to his will. It is one of the proofs that God
presides over all, and that he makes the voluntary purposes of people
subservient to him, and a part of the means of executing his glorious
designs in relation to his people. Indeed, all the proud monarchs and
conquerors of the earth have been in some sense instruments in his hand
of executing his pleasure.
