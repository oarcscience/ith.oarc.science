### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#001)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 4:1</span></span>

Solomon, that is, was king over "all Israel" from the first; not like
David, who for seven and a half years reigned over Judah only. This
feature well introduces the glory of Solomon and the organisation of the
court, of which the historian in this chapter intends to give us a
general sketch. Solomon constitutes certain "princes" or officers of the
first rank, deriving their station from him, and probably holding it
during pleasure.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg1 4:2</span></span>

Azariah, the son of Zadok, the priest - "The priest" here belongs to
Azariah, not to Zadok. The term used כהן kôhên means sometimes a priest,
sometimes a civil officer, with perhaps a semi-priestly character. (See
[Sa2 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#018) note.) In this place it has
the definite article prefixed, and can only mean "the high priest."
Azariah, called here the "son," but really the "grandson," of Zadok,
seems to have succeeded him in the priesthood [Ch1
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#010). His position as high priest at
the time when this list was made out gives Azariah the foremost place in
it.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg1 4:3</span></span>

Shisha, or Shavsha [Ch1 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#016), seems
also to have been called Sheva [Sa2
20:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#025), and Seraiah [Sa2
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#017).

The "scribes" were probably royal "secretaries" (margin), who drew up
the king's edicts, wrote his letters, and perhaps managed his finances
[Kg1 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#010). They were among his most
influential councillors.

By "recorder" or "remembrancer" (margin), we must understand "court
annalist" (marginal reference "a").

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg1 4:4</span></span>

It is curious to find Abiathar in this list of princes, after what has
been said of his disgrace [Kg1 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#027),
[Kg1 2:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#035). Some have supposed that
after a while Solomon pardoned him. Perhaps the true explanation is that
the historian here enumerates all those who were accounted "princes" in
any part of Solomon's reign.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg1 4:5</span></span>

The son of Nathan - It is uncertain whether the Nathan of this verse is
the prophet or the son of David [Sa2
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#014). While on the one hand the
position of "king's friend" is more likely to have been held by a
contemporary, which the prophet's son would have been, than by one so
much younger as the son of a younger brother; on the other hand the
title "cohen" seems to point to a member of the royal family. (See the
next note.) Azariah who was "over the officers" was chief, that is, of
the "officers" mentioned in [Kg1
4:8-19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#008), as appears from the identity
of the term here used with the title by which they are designated in
[Kg1 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#007).

Principal officer - Or, "cohen." The fact that the title כהן kôhên was
borne by sons of David [Sa2 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#018), who
could not be "priests" in the ordinary sense of the word, seems to
identify the Nathan of this verse with David's son [Sa2
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#014) rather than with the prophet.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg1 4:6</span></span>

Over the household - Comptroller of the household, like the "Steward" of
the Persian court. On the importance of this office, see [Kg2
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#018), and compare [Isa
22:15-25](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#015).

The tribute - The marginal reading, "levy," is preferable. The reference
is to the forced laborers whom Solomon employed in his great works
(marginal reference).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg1 4:7</span></span>

The requirement of a portion of their produce from subjects, in addition
to money payments, is a common practice of Oriental monarchs. It
obtained in ancient, and it still obtains in modern, Persia.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg1 4:8</span></span>

In this arrangement of the territory into twelve portions, the divisions
of the tribes seem to have been adopted as far as could be managed
without unfairness. The prefecture of Ben-Hur corresponded nearly to the
territory of Ephraim; that of Ben-Dekar to Dan; that of Ben-Hesed to
Judah; those of Ben-Abinadab and Baana to Cis-Jordanic Manasseh; that of
Ben-Geber to Manasseh beyond Jordan; of Abinadab to Gad; of Ahimaaz to
Naphtali; of Baanah to Asher; of Jehoshaphat to Issachar; of Shimei to
Benjamin; and of Geber to Reuben. The order in which the prefectures are
mentioned is clearly not the geographical. Perhaps it is the order in
which they had to supply the king's table.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg1 4:9</span></span>

For some of the names, see [Jos
19:41-43](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#041).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg1 4:10</span></span>

Sochoh - See [Jos 15:35](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#035).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg1 4:11</span></span>

Dor - See [Jos 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#002) note. It has
always been a practice among Oriental potentates to attach to themselves
the more important of their officers by giving them for wives princesses
of the royal house. Hence, the union here between Ben-Abinadab (probably
Solomon's first cousin, compare [Sa1
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#008)) and Taphath. Compare [Kg1
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#015).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg1 4:12</span></span>

On these cities see [Jos 12:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#021); [Jos
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#016); [Jdg
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#022); [Jos
21:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#022).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg1 4:13</span></span>

It will be observed that five out of the twelve prefects are designated
solely by their father's names, Ben-Hur, etc., while one (Ahimaaz, [Kg1
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#015)) has no such designation.
Probably the document, which the author of the Book of Kings consulted,
had contained originally the proper name and father's name of each
prefect; but it was mutilated or illegible in places at the time when he
consulted it. If it was in the shape of a list, a single mutilation at
one corner might have removed four of the six wanting names.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg1 4:14</span></span>

See the margin. Ahinadab had the territory from the places last
mentioned as far as Mahanaim [Gen
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#002).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg1 4:19</span></span>

The meaning of the last clause is somewhat doubtful. On the whole, our
King James Version may well stand as nearly correct. The writer has
assigned to Geber a wide stretch of territory; and, anticipating
surprise, assures his readers " (there was but) one officer who
(purveyed) in this land."

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg1 4:20</span></span>

There is some doubt about the proper arrangement of the remainder of
this chapter. The best alteration, if we alter the Hebrew order at all,
would be to place [Kg1 4:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#020) after
[Kg1 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#025).

Many ... - See [Kg1 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#008) note; and
compare [Psa 127:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#001), which is
traditionally ascribed to Solomon, and which celebrates the populousness
and security of Israel in his day.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg1 4:21</span></span>

Solomon's empire, like all the great empires of Asia down to the time of
the Persians, consisted of a congeries of small kingdoms, all ruled by
their own kings [Kg1 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#024), who
admitted the suzerainty of the Jewish monarch, and paid him "presents,"
i. e., an annual tribute (see [Kg1
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#025)).

Unto the land of the Philistines - There is no word corresponding to
"unto" in the Hebrew. The construction should be, "Solomon reigned over
all the kingdoms from the river (i. e., the Euphrates: see the marginal
references), over the land of the Philistines," etc. The writer draws
attention to the fact that the extent of Solomon's kingdom was in
accordance with the promises made to Abraham, Moses, and Joshua.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg1 4:22</span></span>

Thirty measures - (margin, cors) The cor, which was the same measure as
the homer, is computed, on the authority of Josephus, at 86 English
gallons, on the authority of the rabbinical writers at 44. Thirty cors,
even at the lower estimate, would equal 1,320 gallons, or 33 of our
"sacks;" and the 90 cors of fine and coarse flour would altogether equal
99 sacks. From the quantity of flour consumed, it has been conjectured
that the number of those who fed at the royal board was 14,000.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg1 4:23</span></span>

Harts ... - The exact sorts of wild land animals here intended are very
uncertain. Perhaps it would be best to translate "wild-goats, gazelles,
and wild oxen," which abounded in the wilder parts of Syria, from where
Solomon would be supplied. (See [Kg1
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#024).) (Yahmur, or the "roebuck,"
gives its name to a valley in a wooded district, south of Carmel
(Conder).) The use of game at the royal banquets of Assyria appears in
the sculptures.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg1 4:24</span></span>

On this side the river - i. e., the region west of the Euphrates.

Tiphsah, or Tiphsach, the place on the Euphrates called Thapsacus. The
word means "ford," or "passage," being formed from פסח pâsach, "to pass
over" (compare "paschal"). It is the modern Suriyeh, forty-five miles
below Balls, at the point where the Euphrates changes its course from
south to southeast by east. The stream is fordable here, and nowhere
else in this part of its course. Solomon's possession of Thapsacus would
have been very favorable to his schemes of land commerce [Kg1
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#019).

To Azzah - i. e., Gaza.

All the kings - Compare Josh. 12:9-24. In Philistia, small as it was,
there were five kings [Sa1 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#018). Syria
was divided into numerous small states, as many as thirty-two kings
being mentioned on one occasion [Kg1
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#001). The Hittites were ruled by a
great number of chieftains or princes [Kg1
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#029); [Kg2
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#006). twelve are mentioned in the
Assyrian inscriptions.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg1 4:25</span></span>

Under his vine ... - This phrase seems to have been common among the
Jews, and even among neighboring nations [Kg2
18:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#031), to express a time of quiet and
security. It is used by the prophets in descriptions of the Messianic
kingdom (marginal references).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg1 4:26</span></span>

In [Ch2 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#025), the number of stalls for
Solomon's chariot horses is stated at 4,000, instead of 40,000. The
number in the present passage is probably a corruption. Solomon's
chariots were but 1,400 [Kg1 10:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#026);
[Ch2 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#014), for which 40,000 horses
could not possibly be required. The Assyrian chariots had at most three
horses apiece, while some had only two. 4,000 horses would supply the
full team of three to 1,200, and the smaller team of two to 200
chariots. The number 4,000 is in due proportion to the 12,000 horses for
cavalry, and is in accordance with all that we know of the military
establishments of the time and country. Compare [Ch2
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#003); [Sa2
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#004).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">kg1 4:28</span></span>

Barley is to this day in the East the common food of horses.

Dromedaries - Coursers. The animal intended is neither a camel nor a
mule, but a swift horse.

The place where the officers were - Rather, "places where the horses and
coursers were," i. e., to the different cities where they were lodged.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg1 4:29</span></span>

Largeness of heart - What we call "great capacity." The expression which
follows is common in reference to numerical multitude [Kg1
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#020), but its use here to express mere
amplitude or greatness is unique.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">kg1 4:30</span></span>

Children of the east country - Rather, "of the East" - the Beni Kedem -
a distinct tribe, who occupied both sides of the Euphrates along its
middle course (marginal reference). They were mostly nomads, who dwelt
in tents [Jer 49:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#028). Job belonged
to them [Job 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#003), as did probably his
three friends; and, perhaps, Balsam [Num
23:7](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#007). They must have been either Arabs
or Aramaeans. We may see in the Book of Job the character of their
"wisdom." Like Solomon's, it was chiefly gnomic but included some
knowledge of natural history. The "wisdom of Egypt" was of a different
kind. It included magic [Gen 41:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#008);
[Exo 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#011), geometry, medicine,
astronomy, architecture, and a dreamy mystic philosophy, of which
metempsychosis was the main principle. It is not probable that Solomon
was, like Moses (marginal reference), deeply versed in Egyptian science.
The writer only means to say that his wisdom was truer and more real
than all the much-praised wisdom of Egypt.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">kg1 4:31</span></span>

It is most probable that the persons with whom Solomon is compared were
contemporaries, men noted for "wisdom," though there is no other mention
of them.

His fame was in all nations - See below, 1 Kings 10.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">kg1 4:32</span></span>

Proverbs - In the collection which forms the "Book of Proverbs," only a
small portion has been preserved, less certainly than one thousand out
of the three. Ecclesiastes, if it is Solomon's, would add between one
hundred and two hundred more proverbs. But the great bulk of Solomon's
proverbs has perished.

Songs - Of these, Canticles is probably one (marginal reference): Ps.
72; [Psa 127:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#001) may also be of the
number. Probably the bulk of Solomon's songs were of a secular
character, and consequently were not introduced into the canon of
Scripture.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">kg1 4:33</span></span>

Trees ... - A keen appreciation of the beauties of nature, and a habit
of minute observation, are apparent in the writings of Solomon that
remain to us. The writer here means to say that Solomon composed special
works on these subjects. The Lebanon cedars were the most magnificent of
all the trees known to the Hebrews, and hence, represent in the Old
Testament the grandest of vegetable productions. ([Psa
104:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#016); [Sol
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#015); [Eze
31:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#003), etc.) For the hyssop, see [Exo
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#022) note.

Of beasts, and of fowls, and of creeping things, and of fishes - This is
the usual Biblical division of the animal kingdom [Gen
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#026); [Gen
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#002); [Psa
148:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#010).
