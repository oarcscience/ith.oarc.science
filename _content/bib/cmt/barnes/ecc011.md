### [Ecclesiastes Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#001)

[Ecclesiastes](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ecc 11:0</span></span>

There ought to be no division between [Ecc
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#020) and [Ecc
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#001).

As if in contrast to the self-indulgence described in [Ecc
10:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#016), the opposite virtue,
readiness to give to others, is inculcated. The use of the word "bread"
in both [Ecc 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#019) (see the note) and
[Ecc 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#001) points the contrast.

[Ecclesiastes 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ecc 11:1</span></span>

The verse means: "Show hospitality, even though the corresponding return
of hospitality to you may seem improbable; nevertheless, be hospitable
in faith." Compare [Luk 14:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#013); [Heb
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#002). Some interpreters (not
unreasonably) understand by "bread" the seed from the produce of which
bread is made. Seed cast upon the fertile soil flooded by the early
rains would be returned to the sower in autumn with large increase.

[Ecclesiastes 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ecc 11:2</span></span>

The verse means: "Let your hospitality and your alms be extensive: for
you know not what reverses may befall either that person who by your
liberality will be strengthened to meet them, or yourself who may come
to need grateful friends." Compare [Luk
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#009).

Seven, and also to eight - A definite number for an indefinite (compare
marginal reference).

[Ecclesiastes 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ecc 11:3</span></span>

"Unforeseen events come from God; and the man who is always gazing on
the uncertain future will neither begin nor complete any useful work:
but do thou bear in mind that times and circumstances, the powers of
nature and the results to which they minister, are in the hand of God;
and be both diligent and trustful." The images are connected chiefly
with the occupation of an agricultural laborer: the discharge of rain
from the cloud, and the inclination of the falling tree, and the
direction of the wind, are beyond his control, though the result of his
work is affected by them. The common application of the image of the
fallen tree to the state of departed souls was probably not in the mind
of the inspired writer.

[Ecc 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#005)

Spirit - The same Hebrew word (like πνεῦμα pneuma in Greek and "Spirit"
in English) signifies both the wind [Ecc
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#004) and the Spirit (compare marginal
reference). The Old Testament in many places recognizes the special
operation of God [Job 10:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#008); [Psa
139:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#013); [Jer
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#005), and distinctly of the Spirit of
God [Job 31:15](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#015) in the origination of
every child. Compare [Gen 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#007).

[Ecclesiastes 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ecc 11:7</span></span>

The preceding exhortation to a life of labor in the sight of God is now
addressed especially to the active and the young; and is enforced by
another consideration, namely, the transitory character of all that
sustains youth.

[Ecc 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#007)

The light ... the sun - Gifts of God which cheer man's toil, but which
he almost ceases to appreciate in his old age.

[Ecc 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#008)

Days of darkness - The time of old age, and perhaps any time of sorrow
or misfortune. Compare [Ecc 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#002).

All that cometh - i. e., "The future," which must not be reckoned on by
the active man, as if his present state of healthy energy were to
continue.

[Ecc 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#009)

Rejoice ... cheer ... walk - The imperative mood is used to encourage
one who possesses certain gifts from God to remember that they come from
God and are to be used in accordance with His will.

In the ways ... - The words are probably used in an innocent sense [Ecc
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#010); [Pro
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#009).

Judgment - This includes a judgment beyond the grave; though the
writer's view of it was dim and indefinite if compared with Christian's.

[Ecc 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#010)

The sense appears to be, "Let the timely recollection of God's judgment,
and of the fleeting character of youth, so influence your conduct that
you will refrain from acts which entail future remorse and pain."
