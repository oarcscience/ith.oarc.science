<p>Every city and village - Of Galilee.
<p>Preaching an showing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God - That the kingdom of God was about to come, or that his reign in the gospel was about to be set up over people. See the notes at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002">Mat 3:2</A>.
<p>The twelve - The twelve apostles.

<p>Infirmities - Sickness.
<p>Mary called Magdalene - So called from "Magdula," the place of her residence. It was situated on the Sea of Galilee, south of Capernaum. To this place Jesus retired after feeding the 4,000. See the notes at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#039">Mat 15:39</A>.
<p>Out of whom went - By the power of Jesus.
<p>Seven devils - The word "seven" is often used for an indefinite number, and "may" signify merely "many" devils. The expression is used to signify that she was grievously tormented, and rendered, doubtless, insane by the power of evil spirits. See the notes at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#024">Mat 4:24</A>. It has been commonly supposed that Mary Magdalene was a woman of abandoned character, but of this there is not the least evidence. All that we know of her is that she was formerly grievously afflicted by the presence of those evil spirits, that she was perfectly cured by Jesus, and that afterward she became one of his most faithful and humble followers. She was at his crucifixion <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#025">Joh 19:25</A> and burial <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#047">Mar 15:47</A>, and she was among those who had prepared the materials to embalm him <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#001">Mar 16:1</A>, and who first went to the sepulchre after the resurrection; and what is particularly interesting in her history, she was the first to whom the risen Redeemer appeared <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#009">Mar 16:9</A>, and his conversation with her is exceeded in interest and pathos by no passage of history, sacred or profane, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#011">Joh 20:11-18</A>.

<p>Herod's steward - Herod Antipas, who reigned in Galilee. He was a son of Herod the Great. The word "steward" means one who has charge of the domestic affairs of a family, to provide for it. This office was generally held by a "slave" who was esteemed the most faithful, and was often conferred as a reward of fidelity.
<p>Ministered - Gave for his support.
<p>Of their substance - Their property; their possessions. Christians then believed, when they professed to follow Christ, that it was proper to give "all" up to him - their property as well as their hearts; and the same thing is still required that is, to commit all that we have to his disposal; to be willing to part with it for the promotion of his glory, and to leave it when he calls us away from it.
