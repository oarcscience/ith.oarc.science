### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#001)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 13:1</span></span>

The history here, down to the end of 2 Sam. 23 (excepting a few
particulars), is omitted in the Book of Chronicles.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa2 13:3</span></span>

Shimeah - Called Shamma (marginal reference), was Jesse's third son.

Subtil - literally, wise. The word is generally used in a good sense,
but here, and in [Job 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#013), it means
crafty.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa2 13:5</span></span>

Make thyself sick - "Feign thyself to be ill." (Compare [Sa2
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#002).)

That I may see it - He was to feign that he could not fancy anything
that came from the kitchen, but that if he saw it cooked he should be
able to eat it.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa2 13:6</span></span>

Make me cakes ... a pan - The words here used occur nowhere else, and
the etymology is doubtful. Some particular kind of cake or pudding is
meant [Sa2 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#008), called a לביבה
lābı̂ybâh; according to some, it was, from its etymology, shaped like a
heart.

[Sa2 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#009)

The dish into which she poured the לביבה lābı̂ybâh was doubtless borne to
him by one of the servants into the chamber where he lay, and from
which, the doors being open, he could see the outer room where Tamar
prepared the meat.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa2 13:12</span></span>

Tamar's words are a verbal quotation from [Gen
34:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#007). The natural inference is that
Tamar knew the passage in Genesis, and wished to profit by the warning
that it contained. (Compare also [Sa2
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#013).)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa2 13:13</span></span>

My shame - Better, "my reproach." Compare [Gen
30:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#023); [Gen
34:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#014); [Sa1
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#002).

Speak unto the king ... - It cannot be inferred with certainty from this
that marriages were usual among half brothers and sisters in the time of
David. The Levitical law forbade them (marginal reference), and Tamar
may have merely wished to temporize. On the other hand, the debasing and
unhumanizing institution of the harem, itself contrary to the law of
Moses [Deu 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#017), may well have led to
other deviations from its precepts, and the precedent of Abraham [Gen
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#012) may have seemed to give some
sanction to this particular breach of it.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa2 13:16</span></span>

The sense of the passage probably is, "And she spake with him on account
of this great wrong in sending me away, greater than the other wrong
which thou hast done me (said she), but he hearkened not unto her." The
Hebrew text is probably corrupt, and the writer blends Tamar's words
with his own narrative.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa2 13:18</span></span>

A garment of divers colors - See [Gen
37:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#003). Some prefer here (and there) "a
tunic with sleeves," a tunic reaching to the extremities, i. e. the
hands and feet, and worn over the common tunic, in room of a robe.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa2 13:19</span></span>

Laid her hand on her head - To hold on the ashes (see the marginal
references).

Went on crying - i. e. "went away, crying out as she went."

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa2 13:21</span></span>

The Septuagint adds, what is a good explanation, "but he did not vex the
spirit of Amnon his son, because he loved him, because he was his
first-born." This want of justice in David's conduct, and favoritism to
Amnon, probably rankled in Absalom's heart, and was the first seed of
his after rebellion.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">sa2 13:23</span></span>

Sheepshearing was always a time of feasting (marginal references).
Baal-hazor is not known.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">sa2 13:26</span></span>

He mentions Amnon as being the king's first-born. If he could not have
the king's company, let him at least have that of the heir apparent, and
the king's other sons.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">sa2 13:29</span></span>

Upon his mule - So in [Kg1 1:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#033), [Kg1
1:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#038) the mule is the royal animal on
which David himself rides. In [Sa2
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#009) Absalom rides upon a mule.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">sa2 13:32</span></span>

The history supplies another (compare [Sa2
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#003)) instance of Jonadab's subtlety
and sagacity. He at once gave the true explanation of the catastrophe at
Baal-hazor, in spite of the false rumour.

By the appointment of Absalom ... - Meaning that Absalom's resolution to
slay Amnon had been formed at the time, and only waited an opportunity
to give expression to it.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:34](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">sa2 13:34</span></span>

Absalom fled - This is the sequel to [Sa2
13:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#029). The king's sons rose from table
and fled, and Absalom taking advantage of the confusion, also escaped
and fled. This information is inserted here to account for the king's
sons returning unmolested.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:35](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">sa2 13:35</span></span>

The watchman, as his duty was, had sent immediate notice to the king
that he saw a crowd approaching (see [Kg2
9:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#017)). Jonadab, who was with the
king, was prompt to give the explanation.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:37](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">sa2 13:37</span></span>

See the marginal reference.

Ammihur (see the margin) is found as a Punic name.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:39](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">sa2 13:39</span></span>

Longed to go forth - Rather, "longed after Absalom," literally, was
consumed in going forth, with a sense of disappointed hope.
