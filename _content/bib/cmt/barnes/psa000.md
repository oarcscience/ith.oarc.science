Introduction to the Psalm

Section 1. "The Title to the Book of Psalm."

The general title to the Book of Psalms in Hebrew is תהלים Tehilliym,
Psalms, or more fully, תהלים ספר Sêpher Tehilliym, "Book of Psalms?"
Sometimes a shorter title is used - תלים Tilliym. Other terms are used
as appropriate to particular psalms, as מזמורים mizmôriym, or שׁירים
shı̂yriym, songs; or in the singular, מזמור mizmôr, and שׁיר shı̂yr, a
song. These latter titles, however, are not given to the entire
collection, but to particular psalms. The former title - מזמור mizmôr -
is given to [Psa 3:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#001); [Psa
4:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#001); [Psa
5:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#001); [Psa
6:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#001); [Psa
8:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#001); Ps. 9; [Psa
12:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#001); [Psa
13:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#001); [Psa
15:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#001); [Psa
19:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#001); [Psa
20:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#001); [Psa
21:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#001); Ps. 22; [Psa
23:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#001); and to 39 others, the last
being [Psa 143:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#001), rendered
uniformly "a psalm." The latter title, שׁיר shı̂yr, occurs in [Psa
30:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#001); Ps. 45; [Psa
46:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#001); and in 27 other psalms, the
last being [Psa 134:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#001), and is
uniformly rendered "song," though it is sometimes connected with the
word מזמור mizmôr, psalm, and rendered "A song and psalm," as in [Psa
48:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#001); [Psa
65:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#001); Ps. 66; [Psa
67:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#001); Ps. 68; Ps. 69; [Psa
75:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#001); Ps. 83; [Psa
87:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#001); Ps. 88; and in [Psa
122:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#001); [Psa
123:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa123.htm#001); [Psa
124:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#001) it is connected with the word
degrees: "A song of degrees."

The word תהלים Tehilliym is derived from the verb - הלל hâlal, to
praise, as in the word "Hallelujah, Praise Jehovah." The name is given
to the general collection, because praise, more than anything else, is
the characteristic of the book, and because the collection seems to have
been designed to be used in the public praise or worship of God. They
were all probably thus used in Hebrew worship.

The word "Psalms," as applied to the collection, we have derived from
the Greek translation, the word ψαλμοὶ psalmoi, in the plural -
"psalmos" (a psalm) and "psalmoi" (psalms). This word is derived from
ψάλλω psallō, to touch, to twitch, to pluck - as the hair or beard; and
then, to touch or twitch a string, "to twang," that is, to cause it to
vibrate by touching or twitching it with the finger or with a "plectrum"
(πλῆκτρον plēktron) - an instrument for striking the strings of a lyre,
as a quill. Cic. N. D., 2. 59. Hence, the word is applied to instruments
of music employed in praise, and then to acts of praise in general. The
noun - ψαλμός psalmos, - "psalm," means properly "a touching, twang," as
of a bowstring, or of stringed instruments; then a song, as accompanying
stringed instruments; and then specifically a psalm or song of praise to
God. Thus, the verb - ψάλλω psallō, - is used in the New Testament as
denoting "praise" in the following places: [Rom
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#009), "I will confess ... and "sing"
unto Thy name;" [Co1 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#015), "I will
sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding;" [Eph
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#019), "Singing and making melody in
your heart to the Lord;" [Jam 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#013),
"Is any merry? let him sing psalms."

The verb does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament. The "noun" -
ψαλμός psalmos, - is used in the New Testament in the following places
as denoting psalms in general: [Co1
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#026), "Every one of you hath a
psalm;" [Eph 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#019), "Speaking to
yourselves in psalms;" [Col 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#016),
"Admonishing one another in psalms." In the following places it is
applied in the New Testament to the Book of Psalms, considered as a
collection of songs of praise; - [Luk
20:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#042), "David himself saith in the
Book of Psalms;" - [Luk 24:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#044), "All
things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in
the prophets, and in the Psalms, concerning me:" see the notes on that
passage; - [Act 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#020), "It is written
in the Book of Psalms;" - [Act 13:33](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#033),
"It is also written in the second psalm." The word does not occur
elsewhere in the New Testament.

Section 2. "The Authors of the Psalm."

The Psalms thus collected into a book are by no means the production of
one poet or one age. They stretch through a long period of Jewish
history, certainly from the time of Moses to the time of the return from
the captivity of Babylon, and probably later, and they are modified by
all the varieties incident to the peculiarities of their respective
authors; to individual and national history; to the times in which they
were composed. So many of them, however, are the composition of David,
that it is customary to speak of them as "The Psalms of David," though
it is probable that not much more than half of the psalms in the
collection were written by him. Of the 150 psalms comprising the
collection, according to the enumeration in the Hebrew manuscripts, not
quite one half are usually ascribed to him. According to DeWette, 74; to
Kennicott, 66; to DeRossi, 67; to Rosenmuller and Eichhorn, 71; and to
Hengstenberg, 80. It is probable, however, that a portion of the psalms
to which no name is prefixed in the title - but how great a portion it
is impossible now to determine - is the production of David. Still, so
many are known to have been composed by him, and he was so eminent as a
poet, as to justify the language which is so frequently employed when
they are called familiarly "The Psalms of David."

The following persons are mentioned in the titles as authors of psalms:

\(1\) One psalm Ps. 90 is ascribed to Moses. In regard to the question
whether this is to be regarded as a composition of Moses, see the notes
on the psalm. No other psalm in the collection is ascribed to him,
though not a few specimens of his poetry are preserved in the
Pentateuch. Why this was not incorporated with his other writings, or
how it was preserved until it obtained a permanent place in the Book of
Psalms, cannot now be determined.

\(2\) David occupies a prominent position as the author of many of the
psalms in the collection, but, as has been remarked above, critics are
divided in opinion as to the exact number that should be ascribed to
him. In the Hebrew inscriptions of the Psalms, 68 are attributed to him.
The difference between this number and that noted above in regard to the
opinions of DeWette, Kennicott, DeRossi, Rosenmuller, Eichhorn,
Hengstenberg, and others, arises from the variations in the manuscripts
in respect to these inscriptions; the different value attached to these
inscriptions by various critics; the fact that some psalms, though
without a title in the Hebrew, are supposed to be so certainly the
production of David as to make it proper to ascribe them to him; and the
fact that some of the psalms ascribed to him are supposed by different
writers to belong to a later period of the Jewish history than his time,
and that, consequently, the title by which they are attributed to David
is an error. There is every reason to suppose that some of the psalms
now without a title are the composition of David, though it is not
known, and cannot now be known, why they are not ascribed to him in the
titles of the psalms themselves. In consequence of these facts, it is
impossible now to determine with exact precision how many of the psalms
are to be ascribed to David; though the number is undoubtedly so great
that he is to be regarded as the principal author of the collection.

\(3\) Twelve of the psalms, Ps. 50; Ps. 73; Ps. 74; [Psa
75:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#001); [Psa
76:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#001); Ps. 77; Ps. 78; [Psa
79:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#001); Ps. 80; Ps. 81; [Psa
82:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#001); Ps. 83; are ascribed to Asaph.
These, it will be seen, occupy a place together in the collection Ps.
63-83, with the exception of [Psa
1:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001). The reason for this arrangement
cannot now be known. DeWette (Einleitung, III. iii.) supposes that, with
the exception of [Psa 1:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001). and Ps.
73, these are improperly ascribed to Asaph, as, in his view, they
pertain to later times of the Jewish history, Ps. 74; [Psa
79:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#001) to the destruction of the
temple and the city; Ps. 80 to the Exile, etc. Compare the notes on the
introduction to those psalms (Ps. 74; Ps. 79; Ps. 80).

\(4\) Eleven of the psalms, [Psa
42:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001); Ps. 44; Ps. 45; [Psa
46:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#001); [Psa
47:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#001); [Psa
48:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#001); Ps. 49; [Psa
84:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#001); [Psa
85:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#001); [Psa
87:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#001); Ps. 88; are ascribed to "the
sons of Korah," as the authors, or are "for the sons of Korah." See the
notes to the introduction of [Psa
42:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001). It is not certain whether
these were composed by "the sons of Korah," or were composed for "the
sons of Korah;" that is, for the company of musicians to whom the
direction of the music in the temple was confided. It is obvious,
however, that if the meaning is that they were composed by "the sons of
Korah," this furnishes no information as to the individual authorship of
the psalms. By which one of them they were composed, or whether by more
than one, of course is not indicated by a title so general. DeWette
supposes that most of these psalms pertain to the times of the Exile, or
to a later period. There is nothing very unique in the character of
these psalms; nothing which in themselves could lead us to conclude that
they were composed by those to whom they are ascribed, rather than by
David or Asaph.

\(5\) Two psalms, Ps. 88; Ps. 89 are ascribed to a person called "The
Ezrahite." One of these, Ps. 88, is ascribed to" the Ezrahite," and the
other, Ps. 89, to Ethan the Ezrahite." The former of these is also
reckoned among those which pertain to the "sons of Korah." Ethan and
Heman were probably, however, different persons, to each of whom the
name "Ezrahite" might for some reason be applied. In [Kg1
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#031), they are mentioned among others
as remarkable for their wisdom: "For he, Solomon, was wiser than all
men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the
sons of Mahol." In [Ch1 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#006), they are
mentioned as "sons of Zerah:" "Zimri, and Ethan, and Heman, and Calcol,
and Dara." In [Ch1 6:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#033), a Heman is
mentioned as one of the "sons of the Kohathites:" "Heman, a singer, the
son of Joel." So, in [Ch1 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#017), he is
mentioned in connection with Ethan, who is there said to be the son of
Kushaiah; and in [Ch1 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#019), he is
mentioned as associated with Asaph and Ethan: "So the singers, Heman,
Asaph, and Ethan, were appointed to sound with cymbals of brass." In
[Ch1 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#001), Helman is mentioned with
Jeduthun, as one of those whose sons "should prophesy with harps, with
psalteries, and with cymbals." He is there referred to as associated
with Asaph. Compare [Ch2 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#012); [Ch2
29:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#013); [Ch2
35:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#015). Ethan is twice mentioned - [Kg1
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#031) as above, as a wise man, and [Ch1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#006), as above. Compare the notes on
the introduction to Ps. 88; Ps. 89.

\(6\) Two of the psalms, Ps. 72 and [Psa
127:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#001), are ascribed to Solomon, or
are "for Solomon." See the notes on the titles to those psalms (Ps. 72;
Ps. 127). It cannot be positively determined whether those psalms are
his composition, or whether they were composed with reference to him or
for him. The latter would seem to be the more probable opinion in regard
to Ps. 72, so far as can be determined from the contents of the psalm;
but still there is nothing which absolutely prevents us from ascribing
the two to him as the author.

\(7\) Fifteen of the psalms, Ps. 120-134, are entitled "Songs of
Degrees." Of these, four are ascribed to David and one to Solomon. The
names of the authors of the others are not mentioned. Compare the
introduction to the notes on [Psa
120:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#001). They are grouped together
because they appear to have been used on certain special occasions,
rather than from anything special in the psalms themselves.

\(8\) Some of the psalms are ascribed in the Septuagint translation to
Jeremiah, to Ezekiel, to Haggai, and to Zechariah. As there is nothing
corresponding to this in the Hebrew titles, this must have been, of
course, mere conjecture or tradition.

\(9\) There remains a pretty large number of the collection the names of
whose authors are not mentioned; and, of course, there are now no means
of determining the question in regard to the authorship. Such are s.
150. These, it will be seen, are irregularly scattered through the book,
though they are, for the most part, near its close.

In regard to the origin and authority of the titles to the several
psalms, see section 4.

Section 3. "The Formation of the Collection and Arrangement of the Book
of Psalm."

The Jewish Talmud (Cod. Berachot, 1, 9) ascribes the formation of the
Psalter, or the assembling of the Book of Psalms, to David. It is
unnecessary to remark that this cannot be a correct opinion, since many
of the psalms are indubitably of a later date than the time of David.
Most of the Christian fathers, and many critics of modern times, ascribe
the collection and arrangement of the Book to Ezra, and this is now
regarded as the most probable opinion; and if so the whole collection
must have been formed about 450 years before Christ. But though this may
be regarded as the correct opinion in regard to the completion of the
whole as it now stands, yet there is evidence in the psalms themselves
of the existence of smaller collections made before from which the
general one was ultimately formed. By whom those smaller collections
were made is not now known, nor can it be ascertained what changes may
have been made in them when the general collection was formed.

The Book is divided in the Hebrew text into five minor books or
collections, sufficiently marked in their character, and so indicated at
the close of each as to make it every way probable that these may have
been "published," so to speak, in the form of different books, or that
the later were additions to the first collection or volume. This
division is found also in the Septuagint version - a fact which proves
that it existed as early as the year 200 b.c. These portions bear marks
of being not "arbitrary" divisions made at the time when the general
collection was formed, but distinct and independent collections by
different persons. The grouping is not precisely accurate, that is, in
the first part, the "Psalms of David" Ps. 1-41, not all the psalms of
David are included; and there are a few that are not ascribed to him in
the title; but still it was so complete at the time, probably, as to
make it proper to regard it as a collection of "his" psalms in respect
to the purpose for which that collection was made.

The first book embraces the first 41 psalms, and was, probably, a
collection of David's psalms as such, although it does not embrace by
any means all that he wrote, probably not all that were extant at the
time when the collection was made. The "close" of this "book" is
indicated by the words "Amen, and Amen," [Psa
41:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#013). All the psalms in this
collection, except [Psa 1:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001); [Psa
2:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#001); Ps. 10; Ps. 33; are expressly
ascribed to David, and it is every way probable that all were composed
by him. In many manuscripts, in the Septuagint, and in the Latin
Vulgate, the first psalm is united with the second (as are, also, in
other parts of the general collection, [Psa
42:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001) and [Psa
43:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#001); and Ps. 116 and [Psa
117:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/psa117.htm#001)). It is probable that this
collection was early made, though DeWette has endeavored to show that it
could not have been until after the exile, since he supposes that [Psa
14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001) and Ps. 44 were composed after
that event. Of this, however, there is no evidence. Of course it is
impossible to determine by whom this collection was made. It has been
supposed by some that it was as early as the time of Hezekiah, and that
it was prepared under his direction, as he is known to have ordered a
collection of the proverbs of Solomon to be made and written out [Pro
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#001); and as [Ch2
29:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#030) he "commanded the Levites to
sing praise unto the Lord with the words of David." (Kitto,
Encyclopedia)

The second book in the general collection comprises Ps. 42-72. This
collection is made up of the psalms of "the sons of Korah," Ps. 42-49;
of one of the psalms of Asaph, Ps. 50; of 19 psalms of David; of two
whose authors are not named; and of one inscribed "to Solomon," or "for
Solomon," Ps. 72. At the end of this collection [Psa
72:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#020) the following notice is given:
"The prayers of David, the son of Jesse, are ended;" and some have
supposed that this was the close of the entire psalms preceding it, as
one book or collection, Ps. 1-72. Carpzov, Introduction ii. 107. But
that this was a different collection, or that there were two collections
made by different persons, seems evident from the fact that [Psa
53:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#001) is the same as [Psa
14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001); with only slight variations -
the variations consisting mainly in the fact that the word אלהים
'Elohiym is used as the name of God in the latter, in the place of יהוה
Yahweh in the former. It cannot be supposed that a collector would have
used the same psalm with such a variation in the same collection. So
also [Psa 70:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#001) is only a repetition
of [Psa 40:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#013), with only a similar
change.

It may be "suggested" that these two collections may have been
subsequently "united," and may have constituted as one before the more
general collection was made. Thus, the natural "close" of this
collection, as of the first collection [Psa
41:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#013), would be with the words "Amen,
and Amen," [Psa 72:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#019). To the "entire"
collection - the two combined - these words may have been added [Psa
72:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#020), "The prayers of David, the son
of Jesse, are ended," meaning that "now" an entire and complete
collection of the Psalms of David had been made in the "two" combined;
or, that "as many had been combined for public worship as were then
intended to be used in that service." This idea would not prevent the
supposition that there may have been at that time, in fact, other psalms
of David in existence; or that they might have been subsequently
introduced into the worship of God in "other" collections.

The third book Ps. 73-89 consists in part Ps. 73-83 of psalms of Asaph,
and in part Ps. 84-89 of the psalms of the sons of Korah, including one
of David Ps. 86. The book contains none of the psalms of David, with the
exception of Ps. 86; and therefore the notice is given at the end of the
second book [Psa 72:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#020), that "the
prayers of David, the son of Jesse, are ended." It was evidently the
design of the author of the compilation at the "close" of that book not
to admit in the following book any of the psalms of David; perhaps it
was the intention "not" to collect anymore of the psalms of David for
the purpose of public worship. Possibly, as DeWette (Einleitung, p. 21)
suggests, the author of the collection in the third book put the notice
at the end of the second book that David's psalms ended there, it being
his intention to make a collection of another kind. when this collection
was made is unknown. From [Psa 85:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#001)
it would seem probable that it was made as late as the return from the
captivity at Babylon. That psalm may have been written by one of the
company called "the sons of Korah;" or it may have been composed for
their use in the sanctuary. This collection closes, like the two former,
with the expressive "Amen, and Amen," [Psa
89:52](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#052),

The fourth collection Ps. 90-106 is made up wholly of anonymous psalms,
with the exception of Ps. 90, which is ascribed to Moses, and [Psa
101:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#001); Ps. 103; which are ascribed
to David. They are psalms which have almost no local references or
allusions, which might, for the most part, have been composed in any
country or at any period of the world; and which, in their structure and
allusions, give no indication of their authors or of the circumstances
which led to their composition. Their authorship, except in the three
instances above mentioned, cannot now be ascertained; nor is it
necessary to determine that question in order fully to understand and
appreciate them. They were manifestly designed for public worship, and
probably written with the intention of being so used. This book closes
[Psa 106:48](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#048) with the expression "Amen,
Hallelujah."

The fifth and last book Ps. 107-150, is miscellaneous in its character,
and seems to have been intended to be a collection of all the scattered
psalms which would be proper for public worship, which had not found a
place in the other collections. Part ([Psa
108:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#001); Ps. 109; [Psa
110:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001); [Psa
122:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#001); [Psa
124:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#001); [Psa
131:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#001); [Psa
133:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa133.htm#001); the four last being among the
"Songs of Degrees," [Psa 138:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#001); Ps.
139; [Psa 140:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#001); [Psa

when this last collection was made is unknown. It may without
improbability, however, be supposed perhaps that it was made by the
person (Ezra?) who undertook to collect into one the entire "books"
already existing, and who found many psalms that had not been included
by the collectors of the previous books, and who, therefore, grouped all
these together in a single book, to be added in the general collection
to those which had been already classified and arranged.

Section 4. "The Titles to the Several Psalm."

All the psalms, except Ps. 34, now have in the Hebrew titles or
superscriptions. Some, however, reckon only 25 exceptions, as, according
to their view, the phrase, "Hallelujah,"" Praise ye the Lord," occurring
at the commencement of several of the psalms, is regarded by them as a
title or superscription. The more correct supposition, however,
undoubtedly is to regard that phrase as a part of the psalm. To each one
of these exceptions the Talmud gives the name of "Orphan Psalms."

\(a\) The "authorship" of these titles is unknown, and cannot now be
ascertained. They are found in the Hebrew; but it is not to be supposed
that, so far as the "name" of the author of the psalm is concerned, or
so far as they are intended to indicate the author, they were prefixed
to the psalm by the authors themselves. The Psalms are not of the nature
of epistles or histories, and it cannot be supposed that the author
would prefix his name to a mere poem or hymn. The probability,
therefore, is, that they were prefixed to the psalms as they came into
common use, or by the collectors of the several books, or the collector
of the entire book, either as indicating what was the common opinion on
the subject of the authorship, and the occasion on which they were
composed, or as an inspired record in regard to that authorship and
design. The question "by whom" they were prefixed is, however, a point
which cannot now be determined. If it were possible to ascertain that,
it would do much to determine their authority and worth, but the
estimate of their value must now be settled by some other method than
this.

\(b\) These titles are of great "antiquity." The fact that they are
found in the Hebrew manuscripts proves this, for there are no Hebrew
manuscripts, however ancient, without them. They are found, with some
variations, in the Septuagint; and it is thus certain that they existed
before that translation was made. This point is also confirmed by the
fact that the translators of the Septuagint have, in some instances,
copied the Hebrew words in Greek letters, without attempting to
translate them; and that, in other instances, the titles which they use
are translations of the Hebrew words, and show that they must have been
made from a Hebrew original. These facts, however, would not make it
necessary to suppose that they had been prefixed by the writers
themselves, nor would it be "necessary" to suppose that they were
prefixed before the time when the psalms were collected - either the
separate books, or the general collection.

\(c\) The "design" of these titles is either to designate the author of
the psalm, or the occasion on which it was composed, or the chief singer
to whom it was dedicated, and to whom it seems to have been committed to
set it to appropriate music - that is, to arrange the music for a public
use of the psalm; or the style of the poetry; or the instrument which
was to be used; or the "tune" which was to be sung. Some of the titles
simply designate the author, as in many of those ascribed to David; some
describe at length the occasion on which they were written, as Ps. 18;
[Psa 30:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#001); Ps. 51; [Psa
52:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#001); [Psa
56:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#001); etc. Some combine several of
these things together, the author, the occasion, the style of the
poetry, the music to be used, etc., as [Psa
52:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#001); [Psa
53:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#001); [Psa
54:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#001); Ps. 55; [Psa
56:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#001). The longest and fullest of
these titles is that prefixed to [Psa
60:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#001); where we have the dedication
to the chief musician, the name of the author, the style of the poetry,
the design of the psalm, the instrument of music to be employed, and the
historical occasion on which the psalm was composed.

\(d\) It is very difficult at this distance of time to explain the
"meaning" of many of these titles, and critics have differed very
materially in their conjectures on this subject. The difficulty arises
in a considerable degree from our ignorance in regard to the
temple-music, and to the instruments which were employed. The difficulty
is the same which would exist two or three thousand years from the
present time in explaining a book, now familiar, containing "tunes" of
music, and a reference to the instruments of music which are now
employed in the public service of God. It might be difficult, if not
impossible, so to describe the exact instrument of music used as to be
intelligible to a future age; and it would be obviously impossible to
explain satisfactorily the "names" of many of the "tunes" which are now
in common use - as "Mear," "Martin's," "Russia, "Windham," "Lenox." The
difficulty, as has been remarked above, was felt even at the time when
the Septuagint version was made, as in several instances the authors of
that version have not attempted even to translate the title, but have
expressed it in Greek letters answering to the Hebrew. Coverdale, who
translated the Bible in 1535, felt the difficulty to be so great that he
has omitted nearly all the titles except the names of the authors. In
these notes, as far as an explanation can now be given that is
satisfactory or probable, it will be offered in the exposition of the
particular psalms.

\(e\) There has been a wide difference of opinion respecting the
"authority" of these titles. Not a few modern critics, especially German
critics, regard them as of no authority, and argue in respect to the
authorship of the psalms, and the time and occasion on which they were
composed, as if no such titles were found in the Hebrew. By most of the
ancient critics they were considered as genuine, and as having equal
authority with the psalms themselves. They were wholly rejected at the
close of the fourth century by Theodore of Mopsuestia, one of the ablest
and most judicious of the ancient interpreters. Rosenmuller, Hist.
Interp. Librorum Sacrorum, P. III, p. 256. Tholuck and Hengstenberg
admit their authority. The "objections" to the authority of the title
are such as these:

\(1\) That the "subscriptions" at the close of the epistles in the New
Testament are now regarded as of no historical value, and it is asked
why may not the same conclusion be adopted in regard to the titles
"prefixed" to the psalms?

\(2\) that the ancient versions, the Syriac and the Greek especially,
exhibit them with great variations, often altering the Hebrew, and
sometimes giving a heading where the Hebrew has none. It is asked
whether these ancient translators would have taken such liberties if the
titles had been considered sacred like the psalms themselves? (Kitto). -
It is added on this point, that "if ever Ezra settled them, the
variations in versions and manuscripts have tended since to make them
doubtful." Eichhorn, "Einleitung," III, p. 490.

\(3\) It is argued that the titles are at variance with the contents of
the psalms. Thus, it is alleged that sometimes the name of the author is
incorrectly given, "as when David is named over the psalms referring to
the captivity," as in [Psa 14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001); Ps.
25; Ps. 51; Ps. 69. It is also alleged that Ps. 139 cannot be David's,
since it is not free from Aramaisms. It is also said that the occasion
on which a psalm was composed is not always correctly specified, as in
[Psa 30:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#001).

It is to be observed, however, that these writers sometimes assume that
a psalm refers to the time of the exile when it would be possible to
explain it on the supposition that it was composed at an earlier date;
and that it is not always safe to argue from the internal evidence of a
psalm against the inscription. A critic affixes his own interpretation
to a psalm, and then adopts that as a basis of argument in regard to its
origin; whereas often, possibly in all cases, if the inscription were
assumed to be correct, it would not be difficult to explain the psalm,
by fair rules of interpretation, in accordance with that supposition.

On the whole, it seems to me that these inscriptions are to be regarded
as a part of the inspired record, and as having the authority of
inspiration. The fact that they are found in the Hebrew - that they can
be traced back to the earliest periods when we have any knowledge of the
Hebrew text - that they have come down to us with that text - furnishes
proof which it seems we cannot now set aside; that they are to be
regarded as a part of the text, and that they should not be rejected,
except as any other portion of the Hebrew text should be rejected, i.
e., only when it can be demonstrated that an error has crept into the
text by the fault of transcribers.

Section 5. "The General Character of the Book of Psalm."

The Psalms are mostly lyrical poetry, that is, poetry adapted to the
harp or lyre; to be used in connection with instrumental music; to be
"sung," not "read." Such poetry was common among the ancients, as it is
among the moderns. Anacreon, Alcaeus, Stesichous, Sappho, and Horace
were eminent among the ancients as "lyric" poets; and the numerous
writers of "songs," sacred and secular, among the moderns, are to be
ranked in the same class. The phrase "lyric poetry" now, however, is
frequently applied to that species of poetry which "directly expresses
the individual emotions of the poet" (Webster).

Lyric poetry is, for the most part, an expression of deep feeling, and
has its foundation in feeling or emotion. It is not so much the fruit of
the understanding as of the heart; not so much the creation of the
imagination as the utterance of deep personal emotion. It embraces in
its design and nature all kinds of feeling, and may be joyous, pensive,
desponding, triumphant, according to the feelings of the author, or to
the occasion, for all these utterances may be sung, or may be set to
music, the varying tones of music being adapted to express them all.
Hence, in the Psalms, 150 in number, and composed by a considerable
variety of individuals, and on many different occasions, we have the
varied feelings of trouble, anguish, fear, hope, joy, trust,
thankfulness, devotion to God, penitence for sin, and the exultation of
forgiveness - the heart moved, and finding vent for its feelings in
words adapted to the melody of the lyre, or the musical tones of the
voice. These feelings are expressed in a great variety of modes or
forms, and the music was intended, doubtless, to be in accordance with
these varied feelings. The Psalms, therefore, comprise compositions of
the following classes or orders:

\(1\) Hymns in which the praise of God is the principal and leading
object, as

\(a\) in general, God is praised as the God of nature and of men, [Psa
8:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#001); Ps. 104; Ps. 145;

\(d\) as the helper and deliverer of his people, [Psa

138:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#001).

\(2\) Psalms pertaining to the Hebrew nation; to its history; to the
Divine interposition in its behalf; and to its relation to Yahweh. Ps.
Ps. 78; Ps. 105; Ps. 106; [Psa
114:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#001).

\(3\) temple psalms, or songs of Zion. [Psa

87:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#001); Ps. 132.

\(4\) Psalms in relation to trial, calamity, distress, whether of
individuals or of the nation. These abound, as Ps. 7; Ps. 22; Ps. 55;
[Psa 56:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#001); Ps. 109; Ps. 44; Ps. 74;
[Psa 79:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#001); Ps. 80; [Psa
137:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#001); Ps. 69; Ps. 77; Ps. 102; Ps.

\(5\) Religious and moral psalms, Ps. 90; Ps. 139; [Psa
23:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#001); Ps. 91; [Psa

127:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#001); [Psa
128:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#001); [Psa
42:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001); [Psa
43:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#001); [Psa
101:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#001); [Psa
131:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#001); [Psa
1:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001); [Psa
133:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa133.htm#001); Ps. 119:

The uniqueness of the Hebrew lyrical poetry as distinguished from the
lyrical poetry of other ancient people, and from most of the lyrical
poetry in modern times, is its "religion." It is lyrical poetry on
subjects pertaining to religion, or to be employed in religion: as
expressing religious feeling, and as designed to awaken and foster such
feeling. It is intended to raise the heart and the affections toward
God; to lift up the thoughts of men from the earth; to inspire
confidence in God; to produce consolation as derived from God in times
of trouble; to cheer and comfort man in his pilgrimage along a path of
sorrow and trouble to a better abode. Much of it can be best
characterized by an expression derived from the Bible itself - an
expression no less remarkable for its beauty than its truthfulness - as
"songs in the night" [Job 35:10](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#010); songs
indicating the joy that may spring up in the soul of man in times of
distress and sorrow; songs that show that there "is" joy in the darkness
of this world; songs which illustrate the power and the value of
religion; songs with which men cheer themselves and each other in their
journey toward the grave; songs which even the guilty may pour forth
from hearts softened into penitence, and filled with thankfulness in the
assurance of pardon.

It is most remarkable that this rich poetry should have sprung up in
Palestine, and that it should have been confined to that land. It was
not that the land was better adapted to lyric poetry than other lands -
for in this respect it could not compare favorably with many other
countries, and particularly with Greece. It was not that the events of
their history had been such as peculiarly to suggest this kind of
composition - for poetry adapted to the lyre or to music abounded
elsewhere, and especially in Greece. It was not that the Hebrews had a
more poetic imagination than other people - for theirs did not, in this
respect, surpass the Greek genius, and whatever there was of poetic
imagination in the character of their minds was found with equal
richness in Arabia and Persia. Nor was it that their language was
especiallly favorable for this kind of poetry - for in very many
respects it was far inferior in this point to the Greek, and had no
superiority certainly over the Arabian and Persian.

The fact that their poetry took this turn; the fact that all which they
had was religious; the fact that there was literally no poetry in their
language that was designed and adapted to the dance, to festive
amusements, to Bacchanalian orgies, to scenes of gaiety, frivolity, and
vanity; the fact that in all the lyric poetry of the Hebrews there is
literally nothing in this respect that can be placed by the side of much
in the Greek lyric poetry - much in Horace - much in Burns; by the side
of the lyric poetry of all lands except Palestine, can be traced only to
the idea that the new religion prevailed there, and can be best
explained on the supposition that the authors of that poetry were
inspired to prepare and transmit to future times that which, in all
ages, would express the feelings of true devotion, and which might be
permanently employed in the praises of God. He will fail to explain the
fact that such poetry is found in Palestine alone, and will fail to
appreciate its true nature, who does not admit that these "sweet
singers" were inspired by the Holy Spirit.

On the general character of Hebrew poetry, see the introduction to the
notes on the Book of Job, Section 5. On "the origin and culture of lyric
poetry among the Hebrews," it may be proper to introduce here the
following remarks from DeWette's "Commentar ueber die Psalmen,"
Einleitung, II, pp. 6-12. I copy from the elegant translation of the
introduction of DeWette, by Prof. John Torrey, in the Biblical
Repository, Vol. III, pp. 450-456:

"If we follow the titles of the Psalms and the common opinion, we must
suppose the lyric poetry of the Hebrews, as well as the largest portion
of the Psalms themselves, a production of David and his contemporaries.
The few specimens of lyric composition which we find before David
scarcely enter into consideration, compared with the fertility of his
own period. In the earlier history it is but occasionally that the voice
of poetry is heard, as in the songs of Moses at the Red Sea, of Deborah,
and of Hannah. We are surprised, after so few attempts in lyric poetry,
to see so accomplished and fruitful a poet rise up all at once, with
several others in his company. So rapid a progress supposes some
adequate occasion, some preparatory steps. Now, if we cast our eye over
the history of the times immediately preceding the age of David, we are
presented with a phenomenon which seems to explain the difficulty.

It is Samuel's school of the prophets. Many, as Herder, Eichhorn,
Nachtigall, and Rosenmuller, suppose that the composition of psalms was
cultivated and brought to perfection in this seminary. Specious as this
conjecture appears, it is hardly reconcilable with the facts of the
history. It is not intimated that David, before his unction, had any
connection with Samuel. The former tends his father's flock. Indeed
Samuel appears to have had no acquaintance with David when he comes to
anoint him, [Sa1 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#006) ff. Yet, David
is already a skillful minstrel, and famed for his art, [Sa1
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#018); he was not, therefore, a
disciple of Samuel, at least in minstrelsy. But it is well known that
music and song at this period were not separated; we must therefore
suppose that David was already a poet, and, as such, known and
celebrated. Some time afterward, it is true, we find David in Samuel's
school of the prophets, but it is only on the occasion of his flight
from Saul, [Sa1 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#018) ff.

It may be possible that Samuel had some acquaintance with David prior to
his unction, though no mention is made of it in the account of that
transaction, 1 Sam. 16. But he might have been an object of attention to
the prophet without being properly his disciple; or perhaps the youth
was his own instructor. Natural capacity, in connection with frequent
practice, might produce the same degree of talent, to say the least, as
an artificial system of instruction, like that which we may suppose to
have prevailed in the prophetic school. At the same time, it would be an
error to imagine that lyric poetry arose among the Hebrews all at once,
as if it sprung out of the ground. David's contemporaries, the women who
celebrated with song and joy his victory over Goliath, practiced a
species of poetry which, though rude and uncultivated, was truly lyric
in its kind; their short poem, has already the form of the poetic
parallelism, and an original and superior mind might easily advance from
such a beginning to the highest degree of excellence.

Saul smote his thousands,

But David his ten thousands,

We find also, still earlier, in addition to the examples of Moses,
Deborah, and Hannah, the practice, particularly among the women, of
music and the dance, from which song certainly was not excluded.
Jephthah's daughter comes out to meet her father with timbrels and
dances, [Jdg 11:34](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#034). At Shiloh the
maidens held a yearly feast with dances, [Jdg
21:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#021). It may be questioned whether
Samson was not a minstrel, for he is called out to play before the
Philistines, [Jdg 16:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#025), which is
commonly understood to refer to the dance, but excludes not the
accompaniments of song and instrumental music. But even if he was not,
strictly speaking, a musician and singer, yet we meet in him with the
first "Mashal" poet, as we have also from the same period the masterly
apologue of Jotham. Such facts, though insulated, presuppose among a
people a considerably high degree of cultivation, or at least of
poetical capacity.

Indeed, the song of Deborah alone proves that the poetic art was already
arrived at a stage of improvement sufficient to account for the origin
of the Davidian poetry. Whether a period produces one admirable poem or
more is a matter of chance rather than the result of the state of
culture. Besides, the times of the judges and of Samuel constituted the
heroic age of the Hebrews, a period peculiarly favorable to the first
beginnings and gradual improvement of poetry. 'Such times,' says
Eichhorn, 'are poetical under every climate;' but I cannot add with him,
'that poetry, in this case, is like the nation, wild and heroic,
breathes only in the warlike trump, and knows no field for practice but
that of valor and victory with their attendant train.' The occasions
which first called forth the Hebrew poets were, probably enough,
connected with war; but when poetry has once sprung into life, she
confines herself to no such narrow limits, and draws still other objects
within her circle. With feasts of victory, sacrifices, dances, and other
rites were united, which might easily have tempered the song to a tone
of somewhat softer character. Even warlike songs admit of the gentler
emotions, and the song of Deborah is rich in touches of amiable feeling.
When it is said they sung to the trumpet, we are certainly not to
understand it in the literal sense; the music of the harp, of the flute,
and of the timbrel, was the accompaniment even of the songs of war, and
these instruments are adapted to the softest tones. We are not then
obliged to trace the origin of the sweet and amiable poetry of David's
psalms exclusively to Samuel's school of the prophets.

"Unfortunately we know far too little about the prophetic school of
Samuel to determine what influence it had on the cultivation of poetry.
The passages relating to it are [Sa1
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#005); [Sa1
19:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#019). In the first of these it is
undoubtedly implied that the disciples of the prophets had music among
them. and their 'prophesying' (התנבא hitenabē') has been understood, not
without grounds, in the sense of song, for the word נביא nâbı̂y'
sometimes signifies poet, [Exo 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#020),
and נבא nibâ', to sing, [Ch1 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#001) ff.
We may suppose, however, that this music was employed simply as a
support and accompaniment of the prophetic delivery. The prophets
probably delivered their messages, in the earlier times at least, in
connection with music and a vehement action and declamation approaching
to a dance. The passage in [Kg2 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#015)
ff. is remarkable. The prophet Elisha is about to pronounce the answer
of the Lord to certain inquiries of Jehoshaphat; but before he does it,
he asks for a minstrel; and as the latter strikes the harp, 'the hand of
Yahweh comes upon him,' and he utters his reply.

The case here, it is true, is different; the prophet does not play and
sing himself, but submits to the performance of another; still it shows
the constant connection of music with the prophetic office. Neither is
it distinctly asserted in the passages above that the company of the
prophets "sung" themselves. The word התנבא hitenabē', which is there
employed, may not perhaps signify "to sing," for Saul and Saul's
messengers prophecy - התנבאוּ hitenabe'û - as soon as they hear the
music, without preparation or practice. Their prophesying was perhaps
nothing more than a vehement action, dancing, and gesticulation, as we
see from the circumstance of Saul's falling down naked. At the farthest,
they might have joined in the choral song with the company of prophets.
Such choral chants were perhaps sung in the school of Samuel, but only
for the purposes of devotion and inspiration; and the proper design of
this school was to educate youth for the prophetic office, that is, to
give counsel from the Lord to a people under a theocratic government.

Samuel was a prophet, and history has preserved no remains of any
poetical works of his. Is it not most probable that he was aiming to
educate his disciples likewise for the prophetic office? Now, it is true
that the Hebrews drew no accurate line of distinction between lyric
poetry and prophetic eloquence; yet these two always differ,
particularly in the mode of delivery, for the lyric poem was probably
sung, while the prophetic message was only recited. Supposing, then,
Samuel was employed in forming his disciples to be prophetic poets or
speakers, what is more natural than to imagine that some of them might
feel drawn by genius and inclination to lyric poetry, and succeed in
perfecting themselves in this? Yet it lay out of the plan of the
prophetic school, and was a thing quite accidental. It is hardly
correct, therefore, to consider the prophetic school of Samuel simply as
an institution for the cultivation of singing and poetry.

"There were other institutions which may have had an influence still
more important and decided than this school of the prophets in promoting
the culture of lyric poetry, especially of the religious kind. I refer
particularly to those musical schools which, according to the account,
[Ch1 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#016) ff. were founded by David
in aid of the public worship. Yet I cannot retract the unfavorable
opinion I once pronounced upon these and similar narratives in the
Chronicles; I must rather confirm it. Besides the reasons there alleged,
which I may not repeat, it seems to me to be a circumstance particularly
calculated to excite suspicion, that the psalms and fragments of psalms
represented by the Chronicles to have been sung at the dedication of the
tabernacle and on similar occasions can hardly have been penned by
David, but belong rather to the later and less pure style of the temple
poetry. The psalm which is sung, [Ch1
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#008) ff, is composed Ps. 105 and [Psa
96:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001); but both are productions of a
later style. If the Chronicles had presented us on this occasion with a
genuine song of David, such as the elegy for which we are indebted to 2
Sam. 1; this circumstance would have contributed not a little to add
weight to its authority, but the insertion of these fragments throws
suspicion over the whole of the accompanying narrative. The phrase also,
quoted [Ch1 16:41](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#041), and elsewhere,
respecting the Levites who were appointed to give thanks to the Lord,
'because his mercy endureth forever,' betrays the later poetry of the
temple, an example of which we have in Ps. 136, where this phrase forms
a regular refrain; also Ps. 106; Ps. 107; Ps. 118; in which this phrase
occurs appear to belong to a later style of poetry.

"We may imagine that a master like David would not be without companions
and assistants in the poetic art; and, in fact, several of David's
contemporaries are named in the titles as composers of psalms: but these
notices are not always good authority. Solomon, according to the
testimony of history, united in himself such richness of lyric invention
with the sententious style unique to him, that in his time lyric poetry
must have attained to a very high degree of perfection. 'Solomon spoke
three thousand proverbs, and his songs were a thousand and five,' [Kg1
4:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#032). It is singular, however, that
with the exception of two which are quite uncertain, no psalms of
Solomon are preserved in our present collection; nor do we find any
psalm with the author's name belonging to the period after Solomon, not
even one which admits of being referred with certainty and of necessity
to any particular event in the history of those times; and yet such
lyric poems as those of Hezekiah and of Habakkuk clearly evince, that
during this period the culture of lyric composition had by no means
fallen into neglect.

On the contrary, we have many psalms which, according to the results of
a sound critical exegesis almost universally acknowledged, must be
placed in the times of the captivity, and after the captivity; and these
psalms rank, for purity of language, and for sublimity, beauty, and
freshness of conception, in the highest class, and are, in no respect,
inferior to the poems of David and his contemporaries, for example, Ps.
45; Ps. 74; [Psa 79:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#001); Ps. 107; and
many, if not all, of the Psalms of Degrees. We are here presented, then,
with a singular phenomenon. The lyric poetry of the Hebrews, which was
cultivated and brought to perfection in the times of David, after
producing abundance of fruit, sank into a repose of nearly 500 years,
and then all at once, in the most calamitous period of the state, arose
again, survived another golden age, and yielded a second harvest - a
phenomenon hardly corresponding with the common course of events. The
singularity, however, disappears as soon as we suppose that the
collection of Psalms contains several pieces, either anonymous or
incorrectly named, which belong to the period extending from David to
the captivity. Indeed, it is in the highest degree probable that lyric
composition flourished side by side with the prophetic poetry, and that
many of the prophets themselves contributed to our present collection,
and might reclaim their own productions from David and others. Some of
the prophets, too, are actually named by the Septuagint as authors of
psalms."

Section 6. "The Imprecations in the Psalm."

Much has been written on the subject of the imprecations in the Psalms,
or, as they are called, "The imprecatory psalms;" and perhaps there is
no part of the Bible that gives more perplexity and pain to its readers
than this; perhaps nothing that constitutes a more plausible objection
to the belief that the psalms are the productions of inspired men than
the spirit of revenge which they sometimes seem to breathe, and the
spirit of cherished malice and implacableness which the writers seem to
manifest. There has been probably no explanation offered which has
relieved the minds of those who are thus perplexed, or which has
furnished a solution wholly satisfactory on the question how this spirit
can be reconciled with the precepts of the New Testament and with the
requirements of true religion. It is useless to attempt to disguise or
to conceal the difficulty, and it may be admitted that most of the
explanations which have been suggested leave the difficulty just where
it was. Perhaps it is not possible for us to remove all such difficulty,
or so to present the subject that questions may not be asked which it
would be impossible to answer, and, indeed, what subject is there in
mental philosophy, in natural science, in morals, or in theology, on
which questions may not be asked which the human powers are not yet
competent to answer? In regard to the growth of a blade of grass,
questions may be asked which no chemist - no person - can answer.

With reference to the imprecations in the Psalms, it will be proper,
first, to refer to some specimens of such psalms, that we may know where
the difficulty lies; and then to consider in what way, if any, this
difficulty may be solved.

The following are among the passages which would be referred to as
belonging to that class of psalms. They are not, indeed, all that could
be selected, but they are fair specimens, and there are no others that
would involve any difficulty which are not found in these.

[Psa 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#010), "destroy thou them, O God;
let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of
their transgressions, for they have rebelled against thee."

[Psa 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#015), "break thou the arm of the
wicked and the evil man: seek out his wickedness until thou find none."

[Psa 18:40-42](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#040), "thou hast also given
me the necks of mine enemies; that might destroy them that hate me. They
cried, but there was none to save them: even unto the Lord, but he
answered them not. Then did I beat them small as the dust before the
wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in streets."

[Psa 28:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#004), "give them according to
their deeds, and according to the wickedness of their endeavors: give
them after the work of their hands; render to them their desert."

[Psa 31:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#017), "let me not be ashamed, O
Lord, for I have called upon thee: let the wicked be ashamed, and let
them be silent in the grave."

[Psa 35:3-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#003), "draw out also the spear,
and stop the way against them that persecute me: say unto my soul, I am
thy salvation. Let them be founded and put to shame that seek after my
soul: let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my
hurt. Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of the
Lord chase them. Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel
of the Lord persecute them. For without cause have they hid for me their
net in a pit, which without cause they have digged for my soul. Let
destruction come upon him at unawares; and let his net that he hath hid
catch himself: into that very destruction let him fall."

[Psa 40:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#014), "let them be ashamed and
confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it; let them be
driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil."

[Psa 55:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#009), "destroy, O Lord, and
divide their tongues: for I have seen violence and strife in the city."

[Psa 55:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#015), "let death seize upon
them, and let them go down quick (alive, living) into hell: for
wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them."

[Psa 58:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#006), "break their teeth, O
God, in their mouth: break out the great teeth of the young lions, O
Lord. Let them melt away as waters which run continually: when he
bendeth his bow to shoot his arrows, let them be as cut in pieces. As a
snail which melteth, let every one of them pass away: like the untimely
birth of a woman, that they may not see the sun. Before your pots can
feel the thorns, he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, both
living, and in his wrath. The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the
vengeance: he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked."

[Psa 59:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#012), "for the sin of their
mouth and the words of their lips let them even be taken in their pride:
and for cursing and lying which they speak. Consume them in wrath,
consume them, that they may not be: and let them know that God ruleth in
Jacob unto the ends of the earth. And at evening let them return; and
let them make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city. Let them
wander up and down for meat, and grudge if they be not satisfied."

[Psa 68:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#002), "as smoke is driven away,
so drive them away: as wax melteth before the fire, so let the wicked
perish at the presence of God."

[Psa 69:22-25](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#022), "let their table become
a snare before them: and that which should have been for their welfare,
let it become a trap. Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and
make their loins continually to shake. Pour out thine indignation upon
them, and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them. Let their habitation
be desolate; and let none dwell in their tents."

[Psa 79:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#012), "and render unto our
neighbors sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, wherewith they have
reproached thee, O Lord."

[Psa 83:9-17](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#009), "do unto them as unto
the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook of Kison: which
perished at Endor: they became as dung for the earth. Make their nobles
like Oreb, and like Zeeb; yea, all their princes as Zebah, and as
Zalmunna ...O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the
wind. As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the mountains
on fire; so persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with
thy storm. Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O
Lord. Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put
to shame, and perish."

[Psa 109:6-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#006), "set thou a wicked man
over him: and let Satan stand at his right hand. When he shall be
judged, let him be condemned: and let his prayer become sin. Let his
days be few; and let another take his office. Let his children be
fatherless, and his wife a widow. Let his children be continually
vagabonds, and beg: let them seek their bread also out of their desolate
places. Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the
strangers spoil his labor. Let there be none to extend mercy unto him:
neither let there be any to favor his fatherless children. Let his
posterity be cut off; and in the generation following let their name be
blotted out. Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the
Lord; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out. Let them be
before the Lord continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from
the earth."

[Psa 137:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#007), "remember, O Lord, the
children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Rase it, rase it,
even to the foundation thereof. O daughter of Babylon, who art to be
destroyed; happy shall he be, that rewardeth thee as thou hast served
us. Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against
the stones."

These are specimens of the class of psalms now under consideration, and
though the number might be somewhat increased, yet these examples
embrace those which are most difficult to be explained, and involve all
the difficulties to be found in this class of the psalms. None could be
adduced which seem to breathe a more vindictive spirit than these do;
none seem to be more opposed to the spirit of the New Testament. If,
therefore, a solution can be suggested that would be satisfactory in
regard to these passages, it would be easy to apply the principles of
such a solution to all the similar passages in the Psalms.

The inquiry then occurs in what way, if in any way, the difficulty is to
be solved, or what explanations can be suggested.

On this subject the following remarks may be made:

\(1\) Whatever difficulty there exists is created by the Bible itself.
The record is one which the sacred writers have themselves made. This
fact is proof at least of candor, and of a consciousness on their part
that there was "nothing" in this record which was not founded in truth,
which did not really occur; that is, that these feelings actually
existed in their minds. It cannot be pretended that the writers indulged
in feelings which they were unwilling to record; which they were ashamed
to make known. In fact, they took all the methods in their power to make
them known, and to have the record perpetuated. They not only recorded
them - put them in a permanent form - but they embodied them in poetry,
which was to be employed in the public worship of God; which was to go
down to future ages, to direct the devotions of the people of
far-distant times. Moreover, if there is any condemnation of this spirit
in the Bible - if there was anything wrong in this spirit - we are to
remember that the condemnation is found in the very book where these
expressions occur - for it is to be assumed here that, so far as the
objection lies against these expressions as a part of the Bible - as a
part of a pretended revelation - "the Bible is one book;" the Old
Testament and the New are parts of the same revelation from God. The
Bible, thus in making the record, should be allowed at least to be a
book of candor - a book in which there is no attempt to conceal what was
actually passing in the minds of the writers. There was, it may be
presumed some reason for making the record which was regarded as not
inconsistent with the purpose of a revelation; and it was assumed also
that these things would be susceptible of an explanation, which would be
consistent with the claim that the Bible was a revelation from God.

\(2\) It may be a fair subject of inquiry how much of what is charged as
wrong, harsh, and vindictive, may be referred to the spirit of the age
in which the Bible was composed, and in which these men lived. This
remark is not made on the supposition that the principles of morals and
religion change from one age to another; or that they are modified by
the circumstances of men; or that the same thing is morally right in one
age or country, and morally wrong in another. Truth and holiness, right
and wrong, do not change, nor are they dependent on the caprices or the
customs of mankind. Still, in order to know exactly what was "meant;"
how much words express; what was the precise idea intended to be
conveyed by language that was used - it is necessary for us to place
ourselves in the circumstances, and to understand the prevailing customs
and habits of the people who used the language. We constantly apply
these principles, insensibly it may be, when we read Homer, or when we
read the records of knight-errantry, or when we endeavor to understand
the poetry of any people in the earlier periods of history.

The language which a covenanter or a Puritan used may possibly have
expressed no other internal emotion than would be expressed by the
milder language which we should use; the rough words which the
uneducated and the common use may express no different feelings than
would be found to exist when the thoughts are conveyed in the smooth
tones, and the courtly phrases of those in the higher walks of life.
There may be as much bitter feeling beneath silk and satin as beneath a
dress made of the skins of wild beasts; in the palace as in the wigwam.
It may be possible that those who lived in the earlier ages of the world
really meant no more by the language which they often used, and which
seems to us to be so harsh, so revengeful, and so savage, that we do in
the milder tones which we employ, and which we now suppose to be
demanded by civilization and Christianity. It is, at least, a supposable
case that the people of future times may have had conveyed to them as
much in the records of our literature, and of our customs, which they
will find it difficult to explain consistently with their notions of
refinement, civilization, and the spirit of pure religion, as we
recognize in the language of the covenanters and the Puritans of
Scotland and England, or in the poetic effusions of the days of David.
Let us be sure that we understand precisely what they meant, and exactly
how our own spirit is better than theirs, before we condemn them.

\(3\) Part of these passages may undoubtedly be regarded as prophetic;
expressing what would be, rather than indicating any wish on the part of
the author of the psalms that such things should be. In some instances,
the passages might have been rendered in the future instead of the
imperative mood, with no violation of the laws of the Hebrew language,
or the proper principles of interpretation. Several of the passages of
this kind which may properly be applied to the Messiah, are undoubtedly
of this nature, and those passages are to be interpreted, when the laws
of language will admit of such an interpretation, as expressive of what
sinners deserve, and of what will come upon them, and not as indicating
any desire on the part of the author that it should be so.

It must be admitted, however, that this consideration does by no means
remove all the difficulty, nor does it in fact even diminish it. It
cannot be affirmed by anyone acquainted with the Hebrew language that
this solution could be applied to will the cases in reference to which
the difficulty exists, and there is still an explanation needed to meet
the cases which cannot be brought under this rule. In a book claiming to
be inspired, the objection is, in effect, as great if there is only one
such passage as if there are many. The essential difficulty is to
explain it consistently with the claim to inspiration at all.

It should be conceded, further, that this explanation is one which
cannot be admitted in regard to the most difficult of the passages. No
man can show that they are all mere predictions of the future; no one
can prove that all that is implied in these passages is a mere
expression of what sin deserves, or what ought to be inflicted on
transgressors. Beyond all question there is, in many cases, an
expression of feeling - or desire - or wish; there is language used
which implies that there would be gratification - satisfaction -
pleasure - if the calamity invoked should come upon the enemies of the
writer, or if the punishment should be inflicted on the wicked; there is
what is of the nature of prayer, that these calamities might come, and
that the wicked might be detected, arrested, punished. We cannot on any
honest principles interpret these psalms without admitting this; and the
objector has a right to ask how this feeling can be vindicated; how it
can be reconciled with the spirit of Christianity; how it can be shown
to be consistent with the belief that the psalms were inspired by the
Holy Spirit. This is a fair question to ask, and it is one which a
believer in the inspiration of the Bible should be held to answer.

\(4\) Some of the expressions referred to are a mere record of the
feelings of others; of the gratification which they would feel in seeing
vengeance inflicted on the guilty, even when revenge should be taken in
the most barbarous and savage manner. In such a case all that the
inspired writer, or the Spirit of inspiration, is responsible for, is
the fairness of the record, or that he has given an exact statement of
the feelings which would be cherished and expressed by those who should
inflict the vengeance, or who should experience gratification in seeing
it. A person may describe the acts of the American savage, scalping,
torturing, murdering by slow degrees women and children, or the acts of
cannibals, without being responsible for any of the feelings of the
savages in doing this; and the writer of history cannot assuredly be
responsible for all or any of the feelings of barbarous delight which a
tyrant may have in oppressing his subjects, or for the fury and hatred
which leads men to pursue with vengeance their flying victims. The
inspired writers who made a record of the cruelty of the sons of Jacob
[Gen 34:25-29](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#025); [Gen
49:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#006), or of the act of David in
bringing forth the people of Rabbah, and "putting them under saws, and
under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron. and making them pass
through the brick-kiln" [Sa2 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#031), or
the acts of Joab, Ahithophel, Absalom, Nebuchadnezzar, Ahab or Jezebel,
cannot be held to be answerable for the feelings which they manifested,
or the deeds which they performed, nor is it fair to infer that in
making the record they approved of what was done. All that the writers
can be held to be responsible for is the correctness of the record.

An instance of this kind occurs in [Psa
137:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#008), "O daughter of Babylon, who
art to be destroyed; happy shall he be that rewardeth thee as thou hast
served us. "Happy shall he be that taketh and dasheth thy little ones
against the stones." There is nothing to prevent our regarding this as a
statement of the actual feelings - the pleasure - the satisfaction -
which they would actually feel who should wreak vengeance upon Babylon.
The idea may be, and from anything that appears actually is, that such
had been the pride and arrogance of Babylon, such the wrongs which she
had done to other people; such her acts of cruelty and oppression - that
they who should overcome, subdue, and destroy her, would have conscious
satisfaction and pleasure in bringing deserved punishment on her, even
in those forms which men usually regard as savage and barbarous. In this
there is nothing which necessarily implies that the author of the psalms
would approve of it, or that he would have done it himself. If the case
is supposed even to indicate the common feelings of the Hebrew people,
in view of the destruction of an enemy under which the nation had
suffered so much and so long, still it may be a mere record of that
feeling as a matter of fact, and the Spirit of inspiration is
responsible only for a fair account of the feelings which would actually
exist.

In one of the methods which have thus been indicated the difficulties in
regard to a portion of what are called the "imprecatory psalms" may be
removed altogether. These are solutions, however, which cannot be
applied to all of them; and if there is any number, however small - if
there is a single one remaining - to which these solutions cannot be
applied, it must be admitted that the actual difficulty still remains,
for the Psalms are to be regarded as forming one book; they have, as is
fairly implied in the idea that they are inspired, one author - the Holy
Spirit; and as it is a principle which must be held by all who regard
the Bible as an inspired book, that one text of Scripture fairly
interpreted is sufficient to establish the truth of any doctrine, so it
must be admitted that a well-founded objection to a single text, fairly
interpreted, as really affects the question of inspiration as though
there were many passages of that character. Some other solution,
therefore, must be found in order to remove the real difficulty in the
case.

\(5\) A fifth remark, therefore, in regard to the prayers in these
passages considered as invocations of vengeance or of punishment on the
wicked may be suggested. The real question is, whether under any
circumstance such prayers - such imprecations - can be right; and
whether, if ever right, the circumstances in the Psalms were such as to
make them proper.

To obtain a just view of this, several remarks are to be made.

\(a\) David was a magistrate; a king. He was, by the appointment of God,
the civil and military ruler of the nation. His authority was not an
usurped authority; nor were his acts those merely of a private man, a
man individually wronged. As a king - a magistrate - he was appointed to
preserve order; to maintain law; to dispense justice; to detect,
arraign, and punish the guilty. As a magistrate, he represented the
state; the majesty of the law; the interests of justice. As, a
magistrate, an act done - an offence committed - a crime in the
community, did not respect him as a man - an individual - but as
appointed to administer the government and to defend the state. No one
can deny that David sustained this relation to the state, and that the
duty of maintaining and administering law rested supremely with him.
From anything that appears, also, the remark here made is applicable to
each of the cases where "imprecations" are found in the Psalms. The
question, then, is, whether there is anything in the office and
functions of one appointed to make and execute the laws of a land which
would render such imprecations justifiable.

\(b\) Punishment is right. It is not wrong that a penalty should be
affixed to law; it is not wrong that the penalty of a law should be
inflicted; it is not wrong that pain, privation of office, imprisonment,
and the loss of life itself, should follow the commission of crime. So
all laws determine; so all nations have judged. It is material here to
remark that this is not an arbitrary thing; that it is not a matter of
individual or local feeling. It is laid in our very nature. It is found
in all nations. It is acted on among all people. "There is something in
our very nature, account for it as we may, which approves of punishment
when properly inflicted; which approves of the appointment of a penalty
for crime." If this is wrong, it is a wrong in our very nature; it is a
universal wrong; it is a wrong which has gone into the enactment of all
laws - for all law has a penalty. A law without a penalty would be a
mockery and a farce. When a man, in accordance with a just sentence of
law, is fined, imprisoned, executed, we approve of it. We feel that it
is what ought to be done, and in this feeling we are conscious of no
wrong. We are conscious that we are not to be blamed for approving the
sentence which condemns the guilty anymore than we are for approving the
sentence which acquits the innocent. The foundation of this feeling is
laid in the very nature of man, and, therefore, it cannot be evil. No
man feels that he is blameworthy when he thus finds himself approving of
a just sentence of law; no man feels that this principle of his nature
ought to be resisted or reversed, so that he would be a better man if he
were conscious of the opposite feeling.

\(c\) In accordance with this principle, there are arrangements in every
community for detecting and punishing crime. There are laws made which
define crime, and designate its just penalty; there are arrangements
made for arresting the guilty, and bringing them to trial; there are
prisons built in anticipation that there will be men to be punished.
There are courts organized for the express purpose of trying offenders;
there are penalties affixed by law to different classes of crimes; there
are processes prescribed in the law books for arresting. indicting,
committing, arraigning, and judging those charged with a violation of
law. There is a class of men whose business it is to detect and arrest
offenders; there is a class whose business it is to try them; there is a
class whose business it is to inflict punishment on them. Hence, we have
a detective police - men whose calling it is to find out offenders; we
have an array of constables, jurymen, and judges; we have sheriffs,
keepers of prisons, and executioners. These arrangements are necessary
in our world. Society could not do without them. No community would be
safe without them. No man would feel that his life, his property, his
family were secure without them. They enter into the very structure of
society as it exists on earth; and if these were abolished, the world
would soon be filled with anarchy, bloodshed, and crime.

\(d\) These are lawful, proper, and honorable employments. The business
of a detective officer, of a constable, of a sheriff, of a juryman, of a
judge, is as lawful as that of a farmer, a blacksmith, a school-teacher,
a physician, a clergyman. No man occupies a more honorable position than
the judge of a court, though it be a criminal court; no man is rendering
more valuable service to his country than he whose daily business it is
to detect offenders, to prosecute for crime, or to administer the laws
of a nation. The constable and the judge may go to their work with as
conscious a feeling that they are engaged in an honorable work as the
farmer or the merchant; and the foreman of a jury who declares that a
man arraigned for crime has been found guilty, and the judge who
pronounces the sentence of the law, and the man who executes the
sentence, may each one lie down on his bed at night as calmly as the man
who during the day has been engaged in sowing seed in his field, or
gathering in his harvest, or administering medicine to the sick, or
preaching the Gospel. Through all that day the one may be as conscious
that he has had no malice toward his fellow-men, no desire of revenge,
as the other. In the bosom of each one there may have been only the
consciousness of a simple desire to do his duty.

\(e\) It is lawful and proper for such a man - a detective officer, a
constable, a juryman, a judge, a keeper of a prison, a hangman - to
pray. It is as proper for such a man to pray as any other man. He may
pray in his closet and in his family; he may breathe forth a mental
prayer when searching for a man charged with an offence, or when hearing
a testimony against him, or when sitting in judgment on him, or when
inflicting the penalty of the law. He may pray, as other men do, that he
may be "diligent in business;" that he may be "fervent in spirit;" that
he may "serve the Lord" in that calling. He may pray that he may have
grace to be faithful to his trust; firm in his conduct; "successful in
what he is appointed to do." But what is this? It is that the wicked -
the guilty - may be brought to punishment; that they may be punished;
that they may receive the due reward for their deeds. It is not malice
against an individual; it is not a desire of revenge; it is not the
indulgence of any private feeling; it is not conduct inconsistent with
the widest benevolence. The officers of justice are engaged in the very
work of bringing men to punishment; and why may they not "pray" for
success in the work in which they are engaged? Why may not any man who
loves the cause of justice, and who desires the security and good order
of a community, pray that the wicked may be checked in their career -
arrested - confined - punished? Since men lawfully engage in doing the
thing, why may they not lawfully pray for the Divine blessing to aid
them in doing it?

It is further to be remarked that a magistrate offering such a prayer
would have a very different feeling from one who was engaged in an
unlawful employment. How can a man engaged in the manufacture and sale
of intoxicating drinks "pray"? How can he ask for success in his work?
To do this would be to pray that his neighbor, his fellow-men, near or
far off, might spend their property for that which would not profit
them; might waste their time, ruin their health, cut short their lives,
and destroy their souls; that they might be profane, gross, offensive,
beastly; that they might be a pest in the community, be led into crime,
and find their home in an almshouse, a penitentiary, or an insane
asylum; that their families might be beggared, and that a once peaceful
home might become a hell; and that the young, the vigorous, the hopeful,
the beautiful, the sons of the virtuous and the pious - might go down
early to the drunkard's grave; that the hearts of wives, mothers,
sisters, and daughters might be crushed and broken, because a husband, a
father, a brother, had been made a drunkard.

But what fiendish malignity would there be in such a prayer as this!
Hence, such men do not ask the Divine blessing on their work. But a
magistrate may pray, and should pray. He may pray that he may be
successful in discharging the duties of his office; in administering
justice; in prosecuting for crime; and in pronouncing the sentence of
the law. His prayer, in fact, is simply that justice may be done to all;
that punishment may be inflicted when it is deserved; and that he may be
made an instrument in the hands of God in detecting and punishing crime.
At the same time this may be so far from being a vindictive and
revengeful spirit, that he himself may be among the most kind and humane
men in a community, and when he pronounces the sentence of the law, he
may be the only one in the court room that shall weep. Tears may flow
fast from his eyes as he pronounces the sentence of the law, while the
hardened wretch sentenced to the gallows may be wholly unmoved. It
indicated no lack of feeling and no malevolent spirit when Washington
signed the death-warrant of the accomplished Andre, for he did it with
tears.

In the same way, and with the same spirit, a man may go forth to the
defense of his country when invaded, or when one portion of it has risen
up in rebellion against a lawful government. A soldier called forth to
defend his country may pray; the commander of an army may pray - should
pray. But the prayer of such an one may be, and should be, in the line
of his duty, for success in that which he has undertaken. It will be a
prayer that the enemies of his country may be overcome and subdued. It
indicates no malice, no personal feeling, no spirit of revenge, when he
prays that the enemies of his country may be scattered as chaff before
the wind; or that their counsels may be turned to foolishness; or that
he may be successful in subduing them. It is a prayer for the triumph of
a righteous cause; and as all his acts as a soldier tend to the
destruction of the enemies of his country; as he is actually engaged in
endeavoring to subdue them; as all his plans contemplate that; as he
cannot be successful without that - if the employment itself is right,
it cannot be wrong that he should pray for success in it; that is, that
his enemies may be delivered into his hands, and that God would enable
him to overcome, to scatter, to subdue them. In this view of the matter
there is necessarily no feeling inconsistent with the purest benevolence
when the defenders of liberty and law and right apply to themselves the
language of [Psa 149:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#001) : "Let the
high praises of God be in their mouth, and a two-edged sword in their
hand; to execute vengeance upon the pagan, and punishments upon the
people; to bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters
of iron; to execute upon them the judgment written," [Psa
149:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#006).

\(f\) It only remains to be added, as bearing on the point here
suggested, that it cannot be "demonstrated" that there is in the psalms
that are called "imprecatory psalms" anymore of malice, or of a spirit
of revenge, than there is in the heart of a detective officer, a
constable, a sheriff, a juryman, a crown lawyer, a prosecuting attorney,
a judge, the keeper of a penitentiary, or an executioner, when he goes
to the daily discharge of the duties of his office, and when, in his
closet, or in his family, in his morning devotions, he "prays" that he
may be faithful and successful in the discharge of his official duties
through the day: for success in any of these duties will be in the line
of prayer, and may be in answer to prayer. If the detective officer is
successful in ferreting out a burglar or a counterfeiter; if a
magistrate is successful in bringing him to justice; if a juryman
pronounces an honest verdict finding him guilty; if an attorney is
successful in prosecuting the guilty to conviction; if a judge delivers
a just sentence; and if the keeper of a prison closes the massive bars
and bolts on the guilty - at night, when they reflect on their work,
they may regard their success in the lawful duties of the day as being
as real an answer to prayer in the proper business of human life as the
waving golden harvest is an answer to the prayers of the pious farmer,
or the ship laden with the rich productions of the east, as she glides
gallantly into port, should be regarded as an answer to the prayers of
the pious merchant; and until it is proved that this may not have been
all that was implied in the language of the psalmist, it should not be
assumed that the imprecatory psalms breathe a vindictive spirit, or are
contrary to the purest and most benevolent feelings of the human heart.

\(6\) There is still another solution of the difficulty which has been
suggested. It is, substantially, that these expressions "are a mere
record of what actually occurred in the mind of the psalmist," and are
preserved to us as an illustration of human nature when partially
sanctified. According to this explanation we are not required by any
just view of inspiration to vindicate those feelings, or to maintain
that such feelings could not occur in the case of an inspired man. One
of the main objects of the Psalms is to illustrate religion as it
actually exists in the minds of good men in this world; men who are not
absolutely perfect, but whose best religious emotions are mingled with
many imperfections. According to this view the Spirit of inspiration is
no more responsible for these feelings on the part of the psalmist than
it is for the acts of David, Abraham, Jacob, or Peter. The feelings -
the acts - are what they are; the Spirit of inspiration is responsible
for a correct record or statement in regard to these acts and feelings:
a record that shall be historically and exactly true. A few remarks may
explain this further.

\(a\) It is, then, an admitted fact that David was not a perfect man;
and the same was undoubtedly true of all the writers of the Psalms. The
Bible never claims that they were perfect; it makes a fair record of
their faults; it lays down the general principle that none are
absolutely free from sin: [Kg1 8:46](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#046);
[Ecc 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#020); [Jam
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#002); [Jo1
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#008); [Job
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#020). As it is everywhere declared in
the Bible that no one is absolutely perfect, and as it is admitted that
David, for example, was guilty of wrong acts, as in the case of Uriah -
so, for the same reason, it is to be admitted that men, even the best of
men, are liable to sin in thoughts and in words as well as in deeds.

\(b\) The proper notion of inspiration does not require us to hold that
the men who were inspired were absolutely sinless. There is and must be
a manifest and palpable difference between being inspired, and being
personally perfect. Inspiration, in its true nature, secures a truthful
record; it does not necessarily secure absolute sanctification. Indeed,
inspiration has no necessary connection with sanctification; - as it is
conceivable, certainly, in accordance with the common belief, that
Balaam uttered true prophecies respecting the Messiah, yet no one from
that fact feels bound to maintain that he was otherwise than a bad man.
Livy, Gibbon, Hume, Robertson, were not perfect men, and yet it may be
true that they have given a correct account of the events which they
profess to record; nor do we argue that because they were faithful
historians that therefore, they were perfect men, or that they never did
or said anything, which, if it were recorded exactly as it occurred,
would not be inconsistent with the idea of absolute perfection of
character. It is, therefore, a very important principle "that
inspiration secures a correct record, not that it implies or secures
personal sanctification; and that if it does secure a correct record the
limit of responsibility in regard to it is reached." Assuredly, the fact
that David in Ps. 51 has made a true record in regard to his guiltiness
in the case of Uriah, does not prove that he was right or innocent in
the fact which is the subject of that record; nor if a record is a
record of feelings instead of deeds does its correctness anymore justify
or sanction such feelings.

\(c\) It was important and necessary in a revelation from God, in order
to meet the wants of the world, that there should be a true
representation of religion as it comes in contact with the human heart;
as it is in fact illustrated and manifested in the life of man, not as
it might be in the life of a spotless angel. Assuming, as the Bible does
everywhere, that man is depraved; that he has corrupt and evil
propensities; that he has passions which by nature are uncontrollable,
and that it is the design of religion to teach him how to control and
govern them - what we want is an illustration of religion as it comes in
contact with such a heart. If the Bible had described only the feelings
and conduct of a perfect being, it would be obviously unfit for man, for
it would not be adapted to his condition. As man is imperfect and
sinful, a representation of religion which would leave the impression
that there is no true piety except where there is absolute perfection,
would be adapted only to discourage and dishearten, for it would hold up
that before his mind which he would feel to be unattainable, and his own
consciousness of imperfection would lead him to the painful conclusion
that he had no true religion.

Hence, in the Bible, except in the solitary instance of the Savior, we
have no record of the life of a perfect saint. We have a description of
piety as it must always be found in the life of man: as feeble, and
struggling, and doubting, and contending with evil passions; as a life
of conflict, of mingled light and darkness, good and evil, happiness and
sadness, cheerfulness and despondency; as a life where evil often breaks
out, where there is a constant effort required to subdue it, and where
there is, amidst much that seems to be otherwise, yet truly a constant
progress in the soul toward perfection - a perfection not to be obtained
in this life, but which is to be consummated in heaven alone. Such a
record only is fitted for man; such a record only would properly
represent and describe man in his present condition. In another world -
in heaven - a true record of man redeemed would be a record of religion
without imperfection - as it would now be of the angels.

As it is, we have now in the Bible everywhere recorded the lives of
imperfect men: imperfect in their conduct; imperfect in their feelings;
imperfect in their words. We have the biographies of Abraham, Isaac,
Jacob, of Eli, David, Hezekiah, Moses, Aaron, Josiah, James, John, Peter
- all imperfect but good men; men in whose bosoms there were the
strugglings between good and evil principles; in whose lives the evil
principle was constantly breaking out, and over whom for the time it
seemed to triumph. Hence, the painful but honest records which we have
of piety in the Bible. In like manner, in order to see and understand
what true piety is, as it is found in connection with human nature, it
might be important that there should be such an illustration of it as we
actually find in the Psalms: the honest record of what passed through
the mind of a good man; of what imperfect man actually feels often, even
when it is proper to characterize him as a man of God. Probably there
have been few men, very few, even under the influence of the highest
forms of piety, who, if they had made an honest record of what was
passing in their minds at all times - of their wishes, desires,
emotions; of their feelings toward their enemies, persecutors, and
slanderers - would not have found that the language of the Psalms would
better express their feelings in this respect than any language which
they could find elsewhere; - and is it a forced or an unauthorized
thought that even such men as Augustine, Luther, Calvin, Knox, and
Edwards, at times when unChristian feelings seemed to have got the
ascendancy in their hearts; when they were strongly tempted to give way
to passion, or actually gave way to it; when they might have been led to
doubt whether men with such feelings could have any true religion - may
have found consolation in the fact that feelings precisely like theirs
sprang up in the hearts of the inspired men who composed the Psalms, and
who there made an honest record of what was actually passing in the
soul, almost an actual transcript of what they themselves experienced?
It need be hardly remarked that if this is a true view of the matter, we
are not bound to attempt to vindicate these expressions of passion -
anymore than we are the conduct of David in the matter of Uriah, or of
Peter in denying his Lord.

\(d\) According to this view, the expressions which are used in this
record are not presented for our imitation. The mere fact that they are
recorded as having occurred in the lives of good men is no evidence that
they are right, or are to be followed by us. "All" that occurred in the
life of the Redeemer was right, and was recorded that, so far as it
might be applicable to us in our circumstances, we might imitate it. If
the above remarks are correct, then the record was made for other
purposes than that we should imitate the conduct of those who gave
expression to these feelings. Nor should the fact that such feelings
actually existed in the minds of good men, or that these "imprecations"
are found in their writings, be charged on religion, as if it tended to
produce them, anymore than the act of adultery and murder on the part of
David, or the profaneness of Peter, should be referred to as an
illustration of what religion is adapted to produce in the hearts and
lives of men. Religion is not responsible for these things. The
responsibility is in our corrupt nature.

\(e\) If such is a just view of the matter, then all that "inspiration"
is responsible for is, the correctness of the "record" in regard to the
existence of these feelings: that is, the authors of the Psalms actually
"recorded" what was passing in their own minds. They gave vent to their
internal emotions. They state real feelings which they themselves had;
feelings which, while human nature remains the same, may spring up in
the mind of imperfect man, anywhere, and at any time. They record what
other men actually feel; and in making the record, they simply give
utterance to what passed through their own hearts. They do not apologize
for it; they do not pause to vindicate it; they offer no word in
extenuation of it - anymore than other sacred writers did when they
recorded the facts about the errors in the lives of the patriarchs, of
David, and of Peter.

In some of these ways it is probable that all the difficulties in regard
to the "imprecations" in the Psalms may be met. They who deny the
inspiration of the Psalms should be able to show that these are not
proper explanations of the difficulty; or that they are not consistent
with any just notions of inspiration.

Section 7. "The Practical Value of the Book of Psalm."

It is not a little remarkable that the Psalms, in the estimation of
religious persons, hold substantially the same place under the clearer
light of the Christian dispensation which they did under the
comparatively obscure Hebrew economy, and that with all the additional
light which has been imparted under the Christian revelation, the Psalms
have not been superseded. The "Christian" looks to the Psalms with an
interest as intense as did the ancient Jew; and, as expressive of
personal religious experience, as well as for the purpose of a manual
for worship, the Psalms are selected by the Christian, from the whole
Bible, as they were by the Jew from the books in his possession - the
Old Testament. As such, they will retain their value in all times to
come, nor will there ever be in our world such an advance in religious
light, experience, and knowledge, that they will lose their relative
place as connected with the exercises of practical piety.

How far this fact is to be regarded as a proof that the authors of the
Psalms were inspired; that there was communicated to them a knowledge of
the principles and workings of true piety, so in advance of their own
age as to be on a level with what will be possessed in the most advanced
periods of religious culture; that there must have been an influence on
their minds, in composing the Psalms, beyond anything derived from mere
poetic genius, is a question which must occur to all reflecting minds.
It is a fair question to propose to one who doubts the inspiration of
the Psalms, how he will account for this fact, consistently with his
idea that the authors of the Psalms were men endowed only as other men
of genius are, and with the acknowledged fact that they lived in an age
when the views of truth in the world were comparatively obscure. How did
it happen that a Hebrew bard, in the matter of deep religious experience
and knowledge, placed himself so high as to be a guide to mankind in all
coming times, after a new revelation should have been introduced to the
world, and after all the attainments which men would have made in the
knowledge of religion and of the human heart?

The special value of the Psalms arises: (a) from the fact that they are
adapted to the worship of God; (b) from the fact that they are records
of deep religious experience.

\(a\) As adapted to the worship of God. For this many of them were
originally designed in their very composition; to this the entire book
seems to have been intentionally adapted by those who made the
collection. It is not necessary to suppose that these sacred songs
comprise the whole of the Hebrew lyrical poetry, for as we know that
some of the books mentioned in the Old Testament, though inspired,
accomplished their purpose and have been lost, so it may have been in
regard to a portion of the lyrical poetry of the Hebrews. Many of the
words of the Savior, though all that he spoke was pure truth - truth
such as no other man ever spoke - truth such as the Spirit of God
imparts - were lost from not having been recorded [Joh
21:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#025), and in like manner it may have
been that truths which were written may have accomplished their purpose,
and have passed away. But, if there were such productions which have not
come down to us, we have no reason to doubt that they were of the same
general character as those which have survived, and which now constitute
the Book of Psalms. Now, it is remarkable that the poetry of the Hebrews
is so adapted to public worship above all other poetry, and that the
poetic genius of the nation took so exclusively a religious turn.

In this respect the Hebrew lyric poetry stands by itself, and is unlike
that of every other nation. Among the Greeks there are, indeed, hymns to
the gods - hymns designed to be used in the worship of the gods; but
this is by no means the general character of their lyric poetry. Among
the Persians, the Arabs, the Romans, the Babylonians, there were
doubtless such hymns; but this is not the prevailing character of their
lyric poetry. In the early Scotch, French, Spanish, Italian, and English
poetry there are such hymns, but this is by no means the exclusive or
the predominant character of the early lyric poetry of those nations.
Few of all their lyric compositions can be used in the worship of the
true God; nor is that which can be thus used always of the most exalted
character as poetry. The composition of psalms and hymns is a separate
poetic art; and though there are specimens, in the hymns in these
languages, of the highest kind of lyric excellence, yet it is to be
admitted that a large portion of that species of literature would
scarcely be regarded as even "respectable," if it related to other
subjects than religion.

Of the Hebrews, however, this is their all. They have no other poetry
whatever. They have none merely amatory or pastoral which will compare
with the Bucolics of Virgil, or with much of the poetry of Burns. Their
poetry of the religious kind, also, is all of a high order. There is
none that can be placed on the same low level with much that is found in
the hymn books of most denominations of Christians - very good; very
pious; very sentimental; very much adapted, as is supposed, to excite
the feelings of devotion - but withal so flat, so weak, so unpoetic,
that it would not, in a volume of mere poetry, be admitted to a third or
fourth rank, if, indeed, it would find a place at all. It is for him who
rejects the idea of "inspiration," as applied to the Book of Psalms, to
account for this fact.

\(b\) The Book of Psalms is a record of deep religious experience. It is
this which, in the estimation of religious persons in general, gives it
its chief value. It is the guide of young believers; and it becomes more
and more the companion, the comforter, and the counselor, as the
believer moves along through the varied scenes of life, and as grey
hairs come upon him, and as the infirmities, which pre-intimate the
approaching close of all things, press him down. A religious man is
rarely, if ever, placed in circumstances where he will not find
something in the Psalms appropriate to his circumstances; where he will
not find that the Hebrew sacred bard has not gone before him in the
depths of religious experience. Hence, in sickness, in bereavement, in
persecution, in old age, on the bed of death, the Book of Psalms becomes
so invariable and so valuable a companion; and hence, not as a matter of
convenience, but as supplying a want in the minds of men, and as
significant of their value, the Psalms and the New Testament are so
often bound together in a single volume. Hence, also, for the aged, for
the sick, for those whose powers of vision fail by disease or by years,
the Psalms and the New Testament are printed in large type, and bound in
convenient forms, that the truths contained in these volumes may be
still accessible to the saint ripening for heaven, as the light fails,
and as life ebbs away. To the end of the world the Psalms in religious
experience will occupy the same place which they now occupy; to the end
of the world they will impart comfort to the troubled, and peace to the
dying, as they have done in the ages that are past.

Section 8. "The Qualifications for Preparing a Commentary on the Psalm."

It is an undoubted fact that there have been more failures in the
Commentaries on the Book of Psalms than on any other of the books of the
Bible. As yet there has been no commentary that has met the wants of the
Christian world; there are none, whatever anticipations may have been
raised, which can be read without feelings of disappointment. For this
fact there must be a cause; and that cause is probably to be found in
the very peculiar qualifications needed to produce a commentary on the
Psalms: - qualifications which are rarely to be found united in the same
person.

A few remarks on the qualifications necessary for preparing such a
commentary may explain the cause of the failures which have occurred;
and may, perhaps, also explain the reason why the one now submitted to
the public may be found to be an addition to the failures already
existing. Every man who prepares a commentary on the Psalms will
probably, at the close of his work, be sensible of a feeling of
disappointment in what he had hoped, perhaps what he had expected to do,
and will share fully in the feelings of his readers that what is thus
submitted to the world is very far from being what a commentary on this
portion of the sacred Scriptures ought to be.

The unique qualifications for preparing a commentary on the Psalms are
such as the following:

\(1\) A knowledge of the Hebrew language, particularly as it is affected
by the laws of poetry which prevailed among the Hebrews. In all
languages there are special rules of poetry; rules by which the sense of
the words used is affected. and by which special shades of thought are
expressed. In most languages, words have a "poetic" and a "prosaic"
sense; and the application of the meaning of a word as used in prose to
a passage in poetry might by no means express the idea which was in the
mind of the poet. We learn almost insensibly, in reading a language
familiar to us, to make this distinction accurately, even when we could
not explain it; and we read a psalm, a hymn, a lyric song, without
mistaking the meaning. But it is another thing when one undertakes to
read a book of poetry in a language different from his native tongue.
What is obvious to an Italian, a Frenchman, or a German, in reading
poetry in his native language, becomes a matter of difficult acquisition
when an Englishman attempts to read the poem.

The same thing is true in studying a dead language. It need not be said
that there is a unique literature with respect to the Greek and Latin
poets; and he who can read Herodotus or Livy cannot assume that he has
such a full knowledge of the Greek and Latin languages as to qualify him
to understand the poetry in those languages. So much depends often on
rhythm, on the poetic forms of words, or on the images special to
poetry, that a classical education is not complete, nor is the student
qualified to apprehend the meaning of the language of a poem, or to
appreciate the beauties of its thought and imagery until he has mastered
this most difficult part of the rules of language. That the Hebrews,
like other people, had such rules and usages, there can be no doubt, for
they are to be found in all languages, and there is abundant evidence in
the Hebrew poetry itself that they existed among the Jewish people. Yet,
it may be doubted whether it is possible now so fully to recover the
knowledge of those rules and usages as to apply them perfectly in the
explanation of the poetic portions of the sacred writings. Much
pertaining to the rhythm of the language, much relating to the accents,
much connected with the peculiar use of words, it may be impossible now
to recover. To show the difficulty of this subject in its bearing on the
interpretation of the Psalms, as well as to illustrate the subject of
Hebrew poetry, I may refer to the remarks of DeWette, Einleitung, vii.
pp. 37-76. An elegant translation of this may be found in the Biblical
Repository, vol. iii.; pp. 478-514.

\(2\) True piety is essential to qualify one to be an interpreter of the
Psalms. This is true, in fact, in regard to the interpretation of any
portion of the sacred volume. Since the Bible is a book of religion,
employed in describing the nature, the power, and the influence of
religion, it is obvious that correct religious feeling, or a practical
acquaintance with religion, is necessary in an interpreter. The
principle is substantially the same which is required in the
interpretation of books on any subject. In a treatise on painting,
poetry, sculpture, architecture, there will be things which could not be
so well explained as by one who had a practical knowledge of these arts;
and in order to the possession of a complete qualification for the
interpretation of such a book, an ability to appreciate what is said on
those arts must be regarded as indispensable. It is obvious that the
mere knowledge of words - of philology - would not be all that would be
demanded; nor would any power of explaining local allusions, laws,
customs, manners, or geographical or historical references, be all that
would be required. Beyond all this, there was in the mind of the writer
or author that which he intended to express, and which no mere knowledge
of language or of customs would be sufficient to explain. To show what
the writer meant it would be obviously necessary to be able to
understand him - to appreciate what he intended to say; to bring out
what was in his mind; what he thought of - what he felt - what he
designed to express. Hence, however valuable a work may be on the Psalms
as a philological work, or as illustrating the authorship of a psalm,
and the circumstances of the author in its composition, it is plain that
we have not reached the main thing unless we have entered into the
spirit of the author, and are qualified to understand and appreciate his
own feelings in the composition.

\(3\) For the reason above stated, there should be in an exposition of
the Psalms more than the mere possession of piety. "There should be deep
religious experience." There should be an acquaintance with piety in its
highest forms of rapture, and in the lowest depths of despondency,
darkness, and sorrow. There is no book in the world in which there are
such varied expressions of piety, in which there are such diversified
forms of religious experience, as in the Book of Psalms. As the Psalms
were designed for every age of the world, for persons found in every
rank and condition of life, for seasons of joy and of sorrow, for
childhood, youth, middle age, old age, for the ignorant and the learned,
for times of sickness and of health, for private, social, domestic, and
public life, for magistrates and private citizens, for war and peace,
for acts of business and acts of charity, for the living and for the
dying, and for those that mourn - so they were designed to form a
"manual" that would illustrate religion in all these forms and
relations; to be a book in which anyone, in all the varied conditions of
human existence, might be sure that he would find something that would
be applicable to himself. If this is so, then it is clear that in order
to a good commentary on the Psalms - in order that the expositor may be
able to enter into the real spirit of the work which he undertakes to
explain - piety of no common order is demanded; a rich and varied
religious experience is required that falls to the lot of very few of
mankind. Looking simply at this qualification of a commentator on the
Psalms, we may cease to be surprised that no such commentary has ever
appeared as to leave nothing yet to be desired.

\(4\) Poetic taste is an important requisite in a commentator on the
Psalms. The Psalms are poetry, and poetry of the most delicate kind.
Much of the beauty of the Psalms, and much of their adaptedness to the
wants of man, depends on the fact that they are poetry. This was a
reason why the Spirit of God, in breathing his influence on the men who
composed the Psalms, preferred that the sentiments found in them should
be expressed in poetry rather that in prose, and hence, this medium was
selected. Among the original endowments of the human mind, that which
contemplates "poetry" as among the means of happiness; as adapted to
impress truth on the mind; as fitted to arouse the soul to great
efforts; as designed to fill the mind with calm, peaceful, pure,
patriotic, pious emotions, is one. Possessed by men, indeed (either in
the power of producing poetry or of appreciating it) in very different
degrees, yet it is an endowment of man; and, being such, religion makes
use of it to promote its own ends. There are those who will be moved by
little besides calm argument, stern logic, severe demonstration; there
are those who will be aroused only by the lofty appeals of eloquence;
there are those who will be most influenced by the voice of persuasion;
there are those who will be awakened from dangerous slumbers only by the
denunciations of wrath; there are those in whose minds pure and joyful
and holy emotions will be best excited by poetry. It is the province of
"song," as such, to awaken many of the most pure and devoted feelings of
piety in the human soul; and the Book of Psalms is the portion of the
sacred volume by which it is designed and expected that this object will
be accomplished as a permanent arrangement.

It is clear, therefore, that he cannot be completely qualified to be a
commentator on the Psalms who has not himself such endowments as to
appreciate the beauties of poetry; who cannot, in this respect, enter
into the feelings of the sacred writer on the one hand, and into the
hearts of those who are so made as to be affected by poetry on the
other. One of the causes of the "failure" to produce a good commentary
on the Psalms may be traced to this source. A mere philologist; a man
who regards nothing as valuable but exact demonstration; a man of
prosaic temperament, though he may have piety that is exalted and pure,
may lack still an important qualification for entering into the true
spirit of the Psalms, and for meeting the needs of those who seek for
edification and comfort in this portion of the Bible.

\(5\) A knowledge of the human heart - of human nature - is an
indispensable condition for a good commentator on the Psalms. The Psalms
comprise, more than any other book in the Bible, a record of the
workings of the heart. Indeed, they pertain mostly to the heart. They
are not addressed, as the epistle to the Romans is, to the loftier
powers of the understanding, nor do they make such appeals to the
imagination as the visions of Isaiah, or the visions of John in Patmos.
It is the heart which, in the Psalms, is eminently the medium of
communication between the Divine Spirit and the soul. Of all parts of
the Bible there is most to illustrate the human heart in the Psalms. All
that there is in the heart of man is there in one way or another
illustrated, and in an almost endless variety of circumstances. Joy,
sorrow, penitence, gratitude, praise, despondency, sadness; love - love
to God - love to man; - the feelings experienced in sickness, and on a
recovery from sickness; - the anguish, the bitterness of soul, arising
from the ingratitude of others; terror at the wrath of God; the dread of
death; the peace which religion gives in the prospect of death; the joy
of prayer; the light which comes into the soul in answer to earnest
supplication; the calmness which springs from devout meditation on the
character of God and his law; the light which beams upon the soul after
long darkness; the effects of remembered guilt (as in Ps. 51); the
feeling of despair when God seems to have forsaken us; the feelings
which spring up in the heart on the reception of injuries; these are a
few among the many topics which are found illustrated in the Psalms in
the personal experience of the writers, and it is obvious that no one is
qualified to comment on these subjects unless he has himself a knowledge
of the workings of the human heart.

To be able to explain the words used; to state the origin and authorship
of the Psalms, and the occasion on which they were composed; to
investigate the genuineness and accuracy of the text, and to determine
the value of the varied readings; to understand and explain the
parallelisms, the rhythm, and the accents employed in the Psalms; to
comprehend and appreciate the poetry of the Psalms; or to gather
together what Jewish rabbis and the Christian fathers have written, or
to transplant from Germany what has been produced under Rationalistic
views of the Bible, or even what the German mind in its best workings
and under the influence of true religion has produced, is not all or
mainly what is demanded in a commentary on the Psalms that will meet the
wants of those in our own land, or that will illustrate the Psalms in
the manner that will be of most value to the great masses of the young,
the sick, the bereaved, the tempted, the aged, and the desponding. A man
who cannot in this varied manner enter into sympathy with the writers of
the Psalms in the workings of the human heart as there illustrated, is
not a man who is fully qualified to prepare a commentary on this Book.
For some purposes he may, indeed, make a book that will be valuable, but
not a book that will be valuable in relation to the real purpose
designed to be accomplished by the Psalms - to be a guide and a comfort
to believers of every station and condition, in all the varied
circumstances of human life, and in all the varied and complicated
workings of the human heart.

\(6\) It may be added that the Book of Psalms, in the main, is so plain,
so easy to be understood by the great mass of readers; so expressive of
the internal feelings and emotions, as to increase the difficulty in the
preparation of a commentary. The Psalms are so rich; so full of meaning;
so adapted to the wants of believers; they so meet the varied
experiences of the people of God, and are so replete with the
illustrations of piety; they so touch the deepest fountains of emotion
in the soul, that, so far as most of these points are concerned, a
"commentary," considered as an additional source of light, does not
differ materially from a candle considered as affording additional
splendor to the sun. What a man finds in the ordinary perusal of the
Psalms as a book of devotion, on the subject of deep experimental piety,
is so much in advance of what he will usually find in the commentary,
that he turns from the attempt to explain them with a feeling of deep
disappointment, and comes back to the book itself as better expressing
his emotions, meeting his necessities, and imparting consolation in
trial, than anything which the commentator can add. He welcomes the Book
of Psalms itself as a comforter and a guide; and in the little volume
sold now at so cheap a rate, or appended to his pocket Testament, the
common reader of the Bible finds more that is suited to his need than he
would in the voluminous commentary of Venema; in all the collections in
the Critici Sacri; in the Synopsis of Poole; in the Annotations of
Grotius; or in the learned expositions of DeWette - elegant as the work
of DeWette is - or of Tholuck, or Hengstenberg.

When these difficulties in composing a commentary on the Psalms are
considered - when a man who sits down to write one reflects on the
qualifications necessary for the task - and when under the influence of
these thoughts, constantly increasing in magnitude, and pressing upon
him more and more as he labors for a dozen years, though at intervals,
as I have done, in preparing a commentary on this portion of Scripture -
whatever ardor of desire or confidence of success he may have had at the
commencement of his enterprise, he will cease to wonder, as he
progresses in his work, that the efforts of others to prepare a
commentary heretofore have been a failure, and he will not be surprised,
should his life be lengthened out to see the result of his own labors,
if he finds that the world regards that at which he has toiled so long,
and which he hoped might be, in some measure, worthy of the volume he
has undertaken to explain, as but adding another to the long list of
unsuccessful attempts to prepare a proper exposition of the Book of
Psalms.
