### [Deuteronomy Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#001)

[Deuteronomy 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 15:1</span></span>

The year of release is no doubt identical with the sabbatical year of
the earlier legislation ([Exo 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#010)
ff, and [Lev 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#002) ff), the command of
the older legislation being here amplified. The release was probably for
the year, not total and final, and had reference only to loans lent
because of poverty (compare [Deu 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#004),
[Deu 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#007)). Yet even so the law was
found to be too stringent for the avarice of the people, because it was
one of those which the rabbis "made of none effect by their traditions."

[Deu 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#002)

Because it is called the Lord's release - Render, because proclamation
has been made of the Lord's release. The verb is impersonal, and implies
(compare [Deu 31:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#010)) that "the
solemnity of the year of release" has been publicly announced.

[Deu 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#003)

The foreigner would not be bound by the restriction of the sabbatical
year, and therefore would have no claim to its special remissions and
privileges. He could earn his usual income in the seventh as in other
years, and therefore is not exonerated from liability to discharge a
debt anymore in the one than the others.

[Deu 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#004)

There is no inconsistency between this and [Deu
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#011). The meaning seems simply to be,
"Thou must release the debt for the year, except when there be no poor
person concerned, a contingency which may happen, for the Lord shall
greatly bless thee." The general object of these precepts, as also of
the year of Jubilee and the laws respecting inheritance, is to prevent
the total ruin of a needy person, and his disappearance from the
families of Israel by the sale of his patrimony.

[Deu 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#009)

literally: "Beware that there be not in thy heart a word which is
worthlessness" (compare [Deu 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#013)
note).

[Deuteronomy 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">deu 15:14</span></span>

Thou shalt furnish him liberally - The verb in the Hebrew is remarkable.
It means "thou shalt lay on his neck," "adorn his neck with thy gifts."

[Deuteronomy 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">deu 15:15</span></span>

The commands here are repeated from [Exo
21:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#002), with amplifications relative
to the maidservant [Deu 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#012) and to
the making ([Deu 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#013) ff) liberal
provision for launching the freedman on an independent course of life.
The release of the servant is connected with the sabbatical principle
though not with the sabbatical year. It is noteworthy also that the
prospect of a gift of this sort, the amount of which was left to the
master's discretion, would be likely to encourage diligence and
faithfulness during the years of servitude.

[Deu 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#018)

He hath been worth a double hired servant to thee, in serving thee six
years - "i. e." such a servant has earned twice as much as a common
hired laborer would have done in the same time.

[Deuteronomy 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">deu 15:19</span></span>

Compare [Exo 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#011) ff. The directions
of the preceding legislation (see [Num
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#015) ff) are here assumed, with the
injunction added, that the animals thus set apart to God [Deu
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#019) were not to be used by their
owners for their earthly purposes. It is further allowed that firstborn
animals which had a blemish should be regarded as exceptions, and
instead of being given to God might be used as food [Deu
15:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#021). The application of the
firstborn of cattle is here directed as in [Deu
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#006), [Deu
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#017); [Deu
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#023) : they are to be consumed in the
sacred Feasts at the sanctuary.
