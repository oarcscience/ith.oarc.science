### [Deuteronomy Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#001)

[Deuteronomy 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 29:1</span></span>

This and the following chapter contain the address of Moses to the
people on the solemn renewal of the covenant. Consult the marginal
references for proof of historical statements or explanation of obscure
words.

[Deuteronomy 29:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">deu 29:4</span></span>

Ability to understand the things of God is the gift of God (compare [Co1
2:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#013)); yet man is not guiltless if
he lacks that ability. The people had it not because they had not felt
their want of it, nor asked for it. Compare [Co2
3:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#014).

[Deuteronomy 29:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 29:9</span></span>

That ye may prosper - literally, "that ye may act wisely." The
connection of the two ideas of wisdom in conduct and prosperity in
circumstances is noteworthy.

[Deuteronomy 29:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">deu 29:11</span></span>

The covenant was national, and therefore embraced all the elements which
make up the nation. The "little ones" would of course be represented by
their parents or guardians; the absent [Deu
29:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#015) by those present; nor were the
servants and proselytes to be excluded (compare [Act
2:39](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#039)). The text is fairly alleged in
justification of the Church's practice of admitting little ones into
covenant with God by Baptism, and accepting promises made on their
behalf by sponsors.

[Deuteronomy 29:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">deu 29:15</span></span>

With him that is not here with us - i. e. as the Jews explain,
posterity; which throughout all generations was to be taken as bound by
the act and deed of those present and living.

[Deuteronomy 29:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">deu 29:17</span></span>

Idols - See the margin, "dungy gods;" i. e. clods or stocks which can be
rolled about (compare [Lev 26:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#030)).

[Deuteronomy 29:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">deu 29:18</span></span>

The word here and in [Deu 32:32](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#032)
rendered "gall," is in [Hos 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#004)
translated "hemlock." It is the name of a plant of intense bitterness,
and of quick growth; and is therefore repeatedly used in conjunction
with "wormwood" (compare [Jer 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#015);
[Lam 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#019); [Amo
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#012)), to express figuratively the
nature and effects of sin (compare the marginal references.). The herb
is probably the poppy. Hence, the "water" (i. e. juice) "of gall" [Jer
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#014); [Jer
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#015) would be opium. This would
explain its employment in the stupefying drink given to criminals at the
time of execution (compare [Psa 69:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#021);
[Mat 27:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#034)), and the use of the word
as synonymous with poison (compare [Deu
32:33](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#033); [Job
20:16](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#016)).

Wormwood - is the plant "absinthium." It is used to denote
metaphorically the distress and trouble which result from sin.

"The root that beareth gall and wormwood," means in this place any
person lurking among them who is tainted with apostasy.

[Deuteronomy 29:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">deu 29:19</span></span>

Compare on the thought [Jer 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#017). The
secret and presumptuous sinner is meant who flatters himself that all is
well and will be well with him, since he follows his own devices and
prospers. Compare [Psa 73:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#011) ff.

To add drunkenness to thirst - The sense is probably: "Himself, drinking
iniquity like water, [Job 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#016), he
corrupts and destroys others who are thirsting for it or prone to it."

The sense of the whole passage from [Deu
29:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#016) onward to [Deu
29:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#020) may be exhibited thus: "Ye have
seen the abominations of idolatry among the pagan. Do you therefore look
diligently that there be no secret idolater among you; a root of
bitterness to all about him. Let there be no one, I say, who when he
hears the curses of the Law against this sin, flatters himself, saying
within himself, 'All will be well, for I walk unmolested in my own
self-chosen path; ' and thus acting, not only takes his own fill of sin,
but destroys likewise every tempted brother within his reach, for the
Lord will not spare him," etc.

[Deuteronomy 29:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">deu 29:23</span></span>

The description is borrowed from the local features of the Dead Sea and
its vicinity. The towns of the vale of Siddim were fertile and well
watered (compare [Gen 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#010)) until
devastated by the wrath of God [Gen
19:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#024). The ruin of Israel and its
land should be of the like sort (compare [Lev
26:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#031); [Psa
107:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#034); [Zep
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#009)). The desolate state of Palestine
at present, and the traces of former fertility and prosperity, are
attested by every traveler.

[Deuteronomy 29:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">deu 29:29</span></span>

The secret things belong unto the Lord our God - This verse seems to be
added as a solemn admonition on the part of Moses, in order to close the
series of blessings and curses which he has delivered. The sense seems
to be this: "The future, when and how these good and evil things will
take effect, it lies with the Lord our God to determine; it pertains not
to man's sphere and duty. God's revealed will is that which we must
carry out." The 17th of our Articles of Religion concludes with much the
same sentiment.
