### [Ezekiel Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#001)

[Ezekiel 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 17:1</span></span>

Ezekiel, after describing by a figure the circumstances and conditions
of the Jews and Zedekiah, the vassal of the Assyrian monarch, warns them
of the delusive character of their hopes of help from Egypt, protests
against the perfidy which must accompany such alliance, and points out
that the restoration of the people of God will be effected by a very
different son of David. The close of this chapter is a striking
prediction of the kingdom of the Messiah.

[Ezekiel 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 17:3</span></span>

A great eagle ... - Probably the golden eagle, whose plumage has the
variety of color here depicted. The eagle (the king of birds) is a
natural representative of monarchs (compare, [Jer
48:40](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#040)), and was an Assyrian emblem.

With great wings, Iongwinged - literally, "great of wing, long of
pinion," because he has swept victoriously over widely distant lands -
of divers colors, because his subjects are of various races and tongues.
Jerusalem is here called "Lebanon" because Lebanon is the proper home of
the cedar. The "highest branch" or "topshoot" is Jeconiah, the rightful
king of Jerusalem, the "young twigs" are his children and the princes
carried by Nebuchadnezzar to Babylon.

[Ezekiel 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 17:4</span></span>

A land of traffick - The land of Babylon.

[Ezekiel 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 17:5</span></span>

He took also of the seed of the land - Zedekiah the king's uncle, not a
Babylonian satrap, was made king.

[Ezekiel 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 17:6</span></span>

Spreading - On the ground, not trained to a pole, that it might have no
other prop but Nebuchadnezzar. As a vine it was less majestic than a
cedar [Eze 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#003); but compare [Psa
80:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#010).

Whose branches ... - Rather, in order that her branches should turn unto
him, and that her roots should be under him.

[Ezekiel 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 17:7</span></span>

Another great eagle - This is the king of Egypt, mighty indeed but not
like the first.

By the furrows of her plantation - From the beds, where it was planted
to bring forth fruit for another, it shot forth its roots to him that he
might water it. Zedekiah was courting the favor of Egypt while he owed
his very position to the bounty of Assyria.

[Ezekiel 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 17:9</span></span>

Her spring - Rather, her growth.

Even without ... - Translate; and not with great power or with much
people is it to be raised up from its roots again.

[Ezekiel 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 17:17</span></span>

To cast up mounts and build forts - was the business not of the
relieving but of the besieging army. Translate it: when men cast up
mounts and build forts to destroy many persons.

[Ezekiel 17:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eze 17:22</span></span>

A contrast between the dealings of Nebuchadnezzar and of Yahweh.
Nebuchadnezzar "cut off," Yahweh will "set up" the topshoot;
Nebuchadnezzar "carried it into a land of traffic," Yahweh will "plant
it in the mountain of the height of Israel." Nebuchadnezzar set his
favorite as a "vine, lowly" though not poor, in the place where such
trees as the humble "willow" grow and thrive. Yahweh's favorite is like
the "lofty cedar, eminent upon a high mountain."

The highest branch of the high cedar - The rightful representative of
the royal house of David, the Messiah.

Tender one - The Messiah. This prophecy rests upon [Isa
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001), [Isa
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#010).

[Ezekiel 17:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eze 17:23</span></span>

In the mountain of the height of Israel - The parallel passage [Eze
20:40](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#040) points to the mountain on which
the temple stood. But it is not here the actual Mount Moriah so much as
the kingdom of which that mountain was the representative, the seat of
the throne of the anointed Son of God ([Psa
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#006); compare [Psa
40:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#002)).

All fowl of every wing - (or, of every kind) are those who flock from
all lands to this kingdom. Compare [Mat
13:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#032).

The prophet brings prominently forward the future exaltation of the
king; and he furnishes us thereby with hope, encouragement, and
consolation, at such times as we see the Church of Christ in like
depression.

[Ezekiel 17:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">eze 17:24</span></span>

The trees fo the field - The kingdoms of the world as contrasted with
the kingdom of God. The truth here enunciated is a general one. God
gives the promise, God fulfils it.
