<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_000">ch2 12:0</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>This chapter runs parallel with Kings (see the marginal reference), but considerably enlarges the narrative. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#001">2 Chronicles 12:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">ch2 12:1</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>All Israel with him - i. e., "all Judah and Benjamin" - all the Israelites of those two tribes. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#002">2 Chronicles 12:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">ch2 12:2</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Shishak ... came up ... because they had transgressed - The writer speaks from a divine, not a human, point of view. Shishak's motive in coming up was to help Jeroboam, and to extend his own influence. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#003">2 Chronicles 12:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">ch2 12:3</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>twelve hundred chariots - This number is not unusnal (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#007">Exo 14:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#026">Kg1 10:26</A>). Benhadad brought 1,200 chariots into the field against Shalmaneser II; and Ahabhad at the same time a force of 2,000 chariots (compare the <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#001">Kg1 20:1</A> note).
<p>The Lubims or "Libyans" <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#043">Dan 11:43</A>, were a people of Africa, distinct from the Egyptians and the Ethiopians dwelling in their immediate neighborhood. They were called Ribu or Libu by the Egyptians. See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#013">Gen 10:13</A>.
<p>Sukkiims - This name does not occur elsewhere. The Septuagint, who rendered the word "Troglodytes," regarded the Sukkiim probably as the "cave-dwellers" along the western shore of the Red Sea; but the conjecture that the word means "tent-dwellers" is plausible, and would point rather to a tribe of Arahs (Scenitae). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#004">2 Chronicles 12:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">ch2 12:4</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>See 1 the Kings 14:25 note. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#006">2 Chronicles 12:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">ch2 12:6</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>They said, The Lord is righteous - i. e., they acknowledged the justice of the sentence which had gone forth against them <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#005">Ch2 12:5</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#007">2 Chronicles 12:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">ch2 12:7</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Compare the repentance of Ahab (marginal reference) and that of the Ninevites <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#005">Jon 3:5-10</A> which produced similar revocations of divine decrees that had been pronounced by the mouth of a prophet.
<p>Some deliverance - Rather, "deliverance for a short space" (see the margin). Because of the repentance, the threat cf immediate destruction was withdrawn; but the menace was still left impending, that the people might be the more moved to contrition and amendment. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#008">2 Chronicles 12:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">ch2 12:8</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>That they may know my service, and the service of the kingdom - i. e., that they may contrast the light burthen of the theocracy with the heavy yoke of a foreign monarch. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#014">2 Chronicles 12:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">ch2 12:14</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>He prepared not his heart ... - See the margin. Rehoboam's sin was want of earnestness and consistency.
