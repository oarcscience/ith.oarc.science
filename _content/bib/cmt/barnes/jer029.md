### [Jeremiah Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#001)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 29:0</span></span>

Appended to this history of the struggle with the false prophets at home
is a letter addressed to the exiles at Babylon Jer. 29. There was at
Babylon as at Jerusalem the same determination of the Jews never to
submit quietly to a foreign rule. This Jeremiah sought to quell. His
words found credence, but not without resistance on the part of the
false prophets.

[Jeremiah 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 29:1</span></span>

The residue of the ciders - i. e., such of the elders as were still
alive.

[Jeremiah 29:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 29:2</span></span>

The queen - The queen-mother.

[Jeremiah 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 29:3</span></span>

Elasah - Probably brother of Ahikam [Jer
26:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#024), and therefore an acceptable
person at the Chaldaean court. As Zedekiah had to go in person to
Babylon in his fourth year [Jer 51:59](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#059),
this embassy was probably sent two or three years earlier. Its date,
however, was subsequent to the vision in [Jer
24:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#001). It is appended therefore to
Jer. 28, not as later in point of time, but because of the similarity of
subject.

[Jeremiah 29:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 29:4</span></span>

As the exile was God's doing for their good, they were to make the best
of their position, and acquire wealth and influence; whereas if they
were always restlessly looking out for the opportunity of returning
home, they would rapidly fall into poverty and dwindle away.

[Jer 29:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#007)

Seek the peace of the city ... - Not only because their welfare for
seventy years was bound up with that of Babylon, but because it would
have degraded their whole moral nature to have lived as conspirators,
banded together against the country that was for the time their home.

[Jeremiah 29:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 29:8</span></span>

Your prophets and your diviners - The evils from which the people had
suffered so cruelly at home followed them in their exile.

Dreams which ye cause to be dreamed - As long as there was a market for
dreams, so long there would be plenty of impostors to supply them.

[Jeremiah 29:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 29:10</span></span>

After seventy years - literally, according to the measure of the
fulfillment of 70 years for Babylon. The 70 years ([Jer
25:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#011) note) are primarily the length
of the Babylonian empire, and only in a secondary sense that of the
Jewish exile.

[Jeremiah 29:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 29:11</span></span>

An expected end - Rather, a future and a hope. The nation shall not come
to an end; the exile shall be followed by a restoration.

[Jeremiah 29:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 29:14</span></span>

Turn away your captivity - Or, "restore your prosperity."

[Jeremiah 29:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 29:16</span></span>

These verses are not in the Septuagint. But the text of the Septuagint
is here throughout so brief and confused as to be explicable only on the
supposition, that it represents what was left behind in Egypt when
Jeremiah died, copied probably with extreme haste, and with no
opportunity of careful collation afterward. On the other hand the Hebrew
text represents no hurried transcript, but the original manuscript, and
is especially trustworthy in the case of these letters sent to Babylon
(see also Jer. 51), because the originals of them would be available for
collation with the text preserved by Jeremiah himself. The verses were
probably intended to allay excitement in Babylon consequent upon the
knowledge that the representatives of various kings were assembled at
that very time at Jerusalem to form a coalition against Babylon [Jer
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#003).

[Jer 29:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#017)

Vile - The word does not occur elsewhere, but comes from a root
signifying to shudder, and thus has an intense meaning.

[Jeremiah 29:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 29:22</span></span>

A curse - There is a play here of words. which probably was the cause
why the death of these men passed into a proverb. One of them was named
ben-Kolaiah; and they are to be made a curse (קללה qelâlâh), because
Nebuchadnezzar had roasted (קלה qâlâh) them. Compare the marginal
reference note.

[Jeremiah 29:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 29:23</span></span>

Villany - Elsewhere folly, in the sense of lewdness [Jdg
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#006), unchastity.

[Jeremiah 29:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jer 29:24</span></span>

A narrative showing the effects of Jeremiah's letter. Shemaiah the
leader of the false prophets wrote to Zephaniah, urging him to restrain
the prophet's zeal with the prison and the stocks.

[Jer 29:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#024)

To Shemaiah - Rather, concerning.

The Nehelamite - Not as in the margin; but one belonging to the village
of Nehlam (unknown).

[Jer 29:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#026)

Officers - Deputy high priests who had the oversight of the temple.

Mad - See [Kg2 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#011) note. Many of the
symbolic actions of the prophets, such as that of Jeremiah going about
with a yoke on his neck, would be mocked at by the irreverent as passing
the line between prophecy and madness.

Prisons - Rather, the stocks [Jer
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#002).

The stocks - Rather, collar.

[Jer 29:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#028)

This captivity is long - Rather, It is long. God's anger, their
punishment, the exile, the time necessary for their repentance - all is
long to men who will never live to see their country again.
