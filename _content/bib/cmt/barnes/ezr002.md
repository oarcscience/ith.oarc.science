### [Ezra Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#001)

[Ezra 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ezr 2:1</span></span>

The province - Judaea was no longer a kingdom, but a mere "province" of
Persia. "The children of the province" are the Israelites who returned
to Palestine, as distinct from those who remained in Babylonia and
Persia.

Every one unto his city - That is, to the city whereto his forefathers
had belonged. Of course, in the few cases where this was not known [Ezr
2:59-62](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#059), the plan could not be carried
out.

Two other copies of the following list have come down to us - one in
Neh. 7:7-69, and the other in 1 Esdras 5:8-43. All seem to have been
taken from the same original document, and to have suffered more or less
from corruption. Where two out of the three agree, the reading should
prevail over that of the third.

[Ezra 2:43](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">ezr 2:43</span></span>

The Nethinims - The hieroduli or sacred slaves, "given" to the Levites
to assist them in their work (see [Ch1
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#002) note).

[Ezra 2:59](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#059)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_059">ezr 2:59</span></span>

Tel-melah, Tel-harsa, Cherub, Addan, and Immer, were probably cities, or
villages, of Babylonia, at which the Jews here spoken of had been
settled. The first and third have been reasonably identified with the
Thelme and Chiripha of Ptolemy. Of the rest, nothing is known at
present.

[Ezra 2:63](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#063)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_063">ezr 2:63</span></span>

The Tirshatha - i. e., Zerubbabel. See margin. The word is probably old
Persian, though it does not occur in the cuneiform inscriptions. Some
derive it from a root "to fear." See the introduction to the Book of
Ezra, first note.

A priest with Urim and with Thummim - See [Exo
28:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#030) note. According to the
rabbinical writers, the second temple permanently lacked this glory of
the first. Zerubbabel, it would seem by the present passage (compare
[Neh 7:65](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#065)), expected that the loss
would be only temporary.

[Ezra 2:64](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#064)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_064">ezr 2:64</span></span>

The sum total is given without any variation by Ezra, by Nehemiah (see
the marginal reference), and by Esdras (1 Esdras 5:41), who adds, that
in this reckoning only those of twelve years of age and upward were
counted.

It is curious that the total 42,360, is so greatly in excess of the
items. Ezra's items make the number 29,818; Nehemiah's 31,089, Esdras,
33,950. The original document was probably illegible in places, and the
writers were forced to make omissions.

[Ezra 2:69](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#069)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_069">ezr 2:69</span></span>

The numbers here and in Nehemiah (see the marginal reference) vary.

[Ezra 2:70](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#070)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_070">ezr 2:70</span></span>

All Israel - That the Israelites of the ten tribes returned to Palestine
with Zerubbabel is apparent:

\(1\) from [Ch1 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#003);

\(2\) from the enumeration of twelve chiefs ([Neh
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#007); 1 Esd. 5:8); and

\(3\) from various expressions in Ezra [Ezr
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#002), [Ezr
2:59](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#059); [Ezr
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#001).
