### [Jeremiah Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 17:1</span></span>

This section [Jer 17:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#001) is
inseparably connected with the preceding. Judah's sin had been described
[Jer 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#019) as one of which the very
Gentiles will become ashamed. and for which she will shortly be punished
by, an intervention of God's hand more marked than anything in her
previous history. Jeremiah now dwells upon the indelible nature of her
sin.

A pen of iron - i. e., an iron chisel for cutting inscriptions upon
tables of stone.

The point of a diamond - The ancients were well acquainted with the
cutting powers of the diamond.

Altars - Not Yahweh's one altar, but the many altars which the Jews had
set up to Baalim [Jer 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#013). Though
Josiah had purged the land of these, yet in the eleven years of
Jehoiakim's reign they had multiplied again, and were the external
proofs of Judah's idolatry, as the table of her heart was the internal
witness.

[Jeremiah 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 17:2</span></span>

While their children remember their altars - Perhaps an allusion to
their sacrifices of children to Moloch. Present perhaps at some such
blood-stained rite, its horrors would be engraven forever upon the
memory.

Groves - "Asherahs," i. e., wooden images of Astarte (see [Exo
34:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#013) note).

[Jeremiah 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 17:3</span></span>

O my mountain in the field - i. e., Jerusalem or Zion, called the Rock
of the Plain in [Jer 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#013). "The
field" is the open unenclosed country, here contrasted with the
privileged height of Zion.

Or sin - i. e., because of thy sin.

[Jeremiah 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 17:4</span></span>

The verb rendered "discontinue" is that used of letting the land rest
[Exo 23:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#011), and of releasing creditors
[Deu 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#002) in the sabbatical year. As
Judah had not kept these sabbatical years she must now discontinue the
tillage of God's inheritance until the land had had its rest. "Even
thyself may mean and that through thyself," through thine own fault.

[Jeremiah 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 17:5</span></span>

In the rest of the prophecy Jeremiah dwells upon the moral faults which
had led to Judah's ruin.

[Jer 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#006)

Like the heath - Or, "like a destitute man" [Psa
102:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#017). The verbs "he shall see" (or
fear) and "shall inhabit" plainly show that a man is here meant and not
a plant.

[Jer 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#008)

The river - Or, "water-course" [Isa
30:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#025), made for purposes of
irrigation.

Shall not see - Or, "shall not fear [Jer
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#006)." God's people feel trouble as
much as other people, but they do not fear it because they know

\(1\) that it is for their good, and

\(2\) that God will give them strength to bear it.

[Jer 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#009)

The train of thought is apparently this: If the man is so blessed [Jer
17:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#007) who trusts in Yahweh, what is
the reason why men so generally "make flesh their arm"? And the answer
is: Because man's heart is incapable of seeing things in a
straightforward manner, but is full of shrewd guile, and ever seeking to
overreach others.

Desperately wicked - Rather, mortally sick.

[Jer 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#010)

The answer to the question, "who can know it?" To himself a man's heart
is an inscrutable mystery: God alone can fathom it.

Ways - Rather, way, his course of life. The "and" must be omitted, for
the last clause explains what is meant "by man's way," when he comes
before God for judgment. It is "the fruit," the final result "of his
doings, i. e., his real character as formed by the acts and habits of
his life.

[Jer 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#011)

Rather, "As the partridge hath gathered eggs which it laid not, so ..."
The general sense is: the covetous man is as sure to reap finally
disappointment only as is the partridge which piles up eggs not of her
own laying, and is unable to hatch them.

A fool - A Nabal. See [Sa1 25:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#025).

[Jer 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#012), [Jer
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#013)

Or, "Thou throne ... thou place ... thou hope ... Yahweh! All that
forsake Thee etc." The prophet concludes his prediction with the
expression of his own trust in Yahweh, and confidence that the divine
justice will finally be vindicated by the punishment of the wicked. The
"throne of glory" is equivalent to Him who is enthroned in glory.

[Jer 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#013)

Shall be written in the earth - i. e., their names shall quickly
disappear, unlike those graven in the rock forever [Job
19:24](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#024). A board covered with sand is
used in the East to this day in schools for giving lessons in writing:
but writing inscribed on such materials is intended to be immediately
obliterated. Equally fleeting is the existence of those who forsake God.
"All men are written somewhere, the saints in heaven, but sinners upon
earth" (Origen).

[Jer 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#015)

This taunt shows that this prophecy was written before any very signal
fulfillment of Jeremiah's words had taken place, and prior therefore to
the capture of Jerusalem at the close of Jehoiakim's life. "Now" means
"I pray," and is ironical.

[Jer 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#016)

I have not hastened from - i. e., I have not sought to escape from.

A pastor to follow thee - Rather, "a shepherd after Thee." "Shepherd"
means "ruler, magistrate" ([Jer 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#008)
note), and belongs to the prophet not as a teacher, but as one invested
with authority by God to guide and direct the political course of the
nation. So Yahweh guides His people [Psa
23:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#001), and the prophet does so "after
Him," following obediently His instructions.

The woeful day - literally, "the day of mortal sickness:" the day on
which Jerusalem was to be destroyed, and the temple burned.

Right - Omit the word. What Jeremiah asserts is that he spake as in
God's presence. They were no words of his own, but had the authority of
Him before whom he stood. Compare [Jer
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#019).

[Jer 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#017)

A terror - Rather, "a cause of dismay," or consternation [Jer
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#017). By not fulfilling Jeremiah's
prediction God Himself seemed to put him to shame.

[Jer 17:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#018)

Confounded - Put to shame.

Destroy them ... - Rather, break them with a double breaking: a twofold
punishment, the first their general share in the miseries attendant upon
their country's fall; the second, a special punishment for their sin in
persecuting and mocking God's prophet.

[Jeremiah 17:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 17:19</span></span>

This prophecy on the observance of the Sabbath, is the first of a series
of short predictions. arranged probably in chronological order among
themselves, but in other respects independent of one another. Its tone
is mild, and dissuasive rather of future neglect than condemnatory of
past misconduct; and it may be assigned to the commencement of
Jehoiakim's reign. Its similarity to the prophecy contained in [Jer
22:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#001) makes it probable that they
were contemporaneous.

[Jer 17:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#019)

The gate of the children of the people - Perhaps the principal entrance
of the outer court of the temple. Very probably there was traffic there,
as in our Lord's time, in doves and other requisites for sacrifice, and
so the warning to keep the Sabbath was as necessary there as at the city
gates.

[Jer 17:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#021)

To yourselves - literally, "in your souls, i. e., in yourselves." They
were to be on their guard from the depths of their own conscience,
thoroughly and on conviction.

Bear no burden on the sabbath day - Apparently the Sabbath day was kept
negligently. The country people were in the habit of coming to Jerusalem
on the Sabbath to attend the temple service, but mingled traffic with
their devotions, bringing the produce of their fields and gardens with
them for disposal. The people of Jerusalem for their part took [Jer
17:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#022) their wares to the gates, and
carried on a brisk traffic there with the villagers. Both parties seem
to have abstained from manual labor, but did not consider that buying
and selling were prohibited by the fourth commandment.

[Jer 17:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#025)

A picture of national grandeur. The prophet associates with the king the
princes of the Davidic lineage, who in magnificent procession accompany
the king as he goes in and out of Jerusalem.

Shall remain forever - Or, "shall be inhabited forever:" populousness is
promised.

[Jer 17:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#026)

The reward for keeping the Sabbath day holy consists in three things;

\(1\) in great national prosperity,

\(2\) in the lasting welfare of Jerusalem, and

\(3\) in the wealth and piety of the people generally, indicated by
their numerous sacrifices.

Bringing sacrifices of praise - Rather, "bringing praise." This clause
covers all that precedes.

The verse is interesting as specifying the exact limits of the dominions
of the Davidic kings, now confined to Judah and Benjamin. These two
tribes are divided according to their physical conformation into

\(1\) the Shefelah, or low country lying between the mountains and the
Mediterranean;

\(2\) the mountain which formed the central region, extending to the
wilderness of Judah, on the Dead Sea; and

\(3\) the Negeb, or arid region, which lay to the south of Judah.

[Jer 17:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#027)

Upon disobedience follows the anger of God, which will consume like a
fire all the, splendor of the offending city.
