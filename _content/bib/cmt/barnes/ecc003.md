### [Ecclesiastes Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#001)

[Ecclesiastes](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ecc 3:0</span></span>

It follows from [Ecc 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#026) that the
works of people are subject in their results to another will (God's)
besides that of the doer. Here is the germ of the great question of
later times - how to reconcile man's free will with God's decrees.
Solomon's way of stating it is that to every separate work, which goes
to make up the great aggregate of human activity (the "travail," [Ecc
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#010)), there is a season, an
appropriate time which God appoints for its being done [Ecc
3:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#001). To the question [Ecc
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#009) What profit? he answers that the
works of people, if done according to God's appointment, are a part of
that beautifully arranged scheme of Divine Providence which, as a whole,
is, by reason of its extent and duration, incomprehensible to us [Ecc
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#011). Man's good is to rejoice and do
good in his lifetime, which he can do only as God appoints [Ecc
3:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#012). God's work, of which this
would be a part, is forever, is perfect (and so not subject to vanity),
and is calculated to teach people to revere Him [Ecc
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#014). His work, which was begun long
ago, is now going on to completion; His work hereafter will be a
complement of something which was done previously; and He recalls the
past in order to add to it what shall make it complete and perfect [Ecc
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#015). The principle of divine
government - that every work in order to be permanent and successful
must be God's work as well as man's work - is also declared in [Psa
127:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#001) (attributed to Solomon).

[Ecclesiastes 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ecc 3:1</span></span>

Everything - More particularly, the actions of people (e. g. his own,
[Ecc 2:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#001)) and events which happen to
people, the world of Providence rather than the world of creation. It
would seem that most of his own works described in [Ecc
2:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#001) were present to his mind. The
rare word translated "season" means emphatically "fitting time" (compare
[Neh 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#006); [Est
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#027), [Est
9:31](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#031)).

[Ecclesiastes 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ecc 3:5</span></span>

Stones may be regarded either as materials for building, or as
impediments to the fertility of land (see [Kg2
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#019), [Kg2
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#025); [Isa
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#002)).

[Ecclesiastes 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ecc 3:6</span></span>

Get ... lose - Rather, seek, and a time to give up for lost.

[Ecclesiastes 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ecc 3:7</span></span>

Rend - i. e., Tear garments in sign of mourning or anger. See [Sa2
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#002), [Sa2
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#011) ff.

[Ecclesiastes 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ecc 3:11</span></span>

Rather, He hath made all (the travail, [Ecc
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#010)) beautiful (fit, in harmony with
the whole work of God) in its time; also He hath set eternity in their
heart (i. e., the heart of the sons of men, [Ecc
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#010)).

The word, translated "world" in the text, and "eternity" in this note,
is used seven times in Ecclesiastes.

The interpretation "eternity," is conceived in the sense of a long
indefinite period of time, in accordance with the use of the word
throughout this book, and the rest of the Old Testament. God has placed
in the inborn constitution of man the capability of conceiving of
eternity, the struggle to apprehend the everlasting, the longing after
an eternal life.

With the other meaning "the world," i. e., the material world, or
universe, in which we dwell, the context is explained as referring
either to the knowledge of the objects with which this world is filled,
or to the love of the pleasures of the world. This meaning seems to be
less in harmony with the context than the other: but the principal
objection to it is that it assigns to the word in the original a sense
which, although found in rabbinical Hebrew, it never bears in the
language of the Old Testament.

So ... find - i. e., Without enabling man to find. Compare [Ecc
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#013); [Ecc
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#017).

[Ecclesiastes 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ecc 3:12</span></span>

In them - i. e., in the sons of men.

To do good - In a moral sense. Physical enjoyment is referred to in [Ecc
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#013).

[Ecclesiastes 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ecc 3:14</span></span>

The last clause of this verse goes beyond a declaration of the fact of
God's government of the world [Ecc
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#026) by adding the moral effect which
that fact is calculated to produce on those who see it. It is the first
indication of the practical conclusion [Ecc
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#013) of the book.

[Ecclesiastes 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ecc 3:15</span></span>

Rather, What has been - what was before, and what shall be has been
before. The word "is" in our the King James Version is erroneously
printed in Roman letters: it does not exist in the Hebrew (it should
have been italicized); and the word there translated "now" is the same
which is translated as "already."

Requireth - i. e., requireth for judgment, as the word specially means
in [Sa2 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#011); [Eze
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#018)...It is obvious from the context
of the last clause of [Ecc 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#014), and
[Ecc 3:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#016), that this is the meaning
here.

Past - literally, "put to flight."

The meaning of the verse is that there is a connection between events -
past, present and future - and that this connection exists in the
justice of God who controls all.

[Ecclesiastes 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ecc 3:16</span></span>

That great anomaly in the moral government of this world, the seemingly
unequal distribution of rewards and punishments, will be rectified by
God, who has future times and events under His control [Ecc
3:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#016). As for people, they are
placed by God, who is their teacher, in a humble condition, even on a
level with inferior animals, by death, that great instance of their
subjection to vanity [Ecc 3:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#018),
which reduces to its original form all that was made of the dust of the
ground [Ecc 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#020). And though the
destinies of man and beast are different, yet in our present lack of
knowledge as to God's future dealing with our spirits [Ecc
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#021), man finds his portion (see the
[Ecc 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#010) note) in such labor and such
joy as God assigns to him in his lifetime [Ecc
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#022).

[Ecc 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#016)

I saw ... - Rather, I have seen (as in [Ecc
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#010)) under the sun the place etc. The
place of judgment means the seat of the authorized judge. Compare "the
place of the holy" [Ecc 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#010).

[Ecc 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#017)

A time there - i. e., a time with God.

[Ecc 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#018)

literally, I said in my heart with regard to the sons of men, it is that
God may prove them and show them that they are beasts, they themselves.
"Showing" is the reading of the Septuagint and Syriac: the present
Hebrew text reads "seeing." The meaning is that the long delay of God's
judgment [Ecc 3:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#016) is calculated to
show people that the brevity of their life renders them incapable of
following out and understanding His distributive justice.

[Ecc 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#019)

That which befalleth the sons of men - literally, the event
(happenstance) of the sons of men, i. e., what comes upon them from
outside, by virtue of the ordinance of God. See the [Ecc
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#014) note. Death in particular [Ecc
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#002), [Ecc
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#011) is a part of the "work that God
doeth."

[Ecc 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#021)

The King James Version of this verse is the only rendering which the
Hebrew text, as now pointed, allows. It is in accordance with the best
Jewish and many modern interpreters. A slightly different pointing would
be requisite to authorize the translation, "Who knows the spirit of the
sons of man whether it goes above, and, the spirit of the beast whether
it goes down below?" etc., which, though it seems neither necessary nor
suitable, is sanctioned by the Septuagint and other versions and by some
modern interpreters.

Who knoweth - This expression (used also in [Ecc
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#019); [Ecc
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#012)) does not necessarily imply
complete and absolute ignorance. In [Psa
90:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#011), it is applied to what is
partially understood: compare similar forms of expression in [Pro
31:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#010); [Psa
94:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#016); [Isa
53:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001). Moreover, it is evident from
marginal references that Solomon did not doubt the future existence and
destination of the soul. This verse can only be construed as a
confession of much ignorance on the subject.

[Ecc 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#022)

What shall be after him - i. e., What shall become of the results of his
work after he is dead. Compare [Ecc
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#019); [Ecc
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#012).
