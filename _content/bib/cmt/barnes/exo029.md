Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Exodus Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#001)

The consecration of the priests. See the notes to Lev. 8-9.

[Exo 29:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#004)

Door of the tabernacle - Entrance of the tent. See [Lev
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#003).

[Exo 29:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#027)

The "waving" was the more solemn process of the two: it was a movement
several times repeated, while "heaving" was simply a "lifting up" once.

[Exo 29:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#033)

A stranger - One of another family, i. e. in this case, one not of the
family of Aaron.

[Exodus 29:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#038)

[Exo 29:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#038)

The continual burnt-offering - The primary purpose of the national altar
is here set forth. The victim slain every morning and every evening was
an acknowledgment that the life of the people belonged to Yahweh; the
offering of meal was an acknowledgment that all their works rightly done
were His due (see Lev. 2); while the incense symbolized their daily
prayers.

[Exo 29:39](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#039)

At even - See [Exo 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#006).

[Exo 29:40](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#040)

A tenth deal - i. e. the tenth part of an Ephah; it is sometimes called
an Omer ([Exo 16:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#036); see [Lev
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#013)). The Ephah seems to have been
rather less than four gallons and a half (see [Lev
19:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#036) note); and the tenth deal of
flour may have weighed about 3 lbs. 2 oz.

An hin - The word appears to be Egyptian. The measure was one-sixth of
an ephah. The quarter of a bin was therefore about a pint and a half.
See [Lev 19:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#036) note.

Beaten oil - See [Exo 27:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#020).

Wine for a drink offering - The earliest mention of the drink-offering
is found in connection with Jacob's setting up the stone at Bethel [Gen
35:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#014). But it is here first associated
with the rites of the altar. The law of the drink-offering is stated
[Num 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#005) following. Nothing whatever
is expressly said in the Old Testament regarding the mode in which the
wine was treated: but it would seem probable, from the prohibition that
it should not be poured upon the altar of incense [Exo
30:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#009), that it used to be poured on the
altar of burnt-offering.

[Exo 29:42](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#042)

At the door of the tabernacle - At the entrance of the tent.

[Exo 29:43](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#043)

The (tabernacle) shall be sanctified - The word "tabernacle" is
certainly not the right one to be here supplied. What is probably meant
is the spot in which Yahweh promises to meet with the assembly of His
people. The verse may be rendered, And in that place will I meet with
the children of Israel, and it shall be sanctified with my glory. See
also the margin.

[Exo 29:44-45](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#044)

The purpose of the formal consecration of the sanctuary and of the
priests who served in it was, that the whole nation which Yahweh had set
free from its bondage in Egypt might be consecrated in its daily life,
and dwell continually in His presence as "a kingdom of priests and an
holy nation." [Exo 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#006).

[Exo 29:46](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#046)

Compare [Gen 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#007).
