### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#001)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 12:1</span></span>

The first step taken by the new king was a most judicious one. If
anything could have removed the disaffection of the Ephraimites, and
caused them to submit to the ascendancy of Judah, it would have been the
honor done to their capital by its selection as the scene of the
coronation. Shechem (now Nablous) lay on the flank of Mount Gerizim,
directly opposite to Mount Ebal, in a position second to none in all
Palestine. Though Abimelech had destroyed the place [Jdg
9:45](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#045), it had probably soon risen
again, and was once more a chief city, or perhaps "the" chief city, of
Ephraim. Its central position made it a convenient place for the general
assembly of the tribes, as it had been in the days of Joshua [Jos
8:30-35](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#030); 24:1-28; and this would
furnish an additional reason for its selection.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg1 12:2</span></span>

Heard of it - i. e., of the death of Solomon and accession of Rehoboam.
This would be more clear without the division into chapters; which
division, it must be remembered, is without authority.

Dwelt in Egypt - By a change of the pointing of one word, and of one
letter in another, the Hebrew text here will read as in [Ch2
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2010.htm#002), "returned out of Egypt; and they
sent and called him."

In the Septuagint Version the story of Jeroboam is told in two different
ways. The general narrative agrees closely with the Hebrew text; but an
insertion into the body of 1 Kings 12 - remarkable for its minuteness
and circumstantiality - at once deranges the order of the events, and
gives to the history in many respects a new aspect and coloring. This
section of the Septuagint, though regarded by some as thoroughly
authentic, absolutely conflicts with the Hebrew text in many important
particulars. In its general outline it is wholly irreconcileable with
the other narrative; and, if both stood on the same footing, and we were
free to choose between them, there could be no question about preferring
the history as given in our Version.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg1 12:4</span></span>

The complaint was probably twofold. The Israelites no doubt complained
in part of the heavy weight of taxation laid upon them for the
maintenance of the monarch and his court [Kg1
4:19-23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#019). But their chief grievance was
the forced labor to which they had been subjected [Kg1
5:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#013); [Kg1
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#028). Forced labor has been among the
causes leading to insurrection in many ages and countries. It helped to
bring about the French Revolution, and it was for many years one of the
principal grievances of the Russian serfs. Jeroboam's position as
superintendent of the forced labors of the tribe of Ephraim [Kg1
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#028) revealed to him the large amount
of dissatisfaction which Solomon's system had produced, and his
contemplated rebellion in Solomon's reign may have been connected with
this standing grievance.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg1 12:6</span></span>

The old men, that stood before Solomon his father - Perhaps "the
princes" of [Kg1 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#002). Solomon placed
great value upon good advisers [Pro
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#014); [Pro
15:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#022); [Pro
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#006).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg1 12:7</span></span>

The advice was not that the king should permanently resign the office of
ruler, but that he should "for once" be ruled by his people.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg1 12:8</span></span>

The age of Rehoboam at his accession is an interesting and difficult
question. According to the formal statement of the present text of [Kg1
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#021); [Ch2
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#013), he had reached the mature age
of 41 years, and would therefore be unable to plead youth as an excuse
for his conduct. The general narrative, however, seems to assume that he
was quite a young man (compare [Ch2
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#007)). Perhaps the best way of
removing the whole difficulty would be to read in the above text
"twenty-one" for "forty-one." The corruption is one which might easily
take place, if letters were used for numerals.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg1 12:10</span></span>

My little finger ... - i. e., "You shall find my hand heavier on you
than my father's - as much heavier as if my little finger were thicker
than his loins."

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg1 12:11</span></span>

Scorpions - By this word some understand whips having leaden balls at
the ends of their lashes with hooks projecting from them; others the
thorny stem of the eggplant, or "the scorpion plant." But it seems best
to regard the expression as a figure of speech.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg1 12:15</span></span>

The cause was from the Lord - i. e., "the turn of events was from the
Lord." Human passions, anger, pride, and insolence, worked out the
accomplishment of the divine designs. Without interfering with man's
free will, God guides the course of events, and accomplishes His
purposes.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg1 12:16</span></span>

See the marginal reference. The words breathe unmistakeably the spirit
of tribal jealousy and dislike ([Kg1
11:40](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#040) note).

Now see to thine own house, David - i. e., "Henceforth, house of David,
look after thine own tribe, Judah, only." It is not a threat of war, but
a warning against interference.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg1 12:17</span></span>

Israel ... - The Israelites proper, or members of the other tribes, who
happened to be settled within the limits of the land of Judah. These
Israelites quietly submitted to Rehoboam. "Israel" through this chapter,
and throughout the rest of Kings, designates ordinarily "the ten
tribes," and is antithetical to "Judah."

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg1 12:18</span></span>

Adoram has been identified with Adoniram (marginal references), and even
with the Adoram of [Sa2 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#024). But it
is highly improbable that the same person was chief superintendent of
the forced labors during the whole of Solomon's long reign, and also
during a part of David's and Rehoboam's. We may therefore conclude that
the three names mark three distinct persons, perhaps of the same family,
who were respectively contemporary with the three kings. Adoram was
chosen, as best acquainted with the hardships whereof the rebels
complained, to arrange some alleviation of their burthens.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg1 12:19</span></span>

Unto this day - This expression shows that the writer, who lived during
the captivity, and consequently long after the rebellion of Israel had
come to an end, is embodying in his history the exact words of an
ancient document. His source, whatever it was, appears to have been also
followed by the writer of Chronicles. (See [Ch2
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2010.htm#019).)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg1 12:20</span></span>

The first act of the Israelites, on learning what had occurred at
Shechem, was to bring together the great "congregation" of the people
(compare [Jdg 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#001)), in order that,
regularly and in solemn form, the crown might be declared vacant, and a
king elected in the room of the monarch whose authority had been thrown
off. The congregation selected Jeroboam. The rank, the talent, and the
known energy of the late exile, his natural hostility to the house of
Solomon, his Ephraimitic descent, his acquaintance with the art of
fortification, and the friendly relations subsisting between him and the
great Egyptian king, pointed him out as the most suitable man for the
vacant post. If, according to the Septuagint, Shishak had not only
protected him against Solomon, but also given him an Egyptian princess,
sister to his own queen, in marriage, his position must have been such
that no other Israelite could have borne comparison with him. Again, the
prophecy of Ahijah would have been remembered by the more religious part
of the nation, and would have secured to Jeroboam their adhesion; so
that every motive, whether of policy or of religion, would have united
to recommend the son of Nebat to the suffrages of his countrymen.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg1 12:21</span></span>

The adhesion of Benjamin to Judah at this time comes upon us as a
surprise. By blood Benjamin was far more closely connected with Ephraim
than with Judah. All the traditions of Benjamin were antagonistic to
Judah, and hitherto the weak tribe had been accustomed to lean
constantly on its strong northern neighhour. But it would seem that, in
the half-century which had elapsed since the revolt of Sheba, the son of
Bichri [Sa2 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#001), the feelings of the
Benjamites had undergone a complete change. This is best accounted for
by the establishment of the religious and political capital at
Jerusalem, on the border line of the two tribes [Jos
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#008); [Jos
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#016), from where it resulted that the
new metropolis stood partly within the territory of either, and was in a
certain sense common to both. One of the gates of Jerusalem was "the
high gate of Benjamin" [Jer 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#002); and
probably Benjamites formed a considerable part of the population. The
whole tribe also, we may well believe, was sincerely attached to the
temple worship, in which they could participate far more freely and more
constantly than the members of remoter tribes, and to which the habits
of forty years had now accustomed them.

On the number of the Israelites, see [Exo
12:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#037), notes; and [Sa2
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#009), notes. The number mentioned here
is moderate, compared with the numbers given both previously and
subsequently [Ch2 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#003); [Ch2
17:14-18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#014).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg1 12:22</span></span>

Shemaiah was the chief prophet in Judah during the reign of Rehoboam, as
Ahijah was in Israel. See the marginal references.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg1 12:23</span></span>

The remnant - i. e., "the children of Israel which dwelt in the cities
of Judah" ([Kg1 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#017) note).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg1 12:25</span></span>

Built Shechem - In the sense of "enlarged and fortified." See [Dan
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#030). The first intention of Jeroboam
seems to have been to make Shechem his capital, and therefore he
immediately set about its fortification. So also he seems to have
fortified Penuel for the better security of his Trans-Jordanic
possessions (marginal reference).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg1 12:26</span></span>

Jeroboam's fear was lest a reaction should set in, and a desire for
reunion manifest itself. He was not a man content to remain quiet,
trusting simply to the promise made him [Kg1
11:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#038). Hence, he gave way to the
temptation of helping forward the plans of Providence by the crooked
devices of a merely human policy. His measures, like all measures which
involve a dereliction of principle, brought certain evils in their
train, and drew down divine judgment on himself. But they fully secured
the object at which he aimed. They prevented all healing of the breach
between the two kingdoms. They made the separation final. They produced
the result that not only no reunion took place, but no symptoms of an
inclination to reunite ever manifested themselves during the whole
period of the double kingdom.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg1 12:27</span></span>

Kill me - In case his subjects desired a reconciliation with Rehoboam,
Jeroboam's death would at once facilitate the re-establishment of a
single kingdom, and obtain favor with the legitimate monarch. (Compare
[Sa2 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#007).)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">kg1 12:28</span></span>

The "calves of gold" were probably representations of the cherubic form,
imitations of the two cherubim which guarded the ark of the covenant in
the holy of holies. But being unauthorized copies, set up in places
which God had not chosen, and without any divine sanction, the sacred
writers call them "calves." They were not mere human figures with wings,
but had at any rate the head of a calf or ox. (Hence, some attribute
this calf-worship entirely to Assyrian and Phoenician influence.)
Jeroboam, in setting them up, was probably not so much influenced by the
Apis-worship of Egypt, as:

\(1\) by a conviction that the Israelites could not be brought to attach
themselves to any worship which did not present them with sensible
objects to venerate;

\(2\) by the circumstance that he did not possess any of the old objects
of reverence, which had been concentrated at Jerusalem; and

\(3\) by the fact that he could plead for his "calves" the authority of
so great a name as Aaron (marginal reference).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg1 12:29</span></span>

In the first place, Jeroboam consulted the convenience of his subjects,
who would thus in no case have very far to go in order to reach one or
the other sanctuary. Further, he avoided the danger of reminding them
continually that they had no ark - a danger which would have been
imminent, had the two cherubs been placed together in one shrine.

He selected Bethel (in the south) for one of his seats of worship, on
account of its pre-eminent sanctity. (See the marginal reference; [Jdg
20:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#026); [Sa1
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#016).)

The north of Palestine did not furnish a spot possessing an equally
sacred character, but still Dan had to some extent the character of a
"holy city" (marginal reference).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">kg1 12:30</span></span>

This thing became a sin - i. e., this act of Jeroboam's became an
occasion of sin to the people. The author perhaps wrote the following
words thus: "The people went to worship before the one to Bethel and
before the other to Dan."

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">kg1 12:31</span></span>

He made an house of high places - i. e., "He built a temple, or
sanctuary, at each of the two cities where the calves were set up." The
writer uses the expression "house of high places" in contempt, meaning
that the buildings were not real temples, or houses of God, like that at
Jerusalem, but only on a par with the temples upon high places which had
long existed in various parts of the land.

Made priests of the lowest of the people - More correctly, "from all
ranks of the people." That the Levites did not accept Jeroboam's
innovations, and transfer their services to his two sanctuaries, must
have been the consequence of their faithful attachment to the true
worship of Yahweh. In all probability Jeroboam confiscated the Levitical
lands within his dominions for the benefit of the new priestly order
[Ch2 11:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#013).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">kg1 12:32</span></span>

A feast - Intended as a substitute for the Feast of tabernacles
(marginal reference "c"). It may also have assumed the character of a
feast of dedication, held at the same time, after the example of Solomon
[Kg1 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#002). His object in changing the
month from the seventh to the eighth, and yet keeping the day of the
month, is not clear. Perhaps it was on account of the later vintage of
the more northern regions. It is remarkable that Josephus places the
scene in the "seventh" month. He therefore, was not aware that the
people of Israel kept the feast of tabernacles a month later than their
brethren of Judah. The expression "he offered upon the altar" (see the
margin and [Exo 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#026)) shows that
Jeroboam himself officiated as priest, and offered this sacrifice - at
Bethel, not at Dan; where it is possible that the priests descended from
Jonathan, the son of Gershom and grandson of Moses, undertook the
services ([Jdg 18:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#030) note).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">kg1 12:33</span></span>

This verse belongs to 1 Kings 13 rather than to 1 Kings 12, being
intended as an introduction to what follows.

Which he had devised of his own heart - The entire system of Jeroboam
receives its condemnation in these words. His main fault was that he
left a ritual and a worship where all was divinely authorized, for
ceremonies and services which were wholly of his own devising. Not being
a prophet, he had no authority to introduce religious innovations. Not
having received any commission to establish new forms, he had no right
to expect that any religious benefit would accrue from them. (See [Kg1
12:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#026) note.)
