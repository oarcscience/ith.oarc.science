### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#001)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 5:1</span></span>

Compare the marginal reference. The chronicler adds some interesting
details 2Sa. 12:23-40 of the manner in which the various tribes from
both sides of the Jordan came to Hebron to make David king, and of the
joyful festivities on the occasion. The consummation to which events in
God's Providence had been leading had now come. Saul and Jonathan, Abner
and Ish-bosheth, were dead; David was already head of a very large
portion of Israel; the Philistines, and perhaps the remnant of the
Canaanites, were restless and threatening; and it was obviously the
interest of the Israelite nation to unite themselves under the
sovereignty of the valiant and virtuous son of Jesse, their former
deliverer, and the man designated by the word of God as their Captain
and Shepherd. Accordingly he was at once anointed king over all Israel
(compare [Sa2 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#004) note).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa2 5:3</span></span>

Before the Lord - Abiathar and Zadok the priests were both with David,
and the tabernacle and altar may have been at Hebron, though the ark was
at Kirjath-jearim.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa2 5:4</span></span>

The age of David is conclusive as to the fact that the earlier years of
Saul's reign (during which Jonathan grew up to be a man) are passed over
in silence, and that the events narrated from 1 Sam. 13 to the end of
the book did not occupy more than 10 years. If David was 20 years old at
the time he killed Goliath, four years in Saul's service, four years of
wandering from place to place, one year and four months in the country
of the Philistines, and a few months after Saul's death, would make up
the 10 years necessary to bring him to the age of 30.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa2 5:6</span></span>

David immediately after being anointed king of Israel, probably wished
to signalize his accession by an exploit which would be popular with all
Israel, and especially with Saul's tribe, Benjamin. He discerned the
importance of having Jerusalem for his capital both because it belonged
as much to Benjamin as to Judah, and on account of its strong position.

Except thou take away the blind ... - Rather, "and (the Jebusite) spake
to David, saying, Thou shalt not come hither, but the blind and the lame
shall keep thee off," i. e. so far shalt thou be from taking the
stronghold from us, that the lame and blind shall suffice to defend the
place.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa2 5:7</span></span>

The stronghold of Zion - Or castle [Ch1
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#005), [Ch1
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#007). The ancient Zion was the hill on
which the temple stood, and the castle seems to have been immediately to
the north of the temple. The modern Zion lies to the southwest of the
temple.

The same is the city of David - The name afterward given to it [Sa2
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#009), and by which it was known in the
writer's time.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa2 5:8</span></span>

i\. e. "Whosoever will smite the Jebusites, let him reach both the lame
and the blind, who are the hated of David's soul, by the gutter or
water-course, and he shall be chief." The only access to the citadel was
where the water had worn a channel (some understand a subterranean
channel), and where there was, in consequence, some vegetation in the
rock. Joab (see the marginal reference) took the hint, and with all the
activity that had distinguished his brother Anabel [Sa2
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#018), climbed up first. The blind and
the lame are either literally such, placed there in derision by the
Jebusites who thought the stronghold impregnable, or they are the
Jebusite garrison, so called in derision by David.

Wherefore they said ... - i. e. it became a proverb (as in [Sa1
19:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#024)). The proverb seems merely to
have arisen from the blind and the lame being the hated of David's soul,
and hence, to have been used proverbially of any that were hated, or
unwelcome, or disagreeable.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa2 5:9</span></span>

David dwelt in the fort - or stronghold, (as in [Sa2
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#007)) i. e. eventually, when the
buildings were completed, which may not have been for two or three
years. Millo appears to have been a fortress of some kind, the northern
defense of the city of David, and to have been a part of the original
Canaanite defenses of Zion, as appears probable also from there having
been a fortress called the house of Millo in the Canaanite city of
Shechem. ([Jdg 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#006) note, and [Sa2
9:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#001) :20.) Millo may be the native
name. Some identify it with the great platform called the Haram es
Sherif.

David built round about - Probably meaning built his own house and other
houses and streets, all, in short, that caused it to be coiled the city
of David. (Compare [Ch1 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#008).) The
buildings were within, on the south of Millo, so as to be protected by
it on the north, as they were east, west. and south, by the precipitous
ravines.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa2 5:11</span></span>

Hiram king of Tyre - Now mentioned for the first time. He survived
David, and continued his friendship to Solomon (marginal references).
The news of the capture of the city of the Jebusites had doubtless
reached Tyre, and created a great impression of David's power.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa2 5:17</span></span>

The hold - Not the same place which is so named in [Sa2
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#007), [Sa2
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#009), but probably the cave (or hold)
of Adullam [Sa2 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#013). The invasion
most probably took place before David had completed his buildings in the
city of David; and is probably referred to in [Sa2
23:8-17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#008).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa2 5:20</span></span>

Baal-perazim - Master or possessor of breaches, equivalent to place of
breaches. It was on a hill near Gibeon (see the marginal reference).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa2 5:21</span></span>

And there they left their images - An indication of the precipitancy of
their flight, and the suddenness with which the Israelites burst upon
them like a "breach of waters." The King James Version rendering "Burned
them," does not give a translation (compare the margin), but a gloss,
warranted by the explanation given in marginal references

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">sa2 5:23</span></span>

The mulberry trees - Rather, the Bacah-tree, and found abundantly near
Mecca. It is very like the balsam-tree, and probably derives its name
from the exudation of the sap in drops like tears when a leaf is torn
off. Some think the valley of Baca [Psa
84:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#006) was so called from this plant
growing there.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">sa2 5:25</span></span>

Geba - Better, as in marginal reference "Gibeon." Gazer should be
"Gezer" ([Jos 10:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#033), etc.); it lay
between the nether Bethhoron and the sea; on the direct route therefore
which the Philistines, fleeing from Gibeon, would take. The exact site
has now been identified ([Kg1 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#016)).
