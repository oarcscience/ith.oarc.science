Heritage

### [2 Chronicles Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 13:1</span></span>

The history of Abijah's reign is here related far more fully than in
Kings (marginal reference), especially as regards his war with Jeroboam.

[2 Chronicles 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 13:2</span></span>

See the [Kg1 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#002) note.

[2 Chronicles 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 13:3</span></span>

It has been proposed to change the numbers, here and in [Ch2
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#017), into 40,000, 80,000, and 50,000
respectively - partly because these smaller numbers are found in many
early editions of the Vulgate, but mainly because the larger ones are
thought to be incredible. The numbers accord well, however, with the
census of the people taken in the reign of David [Ch1
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#005), joined to the fact which the
writer has related [Ch2 11:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#013), of a
considerable subsequent emigration from the northern kingdom into the
southern one. The total adult male population at the time of the census
was 1,570, 000. The total of the fighting men now is 1,200, 000. This
would allow for the aged and infirm 370, 000, or nearly a fourth of the
whole. And in [Ch2 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#017), our author
may be understood to mean that this was the entire Israelite loss in the
course of the war, which probably continued through the whole reign of
Abijah.

[2 Chronicles 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch2 13:9</span></span>

Seven rams - "A bullock and two rams" was the offering which God had
required at the original consecration of the sons of Aaron [Exo
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#001); [Lev
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#002). Jeroboam, for reasons of his own,
enlarged the sacrifice, and required it at the consecration of every
priest.

[2 Chronicles 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch2 13:17</span></span>

Slain - The word means strictly "pierced," and will include both the
killed and the wounded. It is translated "wounded" in [Lam
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#012).

[2 Chronicles 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch2 13:18</span></span>

Brought under - "Humbled" or "defeated," not reduced to subjection.

[2 Chronicles 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch2 13:19</span></span>

Jeshanah is probably identical with the "Isanas" of Josephus, where a
battle took place in the war between Antigonus and Herod; but its
situation cannot be fixed. For Ephrain, see [Jos
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#023) note.

[2 Chronicles 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch2 13:20</span></span>

Jeroboam's death was a judgment upon him for his sins. Chronologically
speaking, his death is here out of place, for he outlived Abijah at
least two years (compare the marginal reference and [Kg1
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#009)); but the writer, not intending
to recur to his history, is naturally led to carry it on to its
termination.
