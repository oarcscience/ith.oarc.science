*Notes on the Bible*, by Albert Barnes, \[1834\], at Intangible Textual
Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Proverbs Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#001)

[Proverbs 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 20:1</span></span>

"Wine" and "strong drink" are personified as themselves doing what they
make men do. The latter (see [Lev 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#009)
note) is here, probably, the "palm-wine" of Syria.

[Proverbs 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 20:2</span></span>

Sinneth against his own soul - i. e., Against his own life (compare [Hab
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#010)).

[Proverbs 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 20:3</span></span>

Meddling - See [Pro 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#014) note.

[Proverbs 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 20:4</span></span>

Plowing time in Palestine is in November and December, when the wind
blows commonly from the North.

[Proverbs 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 20:5</span></span>

The contest between reticence on the one side and pertinacity in search
on the other is represented as by a parable. The well may be very deep
(compare the marginal reference), but the man of understanding" has
enough skill to draw up the water even to the last drop. Every question
is, as it were, a turning of the windlass.

[Proverbs 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 20:6</span></span>

Goodness - With the special sense of bounty, beneficence. Contrast
promise and performance. People boast of their liberality, yet we look
in vain for the fulfillment of actual obligations.

[Proverbs 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 20:9</span></span>

A warning voice against the spirit, which, ignorant of its own guilt, is
forward to condemn others.

[Proverbs 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 20:10</span></span>

See [Pro 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#001) : Here perhaps, as a
companion to [Pro 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#009), with a wider
application to all judging one man by rules which we do not apply to
ourselves or to another.

[Proverbs 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 20:11</span></span>

The graces or the faults of children are not trifles. "The child is
father of the man;" and the earliest actions are prophecies of the
future, whether it will be pure and right, or unclean and evil.

[Proverbs 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 20:12</span></span>

Not only do we owe the gifts of sight and hearing to Yahweh, but He,
being the giver, will also call us to account for them (compare [Psa
94:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#009)).

[Proverbs 20:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 20:13</span></span>

Open thine eyes - Be vigilant and active. That is the secret of
prosperity.

[Proverbs 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 20:14</span></span>

Naught - Bad, worthless [Kg2 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#019).

[Proverbs 20:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 20:15</span></span>

A precious jewel - literally, "A vessel of preciousness," i. e., most
precious of all are "the lips of knowledge."

[Proverbs 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 20:16</span></span>

The warning against suretiship and lust are here repeated and combined
(compare [Pro 27:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#013)). The judge tells
the creditor to seize the goods of the surety who has been weak enough
to pledge himself for those who are alien to him, instead of those of
the actual debtor. The reading of the the King James Version recalls in
the second clause the history of Tamar [Gen
38:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#017). The Hebrew text, however,
gives "strangers" in the masculine plural, and is probably right, the
feminine being the reading of the margin, probably adopted from [Pro
27:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#013).

[Proverbs 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 20:17</span></span>

"To eat gravel" was a Hebrew [Lam
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#016), and is an Arabic, phrase for
getting into trouble. So "bread," got by deceit, tastes sweet at first,
but ends by leaving the hunger of the soul unsatisfied. There is a
pleasure in the sense of cleverness felt after a hard bargain or a
successful fraud, which must be met by bidding men look on the after
consequences.

[Proverbs 20:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 20:19</span></span>

Flattereth - literally, "The man who opens his lips," who has no
reticence; such a man, with or without intending it, does the work of a
talebearer.

[Proverbs 20:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pro 20:20</span></span>

A connecting link between [Lev 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#009)
and [Mat 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#004). The words, "his lamp
shall be put out," describe the failure of outward happiness.

[Proverbs 20:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 20:21</span></span>

Or, An inheritance gotten hastily (greedily sought after by unjust
means) at the beginning, the end thereof shall not be blessed. Another
reading gives, "an inheritance loathed, (compare [Zac
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#008)), or with a curse upon it." The
King James Version agrees with the versions.

[Proverbs 20:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 20:22</span></span>

God's awarding to everyone according to his works, is the true check to
the spirit of vindictiveness (compare [Rom
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#017), [Rom
12:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#019)). Note that man is not told to
wait on the Lord in expectation of seeing vengeance on his enemies, but
"He shall save thee." The difference of the two hopes, in their effect
upon the man's character, is incalculable.

[Proverbs 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 20:24</span></span>

The order of a man's life is a mystery even to himself. He knows not
where he is going, or for what God is educating him.

[Proverbs 20:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">pro 20:25</span></span>

Better, It is a snare to a man to utter a vow (of consecration) rashly,
and after vows to inquire whether he can fulfill them. Both clauses are
a protest against the besetting sin of rash and hasty vows. Compare the
marginal reference.

[Proverbs 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">pro 20:26</span></span>

The wheel - The threshing wheel [Isa
28:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#027), which passes over the grain
and separates the grain from the chaff. The proverb involves therefore
the idea of the division of the good from the evil, no less than that of
the punishment of the latter.

[Proverbs 20:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 20:27</span></span>

The spirit of man - The "breath" of [Gen
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#007), the higher life, above that which
he has in common with lower animals, coming to him direct from God. Such
a life, with all its powers of insight, consciousness, reflection, is as
a lamp which God has lighted, throwing its rays into the darkest
recesses of the heart. A still higher truth is proclaimed in the
Prologue of John's Gospel. The candle, or lamp of Yahweh, derives its
light from "the Light that lighteth every man," even the Eternal Word.

[Proverbs 20:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">pro 20:30</span></span>

Better, The blueness of a wound is a cleansing of evil, so are the
stripes that go down to the inward parts of the belly.

The open sores of wounds left by the scourge, unclean and foul as they
seem, are yet a cleansing, purifying process for evil; so also are the
stripes that reach the inward parts of the belly, i. e., the sharp
reproofs, the stings of conscience, which penetrate where no scourge can
reach, into the inner life of man. Chastisement, whatever be its nature,
must be real; the scourge must leave its mark, the reproof must go deep.
