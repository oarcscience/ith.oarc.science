### [Nehemiah Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#001)

[Nehemiah 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">neh 4:4</span></span>

The parenthetical prayers of Nehemiah form one of the most striking
characteristics of his history. Here we have the first. Other examples
are [Neh 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#019); [Neh
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#009), [Neh
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#014); [Neh
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#014), [Neh
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#022), [Neh
13:29](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#029), [Neh
13:31](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#031).

[Nehemiah 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">neh 4:6</span></span>

Unto the half thereof - i. e. to half the intended height.

[Nehemiah 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">neh 4:7</span></span>

The Arabians ... - Probably a band, composed largely of Arabians,
Ammonites, and Ashdodites, which Sanballat maintained as a guard to his
person, and which formed a portion of "the army of Samaria" [Neh
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#002). A quarrel between such a band and
the people of Jerusalem might be overlooked by the Persian king.

[Nehemiah 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">neh 4:9</span></span>

Because of them - Or, "over against them," i. e. opposite to the place
where they were encamped, probably on the north side of the city.

[Nehemiah 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">neh 4:12</span></span>

Ten times - i. e. repeatedly.

From all places ... - Better as in the margin. The Jews who dwelt on the
Samaritan border, came to Jerusalem and tried to withdraw their
contingents of workmen from the work, representing to them the impending
danger, and saying, "You must return to your homes, and so escape it."

[Nehemiah 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">neh 4:13</span></span>

The lower places - The places where those within the walls had the least
advantage of elevation, the naturally weak places, where an enemy was
likely to make his attack.

[Nehemiah 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">neh 4:16</span></span>

Habergeons - Or, "coats of mail." Coats of mail were common in Assyria
from the ninth century B.C., and in Egypt even earlier. They were made
of thin laminae of bronze or iron, sewn upon leather or linen, and
overlapping one another.

[Nehemiah 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">neh 4:22</span></span>

Let every one ... lodge within Jerusalem - i. e. Let none return to his
own village or city at night, but let all take their rest in Jerusalem."

[Nehemiah 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">neh 4:23</span></span>

Saving ... - The text here is probably unsound. It yields no
satisfactory sense. See the margin.
