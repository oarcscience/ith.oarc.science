### [Leviticus Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#001)

[Leviticus 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 14:1</span></span>

The leper was excluded not only from the sanctuary but from the camp.
The ceremony of restoration which he had to undergo was therefore
twofold. The first part, performed outside the camp, entitled him to
come within and to mix with his brethren, [Lev
14:3-9](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#003). The second part, performed in
the court of the tabernacle and separated from the first by an interval
of seven days, restored him to all the privileges of the covenant with
Yahweh, Lev. 14:10-32.

[Leviticus 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lev 14:4</span></span>

These birds were provided by the priest for the man. They were not, like
the offerings for the altar, brought by the man himself (compare [Lev
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#004) with [Lev
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#010)), they were not presented nor
brought near the sanctuary, nor was any portion of them offered on the
altar.

Cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop - These three substances were used
as the common materials in rites of purification (compare [Exo
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#022); [Num
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#008); [Psa
51:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#007); [Heb
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#019)): the "cedar", or juniper, the
resin or turpentine of which was a preservative against decay, and
employed in medicines for elephantiasis and other skin diseases: the
"scarlet", a "tongue," or band, of twice-dyed scarlet wool, with which
the living bird, the hyssop, and the cedar wood were tied together when
they were dipped into the blood and water: the color expressing the
rosiness associated with health and vital energy: and the "hyssop" (see
[Exo 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#022)), probably the Caper plant,
whose cleansing virtues as a medicine, and use in the treatment of
ulcers and diseases of the skin allied to leprosy, were known to the
ancients. It has been conjectured that the scarlet band was used to tie
the hyssop upon the cedar, so as to make a sort of brush, such as would
be convenient for sprinkling.

[Leviticus 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">lev 14:5</span></span>

Running water - literally, living water, i. e. water fresh from the
spring [Gen 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#019); [Num
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#017).

[Leviticus 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">lev 14:7</span></span>

Seven times - The seal of the covenant, expressed in the number seven
(compare [Lev 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#009)), was renewed in
sprinkling him who, during his leprosy, had lived as an outcast. The
details of a restoration to health and freedom appear to be well
expressed in the whole ceremony. Each of the birds represented the
leper. They were to be of a clean kind, because they stood for one of
the chosen race. The death-like state of the leper during his exclusion
from the camp was expressed by killing one of the birds. The living bird
was identified with the slain one by being dipped in his blood mixed
with the spring water that figured the process of purification, while
the cured leper was identified with the rite by having the same water
and blood sprinkled over him. The bird then liberated was a sign that
the leper left behind him all the symbols of the death disease and of
the remedies associated with it, and was free to enjoy health and social
freedom with his kind. Compare [Col
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#012).

[Leviticus 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">lev 14:9</span></span>

The best of all types of the healing of the Spirit, was the healing of
the leper. In his formal cleansing, consecration, and atonement by
sacrifice (see the notes at [Lev
14:9-20](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#009)), the ministers of the
sanctuary bore public witness that he was restored to the blessing of
communion with his brethren and with Yahweh. Hence, when the Son of God
proved His divine mission by healing the lepers [Mat
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#005), He did not excuse them from
going to the priest to "offer for the cleansing those things which Moses
commanded" [Mar 1:44](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#044); [Luk
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#014) "for a testimony to the people"
[Mat 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#004).

[Leviticus 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">lev 14:10</span></span>

Two young rams from one to three years old (not lambs), a ewe lamb in
her first year (see [Lev 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#006)),
three-tenth parts of an ephah (something over ten pints and a half) of
fine flour mingled with oil, and a log (about half a pint; see [Lev
19:35](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#035)) of oil. The priest presented
both the man and his offerings to Yahweh at the entrance of the tent of
meeting. See [Lev 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#003).

[Leviticus 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">lev 14:12</span></span>

This trespass-offering, with its blood and the oil, must be regarded as
the main feature in the ceremony: no alteration being permitted even in
the case of the poor [Lev 14:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#021).
There appears to be no other case in which an entire victim was waved
(see [Lev 7:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#030)) before Yahweh. The
Levites are spoken of as "a wave offering," [Num
8:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#011) (see the margin). The man in
this case, represented by his trespass-offering, was dedicated as a
Wave-offering in like manner.

[Leviticus 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">lev 14:13</span></span>

It is most holy - See [Lev 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#025) note.

[Leviticus 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lev 14:14</span></span>

In the same way, and with the same significance as in [Lev
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#023). It is said that a portion of the
blood was caught by the priest in the palm of his hand as it ran from
the victim.

[Leviticus 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">lev 14:16</span></span>

The sevenfold sprinkling of the oil before the sanctuary, in addition to
the waving of it, seems to have been intended to consecrate it to
represent the spiritual gift consequent upon the covenant, the sealing
of which had been figured by the sacramental blood of the offering.

[Leviticus 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">lev 14:17</span></span>

Him that is to be cleansed - Of him that has been cleansed. The
significance of the act is similar to that in [Lev
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#011), [Lev
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#015).

[Leviticus 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">lev 14:19</span></span>

The cleansed leper was now in a position to avail himself of the
accustomed law of sacrifice as one completely restored. The ewe lamb was
now offered in his behalf as a sin-offering, one of the young rams as a
burnt-offering, and the fine flour mingled with oil as a meat-offering.

[Leviticus 14:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">lev 14:33</span></span>

This section is separated from that on leprosy in clothing [Lev
13:47-59](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#047) with which it would seem to
be naturally connected, and is placed last of all the laws concerning
leprosy, probably on account of its being wholly prospective. While the
Israelites were in the wilderness, the materials of their dwellings were
of nearly the same nature as those of their clothing, and would be
liable to the same sort of decay. They were therefore included under the
same law.

I put the plague - Yahweh here speaks as the Lord of all created things,
determining their decay and destruction as well as their production.
Compare [Isa 45:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#006); [Jon
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#007); [Mat
21:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#020).

[Lev 14:37](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#037)

Hollow strakes ... - Rather, depressed spots of dark green or dark red,
appearing beneath (the surface of) the wall.

[Lev 14:49](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#049)

Cleanse the house - Strictly, "purge the house from sin." The same word
is used in [Lev 14:52](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#052); and in [Lev
14:53](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#053) it is said, "and make an
atonement for it." Such language is used figuratively when it is applied
to things, not to persons. The leprosy in houses, the leprosy in
clothing, and the terrible disease in the human body, were
representative forms of decay which taught the lesson that all created
things, in their own nature, are passing away, and are only maintained
for their destined uses during an appointed period, by the power of
Yahweh.
