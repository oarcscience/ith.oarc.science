### [Proverbs Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#001)

[Proverbs 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 14:1</span></span>

Every wise woman - literally, Wise women. The fullest recognition that
has as yet met us of the importance of woman, for good or evil, in all
human society.

[Proverbs 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 14:3</span></span>

A rod of pride - i. e., The pride shown in his speech is as a rod with
which he strikes down others and himself.

[Proverbs 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 14:4</span></span>

i\. e., Labor has its rough, unpleasant side, yet it ends in profit. So
also, the life of contemplation may seem purer, "cleaner "than that of
action. The outer business of the world brings its cares and
disturbances, but also "much increase." There will be a sure reward of
that activity in good works for him who goes, as with "the strength of
the ox," to the task to which God calls him.

[Proverbs 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 14:6</span></span>

Findeth it not - literally, there is none. The successful pursuit of
wisdom presupposes at least earnestness and reverence. The scoffer shuts
himself out from the capacity of recognizing truth.

[Proverbs 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 14:8</span></span>

The Hebrew counterpart to the Greek "Know thyself." "The highest wisdom
is for a person to understand his own way. The most extreme folly is
self-deceit." The word "deceit" may, however, involve fraud practiced
upon others. The folly of fools shows itself then in their ceaseless
effort to deceive.

[Proverbs 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 14:9</span></span>

Fools make a mock - The verb in the Heb. is singular, the noun plural.
The King James Version assumes that the number is altered to
individualize the application of the maxim. Others translate it: "Sin
mocks the fools who are its victims," i. e., disappoints and ruins them;
or, "A sin-offering does but mock the worshippers when they are
willfully wicked:" they expect to gain God's favor, and do not gain it.
So taken it becomes parallel to [Pro
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#008); [Pro
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#007).

[Proverbs 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 14:10</span></span>

A striking expression of the ultimate solitude of each man's soul at all
times, and not merely at the hour of death. Something there is in every
sorrow, and in every joy, which no one else can share. Beyond that range
it is well to remember that there is a Divine Sympathy, uniting perfect
knowledge and perfect love.

[Proverbs 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 14:12</span></span>

A way ... - The way of the fool, the way of self-indulgence and
self-will.

[Proverbs 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 14:13</span></span>

Sorrow of some kind either mingles itself with outward joy, or follows
hard upon it.

[Proverbs 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 14:14</span></span>

Shall be satisfied - These words are not in the original. Repeat the
verb from the first clause, "He who falls away from God in his heart,
shall be filled with his own ways; and the good man (shall be filled)
with that which belongs to him."

[Proverbs 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 14:15</span></span>

Simple - In the bad sense (compare [Pro
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#022)).

[Proverbs 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 14:17</span></span>

The contrast lies between two forms of evil. Hasty anger acts foolishly,
but the "man of wicked devices," vindictive and insidious, incurs all
men's hatred.

[Proverbs 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 14:18</span></span>

Crowned - The teacher anticipates the truth, and the paradox, of the
Stoic saying, "The wise is the only king."

[Proverbs 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pro 14:20</span></span>

The maxim, jarring as it is, represents the generalization of a wide
experience; but the words which follow [Pro
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#021) show that it is not to be taken
by itself. In spite of all the selfish morality of mere prudence, the
hearer is warned that to despise his "neighbor" (Christians must take
the word in all the width given to it by the parable of the Good
Samaritan) is to sin. The fullness of blessing comes on him who sees in
the poor the objects of his mercy.

[Proverbs 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 14:22</span></span>

Err - In the sense of wandering from the right way, the way of life.

[Proverbs 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 14:23</span></span>

The contrast between a single, thorough deed, and the mere emptiness of
speech.

[Proverbs 14:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 14:24</span></span>

"The crown," i. e., the glory of the wise man constitutes his wealth. He
alone is truly rich even as he alone (compare [Pro
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#018) note) is truly king.

The seeming tautology of the second clause is really its point. Turn
"the foolishness of fools" as you will, it comes back to "foolishness"
at last.

[Proverbs 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">pro 14:25</span></span>

In the second clause, "destroyeth life" might have been expected as the
antithesis to "delivereth souls." But what worse could be said? "A
deceitful witness speaketh lies." All destruction is implied in
falsehood.

[Proverbs 14:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">pro 14:26</span></span>

His children - Probably, the children whom the Lord adopts, and who are
true to their adoption.

[Proverbs 14:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 14:27</span></span>

See the marginal reference and [Pro
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#011) note.

[Proverbs 14:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">pro 14:28</span></span>

A protest against the false ideal of national greatness to which Eastern
kings, for the most part, have bowed down. Not conquest, or pomp, or
gorgeous array, but a happy and numerous people form the true glory of a
king. The word translated "prince" is of doubtful meaning; but the
translation is supported by the Septuagint, Vulg, and most commentators.

[Proverbs 14:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">pro 14:29</span></span>

Exalteth folly - Lifts it up, as it were, on high, and exposes it to the
gaze of all men.

[Proverbs 14:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">pro 14:30</span></span>

Sound heart - literally, "heart of health," that in which all emotions
and appetites are in a healthy equilibrium. The contrast with this is
the envy which eats, like a consuming disease, into the very bones and
marrow of a man's moral life.

[Proverbs 14:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">pro 14:31</span></span>

Honoureth him - i. e., God, who is the Maker of poor and rich alike.

[Proverbs 14:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">pro 14:32</span></span>

Consult marginal reference. The hope which abides even "in death" must
look beyond it.

[Proverbs 14:33](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">pro 14:33</span></span>

Omit "that which is." "Wisdom" is the subject of both clauses. She is
"made nown," i. e., by the very force of contrast, in the midst of
fools; or she is reserved and reticent in the one, noisy and boastful in
the other. The Septuagint and some other versions get over the
difficulty, by reading "Wisdom is not made known."

[Proverbs 14:34](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">pro 14:34</span></span>

Reproach - The word so rendered has this sense in the Targum of [Lev
20:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#017). Its more usual meaning is
"mercy," "piety;" hence, some have attached to the word rendered "sin"
the sense of "sin-offering," and so get the maxim "piety is an atonement
for the people."
