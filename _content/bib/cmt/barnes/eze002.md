### [Ezekiel Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#001)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 2:0</span></span>

The second and third chapters of Ezekiel contain the direct commission
conveyed to Ezekiel in connection with the vision just recorded. The
commission was repeated more than once, at what intervals of time we are
not told. The communication is from without, the vision and the words
are from God.

[Ezekiel 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 2:1</span></span>

Son of man - This phrase (which occurs elsewhere in Scripture) is
applied especially to Ezekiel and Daniel, the prophets of the captivity.
Ezekiel is thus reminded of his humanity, at the time when he is
especially permitted to have contact with God.

[Ezekiel 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 2:2</span></span>

The spirit - i. e. "the Spirit of God."

[Ezekiel 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 2:3</span></span>

Nation - literally, as in the margin - the word which usually
distinguishes the pagan from God's people. Here it expresses that Israel
is cast off by God; and the plural is used to denote that the children
of Israel are not even "one nation," but scattered and disunited.

Translate: "I send thee to the children of Israel, the rebellious nation
that have rebelled against Me (they and their fathers have transgressed
against Me, even to this very day), and the children impudent and
stiff-hearted: I do send thee unto them."

[Ezekiel 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 2:5</span></span>

A rebellious house - A phrase employed continually by Ezekiel in bitter
irony, in the place of house of Israel, as much as to say, "House no
longer of Israel, but of rebellion." Compare [Isa
30:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#009).

[Ezekiel 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 2:9</span></span>

Was sent - Rather, was put forth.

A roll of a book - The book was one of the ancient kind written on skins
rolled up together. Hence, our English volume [Psa
40:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#007). The writing was usually on one
side, but in this case it was written within and without, on both sides,
the writing as it were running over, to express the abundance of the
calamities in store for the devoted people. To eat the book signifies to
be thoroughly possessed with its contents (compare [Eze
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#010); [Jer
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#016)). There should be no break
between [Eze 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#010) and Ezek. 3.
