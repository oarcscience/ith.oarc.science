### [Lamentations Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#001)

[Lamentations](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">lam 3:0</span></span>

This elegy Lam. 3 is both the most elaborate in form and the most
sublime in its ideas of the five poems which compose the Book of
Lamentations. It presents the image of the deepest suffering, passing on
to the confession of sin, the acknowledgment of God's justice, and the
prayer of faith for forgiveness. It is the ideal representation of that
godly sorrow which worketh repentance unto salvation not to be repented
of [Co2 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#010).

[Lamentations 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lam 3:1</span></span>

That hath seen affliction - i. e. hath experienced, suffered it.

[Lamentations 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lam 3:3</span></span>

Is he turned; he turneth - Or, "surely against me" hath he turned "his
hand" again and again "all the day long."

[Lamentations 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lam 3:4</span></span>

Made old - Or, wasted: his strength slowly wasted as he pined away in
sorrow.

He hath broken my bones - This clause completes the representation of
the sufferer's physical agonies. Here the idea is that of acute pain.

[Lamentations 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">lam 3:5</span></span>

He hath builded ... - The metaphor is taken from the operations in a
siege.

Gall and travail - Or "travail;" i. e. bitterness and weariness (through
toil).

[Lamentations 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">lam 3:6</span></span>

Or, "He hath" made me to dwell "in darkness," i. e. in Sheol or Hades,
"as those" forever "dead."

[Lamentations 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">lam 3:7</span></span>

The prophet feels as if enclosed within walls, and fettered.

[Lamentations 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">lam 3:8</span></span>

Shout - i. e. call for help.

Shutteth out - Or, "shutteth in." God has so closed up the avenues to
the place in which he is immured, that his voice can find no egress.

[Lamentations 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">lam 3:9</span></span>

Inclosed - Or, hedged [Lam 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#007).

Hath, made crooked - Or, "hath" turned aside. A solid wall being built
across the main road, Jeremiah turns aside into by-ways, but finds them
turned aside, so that they lead him back after long wandering to the
place from where he started.

[Lamentations 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">lam 3:10</span></span>

Having dwelt upon the difficulties which hemmed in his path, he now
shows that there are dangers attending upon escape.

[Lam 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#011)

The meaning is, "God, as a lion, lying in wait, has made me turn aside
from my path, but my flight was in vain, for springing upon me from His
ambush lie has torn me in pieces."

Desolate - Or, astonied, stupefied that he cannot flee. The word is a
favorite one with Jeremiah.

[Lam 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#012)

This new simile arises out of the former one, the idea of a hunter being
suggested by that of the bear and lion. When the hunter comes, it is not
to save him.

[Lam 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#014)

Metaphor is dropped, and Jeremiah shows the real nature of the arrows
which rankled in him so deeply.

[Lam 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#015)

"He hath" filled me to the full with bitterness, i. e. bitter sorrows
[Job 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#018).

[Lam 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#016)

Broken my teeth with gravel stones - His bread was so filled with grit
that in eating it his teeth were broken.

[Lam 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#017)

Prosperity - literally, as in the margin, i. e. I forgot what good was,
I lost the very idea of what it meant.

[Lam 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#018)

The prophet reaches the verge of despair. But by struggling against it
he reaches at length firm ground.

[Lamentations 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">lam 3:19</span></span>

Remembering - Or, as in the margin. It is a prayer to Yahweh.

My misery - Or, "my" homelessness ([Lam
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#007) note).

[Lamentations 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">lam 3:21</span></span>

This I recall - Rather, "This will I bring back to my heart, therefore
will I hope." Knowing that God hears the prayer of the contrite, he
begins again to hope.

[Lamentations 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">lam 3:22</span></span>

Verses 22-42 are the center of the present poem, as it also holds the
central place in the whole series of the Lamentations. In them the
riches of God's grace and mercy are set forth in the brightest colors,
but no sooner are they ended than the prophet resumes the language of
woe.

That we - He is speaking as the representative of all sufferers.

[Lamentations 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">lam 3:24</span></span>

The Lord is my portion - "My portion is Yahweh," see [Num
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#020); [Psa
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#005) ff.

Therefore will I hope in him - A more full expression of the confidence
present in the prophet's mind in [Lam
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#021), but based now upon God's
faithfulness in showing mercy.

[Lamentations 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">lam 3:25</span></span>

In these three verses, each beginning in the Hebrew with the word good,
we have first the fundamental idea that Yahweh Himself is good, and if
good to all, then especially is He so to those who being in adversity
can yet wait in confidence upon His mercy.

[Lam 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#026)

And quietly wait - literally, "and be in silence," i. e. abstain from
all complaining.

[Lam 3:27](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#027)

The yoke - Or, a "yoke." By bearing a yoke in his youth, i. e. being
called upon to suffer in early age, a man learns betimes the lesson of
silent endurance, and so finds it more easy to be calm and patient in
later years.

[Lamentations 3:28](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">lam 3:28</span></span>

Translate:

Let him sit alone and keep silence;

For He (God) hath laid the yoke upon him.

Let him place his mouth in the dust;

Perchance there is hope.

Let him offer his cheek to him that smiteth him;

Let him be filled to the full with reproach.

It is good for a man to bear the yoke in his youth, but only if he bear
it rightly. To attain this result, let him learn resignation,
remembering who has laid the yoke upon him. This reverential silence is
described [Lam 3:29](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#029), as putting the
mouth in the dust, and so lying prostrate before the Deity; while [Lam
3:30](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#030) the harder task is imposed of
bearing contumely with meekness (margin reference), and not shrinking
from the last dregs of the cup of reproach. Many who submit readily to
God are indignant when the suffering comes through men.

[Lamentations 3:31](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">lam 3:31</span></span>

Reasons for the resignation urged in the previous triplet.

[Lamentations 3:34](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">lam 3:34</span></span>

Neither does God approve of wanton cruelty inflicted by one man on
another. Three examples are given: the treatment of prisoners of war;
the procuring an unjust sentence before a legal tribunal acting in the
name of God (see [Exo 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#006)); and the
perversion of justice generally.

[Lamentations 3:37](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">lam 3:37</span></span>

Why then does a loving God, who disapproves of suffering when inflicted
by man upon man, Himself send sorrow and misery? "Because of sins."

[Lam 3:37](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#037)

Literally, "Who is this that spake and it was done, though אדני 'ădonāy
commanded it not?"

[Lam 3:39](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#039)

So long as God spares a man's life, why does he complain? The
chastisement is really for his good; only let him use it aright, and he
will be thankful for it in the end.

A man for the punishment of his sins - Translate: Let "each man sigh
for," i. e. because of, "his sins." Instead of complaining because God
sends him sorrow, let him rather mourn over the sins which have made
punishment necessary. The sense of the King James Version is, Why does a
man ... complain "for his sins?" i. e. for the necessary results of them
in chastisement.

[Lamentations 3:40](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">lam 3:40</span></span>

The prophet urges men to search out their faults and amend them.

[Lam 3:40](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#040)

And turn again to the Lord - Or, "and return to Yahweh." The prep. (to)
in the Hebrew implies not half way, but the whole.

[Lam 3:41](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#041)

Literally, "Let us lift up our heart unto our hands unto God in heaven;"
as if the heart first lifted up the hands, and then with them mounted up
in prayer to God. In real prayer the outward expression is caused by the
emotion stirring within.

[Lamentations 3:43](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">lam 3:43</span></span>

In verses 43-66, far from pardoning, God is still actively punishing His
people.

Rather, "Thou hast covered" Thyself "with wrath and pursued ([Lam
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#003) note) us." The covering (here and
in [Lam 3:44](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#044)) is that of clothing and
enwrapping.

[Lamentations 3:45](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#045)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">lam 3:45</span></span>

Omit "as."

[Lamentations 3:47](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#047)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">lam 3:47</span></span>

Desolation - Or, devastation.

[Lamentations 3:48](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#048)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">lam 3:48</span></span>

The deep sympathy of the prophet, which pours itself forth in abundant
tears over the distress of his people.

[Lam 3:51](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#051)

Or, "Mine eye" causeth pain to my soul, i. e. maketh my soul ache,
because of the sad fate of the maidens ([Lam
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#004), [Lam
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#018), ...).

[Lamentations 3:52](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#052)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">lam 3:52</span></span>

Or, "They who without cause are mine enemies have hunted me sore like a
bird." Probably the prophet is speaking of his personal sorrows.

[Lamentations 3:53](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#053)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">lam 3:53</span></span>

They have cut off my life in the dungeon - Or, "They destroyed my life
in the pit," i. e. tried to destroy it by casting me into the cistern,
and covering the month with a stone. See the margin reference.

[Lamentations 3:54](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#054)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">lam 3:54</span></span>

Waters flowed over mine head - A figurative expression for great mental
trouble.

[Lamentations 3:55](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#055)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_055">lam 3:55</span></span>

A prayer for deliverance and for vengeance upon his enemies.

[Lam 3:55](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#055)

Out of the low dungeon - "The lowest pit" of [Psa
88:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#006). Some consider that Ps. 69 was
composed by Jeremiah, and is the prayer referred to here ([Jer
38:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#006) note).

[Lam 3:56](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#056)

Thou hast heard - In sending Ebedmelech to deliver me. The next clause
signifies "Hide not thine ear to my relief to my cry," i. e. to my cry
for relief.

[Lam 3:58](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#058)

God now appears as the prophet's next of kin, pleading the lawsuits of
his soul, i. e. the controversies which concern his salvation. and
rescuing his life, in jeopardy through the malice of his enemies.

[Lam 3:59](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#059)

Wrong - Done to him by the perversion of justice.

[Lam 3:60](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#060), [Lam
3:61](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#061)

Imaginations - Or, devices.

[Lam 3:63](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#063)

Their sitting down, and their rising up - i. e. all the ordinary actions
of their life.

Musick - Or, song, "the subject of it."

[Lam 3:64-66](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#064)

The versions render the verbs in these verses as futures, "Thou shalt
render unto them a recompence," etc.

[Lam 3:65](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#065)

Give them sorrow of heart - Or, "Thou wilt give them" blindness "of
heart."

[Lam 3:66](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#066)

Persecute ... - Or, pursue them in anger and destroy them, etc.
