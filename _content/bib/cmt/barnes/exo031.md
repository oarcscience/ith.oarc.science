### [Exodus Chapter 31](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#001)

[Exodus 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 31:1</span></span>

[Exo 35:30-35](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#030). This solemn call of
Bezaleel and Aholiab is full of instruction. Their work was to be only
that of handicraftsmen. Still it was Yahweh Himself who called them by
name to their tasks, and the powers which they were now called upon to
exercise in their respective crafts, were declared to have been given
them by the Holy Spirit. Thus is every effort of skill, every sort of
well-ordered labor, when directed to a right end, brought into the very
highest sphere of association.

There appears to be sufficient reason for identifying Hur, the
grandfather of Bezaleel, with the Hur who assisted Aaron in supporting
the hands of Moses during the battle with Amalek at Rephidim [Exo
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#010), and who was associated with
Aaron in the charge of the people while Moses was on the mountain [Exo
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#014). Josephus says that he was the
husband of Miriam. It is thus probable that Bezaleel was related to
Moses. He was the chief artificer in metal, stone, and wood; he had also
to perform the apothecary's work in the composition of the anointing oil
and the incense [Exo 37:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo037.htm#029). He had
precedence of all the artificers, but Aholiab appears to have had the
entire charge of the textile work [Exo
35:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#035); [Exo
38:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#023).

[Exo 31:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#003)

Wisdom, understanding, Knowledge - Or, that "right judgment in all
things" for which we especially pray on Whitsunday; the perceptive
faculty; and experience, a practical acquaintance with facts.

[Exo 31:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#004)

To devise cunning works - Rather, to devise works of skill. The Hebrew
phrase is not the same as that rendered "cunning work" in respect to
textile fabrics in [Exo 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#001).

[Exo 31:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#010)

And the cloths of service - Rather, And the garments of office; that is,
the distinguishing official garments of the high priest. The three kinds
of dress mentioned in this verse appear to be the only ones which were
unique to the sanctuary. They were:

\(1\) The richly adorned state robes of the high priest (see Exo.
28:6-38; [Exo 39:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#001) following).

\(2\) the "holy garments" of white linen for the high priest, worn on
the most solemn occasion in the year (see [Exo
28:39](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#039); [Lev
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#004)).

\(3\) the garments of white linen for all the priests, worn in their
regular ministrations (see [Exo
28:40-41](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#040)).

[Exodus 31:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">exo 31:12</span></span>

The penal law of the Sabbath. [Exo
35:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#002). In the fourth commandment the
injunction to observe the seventh day is addressed to the conscience of
the people (see [Exo 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#008) note): in
this place, the object is to declare an infraction of the commandment to
be a capital offence. The two passages stand in a relation to each other
similar to that between Lev. 18, Lev. 19, and Lev. 20. It seems likely
that the penal edict was especially introduced as a caution in reference
to the construction of the tabernacle, lest the people, in their zeal to
carry on the work, should be tempted to break the divine law for the
observance of the day.

[Exo 31:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#014)

See [Num 15:32-36](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#032). The distinction
between the meaning of the two expressions, "to be cut off from the
people", and "to be put to death", is here indicated. He who was cut off
from the people had, by his offence, put himself out of the terms of the
covenant, and was an outlaw. On such, and on such alone, when the
offence was one which affected the well-being of the nation, as it was
in this case, death could be inflicted by the public authority.

[Exo 31:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#017)

Was refreshed - Literally, "he took breath". Compare [Exo
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#012); [Sa2
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#014). The application of the word to
the Creator, which occurs nowhere else, is remarkable.

[Exodus 31:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">exo 31:18</span></span>

Two tables of testimony - See [Exo
25:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#016); [Exo
32:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#015).

The tables of stone which represented the covenant between Yahweh and
His people, and which, when covered with the mercy-seat were to give the
sanctuary its significance, are now delivered to Moses in accordance
with the promise in [Exo 24:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#012).

The history of what relates to the construction of the sanctuary is here
interrupted, and is taken up again in [Exo
35:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#001).
