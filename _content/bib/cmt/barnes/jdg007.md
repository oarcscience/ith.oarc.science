### [Judges Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#001)

[Judges 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 7:1</span></span>

The well of Harod - i. e. of trembling, evidently so called from the
people who were afraid [Jdg 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#003). It is
identified with great probability with Ain Jalud, a spacious pool at the
foot of Gilboa; (by Conder, with Ain el Jem'ain (the spring of the two
troops)).

Moreh was, probably, the little Hermon, the Jebel ed-Duhy of the Arabs,
which encloses the plain two or three miles north of Gilboa, which shuts
it in on the south.

[Judges 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jdg 7:3</span></span>

The proclamation was in accordance with the Law (see the marginal
reference). No mountain of the name of Gilead is known in this locality,
and it has been conjectured that the right reading is Gilboa. Others
think that this may be a form of proclamation customary in Manasseh.

[Judges 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jdg 7:4</span></span>

Try - The word used for refining metals by separating the dross from the
pure ore. They who threw themselves on the ground and drank freely were
the more self-indulgent; while they who, remembering the near presence
of the enemy, slaked their thirst with moderation, and without being off
their guard for an instant, were the true soldiers of the army of God.

[Judges 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jdg 7:8</span></span>

The sense is, "And they (the three hundred) took the victuals and
trumpets of the people (all the people of [Jdg
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#007)) into their hands." so that each
of the three hundred should have a trumpet and a pitcher.

[Judges 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jdg 7:11</span></span>

The armed men - The word is rendered harnessed in [Exo
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#018) (see the note). The most
probable meaning of the word is arrayed in divisions or ranks.

[Judges 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jdg 7:13</span></span>

A cake of barley bread - i. e. such a cake as could hardly be eaten by
men, it was so vile: a term expressive of the contempt of the Midianites
for the people of Israel.

A tent - The tent, meaning, probably, the tent of the king of Midian, or
of the captain of the host.

[Judges 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jdg 7:14</span></span>

This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon - The word rendered
tumbled in [Jdg 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#013), is rather
descriptive of a sword brandished (compare [Gen
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#024)). Hence, the interpretation "the
sword of Gideon." Hearing this dream and the interpretation would
convince Gideon that he was indeed under the guidance of God, and so
assure him of God's aid; and secondly, it would show him that a panic
had already fallen npon the mind of the enemy.

[Judges 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jdg 7:16</span></span>

Gideon himself took the command of one company, and sent the other two
under their respective captains to different sides of the camp [Jdg
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#018), [Jdg
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#021).

[Judges 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jdg 7:19</span></span>

The middle watch - The old Jewish division of the night was three
watches of four hours each. They are alluded to in [Exo
14:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#024); [Sa1
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#011); [Psa
63:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#006); [Psa
90:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#004); [Psa
119:148](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#148); [Psa
130:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#006); [Lam
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#019). After the Jews fell under the
power of the Romans, they used the Roman division of four watches of
three hours each [Mat 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#025); [Mar
13:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#035).

"The beginning" of the watch would be about eleven o'clock at night.

[Judges 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jdg 7:21</span></span>

The effect to the Midianites would be, that they were surrounded by a
mighty host. Their own camp being in darkness, as soon as the confusion
of flight began they would mistake friends for foes, and fleers for
pursuers. When once fighting had begun by the first casual mistake, the
clashing of swords and the shouts of the combatants in the camp,
accompanied by the continuous blowing of Gideon's trumpets outside,
would make it appear that the whole of the enemy was in the camp.
Suspicion of treachery on the part of their allies would also be likely
to arise in the minds of Midianites, Amalekites, and Arabs. Compare a
similar scene in marginal references.

[Judges 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jdg 7:22</span></span>

Beth-shittah - - "House of the acacias," the same trees which gave their
name to "Shittim" [Num 33:49](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#049) in the
plains of Maab, and which grew plentifully also, in the peninsula of
Sinai [Exo 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#005) perhaps "Shuttah", in
the valley of Jezreel; or it may be another name of Scythopolis, or
Beth-shan (compare [Kg1 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#012)).
"Zererath or Zeredath", near Succoth [Jdg
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#005), the same as "Zeredah" in Ephraim
the birth-place of Jeroboam [Kg1
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#026), and "Zartauah" [Kg1
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#012). "Abel-meholah" (field of the
dance), the birth-place of Elisha [Kg1
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#016) is in the Jordan valley, 10
miles from Scythopolis, if identified with Bethmaela: if the same as
Abelmea, it lay between Nablous and Scythopolis. (But see [Kg1
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#016) note.) "Tabbath" was apparently
lower down the Jordan valley, i. e. further south.

[Judges 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jdg 7:24</span></span>

The waters - The streams which run from the mountain district of Ephraim
into the Jordan in the district of Beth-shan, forming great pools and
marshes, which the Midianites fleeing south would have to cross before
they could reach the Jordan fords.

All the men of Ephraim - They had taken no previous part in the rising
against Midian: nor had Gideon, of the smaller tribe of Manasseh,
presumed before to summon his more powerful and arrogant brethren of the
great tribe of Ephraim (see [Jos
17:14-18](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#014)).
