### [Psalms Chapter 147](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 147:0</span></span>

The author of this psalm is unknown; nor can the occasion on which it
was composed be ascertained with any degree of certainty. In the
Septuagint, the Arabic, and the Syriac versions, it is ascribed, like
the previous psalm, to the prophets Haggai and Zechariah. The Syriac has
this title: "A Psalm of Haggai and Zechariah, when they urged the
completion of the temple of Jerusalem." It is quite manifest, from [Psa
147:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#002), [Psa
147:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#013), that the psalm was written
after the return from the Babylonian captivity, and that probably on the
completion of the temple after that return, with a view to be employed
at its dedication. See Introduction to [Psa
146:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#001).

This psalm comprises two themes: praise to God for his goodness to his
creatures generally; and special praise for his goodness to his people.
These topics are intermingled in the psalm, but the former is more
prominent in the first part of the psalm; the latter in the close. Both
were proper themes at the rebuilding of the temple and the walls of the
city, after the return from the exile. Both are proper now, and will be
so always.

[Psalms 147:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 147:1</span></span>

Praise ye the Lord - Hallelu-jah. See [Psa
146:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#001).

For it is good to sing praises unto our God - See the notes at [Psa
92:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#001) : "It is a good thing to give
thanks unto the Lord."

For it is pleasant - See the notes at [Psa
135:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#003) : "Sing praises unto his name,
for it is pleasant." The Hebrew word is the same.

And praise is comely - Becoming; proper. See the notes at [Psa
33:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#001) : "praise is comely for the
upright." The Hebrew word is the same. If these psalms were composed for
the rededication of the temple, it would not be unnatural that much of
the language employed should be borrowed from earlier psalms with which
the people were familiar.

[Psalms 147:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 147:2</span></span>

The Lord doth build up Jerusalem - He builds up the walls; he restores
the city; he has caused the temple to be reconstructed. This language
would be applicable to a return from the captivity. There may be an
allusion here to the language in [Psa
102:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#016) : "When the Lord shall build up
Zion, he shall appear in his glory." See the notes at that passage. What
is there spoken of as what would be in the future is here spoken of as
accomplished, and as a ground of praise.

He gathereth together the outcasts of Israel - Those who have been
exiled from their native land, and who have been scattered as outcasts
in a foreign country. This is appropriate language to use on the
supposition that the psalm was composed after the return from the exile,
for it is in such language that that return was predicted by the
prophets. [Isa 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#012) : "and he shall
assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of
Judah," etc. [Isa 56:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#008) : "the Lord God
which gathereth the outcasts of Israel," etc.

[Psalms 147:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 147:3</span></span>

He healeth the broken in heart - Referrring primarily to the fact that
he had healed those who were crushed and broken in their long captivity,
and that he had given them comfort by returning them to their native
land. At the same time, however, the language is made general, as
describing a characteristic of God that he does this; that it is his
character to do this. See the notes at [Psa
34:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#018). See also [Psa
51:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#017). Compare [Isa
61:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001); [Luk
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#018).

And bindeth up their wounds - See the notes at [Isa
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#006). Margin, griefs. The word refers
to those who are afflicted with griefs and troubles. The reference is to
mental sorrows; to a troubled spirit; to a heart made sad in any way.
God has provided healing for such; on such he bestows peace.

[Psalms 147:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 147:4</span></span>

He telleth the number of the stars - He counts them all. God only can do
this. The stars are so numerous that no astronomer can count them; they
lie so far in the depths of space, and are so remote from each other,
that no man can be so presumptuous as to suppose that he has even seen
any considerable part of them, even by the aid of the most powerful
telescopes.

He calleth them all by their names - As if each one had a name, and God
could call them forth one by one by their names, like the muster-roll of
an army. This language seems to be taken from [Isa
40:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#026) : "Lift up your eyes on high,
and behold who hath created these things, that bringeth out their host
by numbers; he calleth them all by names, by the greatness of his might,
for that he is strong in power; not one faileth." See the notes at that
passage.

[Psalms 147:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 147:5</span></span>

Great is our Lord - See the notes at [Psa
48:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#001).

And of great power - This seems to be added, as in [Isa
40:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#028), in view of the power required
in making the heavens, and in guiding and numbering the stars: "Hast
thou not known? Hast thou not heard, that the everlasting God, the Lord,
the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary?"

His understanding is infinite - Margin, Of his understanding there is no
number. That is, This corresponds with his power to number the stars.
There is no limit to it. It is not bounded; there is no point reached
where it can be said that there is no more; that it is exhausted. See
the notes at [Isa 40:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#028) : "There is no
searching of his understanding."

[Psalms 147:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 147:6</span></span>

The Lord lifteth up the meek - The humble; the poor; the bowed down; the
oppressed. See the notes at [Psa 146:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#008)
: "The Lord raiseth them that are bowed down."

He casteth the wicked down to the ground - See the notes at [Psa
146:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#009) : "The way of the wicked he
turneth upside down."

[Psalms 147:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 147:7</span></span>

Sing unto the Lord with thanksgiving - Accompany the praise of God - the
expression of worship - with a grateful remembrance of the past. The one
will aid the other, and the two will constitute acceptable and proper
worship. The first word here means properly to answer, or respond; and
the idea would seem to be, that we are to make a suitable response or
answer to the manifold layouts which we have received at the hand of
God.

Sing praise upon the harp unto our God - On the word harp, see the notes
at [Isa 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#012). The harp was an
instrument commonly employed in divine worship. See the notes at [Psa
33:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#002) : "Praise the Lord with harp."
Compare [Psa 43:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#004); [Psa
49:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#004); [Psa
57:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#008); [Psa
71:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#022).

[Psalms 147:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 147:8</span></span>

Who covereth the heaven with clouds - Clouds that are designed to convey
refreshing rain to the earth. The reasons for praise here stated [Psa
147:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#008) are derived from the goodness
of God as exhibited in his providential arrangements for the good of
man.

Who prepareth rain for the earth - By causing it to be taken from the
sea, carried by the clouds, and conveyed through the air to the places
where it is needed, and then gently sprinkled on the earth. Compare the
notes at [Psa 104:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#013) : "He watereth
the hills from his chambers." See also [Job
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#010), note; [Job
28:26](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#026), note; [Job
36:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#027), notes; [Job
38:28](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#028), note; [Job
38:37](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#037), note.

Who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains - Which would be barren but
for the rain. Who conveys the water thus to the very tops of the
mountains, and causes it to descend on their sides, so that even the
mountains are clothed with verdure and beauty. Compare the notes at [Psa
104:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#014) : "He causeth the grass to grow
for the cattle."

[Psalms 147:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 147:9</span></span>

He giveth to the beast his food - To the wild beast; to the animals that
cannot toil for it themselves, as man does. Compare [Psa
104:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#021), note; [Psa
104:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#027), notes.

To the young ravens which cry - Compare the notes at [Job
38:41](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#041). See also [Psa
145:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#015).

[Psalms 147:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 147:10</span></span>

He delighteth not in the strength of the horse - The horse is among the
noblest works of God - perhaps the noblest of all the animals that he
has made. See the notes at [Job
39:19-25](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#019). Yet God regards with more
interest and pleasure humble piety than he does any mere power, however
great and wonderful it may be.

He taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man - Not the same pleasure as
in piety; he prefers the humble heart to this. The reference is to man
as capable of rapid marches, of quick movements in assaulting an enemy;
the allusion being, perhaps, to an army prepared for war - cavalry and
infantry - the horse moving on with resistless force - the foot-soldiers
with rapid motion.

[Psalms 147:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 147:11</span></span>

The Lord taketh pleasure in them that fear him - In those who truly
worship him, however humble, poor, and unknown to people they may be;
however unostentatious, retired, unnoticed may be their worship. Not in
the "pride, pomp, and circumstance of war" is his pleasure; not in the
march of armies; not in the valor of the battlefield; not in scenes
where "the garments of the warrior are rolled in blood," but in the
closet, when the devout child of God prays; in the family, when the
group bend before Him in solemn devotion; in the assembly - quiet,
serious, calm - when his friends are gathered together for prayer and
praise; in the heart that truly loves, reverences, adores Him.

In those that hope in his mercy - It is a pleasure to him to have the
guilty, the feeble, the undeserving hope in Him - trust in Him - seek
Him.

[Psalms 147:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 147:12</span></span>

Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem ... - In addition to this general praise in
which all may unite, there are special reasons why Jerusalem and its
inhabitants should praise God: just as now, in addition to the general
reasons pertaining to all people why they should praise God, there are
special reasons why Christians - why his redeemed people - should do it.
What those reasons, as pertaining to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, were,
is specified in the following verses.

[Psalms 147:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 147:13</span></span>

For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates - He has made thee safe
and secure - as if he had given additional strength to the fastenings of
the gates of the city. Cities were surrounded by walls. They were
entered through gates. Those gates were fastened by bars passed across
them, to which the gates were secured. The language here might be
applicable to any period, but it is probable that there is particular
reference to Jerusalem as made strong in rebuilding it after the return
from Babylon.

He hath blessed thy children within thee - The inhabitants, by giving
them safety and peace.

[Psalms 147:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 147:14</span></span>

He maketh peace in thy borders - Margin, he maketh thy border peace. The
word border here refers to a boundary, and stands for all the domain or
territory included within the boundaries of a country. The idea is that
peace prevailed throughout the land.

And filleth thee with the finest of the wheat - Margin, as in Hebrew,
fat of wheat. Literally, "He satisfies thee with the fat of wheat."
There is no want of wheat, and that of the best kind. Compare the notes
at [Psa 132:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#015) : "I will satisfy her
poor with bread."

[Psalms 147:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 147:15</span></span>

He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth - That is, with reference to
the productions of the earth; to the changes which occur; to the
seasons; to snow, frost, ice, cold, heat, wind; and he is universally
and immediately obeyed. Nature everywhere yields a ready acquiescence to
his will.

His word runneth very swiftly - As if it hastened to obey him. There is
no delay. Compare the notes at [Psa
33:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#009) : "He spake, and it was done; he
commanded, and it stood fast." Snow, and frost, and ice, and cold, and
heat, and wind, are entirely obedient to him. There is no reluctance in
obeying him; there is no delay.

[Psalms 147:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 147:16</span></span>

He giveth snow like wool - He covers the earth with snow, so that it
seems to have a clothing of wool. Compare the notes at [Job
37:6](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#006) : "For he saith to the snow, Be
thou on the earth."

He scattereth the hoarfrost like ashes - As if ashes were strewed over
the earth; or, as easily as one strews ashes.

[Psalms 147:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 147:17</span></span>

He casteth forth his ice like morsels - The word rendered morsels means
properly a bit, a crumb, as of bread, [Gen
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#005); [Jdg
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#005). The allusion here would seem to
be to hail, which God sends upon the earth as easily as one scatters
crumbs of bread from the hand.

Who can stand before his cold? - Or, hail. The word is the same, except
in pointing, as the preceding word rendered ice. The idea is that no one
can stand before the peltings of the hail, when God sends it forth, or
scatters it upon the earth.

[Psalms 147:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 147:18</span></span>

He sendeth out his word - He commands: or, he speaks.

And melteth them - Melts the snow and the ice. Compare the notes at [Job
37:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#010) : "By the breath of God frost
is given," etc. The idea is, that they are entirely under his control.
They obey him when he speaks.

He causeth his wind to blow - The warm south wind: "his" wind, because
he directs it, and causes it to perform his will.

And the waters flow - The snow and the ice melt.

[Psalms 147:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 147:19</span></span>

He showeth his word unto Jacob - Margin, words. His commands; his
promises; his laws. The things which were before adverted to, pertain to
the world in general. All people see his works; all enjoy the benefits
of his arrangements in the seasons - in the changes which occur upon the
earth; but he has especially favored his own people by giving them his
laws - his revealed will. This distinguishes them above all other
nations of the earth, and gives them special occasion for gratitude.

His statutes and his judgments unto Israel - His laws; his written word.
The word judgments here refers to the law of God as being that which he
judges or determines to be right.

[Psalms 147:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 147:20</span></span>

He hath not dealt so with any nation - He has favored Israel more than
any other people by giving them his revealed truth. This was so. There
was no nation in the ancient world so favored as the Hebrew people in
this respect. There is no nation now so favored as the nation that has
the revealed will of God - the Bible. The possession of that book gives
a nation a vast superiority in all respects over all others. In laws,
customs, morals, intelligence, social life, purity, charity, prosperity,
that book elevates a nation at once, and scatters blessings which can be
derived from nothing else. The highest benevolence that could be shown
to any nation would be to put it in possession of the word of God in the
language of the people.

And as for his judgments, they have not known them - Other nations are
ignorant of his laws, his statutes, his revealed will. They are
consequently subjected to all the evils which arise from ignorance of
those laws. The fact that the ancient people of God possessed them was a
sufficient reason for the Hallelujah with which the psalm closes. The
fact that we possess them is a sufficient reason why we should re-echo
the shout of praise, and cry Hallelujah.
