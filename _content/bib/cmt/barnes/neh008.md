### [Nehemiah Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#001)

[Nehemiah 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">neh 8:1</span></span>

The street - Rather, "the square" or "court." So in [Neh
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#016) (compare [Ezr
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#009)). The court seems to have been
one between the eastern gate of the temple and the watergate in the
city-wall. It would thus lie within the modern Haram area.

Ezra the scribe - This is the first mention of Ezra in the present book,
and the first proof we have had that he was contemporary with Nehemiah.
Probably he returned to the court of Artaxerxes soon after effecting the
reforms which he relates in Ezra 10, and did not revisit Jerusalem until
about the time when the walls were completed, or after an absence of
more than ten years. It was natural for the people to request him to
resume the work of exposition of the Law to which he had accustomed them
on his former visit [Ezr 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#010), [Ezr
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#025).

[Nehemiah 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">neh 8:2</span></span>

Upon the first day of the seventh month - The day of the "Feast of
Trumpets" (see the margin reference note). The gathering together of the
people, spoken of in [Neh 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#001), was
probably to observe this feast.

[Nehemiah 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">neh 8:4</span></span>

The 13 persons mentioned were probably the chief priests of the course
(shift) which was at the time performing the temple service.

[Nehemiah 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">neh 8:5</span></span>

Stood up - The attitude of attention and respect. Compare the existing
practice of the Christian Church at the reading of the Gospel for the
day.

[Nehemiah 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">neh 8:7</span></span>

The names here (and in [Neh 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#004), [Neh
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#005); [Neh
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#009)) seem not to be the personal
appellations of individuals, but rather designations of Levitical
families, the descendants respectively of Jeshua, etc., who lived not
later than the time of Zerubbabel [Neh
7:43](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#043); [Neh
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#008).

[Nehemiah 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">neh 8:8</span></span>

Gave the sense - Either by rendering the Hebrew into the Aramaic
dialect, or perhaps simply by explaining obscure words or passages.

Caused them to understand - Either "they (the people) understood what
was read;" or, "they (the Levites) expounded as they read."

[Nehemiah 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">neh 8:9</span></span>

Nehemiah, which is the Tirshatha - Hereto, Nehemiah has called himself
פחה pechâh [Neh 5:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#014), [Neh
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#018), which is the ordinary word for
"governor." Now for the first time he is called 'the Tirshatha'" (see
[Ezr 2:63](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#063) note.)

The people wept ... - Because the Law brought vividly before them their
sins of omission and commission. In [Neh
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#010) the Jews were not forbidden to be
sorry for their sins, but they were only prohibited from marring a
festive occasion with the expression of their sorrow.

[Nehemiah 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">neh 8:10</span></span>

The "sending of portions" to the poor is not distinctly mentioned in any
but the later historical Scriptures (compare the margin reference). The
practice naturally grew out of this injunction of the Law [Deu
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#011), [Deu
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#014).

[Nehemiah 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">neh 8:13</span></span>

To understand - Rather, "to consider."

[Nehemiah 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">neh 8:14</span></span>

The Feast of tabernacles had fallen into abeyance either entirely, or as
regarded the dwelling in booths [Neh
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#017), since the time when it was kept
by Zerubbabel [Ezr 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#004). It is evident
that the observance of the Law, impossible during the captivity, was
restored slowly and with difficulty after the return.

[Nehemiah 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">neh 8:15</span></span>

The mount - The "mount of Olives" is probably intended.

Pine branches - Rather, "branches of the wild olive." The actual trees
named by the Law may have become scarce. It was probably considered that
the spirit of the command was kept if branches of trees similar in
general character to those named in Leviticus were employed.

[Nehemiah 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">neh 8:17</span></span>

It is not the intention of the writer to state that the Feast of
tabernacles had not been kept from the time of Joshua until this
occasion (see [Kg1 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#002), [Kg1
8:65](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#065); [Ezr
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#004)); but that there had been no such
celebration as this since Joshua's time. Compare [Kg2
23:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#022); [Ch2
35:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#018).
