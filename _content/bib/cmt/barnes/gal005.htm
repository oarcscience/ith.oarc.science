<p>This chapter is properly a continuation of the argument in the previous chapter, and is designed to induce the Galatians to renounce their conformity to the Jewish law, and to become entirely conformed to the gospel. In particular, it seems to be designed to meet a charge that had been brought against him, that he had preached the necessity of circumcision, or that he had so practiced it as to show that he believed that it was obligatory on others. Under his example, or pleading his authority, it seems the false teachers there had urged the necessity of its observance; see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#011">Gal 5:11</A>. The argument and the exhortation consist of the following parts:
<p>I. He exhorts them to stand firm in the liberty of Christianity, and not to be brought again under bondage; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#001">Gal 5:1</A>.
<p>II. He solemnly assures them, that if they depended on circumcision for salvation, they could derive no benefit from Christ. They put themselves into a perfect legal state, and must depend on that alone; and that was equivalent to renouncing Christ altogether, or to falling from grace; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#002">Gal 5:2-6</A>.
<p>III. He assures them that their present belief could not have come from him by whom they were originally brought to the knowledge of the truth; but must have been from some foreign influence, operating like leaven; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#007">Gal 5:7-9</A>.
<p>IV. He says he had confidence in them, on the whole, that they would obey the truth, and that they would suffer him who had troubled them to bear his proper judgment, gently insinuating that he should be disowned or cut off; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#010">Gal 5:10</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#012">Gal 5:12</A>.
<p>V. He vindicates himself from the charge that he preached the necessity of circumcision. His vindication was, that if he had done that, he would have escaped persecution, for then the offence of the cross would have ceased; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#011">Gal 5:11</A>.
<p>VI. He assures them that they had been called unto liberty; that the gospel had made them free. Yet Paul felt how easy it was to abuse this doctrine, and to pretend that Christ had freed them from all restraint, and from the bondage of all law. Against this he cautions them. Their liberty was not licentiousness. It was not freedom from all the restraints of the Law. It was not that they might give indulgence to the passions of the flesh. It was designed that they should serve one another; and not fall into the indulgence of raging passions, producing strive and mutual hatred; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#003">Gal 5:3-15</A>.
<p>VII. To illustrate this, and to show them the evils of giving indulgence to their appetites under the pretence that they were free, he proceeds to show what were the passions to which carnal indulgence would give rise, or what were the works of the flesh; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#016">Gal 5:16-21</A>.
<p>VIII. On the other hand, the Spirit produces a train of most lovely virtues, feelings, and affections, against which there could be no law; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#022">Gal 5:22-23</A>.
<p>IX. They who were Christians had in fact crucified the flesh. They were bound to live after the teachings of the Spirit, and Paul, therefore, exhorts them to lay aside all vain-glory and envy, and to live in peace; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#024">Gal 5:24-26</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#001">Galatians 5:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">gal 5:1</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Stand fast, therefore - Be firm and unwavering. This verse properly belongs to the previous chapter, and should not have been separated from it. The sense is, that they were to be firm and unyielding in maintaining the great principles of Christian liberty. They had been freed from the bondage of rites and ceremonies; and they should by no means, and in no form, yield to them again.
<p>In the liberty ... - Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#032">Joh 8:32</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#036">Joh 8:36</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#018">Rom 6:18</A>; Notes, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#003">Gal 4:3-5</A>.
<p>And be not entangled again - Tyndale renders this, "And wrap not yourselves again." The sense is, do not again allow such a yoke to be put on you; do not again become slaves to any rites, and customs, and habits.
<p>The yoke of bondage - Of servitude to the Jewish laws; see the note at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#010">Act 15:10</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#002">Galatians 5:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">gal 5:2</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Behold, I Paul say unto you - I, who at first preached the gospel to you; I, too, who have been circumcised, and who was formerly a strenuous assertor of the necessity of observing the laws of Moses; and I, too, who am charged (see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#011">Gal 5:11</A>) with still preaching the necessity of circumcision, now solemnly say to you, that if you are circumcised with a view to being justified by that in whole or in part, it amounts to a rejection of the doctrine of justification by Christ, and an entire apostacy from him. He is to be "a whole Saviour." No one is to share with him in the honor of saving people; and no rite, no custom, no observance of law, is to divide the honor with his death. The design of Paul is to give them the most solemn assurance on this point; and by his own authority and experience to guard them from the danger, and to put the matter to rest.
<p>That if ye be circumcised - This must be understood with reference to the subject under consideration. If you are circumcised with such a view as is maintained by the false teachers that have come among you; that is, with an idea that it is necessary in order to your justification. He evidently did not mean that if any of them had been circumcised before their conversion to Christianity; nor could he mean to say, that circumcision in all cases amounted to a rejection of Christianity, for he had himself procured the circumcision of Timothy, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#003">Act 16:3</A>. If it was done, as it was then, for prudential considerations, and with a wish not necessarily to irritate the Jews, and to give one a more ready access to them, it was not to be regarded as wrong. But if, as the false teachers in Galatia claimed, as a thing essential to salvation, as indispensable to justification and acceptance with God, then the matter assumed a different aspect; and then it became in fact a renouncing of Christ as himself sufficient to save us. So with anything else. Rites and ceremonies in religion may be in themselves well enough, if they are held to be matters not essential; but the moment they are regarded as vital and essential, that moment they begin to infringe on the doctrine of justification by faith alone, and that moment they are to be rejected; and it is because of the danger that this will be the case, that they are to be used sparingly in the Christian church. Who does not know the danger of depending upon prayers, and alms, and the sacraments, and extreme unction, and penance, and empty forms for salvation? And who does not know how much in the papal communion the great doctrine of justification has been obscured by numberless such rites and forms?
<p>Christ shall profit you nothing - Will be of no advantage to you. Your dependence on circumcision, in these circumstances, will in fact amount to a rejection of the Saviour, and of the doctrine of justification by him. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#003">Galatians 5:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">gal 5:3</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>For I testify again - Probably he had stated this when he had preached the gospel to them first, and he now solemnly bears witness to the same thing again. Bloomfield, however, supposes that the word "again" here (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;  palin) means, on the other hand, or, "furthermore," or, as we would say, "and again."
<p>That he is a debtor to do the whole law - He binds himself to obey all the Law of Moses. Circumcision was the distinguishing badge of the Jews, as baptism is of Christians. A man, therefore, who became circumcised became a professor of the Jewish religion, and bound himself to obey all its special laws. This must be understood, of course, with reference to the point under discussion; and means, if he did it with a view to justification, or as a thing that was necessary and binding. It would not apply to such a case as that of Timothy, where it was a matter of mere expediency or prudence; see the note at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#002">Gal 5:2</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#004">Galatians 5:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">gal 5:4</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Christ is become of no effect unto you - You will derive no advantage from Christ. His work in regard to you is needless and vain. If you can be justified in any other way than by him, then of course you do not need him, and your adoption of the other mode is in fact a renunciation of him. Tyndale renders this: "Ye are gone quite from Christ." The word here used (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9;  katargeo&#772;), means properly, to render inactive, idle, useless; to do away, to put an end to; and here it means that they had withdrawn from Christ, if they attempted to be justified by the Law. They would not need him if they could be thus justified; and they could derive no benefit from him. A man who can be justified by his own obedience, does not need the aid or the merit of another; and if it was true, as they seemed to suppose, that they could be justified by the Law, it followed that the work of Christ was in vain so far as they were concerned.
<p>Whosoever of you are justified by the law - On the supposition that any of you are justified by the Law; or if, as you seem to suppose, any are justified by the Law. The apostle does not say that this had in fact ever occurred; but he merely makes a supposition. If such a thing should or could occur, it would follow that you had fallen from grace.
<p>Ye are fallen from grace - That is, this would amount to apostasy from the religion of the Redeemer, and would be in fact a rejection of the grace of the gospel. That this had ever in fact occurred among true Christians the apostle does not affirm unless he affirmed that people can in fact be justified by the Law, since he makes the falling from grace a consequence of that. But did Paul mean to teach that? Did he mean to affirm that any man in fact had been, or could be justified by his own obedience to the Law? Let his own writings answer; see, especially, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#020">Rom 3:20</A>. But unless he held that, then this passage does not prove that anyone who has ever been a true Christian has fallen away. The fair interpretation of the passage does not demand that. Its simple and obvious meaning is, that if a man who has been a professed Christian should be justified by his own conformity to the Law, and adopt that mode of justification, then that would amount to a rejection of the mode of salvation by Christ, and would be a renouncing of the plan of justification by grace. The two systems cannot be united. The adoption of the one is, in fact, a rejection of the other. Christ will be "a whole Saviour," or none. This passage, therefore. cannot be adduced to prove that any true Christian has in fact fallen away from grace, unless it proves also that man may be justified by the deeds of the Law, contrary to the repeated declarations of Paul himself. The word "grace" here, does not mean grace in the sense of personal religion, it means the "system" of salvation by grace, in contradistinction from that by merit or by works - the system of the gospel. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#005">Galatians 5:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">gal 5:5</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>For we - We who are Christians. It is a characteristic of the true Christian.
<p>Through the Spirit - The Holy Spirit. We expect salvation only by his aid.
<p>Wait for - That is, we expect salvation in this way. The main idea is, not that of waiting as if the thing were delayed; it is that of expecting. The sense is, that true Christians have no other hope of salvation than by faith in the Lord Jesus. It is not by their own works, nor is it by any conformity to the Law. The object of Paul is, to show them the true nature of the Christian hope of eternal life, and to recall them from dependence on their conformity to the Law.
<p>The hope of righteousness - The hope of justification. They had no other hope of justification than by faith in the Redeemer; see the note at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#017">Rom 1:17</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#006">Galatians 5:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">gal 5:6</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>For in Jesus Christ - In the religion which Christ came to establish.
<p>Neither circumcision ... - It makes no difference whether a man is circumcised or not. He is not saved because he is circumcised, nor is he condemned because he is not. The design of Christianity is to abolish these rites and ceremonies, and to introduce a way of salvation that shall be applicable to all mankind alike; see the <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#028">Gal 3:28</A>, note; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#019">Co1 7:19</A>, note; compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#029">Rom 2:29</A>.
<p>But faith which worketh by love - Faith that evinces its existence by love to God, and benevolence to people. It is not a mere intellectual belief, but it is that which reaches the heart, and controls the affections. It is not a dead faith, but it is that which is operative, and which is seen in Christian kindness and affection. It is not mere belief of the truth, or mere orthodoxy, but it is that which produces trite attachment to others. A mere intellectual assent to the truth may leave the heart cold and unaffected; mere orthodoxy, however bold and self-confident, and "sound," may not be inconsistent with contentions, and strifes, and logomachies, and divisions. The true faith is that which is seen in benevolence, in love to God, in love to all who bear the Christian name; in a readiness to do good to all mankind. This shows that the heart is affected by the faith that is held; and this is the nature and design of all genuine religion. Tyndale renders this, "faith, which by love is mighty in operation." 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#007">Galatians 5:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">gal 5:7</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Ye did run well - The Christian life is often represented as a race; see the notes at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#024">Co1 9:24-26</A>. Paul means here, that they began the Christian life with ardour and zeal; compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#015">Gal 4:15</A>.
<p>Who did hinder you - Margin, "Drive you back." The word used here (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;  anakopto&#772;) means properly to beat or drive back. Hence, it means to hinder, check, or retard. Dr. Doddridge remarks that this is "an Olympic expression, and properly signifies "coming across the course" while a person is running in it, in such a manner as to jostle, and throw him out of the way." Paul asks, with emphasis, who it could have been that retarded them in their Christian course, implying that it could have been done only by their own consent, or that there was really no cause why they should not have continued as they began.
<p>That ye should not obey the truth - The true system of justification by faith in the Redeemer. That you should have turned aside, and embraced the dangerous errors in regard to the necessity of obeying the laws of Moses. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#008">Galatians 5:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">gal 5:8</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>This persuasion - This belief that it is necessary to obey the laws of Moses, and to intermingle the observance of Jewish rites with the belief of the Christian doctrines in order to be saved.
<p>Not of him that calleth you - That is, of God, who had called them into his kingdom. That it refers to God and not to Paul is plain. They knew well enough that Paul had not persuaded them to it, and it was important now to show them that it could not be traced to God, though they who taught it pretended to be commissioned by him. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#009">Galatians 5:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">gal 5:9</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>A little leaven ... - This is evidently a proverbial expression; see it explained in the notes at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#006">Co1 5:6</A>. Its meaning here is, that the embracing of the errors which they had adopted was to be traced to some influence existing among themselves, and acting like leaven. It may either mean that there was existing among them from the first a slight tendency to conform to rites and customs, and that this had now like leaven pervaded the mass; or it may mean that the false teachers there might be compared to leaven, whose doctrines, though they were few in number, had pervaded the mass of Christians; or it may mean, as many have supposed, that any conformity to the Jewish law was like leaven. If they practiced circumcision, it would not stop there. The tendency to conform to Jewish rites would spread from that until it would infect all the doctrines of religion, and they would fall into the observance of all the rites of the Jewish law. It seems to me that the second interpretation referred to above is the correct one; and that the apostle means to say, that the influence which had brought this change about was at first small and unimportant; that there might have been but a few teachers of that kind, and it might have not been deemed worthy of particular attention or alarm; but that the doctrines thus infused into the churches, had spread like leaven, until the whole mass had become affected. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#010">Galatians 5:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">gal 5:10</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>I have confidence in you ... - Though they had been led astray, and had embraced many false opinions, yet, on the whole, Paul had confidence in their piety, and believed they would yet return and embrace the truth.
<p>That ye will be none otherwise minded - That is, than you have been taught by me; or than I think and teach on the subject. Paul doubtless means to say, that he had full confidence that they would embrace the views which he was inculcating on the subject of justification, and he makes this remark in order to modify the severity of his tone of reprehension, and to show that, notwithstanding all he had said, he had confidence still in their piety. He believed that they would coincide with him in his opinion, alike on the general subject of justification, and in regard to the cause of their alienation from the truth. He, therefore, gently insinuates that it was not to be traced to themselves that they had departed from the truth, but to the "little leaven" that had leavened the mass; and he adds, that whoever had done this, should be held to be responsible for it.
<p>But he that troubleth you - By leading you into error.
<p>Shall bear his judgment - Shall be responsible for it, and will receive proper treatment from you. He gently states this general principle, which is so obvious; states that he does not believe that the defection is to be traced to themselves; and designs to prepare their minds for a proposition which he intends to submit <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#012">Gal 5:12</A>, that the offending person or persons should be disowned and cut off.
<p>Whosoever he be - "I do not know who he is. I mention no names; accuse no one by name; and advise no severe measures against any particular individual. I state only the obvious principle that every man should bear his own burden, and be held responsible for what he has done - no matter who he is." 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#011">Galatians 5:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">gal 5:11</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>And I, brethren - Paul here proceeds to vindicate himself from giving countenance to the doctrines which they had advanced there. It is evident that the false teachers in Galatia appealed to Paul himself, and alleged that he insisted on the necessity of circumcision, and that they were teaching no more than he taught. On what they founded this is unknown. It may have been mere slander; or it may have arisen from the fact that he had circumcised Timothy <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#003">Act 16:3</A>, and, possibly, that he may have encouraged circumcision in some other similar cases. Or it may have been inferred from the fact (which was undoubtedly true) that Paul in general complied with the customs of the Jews when he was with them. But his conduct and example had been greatly perverted. He had never enjoined circumcision as necessary to salvation; and had never complied with Jewish customs where there was danger that it would be understood that he regarded them as at all indispensable, or as furnishing a ground of acceptance with God.
<p>If I yet preach circumcision - If I preach it as necessary to salvation; or if I enjoin it on those who are converted to Christianity.
<p>Why do I yet suffer persecution? - That is, from the Jews. "Why do they oppose me? Circumcision is the special badge of the Jewish religion; it implies all the rest (see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#002">Gal 5:2</A>); and if I preach the necessity of that, it would satisfy the Jews, and save me from persecution. They would never persecute one who did that as they do me; and the fact that I am thus persecuted by them is full demonstration that I am not regarded as preaching the necessity of circumcision." It is remarkable that Paul does not expressly deny the charge. The reason may be, that his own word would be called in question, or that it might require much explanation to show why he had recommended circumcision in any case, as in the case of Timothy; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#003">Act 16:3</A>. But the fact that he was persecuted by the Jews settled the question, and showed that he did not preach the necessity of circumcision in any such sense as to satisfy them, or in any such sense as was claimed by the false teachers in Galatia. In regard to the fact that Paul was persecuted by the Jews; see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#001">Act 14:1-2</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#019">Act 14:19</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#004">Act 17:4-5</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#013">Act 17:13</A>; compare Paley, Hora Paulina, Galat. no. v.
<p>Then is the offence of the cross ceased - "For if I should preach the necessity of circumcision, as is alleged, the offence of the cross of Christ would be removed. The necessity of depending on the merits of the sacrifice made on the cross would be taken away, since then people could be saved by conformity to the laws of Moses. The very thing that I have so much insisted on, and that has been such a stumbling-block to the Jews (see the note at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#023">Co1 1:23</A>), that conformity to their rites was of no avail, and that they must be saved only by the merits of a crucified Saviour, would be done away with." Paul means that if this had been done, he would have saved himself from giving offence, and from the evils of persecution. He would have preached that people could be saved by conformity to Jewish rites, and that would have saved him from all the persecutions which he had endured in consequence of preaching the necessity of salvation by the cross. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#012">Galatians 5:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">gal 5:12</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>I would they were even cut off - That is, as I understand it, from the communion of the church. So far am I, says Paul, from agreeing with them, and preaching the necessity of circumcision as they do, that I sincerely wish they were excluded from the church as unworthy a place among the children of God. For a very singular and monstrous interpretation of this passage, though adopted by Chrysostom, Theodoret, Theophylact, Jerome, Grotius, Rosenmuller, Koppe, and others, the learned reader may consult Koppe on this verse. To my amazement, I find that this interpretation has also been adopted by Robinson in his Lexicon, on the word &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;  apokopto&#772;. I will state the opinion in the words of Koppe. "Non modo circumcidant se, sed, si velint, etiam mutilant se - ipsa genitalia resecent." The simple meaning is, I think, that Paul wished that the authors of these errors and disturbances were excluded from the church.
<p>Which trouble you - Who pervert the true doctrines of salvation, and who thus introduce error into the church. Error always sooner or later causes trouble; compare the note at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#007">Co1 5:7</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#013">Galatians 5:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">gal 5:13</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty - Freedom from Jewish rites and ceremonies; see the notes at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#028">Gal 3:28</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#009">Gal 4:9</A>, note, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#021">Gal 4:21-31</A>, note. The meaning here is, that Paul wished the false teachers removed because true Christians had been called unto liberty, and they were abridging and destroying that liberty. They were not in subjection to the Law of Moses, or to anything else that savored of bondage. They were free; free from the servitude of sin, and free from subjection to expensive and burdensome rites and customs. They were to remember this as a great and settled principle; and so vital a truth was this, and so important that it should be maintained, and so great the evil of forgetting it, that Paul says he earnestly wishes <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#012">Gal 5:12</A> that all who would reduce them to that state of servitude were cut off from the Christian church.
<p>Only use not liberty ... - The word use here introduced by our translators, obscures the sense. The idea is, "You are called to liberty, but it is not liberty for an occasion to the flesh. It is not freedom from virtuous restraints, and from the laws of God. It is liberty from the servitude of sin, and religious rites and ceremonies, not freedom from the necessary restraints of virtue." It was necessary to give this caution, because:
<p>(1) There was a strong tendency in all converts from paganism to relapse again into their former habits. Licentiousness abounded, and where they had been addicted to it before their conversion, and where they were surrounded by it on every hand, they were in constant danger of falling into it again. A bare and naked declaration, therefore, that they had been called to liberty, to freedom from restraint, might have been misunderstood, and some might have supposed that they were free from all restraints.
<p>(2) it is needful to guard the doctrine from abuse at all times. There has been a strong tendency, as the history of the church has shown, to abuse the doctrine of grace. The doctrine that Christians are "free;" that there is liberty to them from restraint, has been perverted always by Antinomians, and been made the occasion of their indulging freely in sin. And the result has shown that nothing was more important than to guard the doctrine of Christian liberty, and to show exactly what Christians are freed from, and what laws are still binding on them. Paul is, therefore, at great pains to show that the doctrines which he had maintained did not lead to licentiousness, and did not allow the indulgence of sinful and corrupt passions.
<p>An occasion - As allowing indulgence to the flesh, or as a furtherance or help to corrupt passions; see the word explained in the notes at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#008">Rom 7:8</A>.
<p>To the flesh - The word flesh is often used in the writings of Paul to denote corrupt and gross passions and affections; see the notes at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#018">Rom 7:18</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#001">Rom 8:1</A>, note.
<p>But by love serve one another - By the proper manifestation of love one to another strive to promote each other's welfare. To do this will not be inconsistent with the freedom of the gospel. When there is love there is no servitude. Duty is pleasant, and offices of kindness agreeable. Paul does not consider them as freed from all law and all restraint; but they are to be governed by the law of love. They were not to feel that they were so free that they might lawfully give indulgence to the desires of the flesh, but they were to regard themselves as under the law to love one another; and thus they would fulfil the law of Christian freedom.

<p>For all the law is fulfilled ... - That is, this expresses the substance of the whole law; it embraces and comprises all. The apostle of course here alludes to the Law in regard to our duty to our fellow-men, since that was the point which he particularly enforces. He is saying that this law would counteract all the evil workings of the flesh, and if this were fulfilled, all our duty to others would be discharged. A similar sentiment he has expressed in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#008">Rom 13:8-10</A>; see the notes at that passage. The turn here in the discussion is worthy of particular notice. With great skill he changes the subject from a doctrinal argument to a strain of practical remark, and furnishes most important lessons for the right mode of overcoming our corrupt and sensual passions, and discharging our duty to others.
<p>Thou shalt love thy neighbor ... - See this explained in the note at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#019">Mat 19:19</A>.

<p>But if ye bite - The word used here (&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;  dakno&#772;), means, properly, to bite, to sting; and here seems to be used in the sense of contending and striving - a metaphor not improbably taken from dogs and wild beasts.
<p>And devour one another - As wild beasts do. The sense is, "if you contend with each other;" and the reference is, probably, to the strifes which would arise between the two parties in the churches - the Jewish and the Gentile converts.
<p>Take heed that ye be not consumed ... - As wild beasts contend sometimes until both are slain. Thus, the idea is, in their contentions they would destroy the spirituality and happiness of each other; their characters would be ruined; and the church be overthrown. The readiest way to destroy the spirituality of a church, and to annihilate the influence of religion, is to excite a spirit of contention.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">gal 5:16</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>This I say then - This is the true rule about overcoming the propensities of your carnal natures, and of avoiding the evils of strife and contention.
<p>Walk - The Christian life is often represented as a journey, and the word walk, in the scripture, is often equivalent to live; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#005">Mar 7:5</A>. See the notes at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#012">Rom 4:12</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#004">Rom 6:4</A>, note; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#001">Rom 8:1</A>, note.
<p>In the Spirit - Live under the influences of the Holy Spirit; admit those influences fully into your hearts. Do not resist him, but yield to all his suggestions; see the note at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#001">Rom 8:1</A>. What the Holy Spirit would produce, Paul states in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#022">Gal 5:22-23</A>. If a man would yield his heart to those influences, he would be able to overcome all his carnal propensities; and it is because he resists that Spirit, that he is ever overcome by the corrupt passions of his nature. Never was a better, a safer, or a more easy rule given to overcome our corrupt and sensual desires than that here furnished; compare notes, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#001">Rom 8:1-13</A>.
<p>And ye shall not fulfil ... - Margin, "Fulfil not" - as if it were a command. So Tyndale renders it. But the more common interpretation, as it is the more significant, is that adopted by our translators. Thus, it is not merely a command, it is the statement of an important and deeply interesting truth - that the only way to overcome the corrupt desires and propensities of our nature, is by submitting to the influences of the Holy Spirit. It is not by philosophy; it is not by mere resolutions to resist them; it is not by the force of education and laws; it is only by admitting into our souls the influence of religion, and yielding ourselves to the guidance of the Holy Spirit of God. If we live under the influences of that Spirit, we need not fear the power of the sensual and corrupt propensities of our nature. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#017">Galatians 5:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">gal 5:17</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit - The inclinations and desires of the flesh are contrary to those of the Spirit. They draw us away in an opposite direction, and while the Spirit of God would lead us one way, our carnal nature would lead us another, and thus produce the painful controversy which exists in our minds. The word "Spirit" here refers to the Spirit of God, and to his influences on the heart.
<p>And these are contrary ... - They are opposite in their nature. They never can harmonize; see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#006">Rom 8:6-7</A>; compare below <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#019">Gal 5:19-23</A>. The contrariety Paul has illustrated by showing what each produces; and they are as opposite as adultery, wrath, strife, murders, drunkenness, etc., are to love, joy, goodness, gentleness, and temperance.
<p>So that ye cannot do the things that ye would - See this sentiment illustrated in the notes at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#015">Rom 7:15-19</A>. The expression "cannot do" is stronger by far than the original, and it is doubted whether the original will bear this interpretation. The literal translation would be, "Lest what ye will, those things ye should do" (&#x3b9;&#788;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3c9;&#788;&#769; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;, &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;  hina me&#772; ho&#772; an thele&#772;te, tauta poie&#772;te). It is rendered by Doddridge, "So that ye do not the things that ye would." By Locke, "You do not the things that you propose to yourselves;" and Locke remarks on the passage, "Ours is the only translation that I knew which renders it cannot." The Vulgate and the Syriac give a literal translation of the Greek, "So that you do not what you would." This is undoubtedly the true rendering; and, in the original, there is no declaration about the possibility or the impossibility, the ability or the inability to do these things.
<p>It is simply a statement of a fact, as it is in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#015">Rom 7:15</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#019">Rom 7:19</A>. That statement is, that in the mind of a renewed man there is a contrariety in the two influences which bear on his soul - the Spirit of God inclining him in one direction, and the lusts of the flesh in another; that one of these influences is so great as in fact to restrain and control the mind, and prevent its doing what it would otherwise do; that when there is an inclination in one direction, there is a controlling and overpowering influence in another, producing a conflict, which prevents it, and which finally checks and restrains the mind. There is no reason for interpreting this, moreover, as seems always to be the case, of the overpowering tendency in the mind to evil, as if it taught that the Christian was desirous of doing good, but could not, on account of his indwelling corruption. So far as the language of Paul or the fact is concerned, it may be understood of just the opposite, and may mean, that such are the restraints and influences of the Holy Spirit on the heart, that the Christian does not the evil which he otherwise would, and to which his corrupt nature inclines him.
<p>He (Paul) is exhorting them <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#016">Gal 5:16</A> to walk in the Spirit, and assures them that thus they would not fulfil the lusts of the flesh. To encourage them to this, he reminds them that there were contrary principles in their minds, the influences of the Spirit of God, and a carnal and downward tendency of the flesh. These are contrary one to the other; and such are, in fact, the influences of the Spirit on the mind, that the Christian does not do the things which he otherwise would. So understood, or understood in any fair interpretation of the original, it makes no assertion about the ability or inability of man to do right or wrong. It affirms as a fact, that where these opposite principles exist, a man does not do the things which otherwise he would do. If a man could not do otherwise than he actually does, he would not be to blame. Whether a Christian could not resist the influences of the Holy Spirit, and yield to the corrupt desires of the flesh; or whether he could not overcome these evil propensities and do right always, are points on which the apostle here makes no affirmation. His is the statement of a mere fact, that where these counteracting propensities exist in the mind, there is a conflict, and that the man does not do what he otherwise would do.

<p>But if ye be led of the Spirit - If you submit to the teachings and guidance of the Holy Spirit.
<p>Ye are not under the law - You are under a different dispensation - the dispensation of the Spirit. You are free from the restraints and control of the Mosaic law, and are under the control of the Spirit of God.

<p>Now the works of the flesh - What the flesh, or what corrupt and unrenewed human nature produces.
<p>Are manifest - Plain, well-known. The world is full of illustrations of what corrupt human nature produces, and as to the existence and nature of those works, no one can be ignorant. It is evident here that the word &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c1;&#x3be;  sarx, "flesh," is used to denote corrupt human nature, and not merely the body; since many of the vices here enumerated are the passions of the mind or the soul, rather than of the body. Such are "wrath," "strife," "heresies," "envyings," etc., which cannot be said to have their seat in the body. If the word, therefore, is used to denote human nature, the passage furnishes a sad commentary on its tendency, and on the character of man. It is closely parallel to the declaration of the Saviour in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#019">Mat 15:19</A>. Of the nature of most of these sins, or works of the flesh, it is unnecessary to offer any comment. They are not so rare as not to be well known, and the meaning of the words requires little exposition. In regard to the existence of these vices as the result of human nature, the notes at Rom. 1 may be examined; or a single glance at the history of the past, or at the present condition of the pagan and a large part of the Christian world, would furnish an ample and a painful demonstration. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#020">Galatians 5:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">gal 5:20</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Witchcraft - Pretending to witchcraft. The apostle does not vouch for the actual existence of witchcraft; but he says that what was known as such was a proof of the corrupt nature of man, and was one of the fruits of it. No one can doubt it. It was a system of imposture and falsehood throughout; and nothing is a better demonstration of the depravity of the human heart than an extended and systematized attempt to impose on mankind. The word which is used here (&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;  pharmakeia, whence our word "pharmacy," from &#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  pharmakon, a medicine, poison, magic potion) means, properly, the preparing and giving of medicine. Then it means also poisoning, and also magic art, or enchantment; because in savage nations pharmacy or medicine consisted much in magical incantations. Thence it means sorcery or enchantment, and it is so used uniformly in the New Testament. It is used only in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#020">Gal 5:20</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#021">Rev 9:21</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#023">Rev 18:23</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#008">Rev 21:8</A>. Some have supposed that it means poisoning here, a crime often practiced; but the more correct interpretation is, to refer it to the black art, or to pretensions to witchcraft, and the numerous delusions which have grown out of it, as a striking illustration of the corrupt and depraved nature of man.
<p>Hatred - Greek: "hatreds," in the plural. Antipathies, and lack of love, producing contentions and strifes.
<p>Variance - Contentions; see the note at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#029">Rom 1:29</A>.
<p>Emulations - (&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;  ze&#772;loi). In a bad sense, meaning heart-burning, or jealousy, or perhaps inordinate ambition. The sense is ardor or zeal in a bad cause, leading to strife, etc.
<p>Wrath - This also is plural in the Greek (&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768;  thumoi), meaning passions, "bursts of anger;" see the note at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#020">Co2 12:20</A>.
<p>Strife - Also plural in the Greek; see the note at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#020">Co2 12:20</A>
<p>Seditions - See the note at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#017">Rom 16:17</A>.
<p>Heresies - See the note at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#017">Act 5:17</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#019">Co1 11:19</A>.

<p>And such like - This class of evils, without attempting to specify all.
<p>Of which I tell you before - In regard to which I forewarn you.
<p>As I have also told you in time past - When he was with them.
<p>Shall not inherit the kingdom of God - Cannot possibly be saved; see the notes at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#009">Co1 6:9-11</A>. In regard to this passage, we may remark:
<p>(1) That it furnishes the most striking and unanswerable proof of human depravity. Paul represents these things as "the works of the flesh," the works of the unrenewed nature of man. They are such as human nature, when left to itself, everywhere produces. The world shows that such is the fact; and we cannot but ask, is a nature producing this to be regarded as pure? Is man an unfallen being? Can he save himself? Does he need no Saviour?
<p>(2) this passage is full of fearful admonition to those who indulge in any or all of these vices. Paul, inspired of God, has solemnly declared, that such cannot be saved. They cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven as they are. Nor is it desirable that they should. What would heaven be if filled up with adulterers, and fornicators, and idolaters, with the proud and envious, and with murderers, and drunkards? To call such a place heaven, would be an abuse of the word. No one could wish to dwell there; and such people cannot enter into heaven.
<p>(3) the human heart must be changed, or man cannot be saved. This follows of course. If such is its tendency, then there is a necessity for such a change as that in regeneration, in order that man may be happy and be saved.
<p>(4) we should rejoice that such people cannot, with their present characters, be admitted to heaven. We should rejoice that there is one world where these vices are unknown, a world of perfect and eternal purity. When we look at the earth; when we see how these vices prevail; when we reflect that every land is polluted, and that we cannot traverse a continent or an island, visit a nook or corner of the earth, dwell in any city or town, where these vices do not exist, O how refreshing and invigorating is it to look forward to a pure heaven! How cheering the thought that there is one world where these vices are unknown; one world, all whose ample plains may be traversed, and the note of blasphemy shall never fall on the ear; one world, where virtue shall be safe from the arts of the seducer; one world where we may forever dwell, and not one reeling and staggering drunkard shall ever be seen; where there shall be not one family in want and tears from the vice of its unfaithful head! With what joy should we look forward to that world! With what ardor should we pant that it may be our own!

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">gal 5:22</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>But the fruit of the Spirit - That which the Holy Spirit produces. It is not without design, evidently, that the apostle uses the word "Spirit" here, as denoting that these things do not flow from our own nature. The vices above enumerated are the proper "works" or result of the operations of the human heart; the virtues which he enumerates are produced by a foreign influence - the agency of the Holy Spirit. Hence, Paul does not trace them to our own hearts, even when renewed. He says that they are to be regarded as the proper result of the Spirit's operations on the soul.
<p>Is love - To God and to human beings. Probably the latter here is particularly intended, as the fruits of the Spirit are placed in contradistinction from those vices which lead to strifes among people. On the meaning of the word love, see the notes at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#001">Co1 13:1</A>; and for an illustration of its operations and effects, see the notes at that whole chapter.
<p>Joy - In the love of God; in the evidences of pardon; in communion with the Redeemer, and in his service; in the duties of religion, in trial, and in the hope of heaven; see the notes at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#002">Rom 5:2</A>; compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#008">Pe1 1:8</A>.
<p>Peace - As the result of reconciliation with God; see the notes at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#001">Rom 5:1</A>.
<p>Long-suffering - In affliction and trial, and when injured by others; see the note at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#004">Co1 13:4</A>.
<p>Gentleness - The same word which is translated "kindness" in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#006">Co2 6:6</A>; see the note at that place. The word means goodness, kindness, benignity; and is opposed to a harsh, crabbed, crooked temper. It is a disposition to be pleased; it is mildness of temper, calmness of spirit, an unruffled disposition, and a disposition to treat all with urbanity and politeness. This is one of the regular effects of the Spirit's operations on the heart. Religion makes no one crabby, and morose, and sour. It sweetens the temper; corrects an irritable disposition; makes the heart kind; disposes us to make all around us as happy as possible. This is true politeness; a kind of politeness which can far better be learned in the school of Christ than in that of Chesterfield; by the study of the New Testament than under the direction of the dancing-master.
<p>Goodness - See the note at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#014">Rom 15:14</A>. Here the word seems to be used in the sense of beneficence, or a disposition to do good to others. The sense is, that a Christian must be a good man.
<p>Faith - On the meaning of the word faith, see the note at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#016">Mar 16:16</A>. The word here may be used in the sense of fidelity, and may denote that the Christian will be a faithful man, a man faithful to his word and promises; a man who can be trusted or confided in. It is probable that the word is used in this sense because the object of the apostle is not to speak of the feelings which we have toward God so much as to illustrate the influences of the Spirit in directing and controlling our feelings toward people. True religion makes a man faithful. The Christian is faithful as a man; faithful as a neighbor, friend, father, husband, son. He is faithful to his contracts; faithful to his promises. No man can be a Christian who is not thus faithful, and all pretensions to being under the influences of the Spirit when such fidelity does not exist, are deceitful and vain.

<p>Meekness - See the note at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#005">Mat 5:5</A>.
<p>Temperance - The word used here, (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;  egkrateia), means properly "self-control, continence." It is derived from &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;  en and &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  kratos, "strength," and has reference to the power or ascendancy which we have over exciting and evil passions of all kinds. It denotes the self-rule which a man has over the evil propensities of his nature. Our word temperance we use now in a much more limited sense, as referring mainly to abstinence from intoxicating drinks. But the word here used is employed in a much more extended signification. It includes the dominion over all evil propensities, and may denote continence, chastity, self-government, moderation in regard to all indulgences as well as abstinence from intoxicating drinks. See the word explained in the notes at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#025">Act 24:25</A>. The sense here is, that the influences of the Holy Spirit on the heart make a man moderate in all indulgences; teach him to restrain his passions, and to govern himself; to control his evil propensities, and to subdue all inordinate affection.
<p>The Christian will not only abstain from intoxicating drinks, but from all exciting passions; he will be temperate in his manner of living, and in the government of his temper. This may be applied to temperance properly so called with us; but it should not be limited to that. A Christian must be a temperate man; and if the effect of his religion is not to produce this, it is false and vain. Abstinence from intoxicating drinks, as well as from all improper excitement, is demanded by the very genius of his religion, and on this subject there is no danger of drawing the cords too close. No one was ever injured by the strictest temperance, by total abstinence from ardent spirits, and from wine as a beverage; no man is certainly safe who does not abstain; no man, it is believed, can be in a proper frame of mind for religious duties who indulges in the habitual use of intoxicating drinks. Nothing does more scandal to religion than such indulgences; and, other things being equal, he is the most under the influence of the Spirit of God who is the most thoroughly a person of temperance.
<p>Against such there is no law - That is, there is no law to condemn such persons. These are not the things which the Law denounces. These, therefore, are the true freemen; free from the condemning sentence of the Law, and free in the service of God. Law condemns sin; and they who evince the spirit here referred to are free from its denunciations.

<p>With the affections - Margin, "Passions." All corrupt desires.
<p>And lusts - See the note at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#024">Rom 1:24</A>.

<p>If we live in the Spirit - See the note at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#016">Gal 5:16</A>. The sense of this verse probably is, "We who are Christians profess to be under the influences of the Holy Spirit. By his influences and agency is our spiritual life. We profess not to be under the dominion of the flesh; not to be controlled by its appetites and desires. Let us then act in this manner, and as if we believed this. Let us yield ourselves to his influences, and show that we are controlled by that Spirit." It is an earnest exhortation to Christians to yield wholly to the agency of the Holy Spirit on their hearts, and to submit to his guidance; see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#005">Rom 8:5</A>, note9, note.

<p>Let us not be desirous of vainglory - The word used here (&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;  kenodoxoi) means "proud" or "vain" of empty advantages, as of birth, property, eloquence, or learning. The reference here is probably to the paltry competitions which arose on account of these supposed advantages. It is possible that this might have been one cause of the difficulties existing in the churches of Galatia, and the apostle is anxious wholly to check and remove it. The Jews prided themselves on their birth, and people are everywhere prone to overvalue the supposed advantages of birth and blood. The doctrines of Paul are, that on great and most vital respects people are on a level; that these things contribute nothing to salvation (notes, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#028">Gal 3:28</A>); and that Christians should esteem them of little importance, and that they should not be suffered to interfere with their fellowship, or to mar their harmony and peace.
<p>Provoking one another - The sense is, that they who are desirous of vainglory, do provoke one another. They provoke those whom they regard as inferiors by a haughty carriage and a contemptuous manner toward them. They look upon them often with contempt; pass them by with disdain; treat them as beneath their notice; and this provokes on the other hand hard feeling, and hatred. and a disposition to take revenge. When people regard themselves as equal in their great and vital interests; when they feel that they are fellow-heirs of the grace of life; when they feel that they belong to one great family, and are in their great interests on a level; deriving no advantage from birth and blood; on a level as descendants of the same apostate father; as being themselves sinners; on a level at the foot of the cross, at the communion table, on beds of sickness, in the grave, and at the bar of God; when they feel this, then the consequences here referred to will be avoided. There will be no haughty carriage such as to provoke opposition; and on the other hand there will be no envy on account of the superior rank of others.
<p>Envying one another - On account of their superior wealth, rank, talent, learning. The true way to cure envy is to make people feel that in their great and important interests they are on a level. Their great interests are beyond the grave. The distinctions of this life are temporary, and are comparative trifles. Soon all will be on a level in the grave, and at the bar of God and in heaven. Wealth, and honor, and rank do not avail there. The poorest man will wear as bright a crown as the rich; the man of most humble birth will be admitted as near the throne as he who can boast the longest line of illustrious ancestors. Why should a man who is soon to wear a "crown incorruptible and undefiled and that fadeth not away," envy him who has a ducal coronet here, or a royal diadem - baubles that are soon to be laid aside forever? Why should he, though poor here, who is soon to inherit the treasures of heaven where "moth and rust do not corrupt," envy him who can walk over a few acres as his own, or who has accumulated a glittering pile of dust, soon to be left forever?
<p>Why should he who is soon to wear the robes of salvation, made "white in the blood of the Lamb," envy him who is "clothed in purple and fine linen," or who can adorn himself and his family in the most gorgeous attire which art and skill can make, soon to give place to the winding-sheet; soon to be succeeded by the simple garb which the most humble wears in the grave? If men feel that their great interests are beyond the tomb: that in the important matter of salvation they are on a level; that soon they are to be undistinguished beneath the clods of the valley, how unimportant comparatively would it seem to adorn their bodies, to advance their name and rank and to improve their estates! The rich and the great would cease to look down with contempt on those of more humble rank, and the poor would cease to envy those above them, for they are soon to be their equals in the grave; their equals, perhaps their superiors in heaven!
