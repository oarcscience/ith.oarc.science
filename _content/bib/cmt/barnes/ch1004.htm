<p>Read, "These are the sons of the father (i. e. chief) of Etam" <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#006">Ch2 11:6</A>, a city of Judah, not far from Bethlehem. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#009">1 Chronicles 4:9</A></p>

<p>It is remarkable that Jabez should be introduced without description, or patronymic, as if a well-known personage. We can only suppose that he was known to those for whom Chronicles was written, either by tradition, or by writings which have perished. In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#010">Ch1 4:10</A> Jabez alludes to his name, "sorrowful" (margin): "Grant that the grief implied in my name may not come upon me!" 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#011">1 Chronicles 4:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">ch1 4:11</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>It has been conjectured from the strangeness of all the names in this list, that we have here a fragment of Canaanite record, connected with the family of the "Shua," whose daughter Judah took to wife <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#003">Ch1 2:3</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#002">Gen 38:2</A>, and whose family thus became related to the tribe of Judah. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#014">1 Chronicles 4:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">ch1 4:14</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The words "and Meonothai" should he added to the end of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#013">Ch1 4:13</A>; but they should be retained also at the commencement of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#014">Ch1 4:14</A>. Or, see the marginal note. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#017">1 Chronicles 4:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">ch1 4:17</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>She bare Miriam - Rather, "she conceived." The mother is not mentioned, and it seems impossible to restore the original text with any certainty. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#018">1 Chronicles 4:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">ch1 4:18</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>His wife - i. e. Mered's. Mered, it would seem, had two wives, Bithiah, an Egyptian woman, and a Jewish wife (see the margin), whose name is not given. If Mered was a chief of rank, Bithlah may have been married to him with the consent of her father, for the Egyptian kings often gave their daughters in marriage to foreigners. Or she may have elected to forsake her countrymen and cleave to a Jewish husband, becoming a convert to his religion. Her name, Bithiah, "daughter of Yahweh," is like that of a convert. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#019">1 Chronicles 4:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">ch1 4:19</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>His wife Hodiah - Not as in the margin, but rather, "the sons of the wife of Hodiah." Hodiah is elsewhere always a man's name <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#007">Neh 8:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#005">Neh 9:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#010">Neh 10:10</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#013">Neh 10:13</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#018">Neh 10:18</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#022">1 Chronicles 4:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">ch1 4:22</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Who had the dominion in Moab - Moab was conquered by David <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#002">Sa2 8:2</A>, and again by Omri, after which it remained subject until the death of Ahab <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#005">Kg2 3:5</A>. But a more ancient rule, in times of which we have no further record, is probably intended. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#023">1 Chronicles 4:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">ch1 4:23</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Among plants and hedges - Rather, "in Netaim and Gederah" <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#036">Jos 15:36</A>.
<p>With the king - Or, probably, "on the king's property." Both David and several of the later kings had large territorial possessions in various parts of Judaea <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#025">Ch1 27:25</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#031">Ch1 27:31</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#010">Ch2 26:10</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#004">Ch2 27:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#028">Ch2 32:28-29</A>.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#031">1 Chronicles 4:31</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_031">ch1 4:31</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Unto the reign of David - It is not quite clear why this clause is added. Perhaps the writer is quoting from a document belonging to David's reign. Or, he may mean that some of the cities, as Ziklag <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#006">Sa1 27:6</A>, were lost to Simeon about David's time. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#033">1 Chronicles 4:33</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_033">ch1 4:33</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>And their genealogy - Rather, "and their register was according thereto" - they were registered, i. e. according to the places where they dwelt. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#038">1 Chronicles 4:38</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_038">ch1 4:38</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>These mentioned by their names were princes - The registered chiefs of the cities in the first list <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#028">Ch1 4:28-31</A>, in the time of Hezekiah <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#041">Ch1 4:41</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#039">1 Chronicles 4:39</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_039">ch1 4:39</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Gedor - Rather read, "Gerar" (Septuagint) a fertile district <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#006">Gen 26:6-12</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#014">Ch2 14:14-15</A> in Philistine country. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#041">1 Chronicles 4:41</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_041">ch1 4:41</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The habitations - Rather, "the Mehunim" (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#007">Ch2 36:7</A>), called also "Maonites" (see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#012">Jdg 10:12</A> note). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#043">1 Chronicles 4:43</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_043">ch1 4:43</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Unto this day - These words are probably taken from the record which the writer of Chronicles had before him, and do not imply that the Simeonites remained undisturbed in their conquests until after the return from the captivity. So <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#041">Ch1 4:41</A>.
