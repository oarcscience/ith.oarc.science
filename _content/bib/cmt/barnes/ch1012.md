### [1 Chronicles Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#001)

[1 Chronicles 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 12:1</span></span>

This chapter is composed wholly of matter that is new to us, no
corresponding accounts occurring in Samuel. It comprises four lists:

\(1\) One of men, chiefly Benjamites, who joined David at Ziklag [Ch1
12:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#001);

\(2\) A second of Gadites who united themselves to him when he was in a
stronghold near the desert [Ch1
12:8-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#008);

\(3\) A third of Manassites who came to him when he was dismissed by the
Philistines upon suspicion [Ch1
12:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#019); and

\(4\) A fourth of the numbers from the different tribes who attended and
made him king at Hebron 1 Chr. 12:23-40.

[1 Chronicles 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch1 12:2</span></span>

The skill of the Benjamites as archers is noted in [Ch1
8:40](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#040), and [Ch2
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#008). Their proficiency in using the
left hand appears in the narrative of Judges ([Jdg
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#015), and marginal reference) where
their special excellency as slingers is also noticed.

Even of Saul's brethren - Compare [Ch1
12:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#029). Even of Saul's own tribe there
were some who separated themselves from his cause, and threw in their
lot with David.

[1 Chronicles 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch1 12:8</span></span>

Into the hold to the wilderness - Rather, "into the hold toward the
wilderness." Some understand by this Ziklag, some En-gedi [Sa1
24:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#001); but it seems most probable
that here and in [Ch1 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#016) the
stronghold of Adullam is intended [Ch1
11:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#015).

[1 Chronicles 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch1 12:14</span></span>

The marginal rendering is preferable. (Compare [Lev
26:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#008)).

[1 Chronicles 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch1 12:15</span></span>

On the danger of the exploit, see the marginal reference note.

This passage [Ch1 12:8-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#008) seems to be
taken verbatim from an ancient source, the poetical expressions in [Ch1
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#008), [Ch1
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#014), being especially unlike the
usual style of our author.

[1 Chronicles 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch1 12:18</span></span>

Amasai - The marginal reference identifies him with Amasa, David's
nephew, but it seems unlikely that David would have misdoubted a band
led by his own nephew.

The passionate earnestness of Amasai's speech is strongly marked in the
original, and will be better seen by omitting the words which our
Version adds in italics. Here, as in [Ch1
12:8-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#008), we have manifestly the actual
words of a very ancient record.

[1 Chronicles 12:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch1 12:21</span></span>

The band of the rovers - See the marginal reference.

[1 Chronicles 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ch1 12:23</span></span>

Rather, "These are the numbers of the men, ready equipped for the host,
that came to David, etc."

In the list which follows such points as

\(1\) The large mumber sent by the trans-Jordanic tribes;

\(2\) The large numbers from Zebulon, Asher, Naphtali, and Dan, all
tribes somewhat remote, and generally speaking undistinguished;

\(3\) The small size of the contingent from Judah, which is generally
represented as numerically superior to every other tribe, and which
might have been expected to be especially zealous on behalf of its own
prince and tribesman; throw some doubt upon the numbers, which may be
suspected of having in some instances undergone corruption.

[1 Chronicles 12:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">ch1 12:29</span></span>

For hitherto ... - Rather, "For still the greatest part of them
maintained their allegiance to the house of Saul." This is given as the
reason for so few coming to Hebron. It shows us that, even after the
death of Ishbosheth, the Benjamites had hopes of furnishing a third king
to the nation.

[1 Chronicles 12:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">ch1 12:32</span></span>

Men that had understanding of the times - This is best interpreted
politically. Compare the marginal reference

[1 Chronicles 12:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">ch1 12:33</span></span>

Expert in war ... - Rather "arrayed for battle with all harness of
battle, who set the battle in array with no double heart," excelling,
that is, in the matter of their arms and accoutrements. The writer notes
in each tribe the point in which it was most admirable.
