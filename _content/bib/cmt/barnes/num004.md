### [Numbers Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#001)

[Numbers 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">num 4:4</span></span>

About the most holy things - Omit "about." The sense is, "this is the
charge of the sons of Kohath, the most holy things:" i. e. the ark of
the covenant, the table of showbread, the candlestick, and the golden
altar, together with the furniture pertaining thereto. It appears, from
a comparison of [Num 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#016), [Num
4:28](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#028), [Num
4:33](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#033), that the ministry of the
Kohathites was superintended by Eleazar, the older of the two surviving
sons of Aaron; and that of the two other families by Ithamar.

[Numbers 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">num 4:6</span></span>

wholly of blue - Compare [Exo 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#004)
note. The third and external covering of the ark only was to be of this
color. The table of showbread had [Num
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#008) an outer wrapping of scarlet; the
altar [Num 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#013) one of purple.

Put in the staves - Probably, "put the staves in order." These were
never taken out of the golden rings by which the ark was to be borne
(see [Exo 25:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#014)), but would need
adjustment.

[Numbers 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">num 4:20</span></span>

to see when the holy things are covered - Render: to see the holy things
for an instant. The expression means Iiterally" as a gulp," i. e. for
the instant it takes to swallow.

[Numbers 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">num 4:23</span></span>

enter in to perform the service - literally, as in the margin, "to war
the warfare," or, as the same phrase in part is rendered, [Num
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#003), "enter into the host to do the
work." The language is military. The service of God is a sacred warfare
([Num 8:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#024) marginal reading).

[Numbers 4:28](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">num 4:28</span></span>

The Gershonites and Merarites are superintended by Ithamar, Aaron's
younger son, who had already had the oversight of the tabernacle in its
construction [Exo 38:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#021). Thus, readily
do the permanent offices of the leaders of the Israelite community
spring out of the duties which, under the emergencies of the first year
of the Exodus, they had been led, from time to time, to undertake.

[Num 4:32](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#032)

By name ye shall reckon the instruments - Or, assign them to their
bearers singly, and "by name." These "instruments" comprised the heavier
parts of the tabernacle; and the order seems intended to prevent
individual Merarites choosing their own burden, and so throwing more
than the proper share on others.
