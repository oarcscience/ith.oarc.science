### [Numbers Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#001)

[Numbers 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 2:2</span></span>

standard ... ensign - The "standard" marked the division, or camp (cf.
[Num 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#009), [Num
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#016), [Num
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#024), [Num
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#031)); the "ensign" the family. There
would thus be four "standards" only, one for each "camp" of three
tribes. The "standard" was probably a solid figure or emblem mounted on
a pole, such as the Egyptians used. Tradition appropriates the four
cherubic forms ([Eze 1:5-12](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#005); [Rev
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#007) ff), the lion, man, ox, and eagle,
to the camps of Judah, Reuben, Ephraim, and Dan respectively; and this,
as to the first, has a certain support from [Gen
49:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#009) (compare [Rev
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#005)), and as to the third, from [Deu
33:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#017).

Far off - See the margin, over against; i. e. facing the tabernacle on
every side. The distance was perhaps 2,000 cubits or rather more than 14
mile: compare [Jos 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#004).

[Numbers 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#003)

The following plan shows the general arrangement of the camp, which
would vary in different places according to local exigencies. The area
of the camp might be about three square miles:

[Num 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#014)

Reuel - Doubtless an error of transcription for Deuel [Num
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#014).

[Numbers 2:33](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">num 2:33</span></span>

Such was the ideal form of the encampment in the wilderness: a form
reproduced in the square court with which the temple was eventually
surrounded, and in the vision of the heavenly city as seen by Ezekiel
[Eze 48:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#020), and by John ([Rev
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#016); compare [Rev
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#009)). Thus the camp of God's earthly
people was divinely ordered so as to set forth the completeness of His
Church; and to illustrate by its whole arrangement, which was determined
by the tabernacle in the center, both the dependance of all on God, and
the access which all enjoyed to God.
