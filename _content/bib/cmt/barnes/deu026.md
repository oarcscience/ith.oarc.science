### [Deuteronomy Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#001)

[Deuteronomy 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 26:1</span></span>

Two liturgical enactments having a clear and close reference to the
whole of the preceding legislation, form a most appropriate and
significant conclusion to it, namely,

\(1\) the formal acknowledgment in deed and symbol of God's
faithfulness, by presentment of a basket filled with firstfruits, and in
word by recitation of the solemn formula prescribed in [Deu
26:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#003), [Deu
26:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#005); and

\(2\) the solemn declaration and profession on the part of each
Israelite on the occasion of the third tithe [Deu
26:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#012).

[Deuteronomy 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">deu 26:2</span></span>

On the subject of firstfruits see the notes at [Lev
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#009) ff. The firstfruits here in
question are to be distinguished alike from those offered in
acknowledgment of the blessings of harvest (compare [Exo
22:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#029)) at the Feasts of Passover and
Pentecost, and also from the offerings prescribed in [Num
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#008) ff. The latter consisted of
preparations from the produce of the earth, such as oil, flour, wine,
etc.; while those here meant are the raw produce: the former were
national and public offerings, those of this chapter were private and
personal. The whole of the firstfruits belonged to the officiating
priest.

[Deuteronomy 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">deu 26:5</span></span>

A Syrian ready to perish was my father - The reference is shown by the
context to be to Jacob, as the ancestor in whom particularly the family
of Abraham began to develop into a nation (compare [Isa
43:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#022), [Isa
43:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#028), etc.). Jacob is called a Syrian
(literally, Aramaean), not only because of his own long residence in
Syria with Laban Gen. 29-31, as our Lord was called a Nazarene because
of his residence at Nazareth [Mat
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#023), but because he there married and
had his children (compare [Hos 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#012));
and might be said accordingly to belong to that more than to any other
land.

[Deuteronomy 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">deu 26:12</span></span>

See the marginal reference to Numbers and note. A strict fulfillment of
the onerous and complicated tithe obligations was a leading part of the
righteousness of the Pharisees: compare [Mat
23:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#023).

[Deuteronomy 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">deu 26:14</span></span>

I have not eaten thereof in my mourning - When the Israelite would be
unclean (compare the marginal references).

Nor given ought thereof for the dead - The reference is not so much to
the superstitious custom of placing food on or in tombs as to the
funeral expenses, and more especially the usual feast for the mourners
(compare [Jer 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#007); [Eze
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#017); [Hos
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#004); Tobit 4:17). The dedicated things
were to be employed in glad and holy feasting, not therefore for funeral
banquets; for death and all associated with it was regarded as unclean.

[Deuteronomy 26:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">deu 26:16</span></span>

A brief and earnest exhortation by way of conclusion to the second and
longest discourse of the book.

[Deu 26:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#017)

Thou hast avouched - literally, "made to say:" so also in the next
verse. The sense is: "Thou hast given occasion to the Lord to say that
He is thy God," i. e. by promising that He shall be so. Compare [Exo
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#007); [Jos
24:14-25](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#014),
