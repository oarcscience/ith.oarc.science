### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#001)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 21:1</span></span>

There is no note of time whatever, nor any clue as to what part of
David's reign the events of this chapter ought to be assigned.

Enquired of the Lord - Hebrew "sought the face of the Lord," quite a
different phrase from that so often used in Judges (e. g. [Jdg
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#001)) and the Books of Samuel, and
probably indicating that this chapter is from a different source; an
inference agreeing with the indefinite "in the days of David," and with
the allusion to the slaughter of the Gibeonites, which has not anywhere
been narrated.

And for his bloody house - literally, "the house of blood," i. e., the
house or family upon which rests the guilt of shedding innocent blood.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa2 21:2</span></span>

The way in which the writer here refers to the history of the league
with the Gibeonites Josh. 9 shows that the Book of Joshua was not a part
of the same work as the Books of Samuel.

Of the Amorites - The Gibeonites were Hivites [Jos
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#007); [Jos
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#019); and in many enumerations of the
Canaanite nations the Hivites are distinguished from the Amorites. But
"Amorite" is often used in a more comprehensive sense, equivalent to
"Canaanite" (as [Gen 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#016); [Deu
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#027)), and denoting especially that
part of the Canaanite nation which dwelt in the hill country [Num
13:29](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#029); [Deu
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#007), [Deu
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#020), [Deu
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#024), and so includes the Hivites.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa2 21:4</span></span>

No silver, nor gold ... - Money payments as a compensation for
blood-guilt were very common among many nations. The law, too, in [Num
35:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#031), presupposes the existence of
the custom which it prohibits. In like manner the speech of the
Gibeonites implies that such a payment as they refuse would be a not
unusual proceeding.

Neither ... shalt thou kill any man in Israel - They mean that it is not
against the nation of Israel, but against the individual Saul, that they
cry for vengeance. The demand for Saul's sons is exactly similar to that
which dictated David's own expression in [Sa2
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#017), "against me, and against my
father's house."

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa2 21:6</span></span>

Seven men - Seven was a sacred number not only with the Hebrews but with
other Oriental nations [Num 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#001), [Num
23:29](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#029), and is therefore brought in on
this occasion when the judicial death of the sons of Saul was a
religious act intended to appease the wrath of God for the violation of
an oath [Num 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#004).

Whom the Lord did choose - Rather, "the Lord's chosen," or elect. The
same phrase is applied to Moses [Psa
106:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#023), to the Israelites [Isa
43:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#020), and to Christ [Isa
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa2 21:7</span></span>

The Lord's oath - The calamity brought upon Israel by Saul's breach of
the oath to the Gibeonites would make David doubly careful in the matter
of his own oath to Jonathan.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa2 21:8</span></span>

Rizpah - See the marginal reference. A foreign origin was possibly the
cause of the selection of Rizpah's sons as victims.

Sons of Michal - An obvious error for "Merab" ([Sa1
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#019) note).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa2 21:9</span></span>

In the first days - The barley harvest (about the middle or toward the
end of April) was earlier than the wheat harvest [Exo
9:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#031); [Rut
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#022).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa2 21:10</span></span>

Dropped - Rather, "poured," the proper word for heavy rain [Exo
9:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#033). The "early rain," or heavy rain
of autumn, usually began in October, so that Rizpah's devoted watch
continued about six months. How rare rain was in harvest we learn from
[Sa1 12:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#017); [Pro
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#001). The reason of the bodies being
left unburied, contrary to [Deu 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#023),
probably was that the death of these men being an expiation of the guilt
of a violated oath, they were to remain until the fall of rain should
give the assurance that God's anger was appeased, and the national sin
forgiven.

Birds of the air ... beasts of the field - It is well known how in the
East, on the death e. g. of a camel in a caravan, the vultures instantly
flock to the carcass. (Compare [Mat
24:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#028).)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa2 21:12</span></span>

From the street of Beth-shan - This was the wide place just inside the
gate of an Oriental city, bounded therefore by the city wall (compare
the marginal reference). Here, as the place of concourse, the
Philistines had fastened the bodies.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa2 21:15</span></span>

This, like the preceding paragraph [Sa2
21:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#001), is manifestly a detached and
unconnected extract. It is probably taken from some history of David's
wars, apparently the same as furnished the materials for 2 Sam. 5; 8;
23:8-39. There is no direct clue to the time when the events here
related took place, but it was probably quite in the early part of
David's reign, while he was still young and active, after the war
described in 2 Sam. 5. The Book of Chronicles places these Philistine
battles immediately after the taking of Rabbah of the Ammonites [Ch1
20:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1020.htm#004), but omits David's adventure
[Sa2 21:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#015).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa2 21:16</span></span>

Ishbi-benob - A corrupt reading. The whole passage should perhaps run
thus: "And David waxed faint. So they halted in Gob (as in [Sa2
21:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#018)). And there was a man (in
Gob) which was of the sons of the giant, etc."

Sons of the giant - The "giant" here [Sa2
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#018), [Sa2
21:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#020), [Sa2
21:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#022) is "ha-Raphah," whence, the
"Rephaim" [Gen 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#005); [Deu
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#011). The sons of Ha-raphah, or
Rephaim, are different from the "Nephilim," or Giants [Gen
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#004); [Num
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#033). The sons of Anak were not
strictly Rephaim, but Nephilim.

Three hundred shekels of brass - About eight pounds. Goliath's spear's
head weighed "six hundred shekels of iron."

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa2 21:18</span></span>

A battle in Gob - In the parallel passage (marginal reference), "Gezer"
is named as the field of this battle. However, Gath is named [Sa2
21:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#020), [Sa2
21:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#022) in a way to make it probable
that Gath was the scene of all the battles. The Septuagint in this verse
has "Gath."

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 21:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa2 21:19</span></span>

The Hebrew text is manifestly very corrupt. First, for "Jaare-oregim,"
[Ch1 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1020.htm#005) gives us the reading Jair.
"Oregim" has evidently got in by a transcriber's error from the line
below, where "oregim" is the Hebrew for "weavers." Again, the word the
"Bethlehemite" is very doubtful. It is supported by [Sa2
23:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#024), but it is not found in the far
purer text of [Ch1 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1020.htm#005), but instead
of it we find the name of the Philistine slain by Elhanan, "Lahmi the
brother of Goliath the Gittite." It is probable, therefore, that either
the words "the Bethlehemite," are a corruption of "Lahmi," or that the
recurrence of "Lahmi," and the termination of "Beth-lehemite" has
confused the transcriber, and led to the omission of one of the words in
each text.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 21:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">sa2 21:22</span></span>

Four - Not necessarily meaning that they were brothers, but that they
were all of the race of the Giant, all Rephaim. The word "four" is
omitted in the parallel passage, only the three last being mentioned in
that chapter.
