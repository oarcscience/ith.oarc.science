### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#001)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 11:1</span></span>

Athaliah, as wife of Joram and mother of Ahaziah, had guided both the
internal and the external policy of the Jewish kingdom; she had procured
the establishmeut of the worship of Baal in Judaea [Kg2
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#018), [Kg2
8:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#027), and had maintained a close
alliance with the sister kingdom [Kg2
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#029); [Kg2
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#013). The revolution effected by Jehu
touched her nearly. It struck away from her the support of her
relatives; it isolated her religious system, severing the communication
with Phoenicia; and the death of Ahaziah deprived her of her legal
status in Judaea, which was that of queen-mother (the [Kg1
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#013) note), and trausferred that
position to the chief wife of her deceased son. Athaliah, instead of
yielding to the storm, or merely standing on the defensive, resolved to
become the assailant, and strike before any plans could be formed
against her. In the absence of her son, hers was probably the chief
anthority at Jerusalem. She used it to command the immediate destruction
of all the family of David, already thinned by previous massacres [Kg2
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#014); [Ch2
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#004), [Ch2
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#017), and then seized the throne.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg2 11:2</span></span>

Jehosheba ... sister of Ahaziah - "Half-sister," according to Josephus -
daughter of Joram, not by Athaliah, but by another wife. She was married
to Jehoiada the high priest, and was thus in a position to save and
conceal her nephew, Joash, who was only one year old (compare [Kg2
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#003), [Kg2
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#021)).

In the bedchamber - literally, "in the chamber of mattresses" - probabIy
a store-room in the palace in which mattresses were kept.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg2 11:3</span></span>

And Athaliah did reign over the land - In these words the writer
dismisses the entire reign of Athaliah, whereof he scorns to speak. We
gather incidentally from [Kg2 12:5-12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#005),
compared with [Ch2 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#007), that Athaliah
used her power to establish the exclusive worship of BaaI through the
kingdom of Judah, and to crush that of Yahweh. She stopped the temple
service, gave over the sacred vessels of the sanctuary to the use of the
Baal priests, and employed the temple itself as a quarry from which
materials might be taken for the construction of a great temple to Baal,
which rose in the immediate neighborhood.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg2 11:4</span></span>

See the marginal reference.

The captains - The word used here and in [Kg2
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#019), הא־כרי ha-kârı̂y, designates a
certain part of the royal guard, probably that which in the earlier
times was known under the name of Cherethites [Kg1
1:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#038). Others see in the term an ethnic
name - "Carians," who seem certainly to have been much inclined to take
service as mercenaries from an early date. Render the whole passage thus
- "And in the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the centurions of
the Carians and the guardsmen (literally, 'runners, ' [Kg2
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#025)), etc."

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg2 11:5</span></span>

Five divisions of the guard under their five captains are distinguished
here. Three of the five divisions "enter in" on the Sabbath; the other
two "go forth" on the Sabbath [Kg2
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#007). By the former phrase seems to be
meant the mounting guard at the royal palace (the "king's house," where
Athaliah then was); by the latter the serving of escort to the sovereign
beyond the palace bounds. Jehoiada orders that of those whose business
it would be to guard the palace on the ensuing Sabbath, one company or
cohort should perform that task in the ordinary way, while another
should watch the gate of Sur - or better, "the gate of the foundation"
[Ch2 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#005) - that by which the palace
was usually quitted for the temple, and a third should watch another of
the palace gates, called "the gate of the guard" (see [Kg2
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#019)). The two companies whose proper
business it would be to serve as the royal escort beyond the palace
walls, he orders to enter the temple, and surround the person of the
young king.

[Kg2 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#006)

That it be not broken down - The one word in the original text of which
this is a translation occurs nowhere else; and its meaning is very
doubtful.

[Kg2 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#008)

Within the ranges - Rather, "within the ranks." If anyone tried to break
through the soldiers' ranks to the king, or even to disturb their order,
he was to be immediately slain.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg2 11:11</span></span>

From the right corner ... - Rather, "from the right side of the temple
buildings to the left side" - i. e., right across the temple court from
the one side to the other, by the altar of burnt offerings, etc. This
altar stood exactly in front of the temple-porch. Here the king was
stationed; and before him and behind him, ("round about" him) stood the
soldiers, drawn up several ranks deep across the entire court, just in
front of the sacred building.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg2 11:12</span></span>

The testimony - i. e., "The Book of the Law" which was kept in the ark
of the covenant (Dent. 31:26). This Jehoiada placed ou the king's head
at the moment of coronation, perhaps to indicate that the king was not
to be above, but under, the direction of the Law of his country.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg2 11:14</span></span>

By a pillar - Rather, "upon the pillar" probably a sort of stand, or
pulpit, raised on a pillar. Under the later monarchy the Jewish king
seems to have had a special place assigned him in the temple-court, from
which on occasions he addressed the people (marginal references).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg2 11:15</span></span>

Have her forth without the ranges - Rather, "Conduct her out between
your ranks." Guard her, i. e., on all sides, that the people may not
fall upon her and kill her as she passes through the court, thereby
polluting the temple.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg2 11:16</span></span>

And they laid hands on her - Most modern critics render - "and they gave
her space," i. e., they cleared a way for her, and allowed her to walk
out of the temple not only unharmed but untonched.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg2 11:17</span></span>

A covenant - Rather, "the covenant," which either was already an
established part of a coronation (marginal reference "k"), or at least
became such afterward.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg2 11:18</span></span>

A temple had been built to Baal at Jerusalem itself by Athaliah,
Ahaziah, or Jehoram. According to Josephus, it was constructed in the
reign of Jehoram. Its exact position is uncertain.

Images - The word used here is not the same as in [Kg2
10:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#026), but a word which implies
likeness. The Phoenicians had fashioned images, besides their
unfashioned pillar-idols.

The priest appointed ... - The temple worship having been discontinued
during Athaliah's rule, it devolved on Jehoiada now to re-establish it
(see marginal reference). He had already summoned the Levites out of all
the cities of Judah [Ch2 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#002), and had
made use of them in the events of the day. He therefore proceeded at
once to assign the custody of the temple to a particular course, before
conducting the young king to the palace.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg2 11:19</span></span>

They conducted the king down from the temple hill, across the valley of
the Tyropoeum, and up the opposite hill to the royal palace, entering it
not by the "horse-gate" [Kg2 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#016),
where Athaliah had just been slain, but by the "gate of the guard" [Kg2
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#006), which was probably the main gate
of the palace on the eastern side (see [Ch2
23:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#020)).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg2 11:20</span></span>

They slew Athaliah with the sword - This is one of the many little
repetitions which mark the manner of the writer, and which generally
contain some little point which has not been mentioned before (compare
[Kg2 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#016)).
