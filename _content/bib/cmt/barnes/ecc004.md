### [Ecclesiastes Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#001)

[Ecclesiastes](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ecc 4:0</span></span>

Having arrived [Ecc 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#022) at a partial
answer to his question [Ecc 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#003);
namely, that there is positive good (a portion) in that satisfaction
which is found in working, Solomon now turns to the case of such
happiness being interrupted and reduced to vanity by various
contingencies - by oppression [Ecc
4:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#001); by envy [Ecc
4:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#004); by loneliness [Ecc
4:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#007); and by decay of working power
[Ecc 4:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#013). The first two instances
seem taken from the lower ranks of life, and the last two derived from
the higher ranks of life.

[Ecclesiastes 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ecc 4:1</span></span>

So I returned, and considered - Rather, And I returned and saw. He turns
to look upon other phenomena, and to test his previous conclusion by
them.

Oppressed - See the introduction to Ecclesiastes.

[Ecclesiastes 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ecc 4:4</span></span>

Every right work - Rather, every success in work.

For this ... - i. e., "This successful work makes the worker an object
of envy." Some understand the meaning to be, "this work is the effect of
the rivalry of man with his neighbor."

[Ecclesiastes 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ecc 4:5</span></span>

Foldeth his hands - The envious man is here exhibited in the attitude of
the sluggard (marginal references).

Eateth his own flesh - i. e., "Destroys himself:" compare a similar
expression in [Isa 49:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#026); [Psa
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#002); [Mic
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#003).

[Ecclesiastes 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ecc 4:6</span></span>

Either the fool's sarcasm on his successful but restless neighbor; or
the comment of Solomon recommending contentment with a moderate
competence. The former meaning seems preferable.

[Ecclesiastes 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ecc 4:7</span></span>

The spectacle of a prosperous man whose condition is rendered vain by
his brotherless, childless isolation.

[Ecc 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#008)

A second - Any one associated or connected with him.

[Ecc 4:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#009)

Compare a saying from the Talmud: "A man without companions is like the
left hand without the right."

[Ecclesiastes 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ecc 4:13</span></span>

These verses set forth the vanity of earthly prosperity even on a
throne. Opinion as to their application is chiefly divided between
considering them a parable or fiction like that of the childless man in
[Ecc 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#008) : or as setting forth first
the vicissitudes of royal life in two proverbial sayings [Ecc
4:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#013), and then [Ecc
4:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#015), the vicissitudes or
procession of the whole human race, one generation giving place to
another, Which in its turn will be forgotten by its successor. On the
whole, the first appears to have the better claim.

[Ecc 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#013)

Child - Rather, young man.

[Ecc 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#014)

Rather: For out of the house of bondage he goes forth to be a king;
although he was born poor in his kingdom, i. e., in the country over
which he became king.

[Ecc 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#015)

I considered ... - literally, I saw "all the population of the young
man's kingdom."

The second child - This second youth is generally understood to be
identical with the one mentioned in [Ecc
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#013).

[Ecc 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#016)

There is - Rather: There was.

That have been before them - Rather, before whom he was, i. e., at the
head of whom the young king was. Compare [Mic
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#013).

They also that ... him - i. e., The next generation shall forget this
chosen king.
