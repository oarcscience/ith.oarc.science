### [Nehemiah Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#001)

[Nehemiah 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">neh 1:1</span></span>

The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah - The prophetical books
commence generally with a title of this kind (see [Jer
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001)); but no other extant historical
book begins thus. Nehemiah, while attaching his work to Ezra, perhaps
marked in this manner the point at which his own composition commenced.
(See the introduction of the Book of Nehemiah.)

Chisleu - The ninth month, corresponding to the end of November and
beginning of December.

In the twentieth year - i. e. of Artaxerxes Longimanus (465-425 B.C.).
Compare [Neh 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#001).

Shushan the palace - Compare [Est 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#002),
[Est 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#005), etc.; [Dan
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#002). Shushan, or Susa, was the
ordinary residence of the Persian kings. "The palace" or acropolis was a
distinct quarter of the city, occupying an artificial eminence.

[Nehemiah 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">neh 1:2</span></span>

Hanani seems to have been an actual brother of Nehemiah [Neh
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#002).

[Nehemiah 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">neh 1:3</span></span>

The attempt to rebuild the wall in the time of the Pseudo-Smerdis [Ezr
4:12-24](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#012) had been stopped. It still
remained in ruins. The Assyrian sculptures show that it was the usual
practice to burn the gates.

[Nehemiah 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">neh 1:4</span></span>

The God of heaven - This title of the Almighty, which is Persian rather
than Jewish (see [Ch2 36:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#023); [Ezr
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#002) note; [Ezr
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#010); [Ezr
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#012), [Ezr
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#021)), is a favorite one with
Nehemiah, who had been born and brought up in Persia.

[Nehemiah 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">neh 1:11</span></span>

A Persian king had numerous cup-bearers, each of whom probably
discharged the office in his turn.
