Heritage

### [Ezekiel Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#001)

[Ezekiel 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 6:1</span></span>

The former prophecies concerned the city of Jerusalem and the
inhabitants of Judaea. The present is addressed to the whole land and
people of Israel, which is to be included in a like judgment, The ground
of the judgment is "idolatry," and the whole rests on Deut. 12. The
prophecy is against the "mountains" of Israel, because the mountains and
valleys were the seats of idol-worship. It is also the proclamation of
the final judgment of Israel. It is the picture of the future judgment
of the world.

[Ezekiel 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 6:3</span></span>

Rivers - Or, "ravines," which were, like the mountains, favorite seats
of idol-rites [Kg2 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#010).

[Ezekiel 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 6:4</span></span>

Images - See the margin and margin reference, and the [Eze
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#016) note.

Idols - The Phoenicians were in the habit of setting up "heaps" or
"pillars" of stone in honor of their gods, which renders the use of the
word more appropriate.

[Ezekiel 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 6:7</span></span>

The force of the words is, "When the slain shall fall in the midst of
you, then at last ye shall know that I am the Lord." So in [Eze
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#010) where the knowledge implies a
recognition of the merciful intent of Yahweh's dispensations, and
therefore, a hope of restoration.

[Ezekiel 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 6:9</span></span>

I am broken ... - Translate: "because" I have broken "their whorish
heart, which hath departed from me," and their eyes etc. Since Ezekiel
is addressing the Church of God through Israel, we are to note here that
the general principle of the divine administration is laid down. Sin
leads to judgment, judgment to repentance, repentance to forgiveness,
forgiveness to reconciliation, reconciliation to a knowledge of
communion with God.

[Ezekiel 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 6:11</span></span>

The gleam of hope is but transitory. Darkness again gathers round, for
as yet the prophet is predicting judgment.

[Eze 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#011)

Smite ... stamp - Well-known modes of expressing grief.

[Eze 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#013)

Sweet savor - Compare [Gen 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#021).
Words, applied to the smell of sacrifices accepted by God, applied here
to idol-sacrifices in irony.

[Eze 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#014)

Toward Diblath - Or, "Diblathaim," the "Diblathan" of the Moabite stone,
one of the double cities of Moab (see [Eze
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#009)) to the east of which lay the
great desert of Arabia. Some read: "unto Riblah" [Jer
52:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#009) and take the margin rendering.
