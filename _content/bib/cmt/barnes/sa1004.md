### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#001)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 4:1</span></span>

Some attach the opening words to the close of 1 Sam. 3, as the
complement of what is there said, "The Lord revealed himself to Samuel
... in Shiloh, and the word of Samuel went forth to all Israel." If
placed at the commencement of 1 Sam. 4, and in connection with what
follows, they are to be understood in the sense that Samuel called all
Israel to battle against the Philistines. (Compare [Sa1
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#005).) But this is not the natural
interpretation of the words, which seem clearly to belong to what went
before.

The mention of the Philistines connects the narrative with Judg. 13-16.
Since the Philistine servitude lasted forty years [Jdg
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#001), and seems to have terminated in
the days of Samuel [Sa1 7:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#013) in
about the 20th year of his judgeship [Sa1
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#002); and since it had already begun
before the birth of Samson [Jdg 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#005),
and Samson judged Israel for 20 years "in the days of the Philistines"
[Jdg 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#020), it seems to follow that
the latter part of the judgeship of Eli and the early part of that of
Samuel must have been coincident with the lifetime of Samson.

Eben-ezer - (or, the stone of help) The place was afterward so named by
Samuel. See the marginal references. "Aphek," or the "fortress," was
probably the same as the "Aphek" of [Jos
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#018). It would be toward the western
frontier of Judah, not very far from Mizpeh of Benjamin, and near Shiloh
[Sa1 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#004).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 4:3</span></span>

In the evening of the defeat of the Israelites the elders held a
council, and resolved to send for the ark, which is described in full,
as implying that in virtue of the covenant God could not but give them
the victory (compare [Num 10:35](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#035); [Jos
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#010)).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa1 4:4</span></span>

The people sent - The expression is very indicative of the political
state so frequently noted by the writer of the Book of Judges, "In those
days there was no king in Israel."

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 4:6</span></span>

Of the Hebrews - This was the name by which the Israelites were known to
foreign nations (compare [Exo 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#015);
[Exo 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#006)).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa1 4:8</span></span>

This is a remarkable testimony on the part of the Philistines to the
truth of the events which are recorded in the Pentateuch. The
Philistines would of course hear of them, just as Balak and the people
of Jericho did [Num 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#005); [Jos
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#010).

With all the plagues ... - Rather, "with every kind of plague"
equivalent to "with utter destruction.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa1 4:12</span></span>

Runners who were swift of foot, and could go long distances were
important and well-known persons (compare [Sa2
18:19-31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#019)). There seem to have been
always professional runners to act as messengers with armies in the
field ([Kg2 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#004), [Kg2
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#006),[Kg2
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#019), the King James Version
"guards").

Earth upon his head - In token of bitter grief. Compare the marginal
references.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa1 4:15</span></span>

Dim - Rather, "set." The word is quite different from that so rendered
in [Sa1 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#002). The phrase seems to
express the "fixed" state of the blind eye, which is not affected by the
light. Eli's blindness, while it made him alive to sounds, prevented his
seeing the ripped garments and dust-besprinkled head of the messenger of
bad news.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa1 4:18</span></span>

A comparison of [Sa2 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#004), explains
exactly the meaning of the "side of the gate," and Eli's position. His
seat or throne, without a back, stood with the side against the jamb of
the gate, leaving the passage through the gate quite clear, but placed
so that every one passing through the gate must pass in front of him.

Forty years - This chronological note connects this book with that of
Judges. (Compare [Jdg 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#011), etc.) It
is an interesting question, but one very difficult to answer how near to
the death of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar the High Priest, Eli's forty
years of judgeship bring him. It is probable that at least one high
priesthood intervened.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa1 4:21</span></span>

Is departed - Properly, "Is gone into captivity."

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">sa1 4:22</span></span>

The lesson of the ruin brought upon Churches by the covetousness and
profligacy of their priests, which is here taught us so forcibly, and
which has been again and again illustrated in Jews and Christians, is
too solemn and important to be overlooked. When the glory of holiness
departs from what should be a holy community, the glory of God's
presence has already departed, and the outward tokens of His protection
may be expected to depart soon likewise. (Compare [Eze
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#018); [Eze
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#023); [Rev
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#005).) But though particular
congregations may fall, our Lord's promise will never fail his people
[Mat 28:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#020).
