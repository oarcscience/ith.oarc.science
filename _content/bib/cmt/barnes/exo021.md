### [Exodus Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#001)

[Exodus 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 21:1</span></span>

Judgments - i. e. decisions of the law.

[Exodus 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">exo 21:2</span></span>

A Hebrew might be sold as a bondman in consequence either of debt [Lev
25:39](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#039) or of the commission of theft
[Exo 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#003). But his servitude could not
be enforced for more than six full years. Compare the marginal
references.

[Exodus 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">exo 21:3</span></span>

If a married man became a bondman, his rights in regard to his wife were
respected: but if a single bondman accepted at the hand of his master a
bondwoman as his wife, the master did not lose his claim to the woman or
her children, at the expiration of the husband's term of service. Such
wives, it may be presumed, were always foreign slaves.

[Exodus 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">exo 21:6</span></span>

Forever - That is, most probably, until the next Jubilee, when every
Hebrew was set free. See [Lev 25:40](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#040),
[Lev 25:50](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#050). The custom of boring the
ear as a mark of slavery appears to have been a common one in ancient
times, observed in many nations.

Unto the judges - Literally, "before the gods אלהים 'ĕlohı̂ym." The word
does not denote "judges" in a direct way, but it is to be understood as
the name of God, in its ordinary plural form, God being the source of
all justice. The name in this connection always has the definite article
prefixed. See the marginal references. Compare [Psa
82:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#001), [Psa
82:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#006); [Joh
10:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#034).

[Exodus 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">exo 21:7</span></span>

A man might, in accordance with existing custom, sell his daughter to
another man with a view to her becoming an inferior wife, or concubine.
In this case, she was not "to go out," like the bondman; that is, she
was not to be dismissed at the end of the sixth year. But women who were
bound in any other way, would appear to have been under the same
conditions as bondmen. See [Deu 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#017).

[Exodus 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">exo 21:11</span></span>

If he do not these three unto her - The words express a choice of one of
three things. The man was to give the woman, whom he had purchased from
her father, her freedom, unless

\(i\) he caused her to be redeemed by a Hebrew master [Exo
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#008); or,

\(ii\) gave her to his son, and treated her as a daughter [Exo
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#009); or,

\(iii\) in the event of his taking another wife [Exo
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#010), unless he allowed her to retain
her place and privileges.

These rules [Exo 21:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#007) are to be
regarded as mitigations of the then existing usages of concubinage.

[Exodus 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">exo 21:12</span></span>

The case of murder of a free man and of a bondman. See [Exo
21:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#020) note. The law was afterward
expressly declared to relate also to foreigners, [Lev
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#017), [Lev
24:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#021); compare the marginal
references.

[Exodus 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">exo 21:13</span></span>

There was no place of safety for the guilty murderer, not even the altar
of Yahweh. Thus all superstitious notions connected with the right of
sanctuary were excluded. Adonijah and Joab [Kg1
1:50](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#050); [Kg1
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#028) appear to have vainly trusted
that the common feeling would protect them, if they took hold of the
horns of the altar on which atonement with blood was made [Lev
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#007). But for one who killed a man "at
unawares," that is, without intending to do it, the law afterward
appointed places of refuge, Num. 35:6-34; [Deu
4:41-43](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#041); [Deu
19:2-10](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#002); [Jos
20:2-9](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#002). It is very probable that there
was some provision answering to the cities of refuge, that may have been
based upon old usage, in the camp in the Wilderness.

[Exodus 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">exo 21:15</span></span>

The following offences were to be punished with death:

Striking a parent, compare [Deu 27:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#016).

Cursing a parent, compare the marginal references.

Kidnapping, whether with a view to retain the person stolen, or to sell
him, compare the marginal references.

[Exodus 21:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">exo 21:19</span></span>

Quit - i. e. if one man injured another in a quarrel so as to oblige him
to keep his bed, he was free from the liability to a criminal charge
(such as might be based upon [Exo
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#012)): but he was required to
compensate the latter for the loss of his time, and for the cost of his
healing.

[Exodus 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">exo 21:20</span></span>

The Jewish authorities appear to be right in referring this law, like
those in [Exo 21:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#026), [Exo
21:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#032), to foreign slaves (see [Lev
25:44-46](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#044)). The protection here
afforded to the life of a slave may seem to us but a slight one; but it
is the very earliest trace of such protection in legislation, and it
stands in strong and favorable contrast with the old laws of Greece,
Rome, and other nations. If the slave survived the castigation a day or
two, the master did not become amenable to the law, because the loss of
the slave was accounted, under the circumstances, as a punishment.

[Exodus 21:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">exo 21:22</span></span>

The rule would seem to refer to a case in which the wife of a man
interfered in a quarrel. This law, "the jus talionis," is elsewhere
repeated in substance, compare the marginal references. and [Gen
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#006). It has its root in a simple
conception of justice, and is found in the laws of many ancient nations.
It serves in this place as a maxim for the magistrate in awarding the
amount of compensation to be paid for the infliction of personal injury.
The sum was to be as nearly as possible the worth in money of the power
lost by the injured person. Our Lord quotes [Exo
21:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#024) as representing the form of the
law, in order to illustrate the distinction between the letter and the
spirit [Mat 5:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#038). The tendency of the
teaching of the Scribes and Pharisees was to confound the obligations of
the conscience with the external requirements of the law. The law, in
its place, was still to be "holy and just and good," [Rom
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#012), but its direct purpose was to
protect the community, not to guide the heart of the believer, who was
not to exact eye for eye, tooth for tooth, but to love his enemies, and
to forgive all injuries.

[Exodus 21:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">exo 21:26</span></span>

Freedom was the proper equivalent for permanent injury.

[Exodus 21:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">exo 21:28</span></span>

The animal was slain as a tribute to the sanctity of human life (Compare
the marginal references and [Gen
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#011)). It was stoned, and its flesh
was treated as carrion. Guilty negligence on the part of its owner was
reckoned a capital offence, to be commuted for a fine.

In the case of a slave, the payment was the standard price of a slave,
thirty shekels of silver. See [Lev
25:44-46](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#044); [Lev
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#003), and the marginal references for
the New Testament application of this fact.

[Exodus 21:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">exo 21:33</span></span>

The usual mode of protecting a well in the East was probably then, as
now, by building round it a low circular wall.

[Exodus 21:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">exo 21:35</span></span>

The dead ox in this case, as well as in the preceding one, must have
been worth no more than the price of the hide, as the flesh could not be
eaten. See [Lev 17:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#001).
