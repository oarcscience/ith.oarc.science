### [1 Chronicles Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#001)

[1 Chronicles 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 11:1</span></span>

This chapter runs parallel with 2 Sam. 5 as far as [Ch1
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#009), after which it is to be compared
with 2 Sam. 23:8-39 as far as [Ch1
11:40](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#040), the remainder [Ch1
11:41-47](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#041) being an addition, to which
Samuel has nothing corresponding. Compare throughout the notes in
Samuel.

[1 Chronicles 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 11:6</span></span>

The narrative here given fills out a manifest defect in [Sa2
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#008) where something has evidently
dropped out of the text.

The prowess of Joab on this occasion, and the part which he took in the
building of the city of David [Ch1
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#008), are known to us only from this
passage of Chronicles.

[1 Chronicles 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch1 11:10</span></span>

Strengthened themselves - Or "exerted themselves" - "strenuously
assisted with all Israel in making David king." This list of David's
principal heroes belongs, therefore, to his reign at Hebron. In Samuel
the list is not given until nearly the end of David's reign 2 Sam.
23:8-39.

[1 Chronicles 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch1 11:11</span></span>

Chief of the captains - Or, "of the thirty," according to another and
better reading (see [Ch1 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#015), [Ch1
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#025); compare [Sa2
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#008) note). Jashobeam was the
commander of the first monthly course of 24,090 soldiers [Ch1
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#002). He is probably the warrior of
the name who joined David at Ziklag [Ch1
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#006).

[1 Chronicles 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch1 11:13</span></span>

Compare this passage with [Sa2
23:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#009).

Barley - In [Sa2 23:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#011), "lentiles."
The words for barley and lentils are so similar in the Hebrew that we
may fairly explain the diversity by an accidental corruption.

[1 Chronicles 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ch1 11:23</span></span>

Five cubits high - About 7 ft. 6 in. high. The height is not so great as
that recorded of other giants.

[1 Chronicles 11:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">ch1 11:26</span></span>

etc. The list of names here given corresponds generally with that in 2
Sam. 23:24-39, but presents several remarkable differences.

\(1\) the number in Chronicles is 47; the number in Samuel is 31.

\(2\) Four names in the list of Chronicles are not in Samuel.

\(3\) five names in Samuel are not in Chronicles.

\(4\) many of the other names, both personal and local, vary in the two
lists.

It is quite possible that the two lists varied to some extent
originally. The writer of Chronicles distinctly states that he gives the
list as it stood at the time of David's becoming king over all Israel
[Ch1 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#010). The writer of Samuel does
not assign his list to any definite period of David's reign, but
probably delivers it to us as it was constituted at a later date. It is
quite possible therefore that the names which occur only in Chronicles
are those of persons who had died or quitted the army before the other
list was made out, and that the new names in Samuel are the names of
those who had taken their places. See the [Sa2
23:39](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#039) note.

[1 Chronicles 11:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">ch1 11:34</span></span>

The sons of Hashem - It is impossible that this can be the true reading,
since an individual warrior must be spoken of. Comparing [Sa2
23:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#032), perhaps the most probable
conjecture is that the "Beni-Hashem" of Chronicles and the "Beni Jashen"
of Samuel alike conceal some single name of a man which cannot now be
recovered.
