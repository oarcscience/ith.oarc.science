### [Ezekiel Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#001)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 14:0</span></span>

This prophecy [Eze 14:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#001) is a
reproof of those who consult the false prophets. Some of the chief
exiles come to Ezekiel as to one who has authority; but he, endowed with
the genuine prophetic spirit, sees deep into their hearts, and finds the
idols of self-will and unsubmissiveness set up therein. The prophet
warns them that God will not be inquired of in such a spirit as this.

[Ezekiel 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 14:1</span></span>

Elders of Israel - Some of the fellow-exiles of Ezekiel, among whom he
ministered.

[Ezekiel 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 14:4</span></span>

Omit "that cometh."

According to the multitiude of his idols - i. e., I will give him an
answer as delusive as the idols which he serves. Compare Micaiah's
answer to Ahab [Kg1 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#015).

[Ezekiel 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 14:5</span></span>

That I may take ... - i. e., that I may take them, as in a snare,
deceived by their own heart.

[Ezekiel 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 14:7</span></span>

The stranger - They who sojourned among Israel, though they were not of
Israel, were bound to abstain from idol-worship [Lev
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#010); [Lev
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#002).

By myself - Or, as in [Eze 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#004),
"according to" Myself. He who comes to inquire with a heart full of
idolatry shall have his answer,

\(1\) "according to the multitude of his idols" - in delusion,

\(2\) "according to the holiness of God" - in punishment.

The inquiry was hypocritical and unreal - but God will answer not by the
mouth, but by the hand, not by word but by deed, not by speech but by a
scourge.

[Ezekiel 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 14:8</span></span>

Will make him - Or, I will make him amazed [Eze
32:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#010); or, astonished, so as to be a
sign and a proverb.

[Ezekiel 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 14:9</span></span>

I the Lord hare deceived that prophet - A deep truth lies beneath these
words, namely, that evil as well as good is under God's direction. He
turns it as He will, employing it to test the sincerity of men, and thus
making it ultimately contribute to the purification of His people, to
the confirmation of the righteous, to the increase of their glory and
felicity. The case of the false prophets who deceived Ahab 1 Kings 22 is
a striking representation of this principle. The Lord sends forth an
evil spirit to persuade Ahab to his ruin. Toward the close of the
kingdom of Judah false prophets were especially rife. The thoughts of
men's hearts were revealed, the good separated from the bad, and the
remnant of the people purged from the sins by which of late years the
whole nation had been defiled.

[Ezekiel 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 14:11</span></span>

"God," it has been said, "punishes sins by means of sins," but the end
is the re-establishment of righteousness.

[Ezekiel 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 14:12</span></span>

Jer. 14; 15 is a remarkable parallel to this prophecy. Here, as
elsewhere, Ezekiel is commissioned to deliver to the exiles the same
message which Jeremiah conveys to the inhabitants of Judaea. The answer
discovers the nature of the questions which had been expressed or
implied.

\(1\) Can God cast out a people who are holy unto Himself?

\(2\) Is it just to punish them with utter desolation?

The prophet answers:

\(1\) That when a people is so corrupt as to call down national
judgment, individual piety shall save none but the individuals
themselves.

\(2\) The corrupt condition of the people shall be made so manifest,
that none will question the justice of God in dealing thus severely with
them.

[Eze 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#012)

Or, "When a land" - the case is first put in a general form, and then
ism brought with increased force home to Jerusalem - "sinneth against me
by trespassing grievously," and I stretch out "mine hand upon it," and
break the staff of bread "thereof," and send famine "upon it and" cut
off "man and beast: though these three men" etc.

[Eze 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#014)

Noah, Daniel, and Job - Three striking instances of men who, for their
integrity, were delivered from the ruin which fell upon others. Some
have thought it strange that Daniel, a contemporary, and still young,
should have been classed with the two ancient worthies. But the account
of him Dan. 2 shows, that by this time Daniel was a very remarkable man
(compare [Eze 28:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#003)), and the
introduction of the name of a contemporary gives force and life to the
illustration. There is in the order in which the names occur a kind of
climax. Noah did not rescue the guilty world, but did carry forth with
him his wife, sons, and sons' wives. Daniel raised only a few, but he
did raise three of his countrymen with him to honor. To Job was spared
neither son nor daughter.

[Eze 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#022), [Eze
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#023)

Ye shall be comforted ... - By a truer estimate of the dispensations of
the Almighty. This visitation will be recognized as inevitable and just.
