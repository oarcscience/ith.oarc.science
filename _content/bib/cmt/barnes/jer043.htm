<p>These captains belonged to the party who had all along resisted Jeremiah's counsels, and had led Zedekiah astray. Now however that events had proved that the prophet's counsels had been wise and true, they cannot for shame find fault with him, but they affirm that he is under the influence of Baruch, a traitor who has sold himself to the Chaldaeans, and seeks only the hurt of the people.

<p>All the people - Many, nevertheless, would be unwilling agents, compelled to do what their unscrupulous leaders forced upon the community. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#005">Jeremiah 43:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">jer 43:5</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>All the remnant of Judah that were returned - In this way, the utter depopulation of the land was completed. Thus was fulfilled the predictions of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#008">Jer 24:8-10</A>, and the sole hope of the nation now centered in the exiles at Babylon <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#005">Jer 24:5-7</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#007">Jeremiah 43:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">jer 43:7</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Tahpanhes - See the <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#016">Jer 2:16</A> note. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#008">Jeremiah 43:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">jer 43:8</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>On arriving at the frontiers of Egypt, the captains would be compelled to halt in order to obtain the king's permission to enter his country. Jeremiah therefore takes the opportunity to predict, first, the downfall of Egypt; and secondly, that of the false gods. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#009">Jeremiah 43:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">jer 43:9</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Brickkiln - Possibly, a pavement of brick. Jeremiah was to take a few large stones, such, nevertheless, as he could carry in his hand, and build with them, in the propylaea before the royal palace, something that would serve to represent the dais upon which the seat of kings was usually placed. By hiding them in the clay is meant plastering them over with mortar. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#010">Jeremiah 43:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">jer 43:10</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>My servant - See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#009">Jer 25:9</A> note.
<p>That I have hid - i. e., that I have embedded in the mortar by the instrumentality of my prophet.
<p>Pavilion - Rather, canopy. It probably means the parasol held over kings, which had a tall and thick pole, grasped with both hands, and in the early times a somewhat small circular top. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#011">Jeremiah 43:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">jer 43:11</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>According to each man's destiny, he will either die of famine, pestilence, or in battle; or he will be led captive; or be put to death by the executioner. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#012">Jeremiah 43:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">jer 43:12</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>I will kindle - Or, "he shall kindle."
<p>He shall burn them ... - i. e., he shall burn the temples, and carry away the gods.
<p>And he shall array - literally, "And he shall wrap himself in the land of Egypt as the shepherd wrappeth himself in his cloak, and shall (go forth thence in peace;" i. e., With as great ease as a shepherd throws his cloak round him when going forth to watch his flock by night in the field, so easily shall the king of Babylon take possession of all the glory of Egypt, throw it round him, and depart without anyone resisting his progress.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">jer 43:13</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Images - Rather, pillars (compare the <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#019">Isa 19:19</A> note), obelisks.
<p>Beth-shemesh - Heliopolis, famous for its obelisks.
