### [Numbers Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#001)

[Numbers 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 5:1</span></span>

The general purpose of the directions given in this and the next chapter
is to attest and to vindicate, by modes in harmony with the spirit of
the theocratical law, the sanctity of the people of God. Thus, the
congregation of Israel was made to typify the Church of God, within
which, in its perfection, nothing that offends can be allowed to remain
(compare [Mat 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#022); [Rev
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#027)).

Compare the marginal references. The precepts of Lev. 13 and Lev. 15 are
now first fully carried out. They could hardly have been so earlier,
during the hurry and confusion which must have attended the march out of
Egypt, and the encampments which next followed.

[Numbers 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">num 5:5</span></span>

The law of restitution: a passage supplementary to [Lev
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#005), etc., [Lev
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#005), etc.

[Num 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#007)

Recompense his trespass - i. e. make restitution to the person whom he
has injured.

[Num 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#008)

Whereby an atonement shall be made for him - literally, "which shall
clear him of guilt as to it," i. e. as to the trespass.

[Num 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#010)

And every man's hallowed things shall be his - i. e. the priest's. The
heave offerings [Num 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#009) and
dedicatory offerings (e. g. first-fruits) were to be the perquisite of
the officiating priests.

[Numbers 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">num 5:11</span></span>

The trial of jealousy. Since the crime of adultery is especially
defiling and destructive of the very foundations of social order, the
whole subject is dealt with at a length proportionate to its importance.
The process prescribed has lately been strikingly illustrated from an
Egyptian "romance," which refers to the time of Rameses the Great, and
may therefore well serve to illustrate the manners and customs of the
Mosaic times. This mode of trial, like several other ordinances, was
adopted by Moses from existing and probably very ancient and widely
spread institutions.

[Num 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#015)

The offering was to be of the cheapest and coarsest kind, barley
(compare [Kg2 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#001), [Kg2
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#016), [Kg2
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#018)), representing the abused
condition of the suspected woman. It was, like the sin-offering [Lev
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#011), to be made without oil and
frankincense, the symbols of grace and acceptableness. The woman herself
stood with head uncovered [Num 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#018),
in token of her shame.

[Num 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#017)

The dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle - To set forth the fact
that the water was endued with extraordinary power by Him who dwelt in
the tabernacle. Dust is an emblem of a state of condemnation [Gen
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#014); [Mic
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#017).

[Num 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#019)

Gone aside ... - literally, "gone astray from" thy husband by
uncleanness; compare [Hos 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#012).

[Num 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#023)

Blot them out with the bitter water - In order to transfer the curses to
the water. The action was symbolic. Travelers speak of the natives of
Africa as still habitually seeking to obtain the full force of a written
charm by drinking the water into which they have washed it.

[Num 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#024)

Shall cause the woman to drink - Thus was symbolised both her full
acceptance of the hypothetical curse (compare [Eze
3:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#001); [Jer
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#016); [Rev
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#009)), and its actual operation upon
her if she should be guilty (compare [Psa
109:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#018)).

[Num 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#026)

The memorial thereof - See the marginal reference. "Memorial" here is
not the same as "memorial" in [Num
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#015).

[Num 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#027)

Of itself, the drink was not noxious; and could only produce the effects
here described by a special interposition of God. We do not read of any
instance in which this ordeal was resorted to: a fact which may be
explained either (with the Jews) as a proof of its efficacy, since the
guilty could not be brought to face its terrors at all, and avoided them
by confession; or more probably by the license of divorce tolerated by
the law of Moses. Since a husband could put away his wife at pleasure, a
jealous man would naturally prefer to take this course with a suspected
wife rather than to call public attention to his own shame by having
recourse to the trial of jealousy. The trial by red water, which bears a
general resemblance to that here prescribed by Moses, is still in use
among the tribes of Western Africa.
