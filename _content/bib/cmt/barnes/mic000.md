Introduction to Micah

"Micah," or "Micaiah," this Morasthite, was so called, probably, in
order to distinguish him from his great predecessor, Micaiah, son of
Imlah, in the reign of Ahab. His name was spoken in its fuller form, by
the elders of the land whose words Jeremiah has preserved. And in that
fuller form his name is known, where the Greek and Latin translations of
the Scriptures are used. By the Syrians, and by the Jews he is still
called "Micah," as by us. The fullest and original form is "Micaiahu,"
"who is like the Lord?" In this fullest form, it is the name of one of
the Levites sent by Jehoshaphat to teach the people [Ch2
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#007), as also of the mother of King
Asa [Ch2 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#002) (the same name serving
sometimes both for men and women). Then, according to the habit of
abridging names, in all countries, and especially those of which the
proper name of the Lord is a part, it is diversely abridged into
"Micaihu," "Micahu" , whence Micah is readily formed, on the same rule
as "Micaiah" itself from "Micaiahu." The forms are all found
indifferently. The idolatrous Levite in the time of the Judges , are
both called in the same chapter "Micaihu" and "Micah"; the father of one
of Josiah's officers is called "Micaiah" in the Book of Kings [Kg2
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#012), and "Micah" in the Book of
Chronicles [Ch2 34:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#020).

The prophet's name, like those of Joshua, Elijah, Elisha, Hosea, Joel,
Obadiah, was significant. We know that Joshua's name was changed for a
set purpose [Num 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#016). The rest seem
to have been given in God's Providence, or taken by the prophets, in
order to enunciate truths concerning God, opposed to the idolatries or
self-dependence of the people. But the name of "Micah" or "Micaiah," (as
"the elders of the land" [Jer 26:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#017)
called him on a solemn occasion, some 120 years afterward) contained
more than teaching. It was cast into the form of a challenge. "Who is
like the Lord?" The form of words had been impressed upon Israel by the
song of Moses after the deliverance at the Red Sea [Exo
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#011). In the days of Elijah and that
first Micaiah, the strife between God and man, the true prophet and the
false prophet, had been ended at the battle of Ramoth-Gilead; it ceased
for a time, in the reigns of Jehu and his successors, because, in
consequence of his partial obedience, God, by Elisha and Jonah, promised
them good: it was again resumed, as the promise to Jehu was expiring,
and God's prophets had anew to proclaim a message of woe. "Hast thou
found me, O mine enemy?" [Kg1 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#020),
and "I hate him, for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil"
[Kg1 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#008), [Kg1
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#018), Ahab's words as to Elijah and
Micaiah, were the types of the subsequent contradiction of the false
prophets to Hosea and Amos, which closed only with the destruction of
Samaria. Now, in the time of the later Micaiah, were the first dawnings
of the same strife in Judah, which hastened and brought about the
destruction of Jerusalem under Zedekiah, which re-appeared after the
Captivity [Neh 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#014), and was the
immediate cause of the second destruction under the Romans. Micah, as he
dwells on the meaning of names generally, so, doubtless, it is in
allusion to his own name, that, at the close of his prophecy, he ushers
in his announcement of God's incomparable mercy with the words [Mic
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#018), "Who is a God like unto Thee?"
Before him, whatever disobedience there was to God's law in Judah, there
was no systematic, organized, opposition to His prophets.

There is no token of it in Joel. From the times of Micah it is never
missing. We find it in each prophet (however brief the remains of some
are), who prophesied directly to Judah, not in Isaiah only, but in
Habakkuk [Hab 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#005); [Hab
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#001) and Zephaniah [Zep
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#012). It deepened, as it hastened
toward its decision. The nearer God's judgments were at hand, the more
obstinately the false prophets denied that they would come. The system
of false prophecy, which rose to its height in the time of Jeremiah,
which met and thwarted him at every step (see [Jer
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#013), [Jer
5:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#031); [Jer
6:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#013); [Jer
8:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#010); [Jer
14:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#013); [Jer
20:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#001); [Jer
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#009) ff; [Jer
26:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#007), [Jer
26:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#011); [Jer
27:14-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#014); 28; [Jer
29:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#008), [Jer
29:21-32](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#021)), and deceived those who
wished to be deceived, was dawning in the time of Micah. False prophecy
arose in Judah from the selfsame cause whence it had arisen in Israel,
because Judah's deepening corruption drew down the prophecies of God's
displeasure, which it was popular to disbelieve. False prophecy was a
gainful occupation. The false prophets had men's wishes on their side.
They had the people with them. "My people love to have it so" [Jer
5:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#031), said God. They forbade Micah to
prophesy [Mic 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#006); prophesied peace
[Mic 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#005), when God foretold evil;
prophesied for gain [Mic 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#011), and
proclaimed war in the Name of God (see the note at [Mic
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#005)) against those who fed them not.

Micah was called at such a time. His name which he himself explains, was
no chance name. To the Hebrews, to whom names were so much more
significant, parts of the living language, it recalled the name of his
great predecessor - his standing alone against all the prophets of Ahab,
his prophecy, his suffering, his evidenced truth. The truth of prophecy
was set upon the issue of the battle before Ramoth-Gilead. In the
presence of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, as well as of Ahab, the 400
prophets of Ashtaroth had promised to Ahab the prize he longed for. One
solitary, discriminating voice was heard amid that clamorous multitude,
forewarning Ahab that he would perish, his people would be scattered. On
the one side, was that loud triumphant chorus of "all the prophets, Go
up to Ramoth-Gilead, and prosper; for the Lord shall deliver it into the
king's hand" [Kg1 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#012). On the other,
one solemn voice, exhibiting before them that sad spectacle which the
morrow's sun should witness, "I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills,
as sheep that have not a shepherd, and the Lord said, these have no
master, let them return every man to his house in peace" [Kg1
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#017).

Micaiah was struck, imprisoned, and, apparently, ended his ministry,
appealing from that small audience of the armies of Israel and Judah to
the whole world, which has ever since looked back upon that strife with
interest and awe; "Hear ye peoples, each one of them [Kg1
22:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#028). God, who guided the archer
shooting at a venture [Kg1 22:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#034),
fulfilled the words which He had put into the prophet's mouth. God's
words had found Ahab, although disguised. Jehoshaphat, the imperiled
[Kg1 22:30-33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#030), returned home, to
relate the issue. The conflict between God's truth and idol falsehood
was doubtless long remembered in Judah. And now when the strife had
penetrated into Judah, to be ended some 170 years afterward in the
destruction of Jerusalem, another Micaiah arose, his name the old
watchword, "Who is like the Lord?" He prefixed to his prophecy that same
summons to the whole world to behold the issue of the conflict, which
God had once accredited and, in that issue, had given an earnest of the
victory of His truth, there thenceforth and forever.

The prophet was born a villager, in Moresheth Gath, "a village" , Jerome
says; ("a little village" , in Jerome's own days), "East of
Eleutheropolis," where what was " formerly his grave," was "now a
church." Since it was his birthplace and his burial-place, it was
probably his home also. In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim, "the
elders of the land" [Jer 26:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#017)
speak of him with this same title, "the Morasthite." He lingers, in his
prophecy, among the towns of the maritime plain (the Shephelah) where
his birthplace lay. Among the ten places in that neighborhood [Mic
1:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#011), which he selects for warning
and for example of the universal captivity, is his native village, "the
home he loved." But the chief scene of his ministry was Jerusalem. He
names it in the beginning of his prophecy, as the place where the
idolatries, and, with the idolatries, all the other sins of Judah were
concentrated.

The two capitals, Samaria and Jerusalem, were the chief objects of the
word of God to him, because the corruption of each kingdom streamed
forth from them. The sins which he rebukes are chiefly those of the
capital. Extreme oppression [Mic
3:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#002); [Mic
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#002), violence among the rich [Mic
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#012), bribing among judges, priests,
prophets ([Mic 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#011); judges and
priests, [Mic 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#003)); building up the
capital even by cost of life, or actual bloodshed ([Mic
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#010); bloodshed also, [Mic
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#002)); spoilation [Mic
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#008); expulsion of the powerless, women
and children from their homes [Mic
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#009); covetousness [Mic
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#002); cheating in dealings [Mic
6:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#010); pride [Mic
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#003). These, of course, may be
manifoldly repeated in lesser places of resort and of judgment. But it
is "Zion and Jerusalem" which are so built up with blood ([Mic
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#010); bloodshed also, [Mic
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#002)); Zion and Jerusalem, which are,
on that ground, to be "plowed as a field" [Mic
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#012); it is "the city" to which "the
Lord's voice crieth" [Mic 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#009); whose
"rich men are full of violence" [Mic
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#012); it is the "daughter of Zion"
[Mic 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#010), which is to "go forth out
of the city and go to Babylon." Especially, they are the heads and
princes of the people [Mic 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#001), [Mic
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#009), [Mic
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#011); [Mic
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#012); [Mic
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#003), whom he upbraids for perversion
of justice and for oppression. Even the good kings of Judah seem to have
been powerless to restrain the general corruption.

Micah, according to the title which he prefixed to his prophecy, was
called to his prophetic function somewhat later than Isaiah. His
ministry began later, and ended earlier. For Uzziah, in whose reign
Isaiah began to prophesy, was dead before Micah was called to his
office; and Micah probably was called away early in the reign of
Hezekiah, whereas some of the chief public acts of Isaiah's ministry
fell in the 17th and 18th years of the reign of Hezekiah. Joel, Amos,
Obadiah, Jonah, had doubtless been withdrawn to their rest. Hosea alone,
in "grey-haired might," was still protesting in vain against the
deepening corruptions of Israel (to the north).

The contents of Micah's prophecy and his relation to Isaiah agree with
the inscription. His prophecy has indications of the times of Jotham,
perhaps also of those of Ahaz. We know historically that one signal
prophecy, was uttered in the reign of Hezekiah.

It is now accepted by almost everyone that the great prophecy (three
verses of which Isaiah prefixed to Isa. 2) was originally delivered by
Micah. But it appears from the context in Isaiah, that Isaiah delivered
the prophecy in his second chapter, in the reign of Jotham. Other
language of Micah also belongs to that same reign. No one now thinks
that Micah adopted that great prophecy from Isaiah. The prophecy, as it
stands in Micah, is in close connection with what precedes it. He had
said, "the mountain of the house shall be as the high places of the
forest" [Mic 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#012); he subjoins
instantly God's reversal of that sentence, "in the latter days." "And in
the last days it shall be that the mountain of the house of the Lord
shall be established on the top of the mountains, and peoples shall flow
unto it" [Mic 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#001). He had said, "Zion
shall be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps;" he adds
immediately, in reversal of this, "the law shall go forth frown Zion,
and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem" [Mic
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#002). The two sentences are joined as
closely as they can be; "Zion, shall be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem
shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house shall become high
places of a forest; and it shall be, in the last days, the mountain of
the house of the Lord shall be (abidingly) established on the top of the
mountains." Every reader would understand, that the elevation intended,
was spiritual, not physical. They could not fail to understand the
metaphor; or imagine that the Mount Zion, on part of which, (Mount
Moriah,) "the house of the Lord" stood, should be physically placed on
other hills. But the contrast is marked. The premise is the sequel of
the woe; the abiding condition is the reversal of the sentence of its
desolation. Even the words allude, the one to the other.

In Isaiah, there is no such connection. After the first chapter and its
summary of rebuke, warning, threatening, and final weal or woe resting
on each class, Isaiah begins his prophecy anew with a fresh title; "The
word that Isaiah the son of Amos saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem"
[Isa 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#001); and to this he prefixes
three verses from Micah's prophecy. He separates it in a marked way from
the preceding summary, and yet connects it with some other prophecy by
the word, "And" [Isa 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002). He himself
marks that it is not in its original place here. So then, in the prophet
Micah, the close connection with the foregoing marks that it is in its
original place; Isaiah marked purposely that in his prophecy it is not.

But Isaiah's prophecy belongs to a time of prosperity; such as Judah had
not, after the reign of Jotham. It was a time of great war-like
strength, diffused through the whole land. The land was full [Isa
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#007), [Isa
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#011), without end, of gold, silver,
chariots, horses, of lofty looks and haughtiness. The images which
follow [Isa 2:12-21](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#012) are shadows of the
Day of Judgment, and extend beyond Judah; but the sins rebuked are the
sins of strength and might, self-confidence, oppression, manifold female
luxury and bravery [Isa 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#016), [Isa
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#023). Isaiah prophesies that God would
take away their strength [Isa 3:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#001).
They still had it then. At that time, Judah did not trust in God or in
foreign alliances, but only in themselves. Yet, from the time of Ahaz,
trust in foreign help infected them to the end. Even Hezekiah, when he
received the messengers of Merodach-baladan [Isa
39:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#001), fell into the snare; and
Josiah probably lost his life as a vassal of Assyria [Kg2
23:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#029); [Ch2
35:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#020). This union of inherent
strength and unconcernedness about foreign aid is an adequate test of
days prior to Ahaz.

But since Isaiah prefixed to a prophecy in the days of Jotham this great
prophecy of Micah, then Micah's prophecy must have been already current.
To those same days of strength it belongs, that Micah could prophesy as
a gift, the cutting off [Mic 5:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#010),
[Mic 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#014) of "horses and chariots,"
the destruction "of cities" and "strong towers," all, in which Judah
trusted instead of God. The prophecy is a counterpart of Isaiah's.
Isaiah prophesied a day of Judgment, in which all these things would be
removed; Micah foretold that their removal would be a mercy to those who
trust in Christ.

On the other hand, the utter dislocation of society, the bursting of all
the most sacred bands which bind man to man together, described in his
last chapter [Isa 7:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#005), perhaps
belong most to the miserable decay in the reign of Ahaz. The idolatry
spoken of also belongs probably to the time of Ahaz. In Jotham's time
[Kg2 15:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#035), "the people sacrificed and
burned incense still in the high places;" yet, under a king so highly
praised [Kg2 15:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#034); [Ch2
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#002), [Ch2
27:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#006), these are not likely to have
been in Jerusalem. But Micah, in the very head of his prophecy, speaks
of Jerusalem [Mic 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#005) as the center of
the idolatries of Judah. The allusion also to child-sacrifices belongs
to the time of Ahaz, who sacrificed sons of his own [Kg2
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#003); [Ch2
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#003), and whose sacrifice others
probably imitated. The mention of the special idolatry of the time, "the
statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab" [Mic
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#016), belong to the same reign, it
being recorded of Ahaz especially, "he walked in the ways of the kings
of Israel and made also molten images for Baalim" [Ch2
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#002); the special sin of the house of
Ahab. That charactor too which he describes, that, amid all that
idolatry, practical irreligion, and wickedness, they "leant upon the
Lord, and said, Is not the Lord among us? None evil can come upon us"
[Mic 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#011); [Mic
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#006); was just the character of Ahaz.
Not until the end of his reign was he so embittered by God's
chastisements, that he closed His temple [Ch2
28:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#022).

Up to that time, even after he had copied the Brazen Altar at Damascus,
he still kept up a divided allegiance to God. Urijah, the high Priest,
at the king's command, offered the sacrifices for the king and the
people, while Ahaz used "the brazen altar, to enquire by" [Kg2
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#015). This was just the half-service
which God by Micah rejects. It is the old history of man's half-service,
faith without love, which provides that what it believes but loves not
should be done for it, and itself enacts what it prefers. Urijah was to
offer the lawful sacrifices for the king and the people; Ahaz was to
obtain knowledge of the future, such as he wished in his own way, a
lying future, by lying acts.

Micah renewed under Hezekiah the prophecy of the utter destruction of
Jerusalem, which he had pronounced under Jotham. The prophets did not
heed repeating themselves. Eloquent as they were, they are the more
eloquent because eloquence was not their object. Even our Lord Jesus,
with divine wisdom, and the more, probably, because He had divine
wisdom, repeated in His teaching the same words. Those words sank the
deeper, because they were repeated so often. So Micah repeated doubtless
oftentimes those words, which he first uttered in the days of Jotham;
"Zion shall be plowed like a field and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and
the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest." Often,
perhaps during those 30 years or so, he repeated them in vain. At the
last, they brought about a great repentance, and delayed, it may be for
136 years, the destruction which he was constrained to foretell. Early
in the days of Jehoiakim, about 120 years afterward, in the public
assembly when Jeremiah was on trial for his life, "the elder's of the
land said explicitly, that the great conversion at the beginning of the
reign of Hezekiah, nay, of that king himself, was wrought by the
teaching of Micah." "Then rose up, says Jeremiah, certain of the elders
of the land, and spake to all the assembly of the people, saying, Micah
the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, saying,
Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Zion shall be plowed like a field, and
Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house, as the high
places of the forest. Did Hezekiah king of Judah, and all Judah, put him
at all to death? Did he not fear the Lord, and besought the Lord, and
the Lord repented Him of the evil which He had pronounced against them?"
[Jer 26:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#017).

It may have been that single prophecy which Micah so delivered; some
have thought that it was his whole book. Jeremiah, at God's command, at
one time uttered single prophecies; at another, the summary of all his
prophecies. This only is certain, that the prophecy, whether these words
alone or the book containing them, was delivered to all Judah, and that
God moved the people through them to repentance.

The words, as they occur in Jeremiah, are the same, and in the same
order, as they stand in Micah. Only in Jeremiah the common plural
termination is substituted for the rarer and poetic form used by Micah.
The elders, then, who quoted them, probably knew them, not from
tradition, but from the written book of the prophet Micah. But those
elders speak of Micah, as exercising his prophetic function in the days
of Hezekiah. They do not say, "he prophesied," which might have been a
single act; but "he was prophesying,"נבא היה hâyâh nâbâ', a form of
speaking which is only used of an abiding, habitual, action. They say
also, "he was habitually prophesying, and he said," i. e., as we should
say, "in the course of his prophesying in the days of Hezekiah, he
said." Still it was "to all the people of Judah" that he said it. The
elders say so, and lay stress upon it by repeating it. "Did Hezekiah
king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to death?" It must have been
then on some of the great festivals, when "all Judah" was gathered
together, that Micah so spoke to them.

Probably, shortly afterward, in those first years of Hezekiah, Micah's
function on earth closed. For, at the outset and in the summary of his
prophecy, not incidentally, he speaks of the destruction of Samaria,
which took place in the 4th year of Hezekiah, as still to come; and
however practical or partial idolatry continued, such idolatry as he
throughout describes, did not exist after the reformation by Hezekiah.
This conversion, then, of the king and of some considerable part of
Judah was probably the closing harvest of his life, after a long
seed-time of tears. So God allowed His servant Micah to "depart in
peace." The reformation itself, at least in its fullness, took place
after the kingdom of Samaria had come to an end, since Hezekiah's
messengers could, unhindered, invite all Israel to join in his great
Passover. Probably, then, Micah lived to see the first dawnings only of
the first reformation which God wrought by his words.

At the commencement, then, of Hezekiah's reign he collected the
substance of what God had taught by him, re-casting it, so to speak, and
retaining of his spoken prophecy so much as God willed to remain for us.
As it stands, it belongs to that early time of Hezekiah's reign, in
which the sins of Ahaz still lived on. Corruption of manners had been
hereditary. In Jotham's reign too, it is said expressly, in contrast
with himself, "the people were still doing corruptly" [Ch2
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#002). Idolatry had, under Ahaz,
received a fanatic impulse from the king, who, at last, set himself to
close the worship of God [Ch2
28:22-25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#022); [Ch2
29:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#007). The strength of Jotham's reign
was gone; the yearning for its restoration led to the wrong and
destructive policy, against which Isaiah had to contend. Of this Micah
says, such should not be the strength of the future kingdom of God.
Idolatry and oppression lived on; against these, the inheritance of
those former reigns, the sole remainder of Jotham's might or Ahaz'
policy, the breach of the law of love of God and man, Micah concentrated
his written prophecy.

This book also has remarkable symmetry. Each of its three divisions is a
whole, beginning with upbraiding for sin, threatening God's judgments,
and ending with promises of future mercy Christ. The two later divisions
begin again with that same characteristic, "Hear ye" Mic. 3-7, with
which Micah had opened the whole. The three divisions are also
connected, as well by lesser references of the later to the former, as
also by the advance of the prophecy. Judah could not be trusted now with
any simple declaration of God's future mercy. They supposed themselves,
impenitent as they were and with no purpose of repentance, to be the
objects of God's care, and secure from evil. Unmixed promise of good
would but foment this irreligious apathy. Hence, on the promises at the
end of the first portion, "and their king shall pass before them and the
Lord at the head of them" [Mic 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#012),
he turns abruptly, "And I said, Hear, I pray you, Is it not for you to
know judgement?" [Mic 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#001). The promise
had been to "Jacob and the remnant of Israel" [Mic
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#012). He renews his summons to the
"heads of Jacob" [Mic 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#001) and the
"princes of the house of Israel." In like way, the last section, opening
with that wonderful pleading of God with His people, follows upon that
unbroken declaration of God's mercies, which itself issues out of the
promised Birth at Bethlehem.

There is also a sort of progress in the promises of the three parts . In
the first, it is of deliverance generally, in language taken from that
first deliverance from Egypt. The second is objective, the Birth of the
Redeemer, the conversion of the Gentiles, the restoration of the Jews,
the establishment and nature of His kingdom. The third is mainly
subjective man's repentance, waiting upon God, and God's forgiveness of
his sins.

Throughout, the metropolis is chiefly addressed, as the main seat of
present evil and as the center of the future blessings; where the reign
of the long-promised Ruler should be [Mic
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#002), [Mic
4:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#007); whence the revelation of God
should go forth to the heathen [Mic
4:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#001); whither the scattered and
dispersed people should be gathered [Mic
4:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#006); [Mic
7:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#011).

Throughout the prophecy also, Micah upbraids the same class of sins,
wrong dealing of man to man, oppression of the poor by the rich.
Throughout, their future captivity and dispersion are either predicted ,
or assumed as the basis of the prediction of good [Mic
2:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#012); [Mic
4:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#006), [Mic
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#010); [Mic
7:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#011), [Mic
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#015). Throughout, we see the
contemporary of the prophet Isaiah. Beside that great prediction, which
Isaiah inserted verbally from Micah, we see them, as it were, side by
side, in that city of God's visitation and of His mercy, prophesying the
same respite, the same place of captivity and deliverance from it, the
same ulterior mercies in Christ. : "The more to establish the faith, God
willed that Isaiah and Micah should speak together, as with one mouth,
and use such agreement as might the more convict all rebels."

Assyria was then the monarchy of the world; yet both prophets promise
deliverance from it [Isa 10:24-34](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#024);
[Isa 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#025); [Isa
30:31](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#031); [Isa
31:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#008); [Isa
37:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#006), [Isa
37:21-35](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#021); [Mic
5:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#005); both foretell the captivity in
the then subordinate Babylon [Isa
39:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#006); [Mic
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#010); both, the deliverance from it
[Isa 48:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#020); [Mic
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#010). Both speak in the like way of
the gathering together of God's people from lands ([Isa
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#011) following; [Mic
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#012)), to some of which they were not
yet dispersed. Isaiah prophesied the Virgin-Birth of Immanuel [Isa
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014); Micah, the Birth at Bethlehem of
Him "Whose goings fourth have been of old, from everlasting" ([Mic
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#002) English ([Mic
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#001) in Hebrew)). Both speak in the
like way of the reverence for the Gentiles thereafter for her , by
reason of the presence of her God. Even, in outward manner, Micah,
representing himself, as one who "went mourning and wailing, stripped
and naked" ([Mic 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#008), see note), is a
sort of forerunner of the symbolic acts of Isaiah ([Isa
20:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#002)).

Micah had this also common with Isaiah, that he has a predominance of
comfort. He is brief in upbraiding [Mic
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#005); [Mic
2:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#001), [Mic
2:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#009), indignant in casting back the
pleas of the false prophets [Mic 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#007),
[Mic 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#011); [Mic
3:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#005), concise in his threatenings of
woe [Mic 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#003), [Mic
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#010); [Mic
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#004), [Mic
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#012); [Mic
6:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#013); [Mic
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#004), [Mic
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#013), save where he lingers mournfully
over the desolation [Mic 1:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#010); [Mic
2:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#004), large and flowing in his
descriptions of mercy to come [Mic
4:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#001); [Mic
5:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#001); [Mic
7:7-20](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#007). He sees and pronounces the
coming punishment, as absolutely certain; he does not call to repentance
to avert it; he knows that ultimately it will not be averted; he sees it
irrespectively of time, and says that it will be. Time is an accident to
the link of cause and effect. Sin consummated would be the cause;
punishment, the effect. He spoke to those who knew that God pardoned on
repentance, who had lately had before them that marvelous instance in
Nineveh. He dashes to the ground their false security, by reason of
their descent from Jacob [Mic 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#007), of
God's Presence among them in the Temple [Mic
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#011); the multitude of their offerings
amid the multitude of their sins [Mic
6:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#006).

He rejects in God's name, their false, outward, impenitent, penitence;
and thereby the more implies that He would accept a true repentance.
They knew this, and were, for a time, scared into penitence. But in his
book, as God willed it to remain, he is rather the prophet of God's
dealings, than the direct preacher of repentance to individuals. Yet he
is the more an evangelic preacher, in that he speaks of repentance, only
as the gift of God. He does not ignore that man must accept the grace of
God; but, as Isaiah foretells of the days of the Gospel, "the idols He
shall utterly abolish" [Isa 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#018), so
Micah first foretells that God would abolish all wherein man relied out
of God, all wherein he prided himself [Mic
5:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#009), every form of idolatry [Mic
5:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#011), and subsequently describes
the future evangelic repentance, submission to, and waiting upon God and
His righteousness [Mic 7:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#008); and
God's free plenary forgiveness [Mic
7:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#018).

Micah's rapid unprepared transitions from each of his main themes to
another, from upbraiding to threatening, from threatening to mercy and
then back again to upbraiding, is probably a part of that same vivid
perception of the connection of sin, chastisement, forgiveness, in the
will and mind of God. He sees them and speaks of them in the natural
sequence in which they were exhibited to him. He connects most commonly
the sin with the punishment by the one word, therefore (not [Mic
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#006); [Mic
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#013); but [Mic
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#014); [Mic
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#003), [Mic
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#005); [Mic
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#006), [Mic
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#012)), because it was an object with
him to shew the connection. The mercies to come he subjoins either
suddenly without any conjunction [Mic
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#012); [Mic
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#013), or with the simple and. An
English reader loses some of the force of this simplicity by the
paraphrase, which, for the simple copula, substitutes the inference or
contrast, "therefore, then, but, notwithstanding" , which lie in the
subjects themselves.

An English reader might have been puzzled, at first sight, by the
monotonous simplicity of the, and, and, joining together the mention of
events, which stand, either as the contrast or the consequence of those
which precede them. The English version accordingly has consulted for
the reader or hearer, by drawing out for him the contrast or consequence
which lay beneath the surface. But this gain of clearness involved
giving up so far the majestic simplicity of the Prophet, who at times
speaks of things as they lay in the Divine Mind, and as, one by one,
they would be unfolded to man, without explaining the relation in which
they stood to one another. Micah knew that surfferings were, in God's
purpose, travail-pains. And so, immediately after the denunciation of
punishment, he adds so calmly, "And in the last days it shall be;" "And
thou, Bethlehem Ephratah" ([Mic 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#001);
[Mic 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#002) ([Mic
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#001) in Hebrew); add [Mic
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#007)). Or in the midst of his
descriptions of mercies, he speaks of the intervening troubles, as the
way to them. "Now why dost thou cry aloud? - pangs have taken thee, as a
woman in travail - be in pain - thou shalt go even unto Babylon; there
shalt thou be delivered" [Mic 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#009) :
or, "Therefore will He give thee up until the time, ..." ([Mic
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#003) ([Mic
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#002) in Hebrew)), i. e., because He has
these good things in store for thee, "He will give thee up, until the
time" comes.

With this great simplicity Micah unites great vividness and energy. Thus
in predicting punishment, he uses the form of command, bidding them, as
it were, execute it on themselves; "Arise, depart" ([Mic
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#010); add [Mic
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#011), [Mic
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#013); [Mic
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#010)): as, in the Great Day, our Lord
shall say, "Depart, ye cursed." And since God does in us or by us what
He commands to be done, he uses the imperative to Zion, alike as to her
victories over God's enemies [Mic
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#013), or her state of anxious fear
([Mic 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#001) (4:14 in Hebrew)).

To that same vividness belong his rapid changes of person or gender; his
sudden questions [Mic 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#005); [Mic
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#007); [Mic
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#001); [Mic
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#009); [Mic
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#003), [Mic
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#006), [Mic
6:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#010); [Mic
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#018); his unmarked dialogues. The
changes of person and gender occur in all Hebrew poetry; all have their
emphasis. He addresses the people or place as a whole (feminine), then
all the individuals in her ([Mic 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#011),
twice); or turns away and speaks of it ; or contrariwise, having spoken
of the whole in the third person, he turns round and drives the warning
home to individuals [Mic 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#003). The
variations in the last verse of Mic. 6 are unexampled for rapidity even
in Hebrew.

And yet the flow of his words is smooth and measured. Without departing
from the conciseness of Hebrew poetry, his cadence, for the most part,
is of the more prolonged sort, as far as any can be called prolonged,
when all is so concise. In some 8 verses, out of 104, he is markedly
brief, where conciseness corresponds with his subject, as in an abrupt
appeal as to their sins ([Mic 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#010) ((5
words); [Mic 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#011) (6 words)), or an
energetic announcement of judgment ([Mic
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#008); and [Mic
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#013) (7 words)) or of mercy ([Mic
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#011) (7 words); [Mic
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#015) (5 words)), or in that remarkable
prophecy of both ([Mic 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#013) Hebrew (5
Words); [Mic 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#010) (6 words); [Mic
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#011) (7 words)), how God would, in
mercy, cut off all grounds of human trust. Else, whereas in Nahum and
Habakkuk, not quite 13, and in the eleven last Chapters of Hosea much
less than 13, of the verses contain more than 13 words , in Micah above
37 (as, in Joel, nearly 37) exceed that number .

His description of the destruction of the cities or villages of Judah
corresponds in vividness to Isaiah's ideal march of Sennacherib [Isa
10:28-32](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#028). The flame of war spreads
from place to place; but Micah relieves the sameness of the description
of misery by every variety which language allows. He speaks of them in
his own person (see [Mic 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#008), note;
[Mic 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#010), note), or to them; he
describes the calamity in past [Mic
1:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#009) or in future [Mic
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#008), or by use of the imperative [Mic
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#011), [Mic
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#013), [Mic
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#016). The verbal allusions are crowded
together in a way unexampled elsewhere. Moderns have spoken of them, as
not after their taste, or have apologized for them. The mighty prophet,
who wrought a repentance greater than his great contemporary Isaiah,
knew well what would impress the people to whom he spoke. The Hebrew
names had definite meanings. We can well imagine how, as name after name
passed from the prophet's mouth, connected with some note of woe, all
around awaited anxiously, to know upon what place the fire of the
Prophet's word would next fall; and as at last it had fallen upon little
and mighty round about Jerusalem, the names of the places would ring in
their ears as heralds of the coming woe; they would be like so many
monuments, inscribed beforehand with the titles of departed greatness,
reminding Jerusalem itself of its portion of the prophecy, that "evil
should come from the Lord unto the gate of Jerusalem" [Isa
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#012).

Wonderful must have been his lightning-flash of indignation, as, when
the false prophet or the people had forbidden God's word to be spoken,
he burst upon them, "Thou, called house of Jacob, shortened is God's
Spirit?" [Mic 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#007). "Or these His
doings?" And then follow the plaintive descriptions of the wrongs done
to the poor, the peaceful [Mic 2:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#008),
the mothers of his people and their little ones. And then again the
instantaneous dismissal, "Arise and depart." [Mic
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#010). But, therewith, wonderful also
is his tenderness. Burning as are his denunciations against the
oppressions of the rich [Mic 2:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#001);
[Mic 3:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#001), [Mic
3:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#009); [Mic
6:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#010); [Mic
7:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#002), (words less vehement will not
pierce hearts of stone) there is an under-current of tenderness. His
rebukes evince not indignation only against sin, but a tender sympathy
with the sufferers [Mic 1:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#008); [Mic
2:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#001); [Mic
7:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#005). He is afflicted in the
afflictions which he has to denounce. He yearns for his people [Mic
1:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#008), [Mic
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#016); [Mic
4:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#009); nay, until our Lord's coming,
there is scarcely an expression of such yearning longing: he hungers and
thirsts for their good [Mic 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#001).

God's individual care of His people, and of each soul in it, had, since
David's time [Psa 23:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#001) and even
since Jacob [Gen 49:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#024), been likened
to the care of the shepherd for each single sheep. The Psalm of Asaph
[Psa 74:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#001); [Psa
78:52](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#052); [Psa
79:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#013); [Psa
80:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#001) must have familiarized the people
to the image, as relating to themselves as a whole, and David's deep
Psalm had united it with God's tender care of His own in, and over,
death. Yet the predominance of this image in Micah is a part of the
tenderness of the prophet. He adopts it, as expressing, more than any
other natural image, the helplessness of the creature, the tender
individual care of the Creator. He forestalls our Lord's words, "I am
the good shepherd," in his description of the Messiah, gathering "the
remnant of Israel together, as the sheep of Bozrah" [Mic
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#012); His people are as a flock, "lame
and despised" [Mic 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#006), whom God would
assemble; His royal seat, "the tower of the flock" [Mic
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#008); the Ruler of Israel should
"stand" unresting, "and feed them" ([Mic
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#004). (English 3 Hebrew)); those whom
He should employ against the enemies of His people, are shepherds" ([Mic
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#005), ([Mic
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#004) in Hebrew)), under Him, the true
shepherd. He sums up his prayer for his people to God as their Shepherd;
"Feed Thy people with Thy rod, the flock of Thine heritage" [Mic
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#014).

Directly, he was a Prophet for Judah only. At the beginning of his book,
he condemns the idolatries of both capitals, as the central sin of the
two kingdoms. The destruction of Samaria he pronounces at once, as
future, absolutely certain, abiding [Mic
1:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#006). There he leaves her, declares
her "wound incurable," and passes immediately to Judah, to whom, he
says, that wound should pass, whom that same enemy should reach. [Mic
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#009). Thereafter, he mentions
incidentally the infection of Israel's sin spreading to Judah [Mic
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#013). Elsewhere, after that first
sentence on Samaria, the names of Jacob (which he had given to the ten
tribes [Mic 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#005)) and Israel are
appropriated to the kingdom of Judah : Judah is mentioned no more, only
her capital; even her kings are called "the kings of Israel" [Mic
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#014). The ten tribes are only included
in the general restoration of the whole . The future remnant of the two
tribes, to be restored after the captivity of Babylon, are called by
themselves "the remnant of Jacob" ([Mic
5:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#007), ([Mic
5:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#008) in Hebrew)): the Messiah to be
born at Bethlehem is foretold as "the ruler in Israel" ([Mic
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#002) ([Mic
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#001) in Hebrew)): the ten tribes are
called "the remnant of His brethren," who were to "return to the
children of Israel" ([Mic 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#003) ([Mic
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#002) in Hebrew)), i. e., Judah.

This the more illustrates the genuineness of the inscription. A later
hand would have been unlikely to have mentioned either Samaria or those
earlier kings of Judah. Each part of the title corresponds to something
in the prophecy; the name "Micah" is alluded to at its close; his
birthplace, "the Morasthite," at its beginning; the indications of those
earlier reigns lie there, although not on its surface. The mention of
the two capitals, followed by the immediate sentence on Samaria, and
then by the fuller expansion of the sins and punishment of Jerusalem,
culminating in its sentence [Mic 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#012),
in Micah, corresponds to the brief mention of the punishment of Judah in
Amos the prophet of Israel, and then the fuller expansion of the sins
and punishments of Israel. Further, the capitals, as the fountains of
idolatry, are the primary object of God's displeasure. They are both
specially denounced in the course of the prophecy; their special
overthrow is foretold [Mic 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#006), [Mic
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#009), [Mic
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#012); [Mic
3:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#010); [Mic
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#010). The title corresponds with the
contents of the prophecy, yet the objections of modern critics shew that
the correspondence does not lie on the surface.

The taunt of the false priest Amaziah to Amos may in itself suggest
that; prophets at Jerusalem did prophesy against Samaria. Amaziah,
anyhow, thought it natural that they should. Both Isaiah and Micah,
while exercising their office at Jerusalem, had regard also to Samaria.
Divided as Israel and Judah were, Israel was not yet cut off. Israel and
Judah were still, together, the one people of God. The prophets in each
had a care for the other.

Micah joins himself on to the men of God before him, as Isaiah at the
time, and Jeremiah, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Ezekiel, subsequently, employed
words or thoughts of Micah . Micah alludes to the history, the laws, the
promises, the threatenings of the Pentateuch; and that in such wise,
that it is plain that he had, not traditional laws or traditional
history, but the Pentateuch itself before him . Nor were those books
before himself only. His book implies not an acquaintance only, but a
familiar acquaintance with it on the part of the people. The title, "the
land of Nimrod" ([Mic 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#006), ([Mic
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#005) in Hebrew) from [Gen
10:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#008)), "the house of bondage" , for
Egypt, the allusions to the miraculous deliverance from Egypt (see the
note at [Mic 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#013); [Mic
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#004); [Mic
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#015)), the history of Balaam; the
whole summary of the mercies of God from the Exodus to Gilgal (see the
note at [Mic 6:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#004)) the faithfulness
pledged to Abraham and Jacob (see the note at [Mic
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#020)), would be unintelligible without
the knowledge of the Pentateuch. Even single expressions are taken from
the Pentateuch.

Especially, the whole sixth chapter is grounded upon it. Thence is the
appeal to inanimate nature to hear the controversy; thence the mercies
alleged on God's part; the offerings on man's part to atone to God
(except the one dreadful superstition of Ahaz) are from the law; the
answer on God's part is almost verbally from the law; the sins upbraided
are sins forbidden in the law; the penalties pronounced are also those
of the law. There are two allusions also to the history of Joshua (see
the note at [Mic 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#004); [Mic
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#005)), to David's elegy over Saul and
Jonathan [Mic 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#010), and, as before
said, to the history of Micaiah son of Imlah in the Book of Kings.
Single expressions are also taken from the Psalms , and the Proverbs .
In the descriptions of the peace of the kingdom of Christ [Mic
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#003); [Joe
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#010), he appears purposely to have
reversed God's description of the animosity of the nations against God's
people. He has also two characteristic expressions of Amos. Perhaps, in
the image of the darkness which should come on the false prophets [Mic
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#006); [Amo
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#009), he applied anew the image of
Amos, adding the ideas of spiritual darkness and perplexity to that of
calamity.

The light and shadows of the prophetic life fell deeply on the soul of
Micah. The captivity of Judah too had been foretold before him. Moses
had foretold the end from the beginning, had set before them the
captivity and the dispersion, as a punishment which the sins of the
people would certainly bring upon them. Hosea presupposed it ; Amos
foretold that Jerusalem, like the cities of its heathen enemies, should
be burned with fire [Mic 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#005). Micah
had to declare its lasting desolation [Mic
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#012). Even when God wrought repentance
through him, he knew that it was but for a time; for he foresaw and
foretold that the deliverance would be, not in Jerusalem, but at Babylon
[Mic 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#010), in captivity. His prophecy
sank so deep, that, above a century afterward, just when it was about to
have its fulfillment, it was the prophecy which was remembered. But the
sufferings of time disappeared in the light of eternal truth. Above
seven centuries rolled by, and Micah re-appears as the herald, not now
of sorrow but of salvation. Wise men from afar, in the nobility of their
simple belief, asked, "Where is he that is born King of the Jews?" A
king, jealous for his temporal empire, gathered all those learned in
Holy Scripture, and echoed the question. The answer was given,
unhesitatingly, as a well-known truth of God, in the words of Micah.
"For thus it is written in the Prophet." Glorious peerage of the two
contemporary prophets of Judah. Ere Jesus was born, the Angel announced
the birth of the Virgin's Son, "God with us," in the words of Isaiah.
When He was born, He was pointed out as the Object of worship to the
first converts from the heathen, on the authority of God, through Micah.
