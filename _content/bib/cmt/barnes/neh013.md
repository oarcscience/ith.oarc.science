### [Nehemiah Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#001)

[Nehemiah 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">neh 13:1</span></span>

On that day - Or, "at that time," as in [Neh
12:44](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#044).

The entire Pentateuch is probably meant by "the Book of Moses".

[Nehemiah 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">neh 13:3</span></span>

A separation like that made by Ezra, some 20 years previously Ezra
10:15-44, seems to be intended. The pagan wives were divorced and sent
back, with their offspring, to their own countries.

[Nehemiah 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">neh 13:4</span></span>

The relations of Eliashib, the high priest [Neh
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#001), with Tobiah and Sanballat will
account for the absence of any reference to him either in Neh. 8-10, or
in Neh. 12:27-47.

The chamber - The entire outbuilding, or "lean-to," which surrounded the
temple on three sides [Kg1 6:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#005).

Allied - i. e, "connected by marriage." Tobiah was married to a Jewess
[Neh 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#018), who may have been a
relation of Eliashib; and his son Johanan was married to another [Neh
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#018), of whom the same may be said.

[Nehemiah 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">neh 13:5</span></span>

The offerings of the priests - i e "the portion of the offerings
assigned for their sustenance to the priests."

[Nehemiah 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">neh 13:6</span></span>

Artaxerxes king of Babylon - See [Neh
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#001). Compare [Ezr
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#022), where Darius Hystaspis is called
"king of Assyria."

After certain days - Or, "at the end of a year," which is a meaning that
the phrase often has [Exo 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#010); [Lev
25:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#029); [Num
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#022). Nehemiah probably went to the
court at Babylon in 433 B.C., and returned to Jerusalem 432 B.C.

[Nehemiah 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">neh 13:9</span></span>

The chambers - The "great chamber" assigned to Tobiah [Neh
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#005) contained, it would seem, more
than one apartment.

[Nehemiah 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">neh 13:10</span></span>

etc. During Nehemiah's absence there had been a general falling away,
and there was danger of a complete national apostasy.

[Nehemiah 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">neh 13:11</span></span>

I gathered them together - Nehemiah gathered the Levites from their
lands, and reinstated them in their set offices.

[Nehemiah 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">neh 13:15</span></span>

The desecration of the Sabbath is first brought into prominence among
the sins of the Jewish people by Jeremiah [Jer
17:21-27](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#021). It could not but have gained
ground during the captivity, when foreign masters would not have allowed
the cessation of labor for one day in seven. On the return from the
captivity, the sabbatical rest appears to have been one of the
institutions most difficult to re-establish.

In the day - Some render, "concerning the day."

[Nehemiah 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">neh 13:16</span></span>

Friendly relations subsisted between the Phoenicians and the Jews, after
the captivity [Ezr 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#007). It was,
however, a new fact, and one pregnant with evil consequences, that the
Tyrians should have established a permanent colony at Jerusalem. Its
influence on the other inhabitants weakened the hold of the Law upon
men's consciences, and caused it to be transgressed continually more and
more openly.

[Nehemiah 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">neh 13:19</span></span>

The gates were closed at the sunset of the day before the Sabbath; since
the Sabbath was regarded as commencing on the previous evening.

[Nehemiah 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">neh 13:21</span></span>

The lodging of the merchants with their merchandise just outside
Jerusalem during the Sabbath, marked their impatience for the moment
when they might bring their wares in. This was thought by Nehemiah to be
unseemly, and to have an irreligious tendency.

[Nehemiah 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">neh 13:22</span></span>

I commanded the Levites - At first Nehemiah had employed his own retinue
[Neh 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#019) in the work of keeping the
gates. He now assigned the duty to the Levites, as one which properly
belonged to them, since the object of the regulation was the due
observance of the Sabbath.

[Nehemiah 13:24](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">neh 13:24</span></span>

The speech of Ashdod - The Philistine language, which was akin to that
of Egypt.

According to the language of each people - The children spoke a mixed
dialect - half-Philistine, half-Hebrew.

[Nehemiah 13:30](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">neh 13:30</span></span>

The wards - Rather, "the offices or observances." Nehemiah's arrangement
is probably that described in [Neh
11:10-22](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#010).
