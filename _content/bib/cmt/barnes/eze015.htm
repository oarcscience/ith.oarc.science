<p>The vine ... - The image is grounded on a well-known figure <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#008">Psa 80:8</A>; Isa. 5. The comparison is not between the vine and other trees, but between the wood of the vine and the wood of other trees. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#004">Ezekiel 15:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">eze 15:4</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Behold, it is cast into the fire - The wood is in itself useless for any purpose; but what if it have been cast into the fire, and half burned, what of it then? 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#007">Ezekiel 15:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">eze 15:7</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>They shall go out ... - Rather, they have gone forth from the fire, and the fire shall devour them. The condition of the people is here depicted. The people of Israel - as a whole and as separate kingdoms - had become worthless. The branch torn from the living stem had truly been cast into the fire, which had devoured both ends of it; what remained was a brand plucked from the burning. Those who had escaped the general calamity were reserved for a like fate. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#006">Joh 15:6</A>.
