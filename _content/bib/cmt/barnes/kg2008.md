### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#001)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 8:1</span></span>

The famine here recorded, and the conversation of the monarch with
Gehazi, must have been anterior to the events related in 2 Kings 5 since
we may be sure that a king of Israel would not have entered into
familiar conversation with a confirmed leper. The writer of Kings
probably col ected the miracles of Elisha from various sources, and did
not always arrange them chronologically. Here the link of connection is
to be found in the nature of the miracle. As Elisha on one occasion
prophesied plenty, so on another he had prophesied a famine.

Called for a famine - A frequent expression (compare the marginal
references). God's "calling for" anything is the same as His producing
it (see [Eze 36:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#029); [Rom
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#017)).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg2 8:2</span></span>

The country of the Philistines - the rich low grain-growing plain along
the seacoast of Judah - was always a land of plenty compared with the
highlands of Palestine. Moreover, if food failed there, it was easily
imported by sea from the neighboring Egypt.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg2 8:3</span></span>

During the Shunammite's absence in Philistia, her dwelling and her
grain-fields had been appropriated by some one who refused to restore
them. She therefore determined to appeal to the king. Such direct
appeals are common in Oriental countries. Compare [Kg2
6:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#026); [Sa2
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#004); [Kg1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#016).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg2 8:6</span></span>

A certain officer - literally, "a certain eunuch" (margin). Eunuchs were
now in common use at the Samaritan court (compare [Kg2
9:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#032)). They are ascribed to the court
of David in Chronicles [Ch1 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#001); and
we may conjecture that they were maintained by Solomon. But otherwise we
do not find them in the kingdom of Judah until the time of Hezekiah [Isa
56:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#003).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg2 8:7</span></span>

The hour had come for carrying out the command given by God to Elijah
(marginal reference "e"), and by him probably passed on to his
successor. Elisha, careless of his own safety, quitted the land of
Israel, and proceeded into the enemy's country, thus putting into the
power of the Syrian king that life which he had lately sought so eagerly
[Kg2 6:13-19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#013).

The man of God - The Damascenes had perhaps known Elisha by this title
from the time of his curing Naaman. Or the phrase may be used as
equivalent to "prophet," which is the title commonly given to Elisha by
the Syrians. See [Kg2 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#012). Compare
[Kg2 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#013).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 8:8</span></span>

Hazael was no doubt a high officer of the court. The names of Hazael and
Benhadad occur in the Assyrian inscription on the Black Obelisk now in
the British Museum. Both are mentioned as kings of Damascus, who
contended with a certain Shalmaneser, king of Assyria, and suffered
defeat at his hands. In one of the battles between this king and
Benhadad, "Allah of Jezreel" is mentioned among the allies of the
latter. This same Shalmaneser took tribute from Jehu. This is the point
at which the Assyrian records first come in direct contact with those of
the Jews.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg2 8:9</span></span>

Every good thing of Damascus - Probably, besides rich robes and precious
metals, the luscious wine of Helbon, which was the drink of the Persian
kings, the soft white wool of the anti-Libanus [Eze
27:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#018), damask coverings of couches
[Amo 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#012), and numerous manufactured
articles of luxury, which the Syrian capital imported from Tyre, Egypt,
Nineveh, and Babylon. Forty camels were laden with it, and this goodly
caravan paraded the streets of the town, conveying to the prophet the
splendid gift designed for him. Eastern ostentation induces donors to
make the greatest possible show of their gifts, and each camel would
probably bear only one or two articles.

Thy son Ben-hadad - A phrase indicative of the greatest respect, no
doubt used at the command of Benhadad in order to dispose the prophet
favorably toward him. Compare [Kg2
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#021).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg2 8:10</span></span>

Translate - "Go, say unto him, Thou shalt certainly live: howbeit the
Lord hath showed me that he shall certainly die." i. e.," Say to him,
what thou hast already determined to say, what a courtier is sure to say
(compare [Kg1 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#015)), but know that
the fact will be otherwise."

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg2 8:11</span></span>

That is, "And he (Elisha) settled his conntenance, and set it (toward
Hazael), until he (Hazael) was ashamed." Elisha fixed on Hazael a long
and meaning look, until the latter's eyes fell before his, and his cheek
flushed. Elisha, it would seem, had detected the guilty thought that was
in Hazael's heart, and Hazael perceived that he had detected it. Hence
the "shame."

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg2 8:12</span></span>

The evil that thou wilt do - The intention is not to tax Hazael with
special cruelty, but only to enumerate the ordinary horrors of war, as
it was conducted among the Oriental nations of the time. Compare the
marginal references.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg2 8:13</span></span>

But what, is thy servant a dog? - This is a mistranslation, and conveys
to the English reader a sense quite different from that of the original.
Hazael's speech runs thus - "But what is thy servant, this dog, that he
should do this great thing?" He does not shrink from Elisha's words, or
mean to say that he would be a dog, could he act so cruelly as Elisha
predicts he will. On the contrary, Elisha's prediction has raised his
hopes, and his only doubt is whether so much good fortune ("this great
thing") can be in store for one so mean. "Dog" here, as generally
(though not always) in Scripture, has the sense of "mean," "low,"
"contemptible."

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg2 8:14</span></span>

Hazael omitted the clause by which Elisha had shown how those words were
to be understood. He thus deceived his master, while he could flatter
himself that he had not uttered a lie.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg2 8:15</span></span>

A thick cloth - Probably, a cloth or mat placed between the head and the
upper part of the bedstead, which in Egypt and Assyria was often so
shaped that pillows (in our sense) were unnecessary.

The objection that Elisha is involved in the guilt of having suggested
the deed, has no real force or value. Hazael was no more obliged to
murder Benhadad because a prophet announced to him that he would one day
be king of Syria, than David was obliged to murder Saul because another
prophet anointed him king in Saul's room [Sa1
16:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#001).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg2 8:16</span></span>

The passage is parenthetic, resuming the history of the kingdom of Judah
from [Kg1 22:50](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#050).

[Kg2 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#016)

The opening words are - "In the fifth year of Joram, son of Ahab, king
of Israel, and of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah;" but they contradict all
the other chronological notices of Jehoshaphat [Kg1
22:42](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#042), [Kg1
22:51](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#051); [Kg2
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#001); [Ch2
20:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#031), which give him a reign of at
least twenty-three years. Hence, some have supposed that the words
"Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah," are accidentally repeated.
Those, however, who regard them and [Kg2
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#017) as sound, suppose that
Jehoshaphat gave his son the royal title in his 16th year, while he
advanced him to a real association in the empire seven years later, in
his 23rd year. Two years afterward, Jehoshatphat died, and Jehoram
became sole king.

[Kg2 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#017)

The "eight years" are counted from his association in the kingdom. They
terminate in the twelfth year of Johoram of Israel.

[Kg2 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#018)

Jehoshaphat's alliance, political and social, with Ahab and Ahab's
family had not been allowed to affect the purity of his faith. Jehoram
his son, influenced by his wife, Athaliah, the daughter of Ahab, "walked
in the way of the kings of Israel;" he allowed, i. e., the introduction
of the Baal-worship into Judaea.

Among the worst of Jehoram's evil doings must be reckoned the cruel
murder of his six brothers [Ch2 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#004),
whom he killed to obtain their wealth.

[Kg2 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#019)

The natural consequence of Jehoram's apostasy would have been the
destruction of his house, and the transfer of the throne of Judah to
another family. Compare the punishments of Jeroboam [Kg1
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#010), Baasha [Kg1
16:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#002), and Ahab [Kg1
21:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#020). But the promises to David
(marginal references) prevented this removal of the dynasty; and so
Jehoram was punished in other ways [Kg2
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#022); [Ch2
21:12-19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#012).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg2 8:20</span></span>

Edom, which had been reduced by David [Sa2
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#014); [Kg1
11:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#015), but had apparently revolted
from Solomon [Kg1 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#014), was again
subjected to Judah in the reign of Jehoshaphat 2 Kings 3:8-26. The
Edomites had, however, retained their native kings, and with them the
spirit of independence. They now rose in revolt, and fulfilled the
prophecy [Gen 27:40](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#040), remaining from
henceforth a separate and independent people ([Jer
25:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#021); [Jer
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#003); [Amo
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#011), etc.). Kings of Edom, who seem
to be independent monarchs, are often mentioned in the Assyrian
inscriptions.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg2 8:21</span></span>

Zair - Perhaps Seir, the famous mountain of Edom [Gen
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#006).

The people - i. e., The Edomites. Yet, notwithstanding his success,
Joram was forced to withdraw from the country, and to leave the natives
to enjoy that independence [Kg2 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#022),
which continued until the time of John Hyrcanus, who once more reduced
them.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg2 8:22</span></span>

Libnah revolted - Libnah being toward the southwest of Palestine [Jos
15:42](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#042), its revolt cannot well have had
any direct connection with that of Edom. It had been the capital of a
small Canaanite state under a separate king before its conquest by
Joshua [Jos 10:30](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#030); [Jos
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#015), and may perhaps always have
retained a considerable Canaanite population. Or its loss may have been
connected with the attacks made by the Philistines on Jehoram's
territories [Ch2 21:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#016).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg2 8:24</span></span>

On the death of Jehoram, see [Ch2
21:12-19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#012). His son is also called
Jehoahaz (margin) by a transposition of the two elements of the name.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg2 8:26</span></span>

Such names as Athaliah, Jehoram, and Ahaziah, indicate that the
Baal-worshipping kings of Israel did not openly renounce the service of
Yahweh. Athaliah is "the time for Yahweh;" Ahaziah "the possession of
Yahweh;" Jehoram, or Joram, "exalted by Yahweh."

The daughter of Omri - "Son" and "daughter" were used by the Jews of any
descendants (compare [Mat 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001)). The
whole race were "the children of Israel." Athaliah was the
grand-daughter of Omri (see the margin). Her being called "the daughter
of Omri" implies that an idea of special greatness was regarded as
attaching to him, so that his name prevailed over that of Ahab.
Indications of this ideal greatness are found in the Assyrian
inscriptions, where the early name for Samaria is Beth-Omri, and where
even Jehu has the title of "the son of Omri."

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">kg2 8:28</span></span>

This war of the two kings against Hazael seems to have had for its
object the recovery of Ramoth-gilead, which Ahab and Jehoshaphat had
vainly attempted fourteen years earlier 1 Kings 22:3-36. Joram probably
thought that the accession of a new and usurping monarch presented a
favorable opportunity for a renewal of the war. It may also have
happened that Hazael was engaged at the time upon his northern frontier
with repelling one of those Assyrian attacks which seem by the
inscriptions to have fallen upon him in quick succession during his
earlier years. At any rate, the war appears to have been successful.
Ramoth-gilead was recovered [Kg2 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#014),
and remained probably thenceforth in the hands of the Israelites.

The Syrians wounded Joram - According to Josephus, Joram was struck by
an arrow in the course of the siege, but remained until the place was
taken. He then withdrew to Jezreel [Kg1
18:45](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#045); [Kg1
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#001), leaving his army under Jehu
within the walls of the town.
