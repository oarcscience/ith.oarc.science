### [Numbers Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#001)

[Numbers 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 15:1</span></span>

The contents of the next five chapters must apparently be referred to
the long period of wandering to which [Num
14:33](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#033) the people were condemned.

[Numbers 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 15:2</span></span>

To the Israelites of the younger generation is conveyed the hope that
the nation should yet enter into the land of promise. The ordinances
that follow are more likely to have been addressed to adults than to
children; and we may therefore assume that at the date of their delivery
the new generation was growing up, and the period of wandering drawing
toward its close. During that period the meat-offerings and
drink-offerings prescribed by the Law had been probably intermitted by
reason of the scanty supply of grain and wine in the wilderness. The
command therefore to provide such offerings was a pledge to Israel that
it should possess the land which was to furnish the wherewithal for
them.

[Numbers 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">num 15:4</span></span>

The meat-offering is treated in Lev. 2. The drink-offering [Exo
29:40](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#040); [Lev
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#013), hitherto an ordinary accessory
to the former, is now prescribed forevery sacrifice.

[Numbers 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">num 15:18</span></span>

The general principle which includes the ordinance of this and the three
verses following is laid down in [Exo
22:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#029); [Exo
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#019).

[Numbers 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">num 15:20</span></span>

Dough - "Coarse meal" [Neh 10:37](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#037); [Eze
44:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#030).

[Numbers 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">num 15:22</span></span>

The heavy punishments which had already overtaken the people might
naturally give rise to apprehensions for the future, especially in view
of the fact that on the approaching entrance into Canaan the complete
observance of the Law in all its details would become imperative on
them. To meet such apprehensions a distinction is emphatically drawn
between sins of ignorance ([Lev 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#013)
ff) and those of presumption [Num
15:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#030). The passage deals separately
with imperfections of obedience which would be regarded as attaching to
the whole nation [Num 15:22-26](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#022), and
those of individuals [Num 15:27-30](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#027).

[Num 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#024)

Without the knowledge of the congregation - literally, as marginal. The
words point to an error of omission which escaped notice at the time: i.
e. to an oversight.

[Num 15:30](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#030)

Presumptuously - The original (compare the margin, and [Exo
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#008)) imports something done willfully
and openly; in the case of a sin against God it implies that the act is
committed ostentatiously and in bravado.

Reproacheth the Lord - Rather, revileth or blasphemeth the Lord: compare
[Eze 20:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#027).

[Numbers 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">num 15:32</span></span>

Moses mentions here, as is his wont (compare [Lev
24:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#010)), the first open
transgression and its punishment in order to exemplify the laws which he
is laying down. The offence of Sabbath-breaking was one for which there
could be no excuse. This law at least might be observed even in the
wilderness. Transgression of it was therefore a presumptuous sin, and
was punished accordingly.

[Numbers 15:34](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">num 15:34</span></span>

Death had indeed been assigned as the penalty [Exo
31:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#014); [Exo
35:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#002); but it had not been determined
how that death was to be inflicted.

[Numbers 15:38](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">num 15:38</span></span>

That they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue - Reader
that they add to the fringes of the borders (or corners) a thread of
blue (compare the marginal references). These fringes are considered to
be of Egypttian origin. The ordinary outer Jewish garment was a
quadrangular piece of cloth like a modern plaid, to the corners of
which, in conformity with this command, a tassel was attached. Each
tassel had a conspicuous thread of deep blue, this color being doubtless
symbolic of the heavenly origin of the commandments of which it was to
serve as a memento. Tradition determined that the other threads should
be white - this color being an emblem of purity (compare [Isa
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#018)). The arrangement of the threads
and knots, to which the Jews attached the greatest importance, was so
adjusted as to set forth symbolically the 613 precepts of which the Law
was believed to consist. In our Lord's time the Pharisees enlarged their
fringes [Mat 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#005) in order to obtain
reputation for their piety. In later times howerer, the Jews have worn
the fringed garment (tālı̂̄th) of a smaller size and as an under-dress.
Its use is still retained, especially at morning prayer in the
Synagogue.
