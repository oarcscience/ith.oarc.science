*Notes on the Bible*, by Albert Barnes, \[1834\], at Intangible Textual
Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Proverbs Chapter 28](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#001)

[Proverbs 28:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 28:2</span></span>

Transgression - Better, rebellion. A revolt against a ruler leads to
rapid changes of dynasty (the whole history of the kingdom of Israel was
a proof of this), but "with men of understanding and knowledge thus
shall he (the prince) continue." True wisdom will lead people to
maintain an existing order. The King James Version implies that
political disorders may come as the punishment of any national sin.

The state - Better, it (the land) shall surely prolong its days in
stability.

[Proverbs 28:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 28:3</span></span>

People raise a man of the people, poor like themselves, to power. They
find him the worst oppressor of all, plundering them to their last
morsels, like the storm-rain which sweeps off the seed-corn instead of
bringing fertility.

[Proverbs 28:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 28:5</span></span>

The deep interdependence of morality and intellect. We have a right
judgment in all things in proportion as our hearts seek to know God.
Compare [Jam 1:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#023).

[Proverbs 28:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 28:6</span></span>

Perverse in his ways - literally, "Perverse in his double ways." Compare
Ecclesiasticus 2:12 and [Jam 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#008).

[Proverbs 28:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 28:8</span></span>

Unjust gain - Omit "unjust:" "usury and gain" make up the notion of
"gain derived from usury." Ill-gotten gains do not prosper, after a time
they pass into hands that know how to use them better.

[Proverbs 28:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 28:10</span></span>

When the wicked succeed in tempting the righteous, Vice seems to win a
triumph. But the triumph is suicidal. The tempter will suffer the
punishment he deserves, and the blameless, if true to themselves, will
be strengthened and ennobled by the temptation.

[Proverbs 28:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 28:11</span></span>

Wealth blunts, poverty sharpens, the critical power of intellect.

[Proverbs 28:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 28:12</span></span>

There is great glory - Men array themselves in festive apparel, and show
their joy conspicuously.

A man is hidden - Better, men hide themselves, they shrink and cower for
fear, and yet are hunted out.

[Proverbs 28:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 28:13</span></span>

The conditions of freedom are confession and amendment, confession to
God of sins against Him, to men of sins against them. The teaching of
ethical wisdom on this point is identical with that of psalmist,
prophet, apostles, and our Lord Himself.

[Proverbs 28:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 28:14</span></span>

The "fear" here is not so much reverential awe, as anxious, or "nervous"
sensitiveness of conscience. To most men this temperament seems that of
the self-tormentor. To him who looks deeper it is a condition of
blessedness, and the callousness which is opposed to it ends in misery.

[Proverbs 28:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 28:15</span></span>

The form of political wretchedness, when the poverty of the oppressed
subjects not only embitters their sufferings, but exasperates the brutal
ferocity of the ruler.

[Proverbs 28:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 28:17</span></span>

The case of willful murder, not the lesser crime of manslaughter for
which the cities of refuge were appointed. One, with that guilt on his
soul, is simply hasting on to his own destruction. Those who see him
must simply stand aloof, and let God's judgments fulfill themselves.

[Proverbs 28:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 28:18</span></span>

In his ways - Rather "in his double ways" (as in [Pro
28:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#006)). The evil of vacillation rather
than that of craft, the want of the one guiding principle of right, is
contrasted with the straightforwardness of the man that "walketh
uprightly."

Shall fall at once - Better, shall fall in one of them (his ways). The
attempt to combine incompatibilities is sure to fail. Men cannot serve
God and Mammon.

[Proverbs 28:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pro 28:20</span></span>

Not the possession of wealth, nor even the acquisition of it, is evil,
but the eager haste of covetousness.

Shall not be innocent - Better, as in the margin, in contrast with the
many "blessings" of the "faithful."

[Proverbs 28:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 28:21</span></span>

Dishonest partiality leads men who have enslaved themselves to it to
transgress, even when the inducement is altogether disproportionate. A
"piece of bread" was proverbial at all times as the most extreme point
of poverty (compare the marginal reference).

[Proverbs 28:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 28:22</span></span>

The covetous temper leads not only to dishonesty, but to the "evil eye"
of envy; and the temper of grudging, carking care, leads him to poverty.

[Proverbs 28:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 28:24</span></span>

Is the companion of a destroyer - i. e., he stands on the same footing
as the open, lawless robber. Compare this with our Lord's teaching as to
Corban [Mar 7:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#010).

[Proverbs 28:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">pro 28:25</span></span>

Shall be made fat - He shall enjoy the two-fold blessing of abundance
and tranquility (compare [Pro 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#025)).

[Proverbs 28:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">pro 28:26</span></span>

The contrast between the wisdom of him who trusts in the Lord, and the
folly of self-trust.

[Proverbs 28:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 28:27</span></span>

Hideth his eyes - i. e., Turns away from, disregards, the poor. Compare
[Isa 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#015).
