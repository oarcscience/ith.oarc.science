### [Ecclesiastes Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#001)

[Ecclesiastes](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ecc 8:0</span></span>

Although in some degree baffled in his own pursuit of wisdom, Solomon
yet regards wisdom as the nearest approach to "that good for man" which
he is seeking; and presses here, as a part of that wisdom, a spirit of
obedience [Ecc 8:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#001). In the face of
the incomprehensible course of external events, he determined to abide
in the fear and trust of God [Ecc
8:6-14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#006), and to acknowledge the natural
incompetence of every man to find out the unsearchable ways of God [Ecc
8:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#015).

[Ecclesiastes 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ecc 8:1</span></span>

And who - Rather, and as he who knoweth. The possessor of wisdom excels
other people: it imparts serenity to his countenance, and removes the
expression of gloom or fierceness (see the marginal reference).

[Ecclesiastes 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ecc 8:2</span></span>

Oath - A reference to the oath of allegiance taken to Solomon at his
accession to the throne (the margin of [Ch1
29:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#024)).

[Ecclesiastes 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ecc 8:3</span></span>

Stand not ... - i. e., "Do not persist in rebellion."

[Ecclesiastes 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ecc 8:5</span></span>

Feel - literally, know. The meaning is, "He who obeys the commandment
(i. e., the word of the king, [Ecc
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#004)), will not be an accomplice in any
act of rebellion; and if he be a wise man he discerns (literally knows)
that the king's commandment or action is liable to correction, if it be
wrong, in God's time and by God's judgment." Compare [Ecc
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#011), [Ecc
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#017).

[Ecclesiastes 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ecc 8:6</span></span>

Because, therefore - , Or, as in [Ecc
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#007), "for."

The possibility of God's time and judgment being in opposition to a
king's purpose or commandment [Ecc
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#005), suggests the thought that such
discord is a misery (evil, [Ecc 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#001))
common to man (or, mankind).

[Ecclesiastes 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ecc 8:7</span></span>

When - Or, as in the margin. For the meaning of this verse, compare
marginal references.

[Ecclesiastes 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ecc 8:8</span></span>

Neither hath he power - Rather: "and there is no power." Compare [Ecc
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#019).

No discharge ... - i. e., "No exemption from the final hour of struggle
between life and death."

Wickedness - Though the life of the wicked may be prolonged [Ecc
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#015), yet wickedness itself has no
inherent power to prolong that life.

[Ecclesiastes 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ecc 8:9</span></span>

To his own hurt - Or, "to the hurt of the subject." The case is still
that of an unwise king whose command is obeyed [Ecc
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#002) even to the hurt of the wise man
who obeys him.

[Ecclesiastes 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ecc 8:10</span></span>

i\. e., "I saw wicked (rulers) buried, who came into the world and went
from the Holy place (the seat of authority and justice, [Deu
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#017); [Ch2
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#006)), and they were forgotten in the
city where they had so ruled to the hurt of their subjects: this - their
death and oblivion - shews their lot also to be vanity." Others
interpret the verse: "I have seen wicked men buried; and (others) came
into the world, and from the Holy place they went out of the world, and
were forgotten in the city where they had done rightly" (compare [Kg2
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#009)).

[Ecclesiastes 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ecc 8:12</span></span>

His days be prolonged - i. e., in his wickedness [Ecc
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#008).

"I" is emphatic, as if to mark the opposition to the "sons of men" [Ecc
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#011).

[Ecclesiastes 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ecc 8:14</span></span>

Which is done upon the earth - The instance of vanity, to which these
words are applied, is the seeming inequality of God's justice; but if
they are considered in connection with the profession of personal faith
in God's absolute justice [Ecc 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#012),
the conclusion is irresistible, that, whatever reason the Preacher had
for reserve in declaring his belief, he certainly looked forward to
final judgment in a future state of existence (compare [Ecc
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#017); [Ecc
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#014)).

[Ecclesiastes 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ecc 8:15</span></span>

Mirth - Better, Gladness, or "joy" (as in [Ecc
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#010)). The Hebrew word is applied not
only to the pleasures arising from the physical senses, but also
frequently to religious joy. The sentiment of this verse is a frequent
conclusion of the writer's personal experience (compare marginal
references), and is unfairly charged with Epicureanism. The Preacher is
careful to set forth pleasure as a gift from God, to be earned by labor,
and received with thankfulness to the Giver, and to be accounted for to
Him. His estimate of the pleasures of the senses is recorded in [Ecc
7:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#002).

[Ecclesiastes 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ecc 8:16</span></span>

These verses supplement [Ecc 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#015) with
the reflection that the man who goes beyond that limited sphere within
which he can labor and be contented, and investigates the whole work of
God, will find that his finite intelligence cannot grasp it.

[Ecc 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#016)

Business - Or, "travail" [Ecc 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#013);
[Ecc 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#010). The sleeplessness noted
probably refers to the writer himself.
