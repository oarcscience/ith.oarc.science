Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Exodus Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#001)

(Compare [Exo 38:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#001).) The great altar
which stood in the court immediately in front of the tabernacle was
commonly called the altar of burnt-offering, because on it were burnt
the whole burnt-offerings, and all those parts of the other animal
sacrifices which were offered to the Lord. It was also called the brazen
altar, because it was covered with bronze, in distinction from the
golden altar or altar of incense [Exo
39:38-39](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#038); [Exo
40:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#005).

[Exo 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#002)

His horns shall be of the same - These horns were projections pointing
upward in the form either of a small obelisk, or of the horn of an ox.
They were to be actually parts of the altar, not merely superadded to
it. On them the blood of the sin-offering was smeared [Exo
29:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#012); [Lev
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#007); [Lev
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#015); [Lev
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#009); [Lev
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#018). To take hold of them appears to
have been regarded as an emphatic mode of laying claim to the supposed
right of sanctuary ([Exo 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#014) note;
[Kg1 1:50](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#050)).

[Exo 27:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#003)

Pans - Rather pots as in [Exo 38:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#003);
[Kg1 7:45](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#045). On the use to which these
pots were put in disposing of the ashes of the altar, see [Lev
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#016).

Basons - Vessels used for receiving the blood of the victims and casting
it upon the altar (see [Exo 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#006); [Lev
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#005); etc.).

Fleshhooks - These were for adjusting the pieces of the victims upon the
altar (compare [Sa1 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#013)).

Firepans - The same word is rendered snuffdishes, [Exo
25:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#038); [Exo
37:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo037.htm#023) : censers, [Lev
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#001); [Lev
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#012); [Num
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#014); [Num
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#006), etc. These utensils appear to
have been shallow metal vessels which were employed merely to carry
burning embers from the brazen altar to the altar of incense.

[Exo 27:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#005)

The compass of the altar - A shelf or projecting ledge, of convenient
width, carried round the altar half way between the top and the base. It
was supported all round its outer edge by a vertical net-like grating of
bronze that rested on the ground.

[Exo 27:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#008)

Hollow with boards - Slabs, or planks, rather than boards. The word is
that which is used for the stone tables of the law [Exo
24:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#012); [Exo
31:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#018), not that applied to the boards
of the tabernacle [Exo 26:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#015).

The brazen altar was a hollow casing, formed of stout acacia planks
covered with plates of bronze, seven feet six in length and width and
four feet six in height. Jewish as well as Christian authorities have
supposed that, when it was fixed for use, it was filled up with earth or
rough stones. If we connect this suggestion with the old rule regarding
the altar of earth and the altar of stone given in [Exo
20:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#024), the woodwork might in fact
be regarded merely as the case of the altar on which the victims were
actually burned. The shelf round the sides [Exo
27:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#005) was required as a stage for the
priests to enable them to carry on their work conveniently on the top of
the altar. Hence, it is said of Aaron that he came down from the altar
[Lev 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#022). According to rabbinical
tradition, there was a slope of earth at the south side banked up for
the priest to ascend to the stage (compare [Exo
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#026)).

[Exodus 27:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">exo 27:9</span></span>

The court of the tabernacle - (Compare [Exo
38:9-20](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#009))

[Exo 27:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#009)

The south side southward - The south side on the right. See [Exo
26:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#018).

[Exo 27:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#010)

Sockets - Bases. See [Exo 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#019).

Fillets - Rather, Connecting rods; curtain-rods of silver connecting the
heads of the pillars. The hangings were attached to the pillars by the
silver hooks; but the length of the space between the pillars would
render it most probable that they were also in some way fastened to
these rods.

[Exo 27:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#013)

The east side eastward - On the front side eastward.

[Exo 27:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#016)

An hanging - An entrance curtain, which, unlike the hangings at the
sides and back of the court, could be drawn up, or aside, at pleasure.
The words are rightly distinguished in our Bible in [Num
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#026).

Wrought with nedlework - The work of the embroiderer. See [Exo
26:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#036); [Exo
35:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#035). On the materials, see [Exo
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#004).

[Exo 27:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#017)

Filleted with silver - Connected with silver rods. See [Exo
27:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#010),

[Exo 27:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#019)

All the vessels ... - All the tools of the tabernacle used in all its
workmanship, and all its tent-pins, and all the tent-pins of the court,
shall be of bronze. The working tools of the sanctuary were most
probably such things as axes, knives, hammers, etc. that were employed
in making, repairing, setting up and taking down the structure. Compare
[Num 3:36](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#036).

The tabernacle - The word is here to be taken as including both the
משׁכן mı̂shkân and the tent, as in [Num
1:51](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#051), [Num
1:53](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#053), etc. (see [Exo
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#001) note).

The pins - tent-pins.

[Exodus 27:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">exo 27:20</span></span>

Pure oil olive beaten - The oil was to be of the best kind. It is called
beaten, because it was obtained by merely bruising the olives in a
mortar or mill, without the application of heat. The finest oil is now
thus obtained from young fruit freshly gathered. The inferior kind is
pressed from unselected fruit under stronger pressure, and with the
application of heat.

The lamp - i. e. the lamps of the golden candlestick. (See [Exo
25:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#037).)

To burn - See the margin "to ascend up." It should be observed that the
word does not properly mean to burn in the sense of to consume, but is
the word regularly used to express the action of fire upon what was
offered to Yahweh (see [Lev 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#009)).

Always - i. e. every night "from evening until morning." Compare [Exo
30:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#008).

[Exodus 27:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">exo 27:21</span></span>

The tabernacle of the congregation - More literally, the tent of
meeting. This is the first occurrence of this designation of the
tabernacle, and the idea connected with it is that of Yahweh meeting
with either Moses, or the priests, or (in a few cases) with the people
gathered into a congregation at the entrance of the tent.

Without the rail, which is before the testimony - i. e. the holy place
(see [Exo 25:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#016)).
