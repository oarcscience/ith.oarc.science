### [Proverbs Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#001)

[Proverbs 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 9:1</span></span>

A parable full of beauty, and interesting in its parallelism to the
parables of our Lord [Mat 22:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#003); [Luk
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#016).

Seven pillars - The number is chosen as indicating completeness and
perfection. God revealing Himself in nature, resting in His work,
entering into covenant with human beings - these were the ideas conveyed
by it.

[Proverbs 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 9:2</span></span>

Mingled her wine - i. e., with myrrh and other spices, to give flavor
and strength.

[Proverbs 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 9:3</span></span>

Wisdom and the "foolish woman" [Pro
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#013) speak from the same places and to
the same class - the simple, undecided, wavering, standing at the
diverging point of the two paths that lead to life or death.

[Proverbs 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 9:5</span></span>

A parallel to the higher teaching of the Gospels (compare [Joh
6:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#027); [Mat
26:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#026)).

[Proverbs 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 9:7</span></span>

These verses seem somewhat to interrupt the continuity of the invitation
which Wisdom utters. The order of thought is, however, this: "I speak to
you, the simple, the open ones, for you have yet ears to hear: but from
the scorner or evil doer, as such, I turn away." The words are
illustrated by [Mat 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#011) ff.

[Proverbs 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 9:10</span></span>

The holy - The word in the Hebrew is plural, agreeing, probably, with
אלהים 'elohı̂ym understood (so in [Pro
30:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#003)). The knowledge of the Most Holy
One stands as the counterpart to the fear of Yahweh.

[Proverbs 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 9:12</span></span>

The great law of personal retribution (compare [Mat
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#002)). The Septuagint makes a curious
addition to this verse, "My son, if thou wilt be wise for thyself, thou
shalt be wise also for thy neighbors; but if thou turn out evil, thou
alone shalt bear evil. He who resteth on lies shall guide the winds, and
the same shall hunt after winged birds, for he hath left the ways of his
own vineyard, and has gone astray with the wheels of his own husbandry.
He goeth through a wilderness without water, and over a land set in
thirsty places, and with his hands he gathereth barrenness."

[Proverbs 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 9:13</span></span>

The picture of the harlot as the representative of the sensual life, the
Folly between which and Wisdom the young man has to make his choice
([Pro 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#003) note). "Simple," in the
worst sense, as open to all forms of evil. "Knoweth nothing," ignorant
with the ignorance which is willful and reckless.

[Proverbs 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 9:14</span></span>

Contrast with [Pro 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#001), etc. The
foolish woman has her house, but it is no stately palace with seven
pillars, like the home of Wisdom. No train of maidens wait on her, and
invite her guests, but she herself sits at the door, her position as
prominent as that of Wisdom, counterfeiting her voice, making the same
offer to the same class (compare [Pro
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#016) with [Pro
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#004)).

[Proverbs 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 9:17</span></span>

The besetting sin of all times and countries, the one great proof of the
inherent corruption of man's nature. Pleasures are attractive because
they are forbidden (compare [Rom 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#007)).

[Proverbs 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 9:18</span></span>

Compare the marginal reference. With this warning the long introduction
closes, and the collection of separate proverbs begins. Wisdom and Folly
have each spoken; the issues of each have been painted in life-like
hues. The learner is left to choose.
