### [Ruth Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#001)

[Ruth 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rut 3:2</span></span>

Behold, he winnoweth barley ... - The simple manners of Boaz and his
times are here before us. This "mighty man of wealth" assists personally
in the winnowing of his barley, which lies in a great heap on the floor
[Rut 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#015), and sleeps in the open
threshing-floor to protect his grain from depredation.

Tonight - For the sake of the breeze which springs up at sunset, and
greatly facilitates the "cleansing" (separation) of the grain tossed up
across the wind.

[Ruth 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rut 3:4</span></span>

Uncover his feet - Rather, "the place of his feet;" the foot of his bed,
as we should say. So also [Rut 3:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#007).

[Ruth 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rut 3:8</span></span>

Turned himself - Rather, "bent forward," so as to feel what it was which
was at his feet. The same word is translated "took hold of," in [Jdg
16:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#029).

[Ruth 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rut 3:9</span></span>

Spread thy skirt ... - The phrase indicates receiving and acknowledging
her as a wife.

[Ruth 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rut 3:10</span></span>

Thou hast shewed more kindness ... - Literally, "Thou hast made thy last
kindness better than the first." Her last kindness was her willingness
to accept Boaz for her husband, advanced in years as he was.

[Ruth 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rut 3:12</span></span>

By "kinsman," understand the גאל gā'al ([Rut
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#020) note).

[Ruth 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rut 3:15</span></span>

The vail - Quite a different word from that rendered "vail," in [Gen
38:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#014). It seems rather to mean a kind
of loose cloak, worn over the ordinary dress (see the margin).

Six measures - i. e. six seahs, in all two ephahs, twice as much as she
gleaned [Rut 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#017), and a heavy load to
carry; for which reason he laid it on her, probably placed it on her
head. It is well known that women can carry great weights when duly
positioned on their heads.

And she went into the city - The Hebrew has "he went," namely, Boaz,
where, accordingly, we find him [Rut
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#001).

[Ruth 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rut 3:16</span></span>

Who art thou, my daughter? - In the dim twilight [Rut
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#014) her mother was not sure at first
who the young woman was, who sought admittance into the house.
