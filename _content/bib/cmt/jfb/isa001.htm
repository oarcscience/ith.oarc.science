<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">isa 1:1</A></FONT></span></p>(Isa. 1:1-31)
<p>
<p>THE GENERAL TITLE OR PROGRAM applying to the entire book: this discountenances the Talmud tradition, that he was sawn asunder by Manasseh. 
<p>
<p>Isaiah--equivalent to "The Lord shall save"; significant of the subject of his prophecies. On "vision," see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#009">Sa1 9:9</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#006">Num 12:6</A>; and see my Introduction. 
<p>
<p>Judah and Jerusalem--Other nations also are the subjects of his prophecies; but only in their relation to the Jews (Isa. 13:1-23:18); so also the ten tribes of Israel are introduced only in the same relation (Isa. 7:1-9:21). Jerusalem is particularly specified, being the site of the temple, and the center of the theocracy, and the future throne of Messiah (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#002">Psa 48:2-3</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#009">Psa 48:9</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#017">Jer 3:17</A>). Jesus Christ is the "Lion of the tribe of Judah" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#005">Rev 5:5</A>). 
<p>
<p>Uzziah--called also Azariah (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#021">Kg2 14:21</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#001">Ch2 26:1</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#017">Ch2 26:17</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#020">Ch2 26:20</A>). The Old Testament prophecies spiritually interpret the histories, as the New Testament Epistles interpret the Gospels and Acts. Study them together, to see their spiritual relations. Isaiah prophesied for only a few years before Uzziah's death; but his prophecies of that period (Isa. 1:1-6:13) apply to Jotham's reign also, in which he probably wrote none; for Isa. 7:1-25 enters immediately on Ahaz' reign, after Uzziah in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#001">Isa 6:1-13</A>; the prophecies under Hezekiah follow next.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#002">Isaiah 1:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">isa 1:2</A></FONT></span></p>The very words of Moses (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#001">Deu 32:1</A>); this implies that the law was the charter and basis of all prophecy (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#020">Isa 8:20</A>). 
<p>
<p>Lord--Jehovah; in Hebrew, "the self-existing and promise-fulfilling, unchangeable One." The Jews never pronounced this holy name, but substituted Adonai. The English Version, LORD in capitals, marks the Hebrew "Jehovah," though Lord is rather equivalent to "Adonai" than "Jehovah." 
<p>
<p>children-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#022">Exo 4:22</A>). 
<p>
<p>rebelled--as sons (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#018">Deu 21:18</A>) and as subjects, God being king in the theocracy (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#010">Isa 63:10</A>). "Brought up," literally, "elevated," namely, to peculiar privileges (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#006">Jer 2:6-8</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#004">Rom 9:4-5</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#003">Isaiah 1:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">isa 1:3</A></FONT></span></p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#007">Jer 8:7</A>). 
<p>
<p>crib--the stall where it is fed (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#004">Pro 14:4</A>). Spiritually the word and ordinances. 
<p>
<p>Israel--The whole nation, Judah as well as Israel, in the restricted sense. God regards His covenant-people in their designed unity. 
<p>
<p>not know--namely, his Owner, as the parallelism requires; that is, not recognize Him as such (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005">Exo 19:5</A>, equivalent to "my people," <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#010">Joh 1:10-11</A>). 
<p>
<p>consider--attend to his Master (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#008">Isa 41:8</A>), notwithstanding the spiritual food which He provides (answering to "crib" in the parallel clause).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#004">Isaiah 1:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">isa 1:4</A></FONT></span></p>people--the peculiar designation of God's elect nation (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#010">Hos 1:10</A>), that they should be "laden with iniquity" is therefore the more monstrous. Sin is a load (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#004">Psa 38:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#028">Mat 11:28</A>). 
<p>
<p>seed--another appellation of God's elect (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#007">Gen 12:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#021">Jer 2:21</A>), designed to be a "holy seed" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#013">Isa 6:13</A>), but, awful to say, "evildoers!" 
<p>
<p>children--by adoption (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001">Hos 11:1</A>), yet "evildoers"; not only so, but "corrupters" of others (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#012">Gen 6:12</A>); the climax. So "nation--people--seed children." 
<p>
<p>provoked--literally, "despised," namely, so as to provoke (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#030">Pro 1:30-31</A>). 
<p>
<p>Holy One of Israel--the peculiar heinousness of their sin, that it was against their God (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#002">Amo 3:2</A>). 
<p>
<p>gone . . . backward--literally, "estranged" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#003">Psa 58:3</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#005">Isaiah 1:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">isa 1:5</A></FONT></span></p>Why--rather, as Vulgate, "On what part." Image from a body covered all over with marks of blows (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#003">Psa 38:3</A>). There is no part in which you have not been smitten. 
<p>
<p>head . . . sick, &amp;c.--not referring, as it is commonly quoted, to their sins, but to the universality of their punishment. However, sin, the moral disease of the head or intellect, and the heart, is doubtless made its own punishment (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#031">Pro 1:31</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#019">Jer 2:19</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#011">Hos 8:11</A>). "Sick," literally, "is in a state of sickness" [GESENIUS]; "has passed into sickness" [MAURER].
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#006">Isaiah 1:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">isa 1:6</A></FONT></span></p>From the lowest to the highest of the people; "the ancient and honorable, the head, the prophet that teacheth lies, the tail." See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#013">Isa 9:13-16</A>. He first states their wretched condition, obvious to all (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#006">Isa 1:6-9</A>); and then, not previously, their irreligious state, the cause of it. 
<p>
<p>wounds--judicially inflicted (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#013">Hos 5:13</A>). 
<p>
<p>mollified with ointment--The art of medicine in the East consists chiefly in external applications (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#034">Luk 10:34</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#014">Jam 5:14</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#007">Isaiah 1:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">isa 1:7</A></FONT></span></p>Judah had not in Uzziah's reign recovered from the ravages of the Syrians in Joash's reign (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#024">Ch2 24:24</A>), and of Israel in Amaziah's reign (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#013">Ch2 25:13</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#023">Ch2 25:23</A>, &amp;c.). Compare Isaiah's contemporary (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#006">Amo 4:6-11</A>), where, as here (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#009">Isa 1:9-10</A>), Israel is compared to "Sodom and Gomorrah," because of the judgments on it by "fire." 
<p>
<p>in your presence--before your eyes: without your being able to prevent them. 
<p>
<p>desolate, &amp;c.--literally, "there is desolation, such as one might look for from foreign" invaders.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#008">Isaiah 1:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">isa 1:8</A></FONT></span></p>daughter of Zion--the city (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#014">Psa 9:14</A>), Jerusalem and its inhabitants (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#021">Kg2 19:21</A>): "daughter" (feminine, singular being used as a neuter collective noun), equivalent to sons (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#006">Isa 12:6</A>, Margin) [MAURER]. Metropolis or "mother-city" is the corresponding term. The idea of youthful beauty is included in "daughter." 
<p>
<p>left--as a remnant escaping the general destruction. 
<p>
<p>cottage--a hut, made to give temporary shelter to the caretaker of the vineyard. 
<p>
<p>lodge--not permanent. 
<p>
<p>besieged--rather, as "left," and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#009">Isa 1:9</A> require, preserved, namely, from the desolation all round [MAURER].
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#009">Isaiah 1:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">isa 1:9</A></FONT></span></p>Jehovah of Sabaoth, that is, God of the angelic and starry hosts (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#005">Psa 59:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#004">Psa 147:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#002">Psa 148:2</A>). The latter were objects of idolatry, called hence Sabaism (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#016">Kg2 17:16</A>). God is above even them (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#026">Ch1 16:26</A>). "The groves" were symbols of these starry hosts; it was their worship of Sabaoth instead of the Lord of Sabaoth, which had caused the present desolation (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#018">Ch2 24:18</A>). It needed no less a power than His, to preserve even a "remnant." Condescending grace for the elect's sake, since He has no need of us, seeing that He has countless hosts to serve Him.

Positive precepts are only means; moral obedience is the end. A foreshadowing of the gospel, when the One real sacrifice was to supersede all the shadowy ones, and "bring in everlasting righteousness" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006">Psa 40:6-7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024">Dan 9:24-27</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#001">Heb 10:1-14</A>). 
<p>
<p>full--to satiety; weary of 
<p>
<p>burnt offerings--burnt whole, except the blood, which was sprinkled about the altar. 
<p>
<p>fat--not to be eaten by man, but burnt on the altar (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#004">Lev 3:4-5</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#011">Lev 3:11</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#017">Lev 3:17</A>).

<p>
<p>who hath required this--as if you were doing God a service by such hypocritical offerings (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#007">Job 35:7</A>). God did require it (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#017">Exo 23:17</A>), but not in this spirit (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#006">Mic 6:6-7</A>). 
<p>
<p>courts--areas, in which the worshippers were. None but priests entered the temple itself.
<p>

<p>
<p>incense--put upon the sacrifices, and burnt on the altar of incense. Type of prayer (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#002">Psa 141:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#003">Rev 8:3</A>).

Hebrew, "bloods," for all heinous sins, persecution of God's servants especially (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#035">Mat 23:35</A>). It was the vocation of the prophets to dispel the delusion, so contrary to the law itself (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#016">Deu 10:16</A>), that outward ritualism would satisfy God.

<p>scarlet--the color of Jesus Christ's robe when bearing our "sins" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#028">Mat 27:28</A>). So Rahab's thread (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#018">Jos 2:18</A>; compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#004">Lev 14:4</A>). The rabbins say that when the lot used to be taken, a scarlet fillet was bound on the scapegoat's head, and after the high priest had confessed his and the people's sins over it, the fillet became white: the miracle ceased, according to them, forty years before the destruction of Jerusalem, that is, exactly when Jesus Christ was crucified; a remarkable admission of adversaries. Hebrew for "scarlet" radically means double-dyed; so the deep-fixed permanency of sin in the heart, which no mere tears can wash away. 
<p>
<p>snow-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#007">Psa 51:7</A>).

<p>as wool--restored to its original undyed whiteness. This verse shows that the old fathers did not look only for transitory promises (Article VII, Book of Common Prayer). For sins of ignorance, and such like, alone had trespass offerings appointed for them; greater guilt therefore needed a greater sacrifice, for, "without shedding of blood there was no remission"; but none such was appointed, and yet forgiveness was promised and expected; therefore spiritual Jews must have looked for the One Mediator of both Old Testament and New Testament, though dimly understood.

<p>mixed--literally, "circumcised." So the Arabic, "to murder" wine, equivalent to dilute it.

<p>
<p>converts--so MAURER. But Margin, "they that return of her," namely the remnant that return from captivity. However, as Isaiah had not yet expressly foretold the Babylonian captivity, the English Version is better.

<p>oaks--Others translate the "terebinth" or "turpentine tree." Groves were dedicated to idols. Our Druids took their name from the Greek for "oaks." A sacred tree is often found in Assyrian sculpture; symbol of the starry hosts, Saba. 
<p>
<p>gardens--planted enclosures for idolatry; the counterpart of the garden of Eden.

The leaf of the idol oak fades by a law of necessary consequence, having no living sap or "water" from God. So "garden" answers to "gardens" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#029">Isa 1:29</A>).

<p>both--the wicked ruler, and "his work," which "is as a spark."
