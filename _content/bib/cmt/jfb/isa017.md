### [Isaiah Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#001)

[Isaiah 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 17:1</span></span>

PROPHECY CONCERNING DAMASCUS AND ITS ALLY SAMARIA, that is, Syria and
Israel, which had leagued together (seventh and eighth chapters). ([Isa
17:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#001))

Damascus--put before Israel (Ephraim, [Isa
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#003)), which is chiefly referred to in
what follows, because it was the prevailing power in the league; with it
Ephraim either stood or fell (Isa. 7:1-25).

[Isaiah 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 17:2</span></span>

cities of Aroer--that is, the cities round Aroer, and under its
jurisdiction \[GESENIUS\]. So "cities with their villages" ([Jos
15:44](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#044)); "Heshbon and all her cities"
([Jos 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#017)). Aroer was near
Rabbahammon, at the river of Gad, an arm of the Jabbok ([Sa2
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#005)), founded by the Gadites ([Num
32:34](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#034)).

for flocks-- ([Isa 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#017)).

[Isaiah 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 17:3</span></span>

fortress . . . cease--The strongholds shall be pulled down (Samaria
especially: [Hos 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#014); [Mic
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#006); [Hab
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#010)).

remnant of Syria--all that was left after the overthrow by
Tiglath-pileser ([Kg2 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#009)).

as the glory of . . . Israel--They shall meet with the same fate as
Israel, their ally.

[Isaiah 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 17:4</span></span>

glory of Jacob--the kingdom of Ephraim and all that they rely on ([Hos
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#002); [Mic
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#005)).

fatness . . . lean--(See on [Isa
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#016)).

[Isaiah 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 17:5</span></span>

harvestman, &c.--The inhabitants and wealth of Israel shall be swept
away, and but few left behind just as the husbandman gathers the corn
and the fruit, and leaves only a few gleaning ears and grapes ([Kg2
18:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#009)).

with his arm--He collects the standing grain with one arm, so that he
can cut it with the sickle in the other hand.

Rephaim--a fertile plain at the southwest of Jerusalem toward Beth-lehem
and the country of the Philistines ([Sa2
5:18-22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#018)).

[Isaiah 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 17:6</span></span>

in it--that is, in the land of Israel.

two or three . . . in the top--A few poor inhabitants shall be left in
Israel, like the two or three olive berries left on the topmost boughs,
which it is not worth while taking the trouble to try to reach.

[Isaiah 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 17:7</span></span>

look to his Maker--instead of trusting in their fortresses-- ([Isa
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#003); [Mic
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#007)).

[Isaiah 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 17:8</span></span>

groves--A symbolical tree is often found in Assyrian inscriptions,
representing the hosts of heaven ("Saba"), answering to Ashteroth or
Astarte, the queen of heaven, as Baal or Bel is the king. Hence the
expression, "image of the grove," is explained ([Kg2
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#007)).

images--literally, "images to the sun," that is, to Baal, who answers to
the sun, as Astarte to the hosts of heaven ([Kg2
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#005); [Job
31:26](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#026)).

[Isaiah 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 17:9</span></span>

forsaken bough--rather "the leavings of woods," what the axeman leaves
when he cuts down the grove (compare [Isa
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#006)).

which they left because of--rather, "which (the enemies) shall leave for
the children of Israel"; literally, "shall leave (in departing) from
before the face of the children of Israel" \[MAURER\]. But a few cities
out of many shall be left to Israel, by the purpose of God, executed by
the Assyrian.

[Isaiah 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 17:10</span></span>

forgotten . . . God of . . . salvation . . . rock-- ([Deu
32:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#015), [Deu
32:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#018)).

plants--rather, "nursery grounds," "pleasure-grounds" \[MAURER\].

set in--rather, "set them," the pleasure-grounds.

strange slips--cuttings of plants from far, and therefore valuable.

[Isaiah 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 17:11</span></span>

In the day . . . thy plant--rather, "In the day of thy planting"
\[HORSLEY\].

shalt . . . make . . . grow--MAURER translates, "Thou didst fence it,"
namely, the pleasure-ground. The parallel clause, "Make . . . flourish,"
favors English Version. As soon as thou plantest, it grows.

in the morning--that is, immediately after; so in [Psa
90:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#014), the Hebrew, "in the morning,"
is translated "early."

but . . . shall be a heap--rather, "but (promising as was the prospect)
the harvest is gone" \[HORSLEY\].

in . . . day of grief--rather, "in the day of (expected) possession"
\[MAURER\]. "In the day of inundation" \[HORSLEY\].

of desperate sorrow--rather, "And the sorrow shall be desperate or
irremediable." In English Version "heap" and "sorrow" may be taken
together by hendiadys. "The heap of the harvest shall be desperate
sorrow" \[ROSENMULLER\].

The connection of this fragment with what precedes is: notwithstanding
the calamities coming on Israel, the people of God shall not be utterly
destroyed ([Isa 6:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#012)); the Assyrian
spoilers shall perish ([Isa 17:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#013)).

[Isaiah 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 17:12</span></span>

SUDDEN DESTRUCTION OF A GREAT ARMY IN JUDEA (namely that of the Assyrian
Sennacherib), AND ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE EVENT TO THE ETHIOPIAN
AMBASSADORS. (Isa. 17:12-18:7)

Woe . . . multitude--rather, "Ho (Hark)! a noise of," &c. The prophet in
vision perceives the vast and mixed Assyrian hosts (Hebrew, "many
peoples," see on [Isa 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#026)): on the
hills of Judah (so "mountains," [Isa
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#013)): but at the "rebuke" of God,
they shall "flee as chaff."

to the rushing . . . that make--rather, "the roaring . . . roareth"
(compare [Isa 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#007); [Jer
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#023)).

[Isaiah 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 17:13</span></span>

shall . . . shall--rather, "God rebuketh ([Psa
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#005)) them, and they flee--are chased";
the event is set before the eyes as actually present, not future.

chaff of . . . mountains--Threshing floors in the East are in the open
air on elevated places, so as to catch the wind which separates the
chaff from the wheat ([Psa 88:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#013); [Hos
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#003)).

rolling thing--anything that rolls: stubble.

[Isaiah 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 17:14</span></span>

eventide . . . before morning--fulfilled to the letter in the
destruction "before morning" of the vast host that "at eveningtide" was
such a terror ("trouble") to Judah; on the phrase see [Psa
90:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#006); [Psa
30:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#005).

he is not--namely, the enemy.

us--the Jews. A general declaration of the doom that awaits the foes of
God's people ([Isa 54:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#017)).

Isaiah announces the overthrow of Sennacherib's hosts and desires the
Ethiopian ambassadors, now in Jerusalem, to bring word of it to their
own nation; and he calls on the whole world to witness the event ([Isa
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#003)). As [Isa
17:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#012) announced the presence of the
foe, so [Isa 18:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#001) foretells his
overthrow.
