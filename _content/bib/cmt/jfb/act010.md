### [Acts Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#001)

[Acts 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 10:1</span></span>

ACCESSION AND BAPTISM OF CORNELIUS AND HIS PARTY; OR, THE FIRST-FRUITS
OF THE GENTILES. (Acts 10:1-48)

CÃ&brvbr;sarea--(See on [Act 8:40](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#040)).

the Italian band--a cohort of Italians, as distinguished from native
soldiers, quartered at CÃ&brvbr;sarea, probably as a bodyguard to the
Roman procurator who resided there. An ancient coin makes express
mention of such a cohort in Syria. \[AKERMAN, Numismatic Illustrations
of the New Testament.\]

[Acts 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 10:2</span></span>

A devout man, &c.--an uncircumcised Gentile proselyte to the Jewish
faith, of whom there were a very great number at this time; a
distinguished proselyte, who had brought his whole household
establishment under the hallowing influence of the Jewish faith and the
regular observance of its principal seasons of worship.

gave much alms to the people--that is, the Jewish people, on the same
principle as another centurion before him ([Luk
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#005)); thinking it no "great thing," if
they had "sown unto him spiritual things, that they should reap his
carnal things" ([Co1 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#011)).

prayed to God alway--at the stated daily seasons. (See on [Act
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#003)).

[Acts 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 10:3</span></span>

saw . . . evidently--"distinctly."

the ninth hour of the day--three o'clock, the hour of the evening
sacrifice. But he had been "fasting until that hour" ([Act
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#030)), perhaps from the sixth hour
([Act 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#009)).

[Acts 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 10:4</span></span>

What is it, Lord?--language which, tremulously though it was uttered,
betokened childlike reverence and humility.

Thy prayers and thine alms--The way in which both are specified is
emphatic. The one denotes the spiritual outgoing of his soul to God, the
other its practical outgoing to men.

are come up for a memorial before God--that is, as a sacrifice
well-pleasing unto God, as an odor of a sweet smell ([Rev
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#004)).

[Acts 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 10:5</span></span>

send to Joppa . . . for one Simon, &c.--(See on [Act
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#011)).

[Acts 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 10:7</span></span>

when the angel . . . was departed, he called--immediately doing as
directed, and thereby showing the simplicity of his faith.

a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually--of the
"soldiers under him," such as the centurion at Capernaum had ([Mat
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#009)). Who this "devout soldier" was,
can only be matter of conjecture. DA COSTA \[Four Witnesses\] gives a
number of ingenious reasons for thinking that, having attached himself
henceforth to Peter--whose influence in the composition of the second
Gospel is attested by the earliest tradition, and is stamped on that
Gospel itself--he is no other than the Evangelist Mark.

[Acts 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 10:9</span></span>

upon the housetop--the flat roof, the chosen place in the East for cool
retirement.

the sixth hour--noon.

[Acts 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 10:10</span></span>

a trance--differing from the "vision" of Cornelius, in so far as the
things seen had not the same objective reality, though both were
supernatural.

[Acts 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 10:12</span></span>

all manner of four-footed beasts, &c.--that is, the clean and the
unclean (ceremonially) all mixed together.

[Acts 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 10:14</span></span>

Not so, Lord--See Marginal reference.

I have never eaten anything that is common--that is, not sanctified by
divine permission to eat of it, and so "unclean." "The distinction of
meats was a sacrament of national distinction, separation, and
consecration" \[WEBSTER and WILKINSON\].

[Acts 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 10:15</span></span>

What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common--The ceremonial
distinctions are at an end, and Gentiles, ceremonially separated from
the chosen people ([Act 10:28](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#028)), and
debarred from that access to God in the visible ordinances of His Church
which they enjoyed, are now on a perfect equality with them.

[Acts 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">act 10:16</span></span>

done thrice--See [Gen 41:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#032).

[Acts 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">act 10:17</span></span>

while Peter doubted . . . what this should mean, behold, the three men .
. . stood before the gate . . . and asked--"were inquiring," that is, in
the act of doing so. The preparations here made--of Peter for his
Gentile visitors, as of Cornelius for him--are devoutly to be noted. But
besides this, at the same moment, "the Spirit" expressly informs him
that three men were inquiring for him, and bids him unhesitatingly go
with them, as sent by Him.

[Acts 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 10:21</span></span>

I am he whom ye seek--This seems to have been said without any
communication being made to Peter regarding the men or their errand.

[Acts 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 10:22</span></span>

they said, Cornelius . . . a just man, &c.--fine testimony this from his
own servants.

of good report among all the nation of the Jews--specified, no doubt, to
conciliate the favorable regard of the Jewish apostle.

to hear words of thee--(See on [Act
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#014)).

[Acts 10:23](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 10:23</span></span>

called them in and lodged them--thus partially anticipating this
fellowship with Gentiles.

Peter went . . . with them, and certain brethren--six in number ([Act
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#012)).

from Joppa--as witnesses of a transaction which Peter was prepared to
believe pregnant with great consequences.

[Acts 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 10:24</span></span>

Cornelius . . . called together his kinsmen and near friends--implying
that he had been long enough at CÃ&brvbr;sarea to form relationships
there and that he had intimate friends there whose presence he was not
ashamed to invite to a religious meeting of the most solemn nature.

[Acts 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 10:25</span></span>

as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him--a mark of the highest
respect.

fell down at his feet, and worshipped him--In the East this way of
showing respect was customary not only to kings, but to others occupying
a superior station; but among the Greeks and Romans it was reserved for
the gods. Peter, therefore, declines it as due to no mortal \[GROTIUS\].
"Those who claim to have succeeded Peter, have not imitated this part of
his conduct" \[ALFORD\] (therein only verifying [Th2
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#004), and compare [Rev
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#010); [Rev
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#009)).

[Acts 10:28](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">act 10:28</span></span>

Ye know it is . . . unlawful . . . for . . . a Jew to keep company, or
come unto one of another nation, &c.--There was no express prohibition
to this effect, and to a Certain extent intercourse was certainly kept
up. (See the Gospel history, towards the end). But intimate social
fellowship was not practiced, as being adverse to the spirit of the law.

[Acts 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">act 10:29</span></span>

I ask therefore, &c.--The whole speech is full of dignity, the apostle
seeing in the company before him a new brotherhood, into whose devout
and inquiring minds he was divinely directed to pour the light of new
truth.

[Acts 10:30](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">act 10:30</span></span>

Four days ago--the messengers being despatched on the first; on the
second reaching Joppa ([Act 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#009));
starting for CÃ&brvbr;sarea on the third; and on the fourth arriving.

[Acts 10:33](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">act 10:33</span></span>

we are all here present before God, to hear all things that are
commanded thee of God--Beautiful expression of entire preparedness to
receive the expected divine teaching through the lips of this
heaven-commissioned teacher, and delightful encouragement to Peter to
give free utterance to what was doubtless already on his lips!

[Acts 10:34](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">act 10:34</span></span>

Peter opened his mouth--(See on [Mat
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#002)).

Of a truth I perceive--that is, "I have it now demonstrated before mine
eyes."

that God is no respecter of persons--Not, "I see there is no capricious
favoritism with God," for Peter would never imagine such a thing; but
(as the next clause shows), "I see that God has respect only to personal
character and state in the acceptance of men, national and
ecclesiastical distinctions being of no account."

[Acts 10:35](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">act 10:35</span></span>

But in every nation--not (observe), in every religion; according to a
common distortion of these words.

he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness--This being the
well-known phraseology of the Old Testament in describing the truly
godly man, within the pale of revealed religion, it cannot be alleged
that Peter meant it to denote a merely virtuous character, in the
heathen sense; and as Peter had learned enough, from the messengers of
Cornelius and from his own lips, to convince him that the whole
religious character of this Roman officer had been moulded in the Jewish
faith, there can be no doubt that the apostle intended to describe
exactly such saintship--in its internal spirituality and external
fruitfulness--as God had already pronounced to be genuine and approved.
And since to such "He giveth more grace," according to the law of His
Kingdom ([Jam 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#006); [Mat
25:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#029)), He sends Peter, not to be the
instrument of his conversion, as this is very frequently called, but
simply to "show him the way of God more perfectly," as before to the
devout Ethiopian eunuch.

[Acts 10:36](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">act 10:36</span></span>

the word . . . sent unto the children of Israel--for to them (he would
have them distinctly know) the Gospel was first preached, even as the
facts of it took place on the special theater of the ancient economy.

preaching peace by Jesus Christ--the glorious sum of all Gospel truth
([Co1 1:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#020)).

he is Lord of all--exalted to embrace under the canopy of His peace, Jew
and Gentile alike, whom the blood of His Cross had cemented into one
reconciled and accepted family of God ([Eph
2:13-18](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#013)).

[Acts 10:37](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">act 10:37</span></span>

That word . . . ye how--The facts, it seems, were too notorious and
extraordinary to be unknown to those who mixed so much with Jews, and
took so tender an interest in all Jewish matters as they did; though,
like the eunuch, they knew not the significance of them.

which was published throughout all Judea, and began from Galilee--(See
[Luk 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#014), [Luk
4:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#037), [Luk
4:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#044); [Luk
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#017); [Luk
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#006); [Luk
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#005)).

after the baptism which John preached--(See on [Act
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#022)).

[Acts 10:38](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">act 10:38</span></span>

Now God anointed Jesus of Nazareth--rather, "Jesus of Nazareth (as the
burden of that 'published word'), how God anointed Him."

with the Holy Ghost and with power--that is, at His baptism, thus
visibly proclaiming Him MESSIAH, "the Lord's Christ." See [Luk
4:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#018). For it is not His unction for
personal holiness at His incarnation that is referred to--as many of the
Fathers and some moderns take it--but His investiture with the insignia
of the Messianic office, in which He presented Himself after His baptism
to the acceptance of the people.

went about doing good--holding up the beneficent character of all His
miracles, which was their predicted character ([Isa
35:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#005), &c.).

healing all that were oppressed of the devil--whether in the form of
demoniacal possessions, or more indirectly, as in her "whom Satan had
bound with a spirit of infirmity eighteen years" ([Luk
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#016)); thereby showing Himself the
Redeemer from all evil.

for God was with him--Thus gently does the apostle rise to the supreme
dignity of Christ with which he closes, accommodating himself to his
hearers.

[Acts 10:39](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">act 10:39</span></span>

we are witnesses of all . . . he did--not objects of superstitious
reverence, but simply witnesses to the great historical facts on which
the Gospel is founded.

slew and hanged--that is, slew by hanging.

on a tree--So [Act 5:30](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#030) (and see on
[Gal 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#013)).

[Acts 10:40](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">act 10:40</span></span>

showed him openly; Not to all the people--for it was not fitting that He
should subject Himself, in His risen condition, to a second rejection in
Person.

but unto witnesses chosen before of God . . . to us, who did eat and
drink with him after he rose, &c.--Not the less certain, therefore, was
the fact of His resurrection, though withholding Himself from general
gaze in His risen body.

he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead--He had
before proclaimed Him "Lord of all," for the dispensing of "peace" to
all alike; now he announces Him in the same supreme lordship, for the
exercise of judgment upon all alike. On this divine ordination, see [Joh
5:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#022), [Joh
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#027); [Act
17:31](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#031). Thus we have here all Gospel
truth in brief. But, forgiveness through this exalted One is the closing
note of Peter's beautifully simple discourse.

[Acts 10:43](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">act 10:43</span></span>

To him give all the prophets witness--that is, This is the burden,
generally of the prophetic testimony. It was fitter thus to give the
spirit of their testimony, than to quote them in detail on such an
occasion. But let this apostolic statement of the evangelical import of
the Old Testament writings be devoutly weighed by those who are disposed
to rationalize away this element in the Old Testament.

whosoever believeth in him--This was evidently said with special
reference to the Gentile audience then before him, and formed a noble
practical conclusion to the whole discourse.

[Acts 10:44](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">act 10:44</span></span>

While Peter yet spake . . . the Holy Ghost fell--by visible and audible
manifestation ([Act 10:46](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#046)).

[Acts 10:45](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#045)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">act 10:45</span></span>

they of the circumcision . . . were astonished . . . because that on the
Gentiles also was poured out, &c.--without circumcision.

[Acts 10:46](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#046)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">act 10:46</span></span>

heard them speak with tongues and magnify God--As on the day of
Pentecost it was no empty miracle, no mere speaking of foreign
languages, but utterance of "the wonderful works of God" in tongues to
them unknown ([Act 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#011)), so here; but
more remarkable in this case, as the speakers were perhaps less familiar
with the Old Testament songs of praise.

Then answered Peter, Can any man forbid water . . . which have received
the Holy Ghost, &c.--Mark, he does not say, They have received the
Spirit, what need have they for water? but, Having the living
discipleship imparted to them and visibly stamped upon them, what
objection can there be to admitting them, by the seal of baptism, into
the full fellowship of the Church?

[Acts 10:47](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#047)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">act 10:47</span></span>

which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we--and are thus, in all
that is essential to salvation, on a level with ourselves.

[Acts 10:48](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#048)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">act 10:48</span></span>

he commanded them to be baptized--not doing it with his own hands, as
neither did Paul, save on rare occasions ([Co1
1:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#014); compare [Act
2:38](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#038); [Joh
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#002)).

prayed . . . him to tarry certain days--"golden days" \[BENGEL\], spent,
doubtless, in refreshing Christian fellowship, and in imparting and
receiving fuller teaching on the several topics of the apostle's
discourse.
