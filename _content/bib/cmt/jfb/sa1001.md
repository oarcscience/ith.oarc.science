### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 1:1</span></span>

OF ELKANAH AND HIS TWO WIVES. ([Sa1
1:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001))

a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim--The first word being in the dual
number, signifies the double city--the old and new town of Ramah ([Sa1
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#019)). There were five cities of this
name, all on high ground. This city had the addition of Zophim attached
to it, because it was founded by Zuph, "an Ephrathite," that is a native
of Ephratha. Beth-lehem, and the expression "of Ramathaim-zophim" must,
therefore, be understood as Ramah in the land of Zuph in the hill
country of Ephratha. Others, considering "mount Ephraim" as pointing to
the locality in Joseph's territory, regard "Zophim" not as a proper but
a common noun, signifying watchtowers, or watchmen, with reference
either to the height of its situation, or its being the residence of
prophets who were watchmen ([Eze
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#017)). Though a native of Ephratha or
Beth-lehem-judah ([Rut 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#002)), Elkanah
was a Levite ([Ch1 6:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#033)). Though of
this order, and a good man, he practised polygamy. This was contrary to
the original law, but it seems to have been prevalent among the Hebrews
in those days, when there was no king in Israel, and every man did what
seemed right in his own eyes \[[Jdg
21:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#025)\].

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 1:3</span></span>

this man went up out of his city yearly to worship in Shiloh--In that
place was the "earth's one sanctuary," and thither he repaired at the
three solemn feasts, accompanied by his family at one of them--probably
the passover. Although a Levite, he could not personally offer a
sacrifice--that was exclusively the office of the priests; and his piety
in maintaining a regular attendance on the divine ordinances is the more
worthy of notice because the character of the two priests who
administered them was notoriously bad. But doubtless he believed, and
acted on the belief, that the ordinances were "effectual means of
salvation, not from any virtue in them, or in those who administered
them, but from the grace of God being communicated through them."

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa1 1:4</span></span>

when . . . Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah . . . portions--The
offerer received back the greater part of the peace offerings, which he
and his family or friends were accustomed to eat at a social feast
before the Lord. (See on [Lev 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#003);
[Deu 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#012)). It was out of these
consecrated viands Elkanah gave portions to all the members of his
family; but "unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion"; that is, a larger
choice, according to the Eastern fashion of showing regard to beloved or
distinguished guests. (See on [Sa1
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#024); also see on [Gen
43:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#034)).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 1:6</span></span>

her adversary also provoked her sore--The conduct of Peninnah was most
unbecoming. But domestic broils in the houses of polygamists are of
frequent occurrence, and the most fruitful cause of them has always been
jealousy of the husband's superior affection, as in this case of Hannah.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa1 1:11</span></span>

HANNAH'S PRAYER. ([Sa1 1:9-18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#009))

she prayed . . . she vowed a vow--Here is a specimen of the intense
desire that reigned in the bosoms of the Hebrew women for children. This
was the burden of Hannah's prayer; and the strong preference she
expressed for a male child originated in her purpose of dedicating him
to the tabernacle service. The circumstance of his birth bound him to
this; but his residence within the precincts of the sanctuary would have
to commence at an earlier age than usual, in consequence of the Nazarite
vow.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa1 1:12</span></span>

Eli marked her mouth--The suspicion of the aged priest seems to indicate
that the vice of intemperance was neither uncommon nor confined to one
sex in those times of disorder. This mistaken impression was immediately
removed, and, in the words, "God grant," or rather, "will grant," was
followed by an invocation which, as Hannah regarded it in the light of a
prophecy pointing to the accomplishment of her earnest desire, dispelled
her sadness, and filled her with confident hope \[[Sa1
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#018)\]. The character and services of
the expected child were sufficiently important to make his birth a fit
subject for prophecy.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa1 1:20</span></span>

SAMUEL BORN. ([Sa1 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#020))

called his name Samuel--doubtless with her husband's consent. The names
of children were given sometimes by the fathers, and sometimes by the
mothers (see [Gen 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#001), [Gen
4:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#026); [Gen
5:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#029); [Gen
19:37](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#037); [Gen
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#003)); and among the early Hebrews,
they were commonly compound names, one part including the name of God.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa1 1:21</span></span>

the man Elkanah . . . went up to offer . . . his vow--The solemn
expression of his concurrence in Hannah's vow was necessary to make it
obligatory. (See on [Num 30:3](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#003)).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">sa1 1:22</span></span>

But Hannah went not up--Men only were obliged to attend the solemn
feasts ([Exo 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#017)). But Hannah, like
other pious women, was in the habit of going, only she deemed it more
prudent and becoming to defer her next journey till her son's age would
enable her to fulfill her vow.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">sa1 1:24</span></span>

three bullocks--The Septuagint renders it "a bullock of three years
old"; which is probably the true rendering.
