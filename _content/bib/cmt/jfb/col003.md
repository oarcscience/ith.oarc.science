### [Colossians Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#001)

[Colossians 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">col 3:1</span></span>

EXHORTATIONS TO HEAVENLY AIMS, AS OPPOSED TO EARTHLY, ON THE GROUND OF
UNION TO THE RISEN SAVIOUR; TO MORTIFY AND PUT OFF THE OLD MAN, AND TO
PUT ON THE NEW; IN CHARITY, HUMILITY, WORDS OF EDIFICATION,
THANKFULNESS; RELATIVE DUTIES. (Col. 3:1-25)

If . . . then--The connection with [Col
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#018), [Col
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#023), is, he had condemned the
"fleshly mind" and the "satiating to the full the flesh"; in contrast to
this he now says, "If then ye have been once for all raised up (Greek,
aorist tense) together with Christ" (namely, at your conversion and
baptism, [Rom 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#004)).

seek those things . . . above-- ([Mat
6:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#033); [Phi
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#020)).

sitteth--rather, as Greek, "Where Christ is, sitting on the right of
God" ([Eph 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#020)). The Head being
quickened, the members are also quickened with Him. Where the Head is,
there the members must be. The contrast is between the believer's former
state, alive to the world but dead to God, and his present state, dead
to the world but alive to God; and between the earthly abode of the
unbeliever and the heavenly abode of the believer ([Co1
15:47-48](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#047)). We are already seated there
in Him as our Head; and hereafter shall be seated by Him, as the
Bestower of our bliss. As Elisha ([Kg2
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#002)) said to Elijah when about to
ascend, "As the Lord liveth . . . I will not leave thee"; so we must
follow the ascended Saviour with the wings of our meditations and the
chariots of our affections. We should trample upon and subdue our lusts
that our conversation may correspond to our Saviour's condition; that
where the eyes of apostles were forced to leave Him, thither our
thoughts may follow Him ([Mat 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#021);
[Joh 12:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#032)) \[PEARSON\]. Of ourselves
we can no more ascend than a bar of iron lift itself up' from the earth.
But the love of Christ is a powerful magnet to draw us up ([Eph
2:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#005)). The design of the Gospel is
not merely to give rules, but mainly to supply motives to holiness.

[Colossians 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">col 3:2</span></span>

Translate, "Set your mind on the things above, not on the things," &c.
([Col 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#020)). Contrast "who mind
earthly things" ([Phi 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#019)). Whatever
we make an idol of, will either be a cross to us if we be believers, or
a curse to us if unbelievers.

[Colossians 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">col 3:3</span></span>

The Greek aorist tense implies, "For ye have died once for all" ([Col
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#012); [Rom
6:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#004)). It is not said, Ye must die
practically to the world in order to become dead with Christ; but the
latter is assumed as once for all having taken place in the
regeneration; what believers are told is, Develop this spiritual life in
practice. "No one longs for eternal, incorruptible, and immortal life,
unless he be wearied of this temporal, corruptible, and mortal life"
\[AUGUSTINE\].

and your life . . . hid-- ([Psa 83:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#003));
like a seed buried in the earth; compare "planted," [Rom
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#005). Compare [Mat
13:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#031), [Mat
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#033), "like . . . leaven . . . hid."
As the glory of Christ now is hid from the world, so also the glory of
believers' inner life, proceeding from communion with Him, is still
hidden with Christ in God; but ([Col
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#004)) when Christ, the Source of this
life, shall manifest Himself in glory, then shall their hidden glory be
manifest, and correspond in appearance to its original \[NEANDER\]. The
Christian's secret communion with God will now at times make itself seen
without his intending it ([Mat 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#014),
[Mat 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#016)); but his full manifestation
is at Christ's manifestation ([Mat
13:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#043); [Rom
8:19-23](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#019)). "It doth not yet appear
(Greek, 'is not yet manifested') what we shall be" ([Jo1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#002); [Pe1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#007)). As yet Christians do not always
recognize the "life" of one another, so hidden is it, and even at times
doubt as to their own life, so weak is it, and so harassed with
temptations (Psa. 51:1-19; Rom. 7:1-25).

in God--to whom Christ has ascended. Our "life" is "laid up for" us in
God ([Col 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#005)), and is secured by the
decree of Him who is invisible to the world ([Ti2
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#008)).

[Colossians 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">col 3:4</span></span>

Translate, "When Christ shall be manifested who is our life ([Joh
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#025); [Joh
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#006), [Joh
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#019)), then shall ye also with Him be
manifested in glory" ([Pe1 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#013)). The
spiritual life our souls have now in Him shall be extended to our bodies
([Rom 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#011)).

then--and not till then. Those err who think to find a perfect Church
before then. The true Church is now militant. Rome errs in trying to set
up a Church now regnant and triumphant. The true Church shall be visible
as a perfect and reigning Church, when Christ shall be visibly
manifested as her reigning Head. Rome having ceased to look for Him in
patient faith, has set up a visible mockhead, a false anticipation of
the millennial kingdom. The Papacy took to itself by robbery that glory
which is an object of hope, and can only be reached by bearing the cross
now. When the Church became a harlot, she ceased to be a bride who goes
to meet her Bridegroom. Hence the millennial kingdom ceased to be looked
for \[AUBERLEN\].

[Colossians 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">col 3:5</span></span>

Mortify--Greek, "make a corpse of"; "make dead"; "put to death."

therefore--(See on [Col 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#003)). Follow
out to its necessary consequence the fact of your having once for all
died with Christ spiritually at your regeneration, by daily "deadening
your members," of which united "the body of the sins of the flesh"
consists (compare [Col 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#011)). "The
members" to be mortified are the fleshly instruments of lust, in so far
as the members of the body are abused to such purposes. Habitually
repress and do violence to corrupt desires of which the members are the
instruments (compare [Rom 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#019); [Rom
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#013); [Gal
5:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#024)).

upon the earth--where they find their support \[BENGEL\] (Compare [Col
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#002), "things on earth"). See [Eph
5:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#003).

inordinate affection--"lustful passion."

evil concupiscence--more general than the last \[ALFORD\], the disorder
of the external senses; "lustful passion," lust within \[BENGEL\].

covetousness--marked off by the Greek article as forming a whole genus
by itself, distinct from the genus containing the various species just
enumerated. It implies a self-idolizing, grasping spirit; far worse than
another Greek term translated "the love of money" ([Ti1
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#010)).

which is--that is, inasmuch as it is "idolatry." Compare Note, see on
[Eph 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#019), on its connection with sins
of impurity. Self and mammon are deified in the heart instead of God
([Mat 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#024); see on [Eph
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#005)).

[Colossians 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">col 3:6</span></span>

(See on [Eph 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#006).)

[Colossians 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">col 3:7</span></span>

sometime--"once."

walked . . . when ye lived in them--These sins were the very element in
which ye "lived" (before ye became once for all dead with Christ to
them); no wonder, then, that ye "walked" in them. Compare on the
opposite side, "living in the Spirit," having as its legitimate
consequence, "walking in the Spirit" ([Gal
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#025)). The "living" comes first in
both cases, the walking follows.

[Colossians 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">col 3:8</span></span>

But now--that ye are no longer living in them.

ye also--like other believers; answering to "ye also" ([Col
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#007)) like other unbelievers formerly.

put off--"Do ye also put away all these," namely, those just enumerated,
and those which follow \[ALFORD\].

anger, wrath--(See on [Eph 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#031)).

blasphemy--rather, "reviling," "evil-speaking," as it is translated in
[Eph 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#031).

filthy communication--The context favors the translation, "abusive
language," rather than impure conversation. "Foul language" best retains
the ambiguity of the original.

[Colossians 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">col 3:9</span></span>

([Eph 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#025).)

put off--Greek, "wholly put off"; utterly renounced \[TITTMANN\]. ([Eph
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#022)).

the old man--the unregenerate nature which ye had before conversion.

his deeds--habits of acting.

[Colossians 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">col 3:10</span></span>

the new man--(See on [Eph 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#023)). Here
(neon) the Greek, means "the recently-put-on nature"; that lately
received at regeneration (see on [Eph
4:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#023)).

which is renewed--Greek, "which is being renewed" (anakainottmenou);
namely, its development into a perfectly renewed nature is continually
progressing to completion.

in knowledge--rather as the Greek, "unto perfect knowledge" (see on [Col
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#006); [Col
1:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#009)). Perfect knowledge of God
excludes all sin ([Joh 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#003)).

after the image of him that created him--namely, of God that created the
new man ([Eph 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#010); [Eph
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#024)). The new creation is analogous
to the first creation ([Co2 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#006)). As
man was then made in the image of God naturally, so now spiritually. But
the image of God formed in us by the Spirit of God, is as much more
glorious than that borne by Adam, as the Second Man, the Lord from
heaven, is more glorious than the first man. [Gen
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#026), "Let us make man in our image,
after our likeness." The "image" is claimed for man, [Co1
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#007); the "likeness," [Jam
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#009). ORIGEN \[On First Principles,
3:6\] taught, the image was something in which all were created, and
which continued to man after the fall ([Gen
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#006)). The likeness was something
towards which man was created, that he might strive after it and attain
it. TRENCH thinks God in the double statement ([Gen
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#026)), contemplates both man's first
creation and his being "renewed in knowledge after the image of Him that
created Him."

[Colossians 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">col 3:11</span></span>

Where--Translate, "Wherein," namely, in the sphere of the renewed man.

neither . . . nor . . . nor . . . nor--Translate as Greek, "There is no
such thing as Greek and Jew (the difference of privilege between those
born of the natural seed of Abraham and those not, is abolished),
circumcision and uncircumcision (the difference of legal standing
between the circumcised and uncircumcised is done away, [Gal
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#015)) --bondman, freeman." The present
Church is one called out of the flesh, and the present world-course
([Eph 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#002)), wherein such distinctions
exist, to life in the Spirit, and to the future first resurrection: and
this because Satan has such power now over the flesh and the world. At
Christ's coming when Satan shall no longer rule the flesh and the world,
the nations in the flesh, and the word in millennial felicity, shall be
the willing subjects of Christ and His glorified saints ([Dan
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#014), [Dan
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#022), [Dan
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#027); [Luk
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#017), [Luk
19:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#019); [Rev
20:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#001); [Rev
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#021)). Israel in Canaan was a type of
that future state when the Jews, so miraculously preserved distinct now
in their dispersion, shall be the central Church of the Christianized
world. As expressly as Scripture abolishes the distinction of Jew and
Greek now as to religious privileges, so does it expressly foretell that
in the coming new order of things, Israel shall be first of the
Christian nations, not for her own selfish aggrandizement, but for their
good, as the medium of blessing to them. Finally, after the millennium,
the life that is in Christ becomes the power which transfigures nature,
in the time of the new heaven and the new earth; as, before, it first
transfigured the spiritual, then the political and social world.

Scythian--heretofore regarded as more barbarian than the barbarians.
Though the relation of bond and free actually existed, yet in relation
to Christ, all alike were free in one aspect, and servants of Christ in
another ([Co1 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#022); [Gal
3:28](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#028)).

Christ is all--Christ absorbs in Himself all distinctions, being to all
alike, everything that they need for justification, sanctification, and
glorification ([Co1 1:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#030); [Co1
3:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#021); [Gal
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#020)).

in all--who believe and are renewed, without distinction of person; the
sole distinction now is, how much each draws from Christ. The unity of
the divine life shared in by all believers, counterbalances all
differences, even as great as that between the polished "Greek" and the
rude "Scythian." Christianity imparts to the most uncivilized the only
spring of sound, social and moral culture.

[Colossians 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">col 3:12</span></span>

the elect of God--There is no "the" in the Greek, "God's elect" (compare
[Rom 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#003); [Th1
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#004)). The order of the words "elect,
holy, beloved," answers to the order of the things. Election from
eternity precedes sanctification in time; the sanctified, feeling God's
love, imitate it \[BENGEL\].

bowels of mercies--Some of the oldest manuscripts read singular,
"mercy." Bowels express the yearning compassion, which has its seat in
the heart, and which we feel to act on our inward parts ([Gen
43:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#030); [Jer
31:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#020); [Luk
1:78](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#078), Margin).

humbleness of mind--True "lowliness of mind"; not the mock "humility" of
the false teachers ([Col 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#023); [Eph
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#002), [Eph
4:32](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#032)).

[Colossians 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">col 3:13</span></span>

Forbearing--as to present offenses.

forgiving--as to past offenses.

quarrel--rather as Greek, "cause of blame," "cause of complaint."

Christ--who had so infinitely greater cause of complaint against us. The
oldest manuscripts and Vulgate read "the Lord." English Version is
supported by one very old manuscript and old versions. It seems to have
crept in from [Eph 4:32](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#032).

[Colossians 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">col 3:14</span></span>

above--rather "over," as in [Eph 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#016).
Charity, which is the crowning grace, covering the multitude of others'
sins ([Pe1 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#008)), must overlie all the
other graces enumerated.

which is--that is, "for it is"; literally, "which thing is."

bond of perfectness--an upper garment which completes and keeps together
the rest, which, without it, would be loose and disconnected. Seeming
graces, where love is wanting, are mere hypocrisy. Justification by
faith is assumed as already having taken place in those whom Paul
addresses, [Col 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#012), "elect of God,
holy . . . beloved," and [Col 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#012); so
that there is no plea here for Rome's view of justification by works.
Love and its works "perfect," that is, manifest the full maturity of
faith developed ([Mat 5:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#044), [Mat
5:48](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#048)). Love . . . be ye perfect, &c.
([Jam 2:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#021); [Jo1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#005)). "If we love one another, God's
love is perfected in us" ([Rom 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#008);
[Co1 13:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#001); [Ti1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#005); [Jo1
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#012)). As to "bond," compare [Col
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#002), "knit together in love" ([Eph
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#003)), "keep the unity of the Spirit in
the bond of peace."

[Colossians 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">col 3:15</span></span>

peace of God--The oldest manuscripts and versions read, "The peace of
CHRIST" (compare [Phi 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#007)). "The peace
of GOD." Therefore Christ is God. Peace was His legacy to His disciples
before He left them ([Joh 14:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#027)), "MY
peace I give unto you." Peace is peculiarly His to give. Peace follows
love ([Col 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#014); [Eph
4:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#002)).

rule--literally, "sit as umpire"; the same Greek verb simple, as appears
compounded ([Col 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#018)). The false
teacher, as a self-constituted umpire, defrauds you of your prize; but
if the peace of Christ be your umpire ruling in your hearts, your reward
is sure. "Let the peace of Christ act as umpire when anger, envy, and
such passions arise; and restrain them." Let not those passions give the
award, so that you should be swayed by them, but let Christ's peace be
the decider of everything.

in your hearts--Many wear a peaceful countenance and speak peace with
the mouth, while war is in their hearts ([Psa
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#003); [Psa
55:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#021)).

to the which--that is, with a view to which state of Christian peace
([Isa 26:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#003)); [Co1
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#015), "God hath called us to peace."

ye are called--Greek, "ye were also called." The "also" implies that
besides Paul's exhortation, they have also as a motive to "peace," their
having been once for all called.

in one body-- ([Eph 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#004)). The unity of
the body is a strong argument for "peace" among the members.

be ye thankful--for your "calling." Not to have "peace ruling in your
hearts" would be inconsistent with the "calling in one body," and would
be practical unthankfulness to God who called us ([Eph
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#004), [Eph
5:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#019)).

[Colossians 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">col 3:16</span></span>

The form which "thankfulness" ([Col
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#015)) ought to take.

Let the word of Christ--the Gospel word by which ye have been called.

richly-- ([Col 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#002); [Rom
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#014)).

in all wisdom--ALFORD joins this clause with "teaching," &c., not with
"dwell in you," as English Version, for so we find in [Col
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#028), "teaching in all wisdom," and
the two clauses will thus correspond, "In all wisdom teaching," and "in
grace singing in your hears" (so the Greek order).

and . . . and--The oldest manuscripts read "psalms, hymns, spiritual
songs" (see on [Eph 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#019)). At the
AgapÃ&brvbr; or love-feasts, and in their family circles, they were to
be so full of the Word of Christ in the heart that the mouth should give
it utterance in hymns of instruction, admonition, and praise (compare
[Deu 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#007)). TERTULLIAN \[Apology, 39\],
records that at the love-feasts, after the water had been furnished for
the hands and the lights had been literally, according as any had the
power, whether by his remembrance of Scripture, or by his powers of
composition, he used to be invited to sing praises to God for the common
good. Paul contrasts (as in [Eph
5:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#018)) the songs of Christians at
their social meetings, with the bacchanalian and licentious songs of
heathen feasts. Singing usually formed part of the entertainment at
Greek banquets (compare [Jam 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#013)).

with grace--Greek, "IN grace," the element in which your singing is to
be: "the grace" of the indwelling Holy Spirit. This clause expresses the
seat and source of true psalmody, whether in private or public, namely,
the heart as well as the voice; singing (compare [Col
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#015), "peace . . . rule in your
hearts"), the psalm of love and praise being in the heart before it
finds vent by the lips, and even when it is not actually expressed by
the voice, as in closet-worship. The Greek order forbids English
Version, "with grace in your hearts"; rather, "singing in your hearts."

to the Lord--The oldest manuscripts read, "to God."

[Colossians 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">col 3:17</span></span>

Literally, "And everything whatsoever ye do . . . do all," &c.; this
includes words as well as deeds.

in the name of the Lord Jesus--as disciples called by His name as His,
seeking His guidance and help, and desiring to act so as to gain His
approval ([Rom 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#008); [Co1
10:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#031); [Co2
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#015); [Pe1
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#011)). Compare "in the Lord," [Col
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#018), and "Christ is all," [Col
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#011).

God and the Father--The oldest manuscripts omit "and," which seems to
have crept in from [Eph 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#020).

by him--Greek, "through Him" as the channel of His grace to us, and of
our thanksgiving to Him ([Joh 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#006),
end).

[Colossians 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">col 3:18</span></span>

unto your own husbands--The oldest manuscripts omit "own," which crept
in from [Eph 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#022).

as it is fit in the Lord--Greek, "was fit," implying that there was at
Colosse some degree of failure in fulfilling this duty, "as it was your
duty to have done as disciples of the Lord."

[Colossians 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">col 3:19</span></span>

([Eph 5:22-33](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#022).)

be not bitter--ill-tempered and provoking. Many who are polite abroad,
are rude and bitter at home because they are not afraid to be so there.

[Colossians 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">col 3:20</span></span>

([Eph 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#001).)

unto the Lord--The oldest manuscripts read, "IN the Lord," that is, this
is acceptable to God when it is done in the Lord, namely, from the
principle of faith,and as disciples in union with the Lord.

[Colossians 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">col 3:21</span></span>

([Eph 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#004).) It is a different Greek
verb, therefore translate here, "irritate not." By perpetual
fault-finding "children" are "discouraged" or "disheartened." A
broken-down spirit is fatal to youth \[BENGEL\].

[Colossians 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">col 3:22</span></span>

([Eph 6:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#005).) This is to fear God,
when, though none sees us, we do no evil: but if we do evil, it is not
God, but men, whom we fear.

singleness--"simplicity of heart."

fearing God--The oldest manuscripts read, "the Lord."

[Colossians 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">col 3:23</span></span>

And--omitted in the oldest manuscripts (compare [Eph
6:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#007)). Compare the same principle in
the case of all men, Hezekiah ([Ch2
31:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#021); [Rom
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#011)).

do, do it--two distinct Greek verbs, "Whatsoever ye do, work at it" (or
"labor at" it).

heartily--not from servile constraint, but with hearty good will.

[Colossians 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">col 3:24</span></span>

the reward of the inheritance--"Knowing that it is from the Lord (the
ultimate source of reward), ye shall receive the compensation (or
recompense, which will make ample amends for your having no earthly
possession as slaves now) consisting of the inheritance" (a term
excluding the notion of meriting it by works: it is all of grace, [Rom
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#014); [Gal
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#018)).

for ye serve--The oldest manuscripts omit "for," then translate as
Vulgate, "Serve ye the Lord Christ;" compare [Col
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#023), "To the Lord and not unto men"
([Co1 7:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#022)).

[Colossians 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">col 3:25</span></span>

But--The oldest manuscripts read, "for," which accords with "serve ye,"
&c. ([Col 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#024)), the oldest reading:
the for here gives a motive for obeying the precept. He addresses the
slaves: Serve ye the Lord Christ, and leave your wrongs in His hands to
put to rights: (translate), "For he that doeth wrong shall receive back
the wrong which he hath done (by just retribution in kind), and there is
no respect of persons" with the Great Judge in the day of the Lord. He
favors the master no more than the slave ([Rev
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#015)).
