<p>
<p>the Grecians--the Greek-speaking Jews, mostly born in the provinces. 
<p>
<p>the Hebrews--those Jews born in Palestine who used their native tongue, and were wont to look down on the "Grecians" as an inferior class. 
<p>
<p>were neglected--"overlooked" by those whom the apostles employed, and who were probably of the Hebrew class, as being the most numerous. The complaint was in all likelihood well founded, though we cannot suspect the distributors of intentional partiality. "It was really just an emulation of love, each party wishing to have their own poor taken care of in the best manner" [OLSHAUSEN]. 
<p>
<p>the daily ministration--the daily distribution of alms or of food, probably the latter.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#002">Acts 6:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">act 6:2</A></FONT></span></p>the multitude--the general body of the disciples. 
<p>
<p>It is not reason--The word expresses dislike; that is "We cannot submit." 
<p>
<p>to leave the word of God--to have our time and attention withdrawn from preaching; which, it thus appears, they regarded as their primary duty. 
<p>
<p>to serve tables--oversee the distribution of provisions.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#003">Acts 6:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">act 6:3</A></FONT></span></p>look ye out among you--that is, ye, "the multitude," from among yourselves. 
<p>
<p>seven men of honest report--good reputation (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#022">Act 10:22</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#007">Ti1 3:7</A>). 
<p>
<p>full of the Holy Ghost--not full of miraculous gifts, which would have been no qualification for the duties required, but spiritually gifted (although on two of them miraculous power did rest). 
<p>
<p>and wisdom--discretion, aptitude for practical business. 
<p>
<p>whom we may appoint--for while the election was vested in the Christian people, the appointment lay with the apostles, as spiritual rulers.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#004">Acts 6:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">act 6:4</A></FONT></span></p>we will give ourselves to prayer--public prayer, as along with preaching their great work.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#005">Acts 6:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">act 6:5</A></FONT></span></p>Stephen, &amp;c.--As this and the following names are all Greek, it is likely they were all of the "Grecian" class, which would effectually restore mutual confidence.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#006">Acts 6:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">act 6:6</A></FONT></span></p>when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them--the one proclaiming that all official gifts flowed from the Church's glorified Head, the other symbolizing the communication of these to the chosen office-bearers through the recognized channels.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#007">Acts 6:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">act 6:7</A></FONT></span></p>word of God increased . . . disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly--prosperity crowning the beautiful spirit which reigned in this mother community. 
<p>
<p>a great company of the priests were obedient, &amp;c.--This was the crowning triumph of the Gospel, whose peaceful prosperity was now at its greatest height. After Stephen's teaching and trial made it clear that sacerdotal interests could not stand with the Gospel, such priestly accessions became rare indeed. Note (1) how easily misunderstandings may arise among the most loving and devoted followers of the Lord Jesus: but (2) How quickly and effectually such misunderstandings may be healed, where honest intentions, love, and wisdom reign: (3) What a beautiful model for imitation is furnished by the class here complained of, who, though themselves the majority, chose the new office-bearers from amongst the complaining minority! (4) How superior to the lust of power do the apostles here show themselves to be, in not only divesting themselves of the immediate superintendence of temporal affairs in the Christian community, but giving the choice of those who were to be entrusted with it to the disciples at large! (5) How little of formal organization did the apostles give to the Church at first, and when an emergency arose which demanded something more, how entirely was the remedy suggested by the reason of the thing! (6) Though the new office-bearers are not expressly called Deacons here, it is universally admitted that this was the first institution of that order in the Church; the success of the expedient securing its permanency, and the qualifications for "the office of a Deacon" being laid down in one of the apostolical Epistles immediately after those of "a Bishop" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#008">Ti1 3:8-13</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#008">Acts 6:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">act 6:8</A></FONT></span></p>STEPHEN ARRAIGNED BEFORE THE SAMHEDRIM. (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#008">Act 6:8-15</A>)
<p>
<p>And Stephen, &amp;c.--The foregoing narrative seems to be only an introduction to what follows. 
<p>
<p>full of faith--rather, "of grace," as the best manuscripts read.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#009">Acts 6:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">act 6:9</A></FONT></span></p>synagogue of the Libertines--Jewish freedmen; manumitted Roman captives, or the children of such, expelled from Rome (as appears from JOSEPHUS and TACITUS), and now residing at Jerusalem. 
<p>
<p>Cyrenians--Jews of Cyrene, in Libya, on the coast of Africa. 
<p>
<p>them of Cilicia--amongst whom may have been Saul of Tarsus (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#058">Act 7:58</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#039">Act 21:39</A>). 
<p>
<p>and of Asia--(See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#006">Act 16:6</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#010">Acts 6:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">act 6:10</A></FONT></span></p>not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake--What he said, and the power with which he spake it, were alike resistless.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#011">Acts 6:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">act 6:11</A></FONT></span></p>blasphemous words against Moses--doubtless referring to the impending disappearance of the whole Mosaic system. 
<p>
<p>and against God--This must refer to the supreme dignity and authority which he claimed for Christ, as the head of that new economy which was so speedily to supersede the old (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#056">Act 7:56</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#059">Act 7:59-60</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#015">Acts 6:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">act 6:15</A></FONT></span></p>as . . . the face of an angel--a play of supernatural radiance attesting to all who beheld his countenance the divine calm of the spirit within.
