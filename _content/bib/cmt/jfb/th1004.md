### [1 Thessalonians Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#001)

[1 Thessalonians 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">th1 4:1</span></span>

EXHORTATIONS TO CHASTITY; BROTHERLY LOVE; QUIET INDUSTRY; ABSTINENCE
FROM UNDUE SORROW FOR DEPARTED FRIENDS, FOR AT CHRIST'S COMING ALL HIS
SAINTS SHALL BE GLORIFIED. (1Th. 4:1-18)

Furthermore--Greek, "As to what remains." Generally used towards the
close of his Epistles ([Eph 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#010); [Phi
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#008)).

then--with a view to the love and holiness ([Th1
3:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#012)) which we have just prayed for
in your behalf, we now give you exhortation.

beseech--"ask" as if it were a personal favor.

by, &c.--rather as Greek, "IN the Lord Jesus"; in communion with the
Lord Jesus, as Christian ministers dealing with Christian people
\[EDMUNDS\].

as ye . . . received--when we were with you ([Th1
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#013)).

how--Greek, the "how," that is, the manner.

walk and . . . please God--that is, "and so please God," namely, by your
walk; in contrast to the Jews who "please not God" ([Th1
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#015)). The oldest manuscripts add a
clause here, "even as also ye do walk" (compare [Th1
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#010); [Th1
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#011)). These words, which he was able
to say of them with truth, conciliate a favorable hearing for the
precepts which follow. Also the expression, "abound more and more,"
implies that there had gone before a recognition of their already in
some measure walking so.

[1 Thessalonians 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">th1 4:2</span></span>

by the Lord Jesus--by His authority and direction, not by our own. He
uses the strong term, "commandments," in writing to this Church not long
founded, knowing that they would take it in a right spirit, and feeling
it desirable that they should understand he spake with divine authority.
He seldom uses the term in writing subsequently, when his authority was
established, to other churches. [Co1
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#010); [Co1
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#017); and [Ti1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#005) ([Th1
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#018), where the subject accounts for
the strong expression) are the exceptions. "The Lord" marks His
paramount authority, requiring implicit obedience.

[1 Thessalonians 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">th1 4:3</span></span>

For--enforcing the assertion that his "commandments" were "by (the
authority of) the Lord Jesus" ([Th1
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#002)). Since "this is the will of God,"
let it be your will also.

fornication--not regarded as a sin at all among the heathen, and so
needing the more to be denounced ([Act
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#020)).

[1 Thessalonians 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">th1 4:4</span></span>

know--by moral self-control.

how to possess his vessel--rather as Greek, "how to acquire (get for
himself) his own vessel," that is, that each should have his own wife so
as to avoid fornication ([Th1 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#003);
[Co1 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#002)). The emphatical position of
"his own" in the Greek, and the use of "vessel" for wife, in [Pe1
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#007), and in common Jewish phraseology,
and the correct translation "acquire," all justify this rendering.

in sanctification-- ([Rom 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#019); [Co1
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#015), [Co1
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#018)). Thus, "his own" stands in
opposition to dishonoring his brother by lusting after his wife ([Th1
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#006)).

honour-- ([Heb 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#004)) contrasted with
"dishonor their own bodies" ([Rom
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#024)).

[1 Thessalonians 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">th1 4:5</span></span>

in the lust--Greek, "passion"; which implies that such a one is
unconsciously the passive slave of lust.

which know not God--and so know no better. Ignorance of true religion is
the parent of unchastity ([Eph
4:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#018)). A people's morals are like
the objects of their worship ([Deu
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#026); [Psa
115:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#008); [Rom
1:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#023)).

[1 Thessalonians 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">th1 4:6</span></span>

go beyond--transgress the bounds of rectitude in respect to his
"brother."

defraud--"overreach" \[ALFORD\]; "take advantage of" \[EDMUNDS\].

in any matter--rather as Greek, "in the matter"; a decorous expression
for the matter now in question; the conjugal honor of his neighbor as a
husband, [Th1 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#004); [Th1
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#007) also confirms this view; the word
"brother" enhances the enormity of the crime. It is your brother whom
you wrong (compare [Pro 6:27-33](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#027)).

the Lord--the coming Judge ([Th2
1:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#007)).

avenger--the Righter.

of all such--Greek, "concerning all these things;" in all such cases of
wrongs against a neighbor's conjugal honor.

testified--Greek, "constantly testified \[ALFORD\].

[1 Thessalonians 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">th1 4:7</span></span>

unto uncleanness--Greek, "for the purpose of."

unto--rather as Greek, "in"; marking that "holiness" is the element in
which our calling has place; in a sphere of holiness. Saint is another
name for Christian.

[1 Thessalonians 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">th1 4:8</span></span>

despiseth, &c.--Greek, "setteth at naught" such engagements imposed on
him in his calling, [Th1 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#007); in
relation to his "brother," [Th1 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#006).
He who doth so, "sets at naught not man (as for instance his brother),
but God" ([Psa 51:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#004)) is used of
despising or rejecting God's minister, it may mean here, "He who
despiseth" or "rejecteth" these our ministerial precepts.

who hath also given unto us--So some oldest manuscripts read, but most
oldest manuscripts read, "Who (without 'also') giveth (present) unto
you" (not "us").

his Spirit--Greek, "His own Spirit, the Holy (One)"; thus emphatically
marking "holiness" ([Th1 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#007)) as the
end for which the Holy (One) is being given. "Unto you," in the Greek,
implies that the Spirit is being given unto, into (put "into" your
hearts), and among you (compare [Th1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#009); [Eph
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#030)). "Giveth" implies that
sanctification is not merely a work once for all accomplished in the
past, but a present progressive work. So the Church of England
Catechism, "sanctifieth (present) all the elect people of God." "His
own" implies that as He gives you that which is essentially identical
with Himself, He expects you should become like Himself ([Pe1
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#016); [Pe2
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#004)).

[1 Thessalonians 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">th1 4:9</span></span>

brotherly love, &c.--referring here to acts of brotherly kindness in
relieving distressed brethren. Some oldest manuscripts support English
Version reading, "YE have"; others, and those the weightiest, read, "WE
have." We need not write, as ye yourselves are taught, and that by God:
namely, in the heart by the Holy Spirit ([Joh
6:45](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#045); [Heb
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#011); [Jo1
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#020), [Jo1
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#027)).

to love--Greek, "with a view to," or "to the end of your loving one
another." Divine teachings have their confluence in love \[BENGEL\].

[1 Thessalonians 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">th1 4:10</span></span>

And indeed--Greek, "For even."

[1 Thessalonians 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">th1 4:11</span></span>

study to be quiet--Greek, "make it your ambition to be quiet, and to do
your own business." In direct contrast to the world's ambition, which
is, "to make a great stir," and "to be busybodies" ([Th2
3:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#011)).

work with your own hands--The Thessalonian converts were, it thus seems,
chiefly of the working classes. Their expectation of the immediate
coming of Christ led some enthusiasts among them to neglect their daily
work and be dependent on the bounty of others. See end of [Th1
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#012). The expectation was right in so
far as that the Church should be always looking for Him; but they were
wrong in making it a ground for neglecting their daily work. The evil,
as it subsequently became worse, is more strongly reproved in [Th2
3:6-12](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#006).

[1 Thessalonians 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">th1 4:12</span></span>

honestly--in the Old English sense, "becomingly," as becomes your
Christian profession; not bringing discredit on it in the eyes of the
outer world, as if Christianity led to sloth and poverty ([Rom
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#013); [Pe1
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#012)).

them . . . without--outside the Christian Church ([Mar
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#011)).

have lack of nothing--not have to beg from others for the supply of your
wants (compare [Eph 4:28](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#028)). So far from
needing to beg from others, we ought to work and get the means of
supplying the need of others. Freedom from pecuniary embarrassment is to
be desired by the Christian on account of the liberty which it bestows.

[1 Thessalonians 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">th1 4:13</span></span>

The leading topic of Paul's preaching at Thessalonica having been the
coming kingdom ([Act 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#007)), some
perverted it into a cause for fear in respect to friends lately
deceased, as if these would be excluded from the glory which those found
alive alone should share. This error Paul here corrects (compare [Th1
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#010)).

I would not--All the oldest manuscripts and versions have "we would
not." My fellow labourers (Silas and Timothy) and myself desire that ye
should not be ignorant.

them which are asleep--The oldest manuscripts read present tense, "them
which are sleeping"; the same as "the dead in Christ" ([Th1
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#016)), to whose bodies ([Dan
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#002), not their souls; [Ecc
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#007); [Co2
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#008)) death is a calm and holy sleep,
from which the resurrection shall waken them to glory. The word
"cemetery" means a sleeping-place. Observe, the glory and chief hope of
the Church are not to be realized at death, but at the Lord's coming;
one is not to anticipate the other, but all are to be glorified together
at Christ's coming ([Col 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#004); [Heb
11:40](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#040)). Death affects the mere
individual; but the coming of Jesus the whole Church; at death our souls
are invisibly and individually with the Lord; at Christ's coming the
whole Church, with all its members, in body and soul, shall be visibly
and collectively with Him. As this is offered as a consolation to
mourning relatives, the mutual recognition of the saints at Christ's
coming is hereby implied.

that ye sorrow not, even as others--Greek, "the rest"; all the rest of
the world besides Christians. Not all natural mourning for dead friends
is forbidden: for the Lord Jesus and Paul sinlessly gave way to it ([Joh
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#031), [Joh
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#033), [Joh
11:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#035); [Phi
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#027)); but sorrow as though there were
"no hope," which indeed the heathen had not ([Eph
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#012)): the Christian hope here meant
is that of the resurrection. [Psa
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#009), [Psa
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#011); [Psa
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#015); [Psa
73:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#024); [Pro
14:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#032), show that the Old Testament
Church, though not having the hope so bright ([Isa
38:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#018)), yet had this hope. Contrast
CATULLUS \[Carmina 5.4\], "When once our brief day has set, we must
sleep one everlasting night." The sepulchral inscriptions of heathen
Thessalonica express the hopeless view taken as to those once dead: as
AESCHYLUS writes, "Of one once dead there is no resurrection." Whatever
glimpses some heathen philosophers, had of the existence of the soul
after death, they had none whatever of the body ([Act
17:18](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#018), [Act
17:20](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#020), [Act
17:32](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#032)).

[1 Thessalonians 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">th1 4:14</span></span>

For if--confirmation of his statement, [Th1
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#013), that the removal of ignorance as
to the sleeping believers would remove undue grief respecting them. See
[Th1 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#013), "hope." Hence it appears
our hope rests on our faith ("if we believe"). "As surely as we all
believe that Christ died and rose again (the very doctrine specified as
taught at Thessalonica, [Act 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#003)), so
also will God bring those laid to sleep by Jesus with Him (Jesus)." (So
the order and balance of the members of the Greek sentence require us to
translate). Believers are laid in sleep by Jesus, and so will be brought
back from sleep with Jesus in His train when He comes. The disembodied
souls are not here spoken of; the reference is to the sleeping bodies.
The facts of Christ's experience are repeated in the believer's. He died
and then rose: so believers shall die and then rise with Him. But in His
case death is the term used, [Co1
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#003), [Co1
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#006), &c.; in theirs, sleep; because
His death has taken for them the sting from death. The same Hand that
shall raise them is that which laid them to sleep. "Laid to sleep by
Jesus," answers to "dead in Christ" ([Th1
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#016)).

[1 Thessalonians 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">th1 4:15</span></span>

by the word of the Lord--Greek, "in," that is, in virtue of a direct
revelation from the Lord to me. So [Kg1
20:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#035). This is the "mystery," a truth
once hidden, now revealed, which Paul shows ([Co1
15:51-52](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#051)).

prevent--that is, "anticipate." So far were the early Christians from
regarding their departed brethren as anticipating them in entering
glory, that they needed to be assured that those who remain to the
coming of the Lord "will not anticipate them that are asleep." The "we"
means whichever of us are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord.
The Spirit designed that believers in each successive age should live in
continued expectation of the Lord's coming, not knowing but that they
should be among those found alive at His coming ([Mat
24:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#042)). It is a sad fall from this
blessed hope, that death is looked for by most men, rather than the
coming of our Lord. Each successive generation in its time and place
represents the generation which shall actually survive till His coming
([Mat 25:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#013); [Rom
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#011); [Co1
15:51](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#051); [Jam
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#009); [Pe1
4:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#005)). The Spirit subsequently
revealed by Paul that which is not inconsistent with the expectation
here taught of the Lord's coming at any time; namely, that His coming
would not be until there should be a "falling away first" ([Th2
2:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#002)); but as symptoms of this soon
appeared, none could say but that still this precursory event might be
realized, and so the Lord come in his day. Each successive revelation
fills in the details of the general outline first given. So Paul
subsequently, while still looking mainly for the Lord's coming to clothe
him with his body from heaven, looks for going to be with Christ in the
meanwhile ([Co2 5:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#001); [Phi
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#006), [Phi
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#023); [Phi
3:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#020); [Phi
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#005)). EDMUNDS well says, The "we" is
an affectionate identifying of ourselves with our fellows of all ages,
as members of the same body, under the same Head, Christ Jesus. So [Hos
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#004), "God spake with us in Beth-el,"
that is, with Israel. "We did rejoice," that is, Israel at the Red Sea
([Psa 66:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#006)). Though neither Hosea, nor
David, was alive at the times referred to, yet each identifies himself
with those that were present.

[1 Thessalonians 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">th1 4:16</span></span>

himself--in all the Majesty of His presence in person, not by deputy.

descend--even as He ascended ([Act
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#011)).

with--Greek, "in," implying one concomitant circumstance attending His
appearing.

shout--Greek, "signal shout," "war shout." Jesus is represented as a
victorious King, giving the word of command to the hosts of heaven in
His train for the last onslaught, at His final triumph over sin, death,
and Satan ([Rev 19:11-21](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#011)).

the voice of . . . archangel--distinct from the "signal shout." Michael
is perhaps meant ([Jde 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#009); [Rev
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#007)), to whom especially is committed
the guardianship of the people of God ([Dan
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#013)).

trump of God--the trumpet blast which usually accompanies God's
manifestation in glory ([Exo 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#016);
[Psa 47:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#005)); here the last of the three
accompaniments of His appearing: as the trumpet was used to convene
God's people to their solemn convocations ([Num
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#002), [Num
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#010); [Num
31:6](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#006)), so here to summon God's elect
together, preparatory to their glorification with Christ ([Psa
50:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#001); [Mat
24:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#031); [Co1
15:52](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#052)).

shall rise first--previously to the living being "caught up." The
"first" here has no reference to the first resurrection, as contrasted
with that of "the rest of the dead." That reference occurs elsewhere
([Mat 13:41-42](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#041), [Mat
13:50](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#050); [Joh
5:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#029); [Co1
15:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#023); [Rev
20:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#005)); it simply stands in
opposition to "then," [Th1 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#017).
FIRST, "the dead in Christ" shall rise, THEN the living shall be caught
up. The Lord's people alone are spoken of here.

[1 Thessalonians 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">th1 4:17</span></span>

we which are alive . . . shall be caught up--after having been "changed
in a moment" ([Co1 15:51-52](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#051)). Again he
says, "we," recommending thus the expression to Christians of all ages,
each generation bequeathing to the succeeding one a continually
increasing obligation to look for the coming of the Lord. \[EDMUNDS\].

together with them--all together: the raised dead, and changed living,
forming one joint body.

in the clouds--Greek, "in clouds." The same honor is conferred on them
as on their Lord. As He was taken in a cloud at His ascension ([Act
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#009)), so at His return with clouds
([Rev 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#007)), they shall be caught up in
clouds. The clouds are His and their triumphal chariot ([Psa
104:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#003); [Dan
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#013)). ELLICOTT explains the Greek,
"robed round by upbearing clouds" \[Aids to Faith\].

in the air--rather, "into the air"; caught up into the region just above
the earth, where the meeting (compare [Mat
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#001), [Mat
25:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#006)) shall take place between them
ascending, and their Lord descending towards the earth. Not that the air
is to be the place of their lasting abode with Him.

and so shall we ever be with the Lord--no more parting, and no more
going out ([Rev 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#012)). His point being
