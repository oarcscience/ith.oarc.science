### [2 Corinthians Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#001)

[2 Corinthians 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co2 12:1</span></span>

REVELATIONS IN WHICH HE MIGHT GLORY: BUT HE RATHER GLORIES IN
INFIRMITIES, AS CALLING FORTH CHRIST'S POWER: SIGNS OF HIS APOSTLESHIP:
HIS DISINTERESTEDNESS: NOT THAT HE IS EXCUSING HIMSELF TO THEM; BUT HE
DOES ALL FOR THEIR GOOD, LEST HE SHOULD FIND THEM NOT SUCH AS HE
DESIRED, AND SO SHOULD HAVE TO BE SEVERE AT HIS COMING. (2Co. 12:1-21)

He proceeds to illustrate the "glorying in infirmities" ([Co2
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#030)). He gave one instance which
might expose him to ridicule ([Co2
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#033)); he now gives another, but this
one connected with a glorious revelation of which it was the sequel: but
he dwells not on the glory done to himself, but on the infirmity which
followed it, as displaying Christ's power. The oldest manuscripts read,
"I MUST NEEDS boast (or glory) though it be not expedient; for I will
come." The "for" gives a proof that it is "not expedient to boast": I
will take the case of revelations, in which if anywhere boasting might
be thought harmless. "Visions" refers to things seen: "revelations," to
things heard (compare [Sa1 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#015)) or
revealed in any way. In "visions" their signification was not always
vouchsafed; in "revelations" there was always an unveiling of truths
before hidden ([Dan 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#019), [Dan
2:31](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#031)). All parts of Scripture alike
are matter of inspiration; but not all of revelation. There are degrees
of revelation; but not of inspiration.

of--that is, from the Lord; Christ, [Co2
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#002).

[2 Corinthians 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co2 12:2</span></span>

Translate, "I know," not "I knew."

a man--meaning himself. But he purposely thus distinguishes between the
rapt and glorified person of [Co2
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#002), [Co2
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#004), and himself the infirmity-laden
victim of the "thorn in the flesh" ([Co2
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#007)). Such glory belonged not to him,
but the weakness did. Nay, he did not even know whether he was in or out
of the body when the glory was put upon him, so far was the glory from
being his \[ALFORD\]. His spiritual self was his highest and truest
self: the flesh with its infirmity merely his temporary self ([Rom
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#025)). Here, however, the latter is
the prominent thought.

in Christ--a Christian ([Rom 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#007)).

above--rather, simply "fourteen years ago." This Epistle was written
A.D. 55-57. Fourteen years before will bring the vision to A.D. 41-43,
the time of his second visit to Jerusalem ([Act
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#017)). He had long been intimate with
the Corinthians, yet had never mentioned this revelation before: it was
not a matter lightly to be spoken of.

I cannot tell--rather as Greek, "I know not." If in the body, he must
have been caught up bodily; if out of the body, as seems to be Paul's
opinion, his spirit must have been caught up out of the body. At all
events he recognizes the possibility of conscious receptivity in
disembodied spirits.

caught up-- ([Act 8:39](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#039)).

to the third heaven--even to, &c. These raptures (note the plural,
"visions," "revelations," [Co2 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#001))
had two degrees: first he was caught up "to the third heaven," and from
thence to "Paradise" ([Co2 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#004))
\[CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA, Miscellanies, 5.427\], which seems to denote an
inner recess of the third heaven \[BENGEL\] ([Luk
23:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#043); [Rev
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#007)). Paul was permitted not only to
"hear" the things of Paradise, but to see also in some degree the things
of the third heaven (compare "visions," [Co2
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#001)). The occurrence TWICE of
"whether in the body . . . I know not, God knoweth," and of "lest I
should be exalted above measure," marks two stages in the revelation.
"Ignorance of the mode does not set aside the certain knowledge of the
fact. The apostles were ignorant of many things" \[BENGEL\]. The first
heaven is that of the clouds, the air; the second, that of the stars,
the sky; the third is spiritual ([Eph
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#010)).

[2 Corinthians 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co2 12:3</span></span>

Translate, "I know."

out of--Most of the oldest manuscripts read "apart from."

[2 Corinthians 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co2 12:4</span></span>

unspeakable--not in themselves, otherwise Paul could not have heard
them; but as the explanation states, "which it is not lawful . . . to
utter" \[ALFORD\]. They were designed for Paul's own consolation, and
not for communication to others. Some heavenly words are communicable
([Exo 34:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#006); [Isa
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#003)). These were not so. Paul had not
the power adequately to utter; nor if he had, would he have been
permitted; nor would earthly men comprehend them ([Joh
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#012); [Co1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#009)). A man may hear and know more
than he can speak.

[2 Corinthians 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co2 12:5</span></span>

of myself--concerning myself. Self is put in the background, except in
respect to his infirmities. His glorying in his other self, to which the
revelations were vouchsafed, was not in order to give glory to his
fleshly self, but to bring out in contrast the "infirmities" of the
latter, that Christ might have all the glory.

[2 Corinthians 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co2 12:6</span></span>

For--Not but that I might glory as to "myself" ([Co2
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#005)); "FOR if I should desire to
glory, I shall not be a fool"; for I have things to glory, or boast of
which are good matter for glorying of (not mere external fleshly
advantages which when he gloried in \[2Co. 11:1-33\] he termed such
glorying "folly," [Co2 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#001), [Co2
11:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#016)).

think of me--Greek, "form his estimate respecting me."

heareth of me--Greek, "heareth aught from me." Whatever haply he heareth
from me in person. If on account of healing a cripple ([Act
14:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#012)), and shaking off a viper
([Act 28:5](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#005)), the people thought him a
god, what would they have not done, if he had disclosed those
revelations? \[ESTIUS\]. I wish each of you to estimate me by "what he
sees" my present acts and "hears" my teaching to be; not by my boasting
of past revelations. They who allow themselves to be thought of more
highly than is lawful, defraud themselves of the honor which is at God's
disposal \[BENGEL\] ([Joh 5:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#044); [Joh
12:43](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#043)).

[2 Corinthians 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co2 12:7</span></span>

exalted above measure--Greek, "overmuch uplifted." How dangerous must
self-exaltation be, when even the apostle required so much restraint!
\[BENGEL\].

abundance--Greek, "the excess"; exceeding greatness.

given . . . me--namely, by God ([Job
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#006); [Phi
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#029)).

thorn in the flesh-- ([Num 33:55](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#055); [Eze
28:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#024)). ALFORD thinks it to be the
same bodily affliction as in [Gal
4:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#013). It certainly was something
personal, affecting him individually, and not as an apostle: causing at
once acute pain (as "thorn" implies) and shame ("buffet": as slaves are
buffeted, [Pe1 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#020)).

messenger of Satan--who is permitted by God to afflict His saints, as
Job ([Job 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#007); [Luk
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#016)).

to buffet me--In Greek, present: to buffet me even now continuously.
After experiencing the state of the blissful angels, he is now exposed
to the influence of an evil angel. The chastisement from hell follows
soon upon the revelation from heaven. As his sight and hearing had been
ravished with heavenly "revelations," so his touch is pained with the
"thorn in the flesh."

[2 Corinthians 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co2 12:8</span></span>

For--"concerning this thing."

thrice--To his first and second prayer no answer came. To his third the
answer came, which satisfied his faith and led him to bow his will to
God's will. So Paul's master, Jesus, thrice prayed on the Mount of
Olives, in resignation to the Father's will. The thorn seems (from [Co2
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#009), and Greek, [Co2
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#007), "that he may buffet me") to have
continued with Paul when he wrote, lest still he should be "overmuch
lifted up."

the Lord--Christ. Escape from the cross is not to be sought even
indirectly from Satan ([Luk 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#007)).
"Satan is not to be asked to spare us" \[BENGEL\].

[2 Corinthians 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co2 12:9</span></span>

said--literally, "He hath said," implying that His answer is enough
\[ALFORD\].

is sufficient--The trial must endure, but the grace shall also endure
and never fail thee \[ALFORD\], ([Deu
33:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#025)). The Lord puts the words into
Paul's mouth, that following them up he might say, "O Lord, Thy grace is
sufficient for me" \[BENGEL\].

my strength--Greek, "power."

is made perfect--has its most perfect manifestation.

in weakness--Do not ask for sensible strength, FOR My power is perfected
in man's "strengthlessness" (so the Greek). The "for" implies, thy
"strengthlessness" (the same Greek as is translated "weakness"; and in
[Co2 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#010), "infirmities") is the very
element in which My "power" (which moves coincident with "My grace")
exhibits itself more perfectly. So that Paul instead of desiring the
infirmity to "depart," "rather" henceforth "glories in infirmities, that
the power of Christ may rest (Greek, 'tabernacle upon,' cover my
infirmity all over as with a tabernacle; compare Greek, [Joh
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012)) upon" him. This effect of
Christ's assurance on him appears, [Co2
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#007); [Co1
2:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#003); compare [Pe1
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#014). The "My" is omitted in some of
the oldest manuscripts; the sense is the same, "power" (referring to
God's power) standing absolutely, in contrast to "weakness" (put
absolutely, for man's weakness). Paul often repeats the word "weakness"
or "infirmity" (the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth chapters) as being
Christ's own word. The Lord has more need of our weakness than of our
strength: our strength is often His rival; our weakness, His servant,
drawing on His resources, and showing forth His glory. Man's extremity
is God's opportunity; man's security is Satan's opportunity. God's way
is not to take His children out of trial, but to give them strength to
bear up against it ([Psa 88:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#007); [Joh
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#015)).

[2 Corinthians 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co2 12:10</span></span>

take pleasure in--too strongly. Rather as the Greek, "I am well
contented in."

infirmities--the genus. Two pairs of species follow, partly coming from
"Satan's messenger," partly from men.

reproaches--"insults."

when--in all the cases just specified.

then--then especially.

strong--"powerful" in "the power of Christ" ([Co2
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#009); [Co2
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#004); [Heb
11:34](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#034)).

[2 Corinthians 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co2 12:11</span></span>

in glorying--omitted in the oldest manuscripts. "I am become a fool." He
sounds a retreat \[BENGEL\].

ye--emphatic. "It is YE who have compelled me; for I ought to have been
commended by you," instead of having to commend myself.

am I behind--rather as Greek, "was I behind" when I was with you?

the very chiefest--rather, as in [Co2
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#005), "those overmuch apostles."

though I be nothing--in myself ([Co1
15:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#009)).

[2 Corinthians 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co2 12:12</span></span>

Truly, &c.--There is understood some such clause as this, "And yet I
have not been commended by you."

in all patience, in signs, &c.--The oldest manuscripts omit "in."
"Patience" is not one of the "signs," but the element IN which they were
wrought: endurance of opposition which did not cause me to leave off
working \[ALFORD\]. Translate, "IN . . . patience, BY signs," &c. His
mode of expression is modest, putting himself, the worker, in the
background, "were wrought," not "I wrought." As the signs have not been
transmitted to us, neither has the apostleship. The apostles have no
literal successors (compare [Act
1:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#021)).

mighty deeds--palpable works of divine omnipotence. The silence of the
apostles in fourteen Epistles, as to miracles, arises from the design of
those Epistles being hortatory, not controversial. The passing allusions
to miracles in seven Epistles prove that the writers were not
enthusiasts to whom miracles seem the most important thing. Doctrines
were with them the important matter, save when convincing adversaries.
In the seven Epistles the mention of miracles is not obtrusive, but
marked by a calm air of assurance, as of facts acknowledged on all
hands, and therefore unnecessary to dwell on. This is a much stronger
proof of their reality than if they were formally and obtrusively
asserted. Signs and wonders is the regular formula of the Old Testament,
which New Testament readers would necessarily understand of supernatural
works. Again, in the Gospels the miracles are so inseparably and
congruously tied up with the history, that you cannot deny the former
without denying the latter also. And then you have a greater difficulty
than ever, namely, to account for the rise of Christianity; so that the
infidel has something infinitely more difficult to believe than that
which he rejects, and which the Christian more rationally accepts.

[2 Corinthians 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co2 12:13</span></span>

wherein you were inferior--that is, were treated with less consideration
by me than were other churches.

I myself--I made a gain of you neither myself, nor by those others whom
I sent, Titus and others ([Co2
12:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#017)).

wrong--His declining support from the Corinthians might be regarded as
the denial to them of a privilege, and a mark of their spiritual
inferiority, and of his looking on them with less confidence and love
(compare [Co2 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#009), [Co2
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#011)).

[2 Corinthians 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co2 12:14</span></span>

the third time--See Introduction to the first Epistle. His second visit
was probably a short one ([Co1 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#007)),
and attended with humiliation through the scandalous conduct of some of
his converts (compare [Co2 12:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#021); [Co2
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#001)). It was probably paid during his
three years' sojourn at Ephesus, from which he could pass so readily by
sea to Corinth (compare [Co2 1:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#015);
[Co2 13:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#001)). The context here implies
nothing of a third preparation to come; but, "I am coming, and the third
time, and will not burden you this time any more than I did at my two
previous visits" \[ALFORD\].

not yours, but you-- ([Phi 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#017)).

children . . . parents--Paul was their spiritual father ([Co1
4:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#014)). He does not, therefore, seek
earthly treasure from them, but lays up the best treasure (namely,
spiritual) "for their souls" ([Co2
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#015)).

[2 Corinthians 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co2 12:15</span></span>

I will . . . spend--all I have.

be spent--all that I am. This is more than even natural parents do. They
"lay up treasures for their children." But I spend not merely my
treasures, but myself.

for you--Greek, "for your souls"; not for your mere bodies.

the less I be loved--Love rather descends than ascends \[BENGEL\]. Love
him as a true friend who seeks your good more than your good will.

[2 Corinthians 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co2 12:16</span></span>

I did not burden you--The "I" in the Greek is emphatic. A possible
insinuation of the Corinthians is hereby anticipated and refuted: "But,
you may say, granted that I did not burden you myself; nevertheless,
being crafty, I caught you (in my net) with guile"; namely, made a gain
of you by means of others ([Th1 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#003)).

[2 Corinthians 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">co2 12:17</span></span>

Paul's reply: You know well I did not. My associates were as
distinterested as myself. An important rule to all who would influence
others for good.

[2 Corinthians 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">co2 12:18</span></span>

I desired Titus--namely, to go unto you. Not the mission mentioned [Co2
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#006), [Co2
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#017), [Co2
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#022); but a mission previous to this
Epistle, probably that from which he had just returned announcing to
Paul their penitence ([Co2 7:6-16](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#006)).

a brother--rather "OUR (literally, 'the') brother"; one well known to
the Corinthians, and perhaps a Corinthian; probably one of the two
mentioned in [Co2 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#018), [Co2
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#022).

same spirit--inwardly.

steps--outwardly.

[2 Corinthians 12:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">co2 12:19</span></span>

Again--The oldest manuscripts read, "This long time ye think that we are
excusing ourselves unto you? (Nay). It is before God (as opposed to
'unto you') that we speak in Christ" ([Co2
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#017)). English Version Greek text was
a correction from [Co2 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#001); [Co2
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#012).

[2 Corinthians 12:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">co2 12:20</span></span>

For--Assigning cause why they needed to be thus spoken to "for their
edification"; namely, his fear that at his coming he should find them
"not such as he would," and so he should be found by them "such as they
would not" like, namely, severe in punishing misconduct.

debates--Greek, "strifes," "contentions."

envyings--The oldest manuscripts read "envying," singular.

strifes--"factions," "intrigues," "factious schemes" \[WAHL\]. Ambitious
self-seeking; from a Greek root, "to work for hire."

backbitings, whisperings--open "slanderings," and "whispering
backbitings" ([Gal 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#020)).

swellings--arrogant elation; puffing up of yourselves. [Jde
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#016), "great swelling words" ([Pe2
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#018)).

[2 Corinthians 12:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">co2 12:21</span></span>

my God--his God, however trying the humiliation that was in store for
him.

will humble me--The indicative implies that the supposition will
actually be so. The faithful pastor is "humbled" at, and "bewails" the
falls of his people, as though they were his own.

sinned already--before my last coming \[BENGEL\], that is, before the
second visit which he paid, and in which he had much at Corinth to
rebuke.

have not repented--shall not have repented \[ALFORD\].

uncleanness--for example, of married persons ([Th1
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#007)).

fornication--among the unmarried.
