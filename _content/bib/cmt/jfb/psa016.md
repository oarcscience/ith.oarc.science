### [Psalms Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#001)

[Psalms 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 16:1</span></span>

Michtam, or, by the change of one letter, Michtab--a "writing," such as
a poem or song (compare [Isa 38:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#009)).
Such a change of the letter m for b was not unusual. The position of
this word in connection with the author's name, being that usually
occupied by some term, such as Psalm or song, denoting the style or
matter of the composition, favors this view of its meaning, though we
know not why this and Psalms 56-60 should be specially, called "a
writing." "A golden (Psalm)," or "a memorial" are explanations proposed
by some--neither of which, however applicable here, appears adapted to
the other Psalms where the term occurs. According to Peter ([Act
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#025)) and Paul ([Act
13:35](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#035)), this Psalm relates to Christ
and expresses the feelings of His human nature, in view of His
sufferings and victory over death and the grave, including His
subsequent exaltation at the right hand of God. Such was the exposition
of the best earlier Christian interpreters. Some moderns have held that
the Psalm relates exclusively to David; but this view is expressly
contradicted by the apostles; others hold that the language of the Psalm
is applicable to David as a type of Christ, capable of the higher sense
assigned it in the New Testament. But then the language of [Psa
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#010) cannot be used of David in any
sense, for "he saw corruption." Others again propose to refer the first
part to David, and the last to Christ; but it is evident that no change
in the subject of the Psalm is indicated. Indeed, the person who appeals
to God for help is evidently the same who rejoices in having found it.
In referring the whole Psalm to Christ, it is, however, by no means
denied that much of its language is expressive of the feelings of His
people, so far as in their humble measure they have the feelings of
trust in God expressed by Him, their head and representative. Such use
of His language, as recorded in His last prayer (John 17:1-26), and even
that which He used in Gethsemane, under similar modifications, is
equally proper. The propriety of this reference of the Psalm to Christ
will appear in the scope and interpretation. In view of the sufferings
before Him, the Saviour, with that instinctive dread of death manifested
in Gethsemane, calls on God to "preserve" Him; He avows His delight in
holiness and abhorrence of the wicked and their wickedness; and for "the
joy that was set before Him, despising the shame" \[[Heb
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#002)\], encourages Himself;
contemplating the glories of the heritage appointed Him. Thus even death
and the grave lose their terrors in the assurance of the victory to be
attained and "the glory that should follow" \[[Pe1
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#011)\]. ([Psa
16:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#001))

Preserve me, &c.--keep or watch over my interests.

in thee . . . I . . . trust--as one seeking shelter from pressing
danger.

[Psalms 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 16:2</span></span>

my soul--must be supplied; expressed in similar cases ([Psa
42:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#005), [Psa
42:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#011)).

my goodness . . . thee--This obscure passage is variously expounded.
Either one of two expositions falls in with the context. "My goodness"
or merit is not on account of Thee--that is, is not for Thy benefit.
Then follows the contrast of [Psa 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#003)
(but is), in respect, or for the saints, &c.--that is, it enures to
them. Or, my goodness--or happiness is not besides Thee--that is,
without Thee I have no other source of happiness. Then, "to the saints,"
&c., means that the same privilege of deriving happiness from God only
is theirs. The first is the most consonant with the Messianic character
of the Psalm, though the latter is not inconsistent with it.

[Psalms 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 16:3</span></span>

saints--or, persons consecrated to God, set apart from others to His
service.

in the earth--that is, land of Palestine, the residence of God's chosen
people--figuratively for the Church.

excellent--or, "nobles," distinguished for moral excellence.

[Psalms 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 16:4</span></span>

He expresses his abhorrence of those who seek other sources of happiness
or objects of worship, and, by characterizing their rites by drink
offerings of blood, clearly denotes idolaters. The word for "sorrows" is
by some rendered "idols"; but, though a similar word to that for idols,
it is not the same. In selecting such a term, there may be an allusion,
by the author, to the sorrows produced by idolatrous practices.

[Psalms 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 16:5</span></span>

God is the chief good, and supplies all need ([Deu
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#009)).

portion of mine inheritance and of my cup--may contain an allusion to
the daily supply of food, and also to the inheritance of Levi ([Deu
18:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#001)).

maintainest--or, drawest out my lot--enlargest it. [Psa
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#007) carries out this idea more fully.

[Psalms 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 16:7</span></span>

given me counsel--cared for me.

my reins--the supposed seat of emotion and thought ([Psa
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#009); [Psa
26:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#002)).

instruct me--or, excite to acts of praise ([Isa
53:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#011); [Heb
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#002)).

[Psalms 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 16:8</span></span>

With God's presence and aid he is sure of safety ([Psa
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#006); [Psa
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#005); [Joh
12:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#027); [Heb
5:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#007)).

[Psalms 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 16:9</span></span>

glory--as heart ([Psa 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#005)), for self.
In [Act 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#026), after the Septuagint,
"my tongue" as "the glory of the frame"--the instrument for praising
God.

flesh--If taken as opposed to soul ([Psa
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#010)), it may mean the body;
otherwise, the whole person (compare [Psa
63:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#001); [Psa
84:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#002)).

rest in hope--(compare Margin).

[Psalms 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 16:10</span></span>

soul--or, "self." This use of "soul" for the person is frequent ([Gen
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#005); [Gen
46:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#026); [Psa
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#002); [Psa
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#002); [Psa
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#001)), even when the body may be the
part chiefly affected, as in [Psa
35:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#013); [Psa
105:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#018). Some cases are cited, as [Lev
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#004); [Num
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#006); [Num
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#006), [Num
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#010); [Num
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#013); [Hag
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#013), &c., which seem to justify
assigning the meaning of body, or dead body; but it will be found that
the latter sense is given by some adjunct expressed or implied. In those
cases person is the proper sense.

wilt not leave . . . hell--abandon to the power of ([Job
39:14](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#014); [Psa
49:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#010)). Hell as ([Gen
42:38](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#038); [Psa
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#005); [Jon
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jon002.htm#002)) the state or region of death, and
so frequently--or the grave itself ([Job
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#013); [Job
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#013); [Ecc
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#010), &c.). So the Greek Hades
(compare [Act 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#027), [Act
2:31](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#031)). The context alone can settle
whether the state mentioned is one of suffering and place of the damned
(compare [Psa 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#017); [Pro
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#005); [Pro
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#027)).

wilt . . . suffer--literally, "give" or "appoint."

Holy One-- ([Psa 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#003)), one who is the
object of God's favor, and so a recipient of divine grace which he
exhibits--pious.

to see--or, "experience"--undergo ([Luk
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#026)).

corruption--Some render the word, the pit, which is possible, but for
the obvious sense which the apostle's exposition ([Act
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#027); [Act
13:36-37](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#036)) gives. The sense of the
whole passage is clearly this: by the use of flesh and soul, the
disembodied state produced by death is indicated; but, on the other
hand, no more than the state of death is intended; for the last clause
of [Psa 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#010) is strictly parallel
with the first, and Holy One corresponds to soul, and corruption to
hell. As Holy One, or David ([Act
13:36-37](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#036)), which denotes the person,
including soul and body, is used for body, of which only corruption can
be predicated (compare [Act 2:31](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#031)); so,
on the contrary, soul, which literally means the immaterial part, is
used for the person. The language may be thus paraphrased, "In death I
shall hope for resurrection; for I shall not be left under its dominion
and within its bounds, or be subject to the corruption which ordinarily
ensues."

[Psalms 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 16:11</span></span>

Raised from the dead, he shall die no more; death hath no more dominion
over him.

Thou wilt show me--guide me to attain.

the path of life--or, "lives"--the plural denoting variety and
abundance--immortal blessedness of every sort--as "life" often denotes.

in thy presence--or, "before Thy faces." The frequent use of this plural
form for "faces" may contain an allusion to the Trinity ([Num
6:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#025); [Psa
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#015); [Psa
31:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#016)).

at thy right hand--to which Christ was exalted ([Psa
110:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001); [Act
2:33](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#033); [Col
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#001); [Heb
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003)). In the glories of this state, He
shall see of the travail ([Isa
53:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#010); [Phi
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#009)) of His soul, and be satisfied.
