### [1 Chronicles Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#001)

[1 Chronicles 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 26:1</span></span>

DIVISIONS OF THE PORTERS. ([Ch1
26:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#001))

Concerning the divisions of the porters--There were four thousand ([Ch1
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#006)), all taken from the families of
the Kohathites and Merarites ([Ch1
26:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#014)), divided into twenty-four
courses--as the priests and musicians.

Meshelemiah the son of Kore, of the sons of Asaph--Seven sons of
Meshelemiah are mentioned ([Ch1 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#002)),
whereas eighteen are given ([Ch1
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#009)), but in this latter number his
relatives are included.

[1 Chronicles 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch1 26:5</span></span>

God blessed him--that is, Obed-edom. The occasion of the blessing was
his faithful custody of the ark ([Sa2
6:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#011)). The nature of the blessing
([Psa 127:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#005)) consisted in the great
increase of progeny by which his house was distinguished; seventy-two
descendants are reckoned.

[1 Chronicles 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 26:6</span></span>

mighty men of valour--The circumstance of physical strength is
prominently noticed in this chapter, as the office of the porters
required them not only to act as sentinels of the sacred edifice and its
precious furniture against attacks of plunderers or popular
insurrection--to be, in fact, a military guard--but, after the temple
was built, to open and shut the gates, which were extraordinarily large
and ponderous.

[1 Chronicles 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch1 26:10</span></span>

Simri the chief . . . though . . . not the first-born--probably because
the family entitled to the right of primogeniture had died out, or
because there were none of the existing families which could claim that
right.

[1 Chronicles 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch1 26:12</span></span>

Among these were the divisions of the porters, even among the chief
men--These were charged with the duty of superintending the watches,
being heads of the twenty-four courses of porters.

[1 Chronicles 26:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch1 26:13</span></span>

THE GATES ASSIGNED BY LOT. ([Ch1
26:13-19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#013))

they cast lots--Their departments of duty, such as the gates they should
attend to, were allotted in the same manner as those of the other
Levitical bodies, and the names of the chiefs or captains are given,
with the respective gates assigned them.

[1 Chronicles 26:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch1 26:15</span></span>

the house of Asuppim--or, "collections," probably a storehouse, where
were kept the grain, wine, and other offerings for the sustenance of the
priests.

[1 Chronicles 26:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch1 26:16</span></span>

the gate Shallecheth--probably the rubbish gate, through which all the
accumulated filth and sweepings of the temple and its courts were poured
out.

by the causeway of the going up--probably the ascending road which was
cast up or raised from the deep valley between Mount Zion and Moriah,
for the royal egress to the place of worship ([Ch2
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#004)).

ward against ward--Some refer these words to Shuppim and Hosah, whose
duty it was to watch both the western gate and the gate Shallecheth,
which was opposite, while others take it as a general statement
applicable to all the guards, and intended to intimate that they were
posted at regular distances from each other, or that they all mounted
and relieved guard at the same time in uniform order.

[1 Chronicles 26:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch1 26:17</span></span>

Eastward were six Levites--because the gate there was the most
frequented. There were four at the north gate; four at the south, at the
storehouse which was adjoining the south, and which had two entrance
gates, one leading in a southwesterly direction to the city, and the
other direct west, two porters each. At the Parbar towards the west,
there were six men posted--four at the causeway or ascent ([Ch1
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#016)), and two at Parbar, amounting
to twenty-four in all, who were kept daily on guard.

[1 Chronicles 26:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch1 26:18</span></span>

Parbar--is, perhaps, the same as Parvar ("suburbs," [Kg2
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#011)), and if so, this gate might be
so called as leading to the suburbs \[CALMET\].

[1 Chronicles 26:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch1 26:20</span></span>

LEVITES THAT HAD CHARGE OF THE TREASURES. ([Ch1
26:20-28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#020))

of the Levites, Ahijah--The heading of this section is altogether
strange as it stands, for it looks as if the sacred historian were going
to commence a new subject different from the preceding. Besides,
"Ahijah, whose name occurs after" the Levites, is not mentioned in the
previous lists. It is totally unknown and is introduced abruptly without
further information; and lastly, Ahijah must have united in his own
person those very offices of which the occupants are named in the verses
that follow. The reading is incorrect. The Septuagint has this very
suitable heading, "And their Levitical brethren over the treasures," &c.
\[BERTHEAU\]. The names of those who had charge of the treasure chambers
at their respective wards are given, with a general description of the
precious things committed to their trust. Those treasures were immense,
consisting of the accumulated spoils of Israelitish victories, as well
as of voluntary contributions made by David and the representatives of
the people.

[1 Chronicles 26:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">ch1 26:29</span></span>

OFFICERS AND JUDGES. ([Ch1 26:29-32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#029))

officers and judges--The word rendered "officers" is the term which
signifies scribes or secretaries, so that the Levitical class here
described were magistrates, who, attended by their clerks, exercised
judicial functions; there were six thousand of them ([Ch1
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#004)), who probably acted like their
brethren on the principle of rotation, and these were divided into three
classes--one ([Ch1 26:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#029)) for the
outward business over Israel; one ([Ch1
26:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#030)), consisting of seventeen
hundred, for the west of Jordan "in all business of the Lord, and in the
service of the king"; and the third ([Ch1
26:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#031)), consisting of twenty-seven
hundred, "rulers for every matter pertaining to God, and affairs of the
king."
