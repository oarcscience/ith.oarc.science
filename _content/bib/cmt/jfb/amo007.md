Testaments*, by Robert Jamieson, A.R. Fausset and David Brown \[1882\]

### [Amos Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#001)

[Amos 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">amo 7:1</span></span>

showed . . . me; and, behold--The same formula prefaces the three
visions in this chapter, and the fourth in [Amo
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#001).

grasshoppers--rather, "locusts" in the caterpillar state, from a Hebrew
root, "to creep forth." In the autumn the eggs are deposited in the
earth; in the spring the young come forth \[MAURER\].

the latter growth--namely, of grass, which comes up after the mowing.
They do not in the East mow their grass and make hay of it, but cut it
off the ground as they require it.

the king's mowings--the first-fruits of the mown grass, tyrannically
exacted by the king from the people. The literal locusts, as in Joel,
are probably symbols of human foes: thus the "growth" of grass "after
the king's mowings" will mean the political revival of Israel under
Jeroboam II ([Kg2 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#025)), after it had
been mown down, as it were, by Hazael and Ben-hadad of Syria ([Kg2
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#003)), \[GROTIUS\].

[Amos 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">amo 7:2</span></span>

by whom shall Jacob arise?--If Thou, O God, dost not spare, how can
Jacob maintain his ground, reduced as he is by repeated attacks of the
Assyrians, and erelong about to be invaded by the Assyrian Pul ([Kg2
15:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#019))? Compare [Isa
51:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#019). The mention of "Jacob" is a
plea that God should "remember for them His covenant" with their
forefather, the patriarch ([Psa
106:45](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#045)).

he is small--reduced in numbers and in strength.

[Amos 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">amo 7:3</span></span>

repented for this--that is, of this. The change was not in the mind of
God ([Num 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#019); [Jam
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#017)), but in the effect outwardly.
God unchangeably does what is just; it is just that He should hear
intercessory prayer ([Jam 5:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#016)), as
it would have been just for Him to have let judgment take its course at
once on the guilty nation, but for the prayer of one or two righteous
men in it (compare [Gen 18:23-33](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#023); [Sa1
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#011); [Jer
42:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#010)). The repentance of the sinner,
and God's regard to His own attributes of mercy and covenanted love,
also cause God outwardly to deal with him as if he repented ([Jon
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#010)), whereas the change in outward
dealing is in strictest harmony with God's own unchangeableness.

It shall not be--Israel's utter overthrow now. Pul was influenced by God
to accept money and withdraw from Israel.

[Amos 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">amo 7:4</span></span>

called to contend--that is with Israel judicially ([Job
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#003); [Isa
66:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#016); [Eze
38:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#022)). He ordered to come at His call
the infliction of punishment by "fire" on Israel, that is, drought
(compare [Amo 4:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#006)), \[MAURER\].
Rather, war ([Num 21:28](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#028)), namely,
Tiglath-pileser \[GROTIUS\].

devoured the . . . deep--that is a great part of Israel, whom he carried
away. Waters are the symbol for many people ([Rev
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#015)).

did eat up a part--namely, all the land (compare [Amo
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#007)) of Israel east of Jordan ([Ch1
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#026); [Isa
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#001)). This was a worse judgment than
the previous one: the locusts ate up the grass: the fire not only
affects the surface of the ground, but burns up the very roots and
reaches even to the deep.

[Amos 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">amo 7:7</span></span>

wall made by a plumb-line--namely, perpendicular.

[Amos 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">amo 7:8</span></span>

plumb-line in . . . midst of . . . Israel--No longer are the symbols, as
in the former two, stated generally; this one is expressly applied to
Israel. God's long-suffering is worn out by Israel's perversity: so Amos
ceases to intercede (compare [Gen
18:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#033)). The plummet line was used not
only in building, but in destroying houses ([Kg2
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#013); [Isa
28:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#017); [Isa
34:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#011); [Lam
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#008)). It denotes that God's judgments
are measured out by the most exact rules of justice. Here it is placed
"in the midst" of Israel, that is, the judgment is not to be confined to
an outer part of Israel, as by Tiglath-pileser; it is to reach the very
center. This was fulfilled when Shalmaneser, after a three years' siege
of Samaria, took it and carried away Israel captive finally to Assyria
([Kg2 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#003), [Kg2
17:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#005), [Kg2
17:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#023)).

not . . . pass by . . . any more--not forgive them any more ([Amo
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#002); [Pro
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#011); [Mic
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#018)).

[Amos 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">amo 7:9</span></span>

high places--dedicated to idols.

of Isaac--They boasted of their following the example of their
forefather Isaac, in erecting high places at Beer-sheba ([Amo
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#005); compare [Gen
26:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#023); [Gen
46:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#001)); but he and Abraham erected them
before the temple was appointed at Jerusalem--and to God; whereas they
did so, after the temple had been fixed as the only place for
sacrifices--and to idols. In the Hebrew here "Isaac" is written with s,
instead of the usual ts; both forms mean "laughter"; the change of
spelling perhaps expresses that their "high places of Isaac" may be well
so called, but not as they meant by the name; for they are only fit to
be laughed at in scorn. Probably, however, the mention of "Isaac" and
"Israel" simply expresses that these names, which their degenerate
posterity boasted in as if ensuring their safety, will not save them and
their idolatrous "sanctuaries" on which they depended from ruin (compare
[Amo 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#014)).

house of Jeroboam with . . . sword--fulfilled in the extinction of
Zachariah, son of Jeroboam II, the last of the descendants of Jeroboam
I, who had originated the idolatry of the calves ([Kg2
15:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#008)).

[Amos 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">amo 7:10</span></span>

AMAZIAH'S CHARGE AGAINST AMOS: HIS DOOM FORETOLD. ([Amo
7:10-17](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#010))

priest of Beth-el--chief priest of the royal sanctuary to the calves at
Beth-el. These being a device of state policy to keep Israel separate
from Judah. Amaziah construes Amos words against them as treason. So in
the case of Elijah and Jeremiah ([Kg1
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#017); [Jer
37:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#013)). So the antitype Jesus was
charged ([Joh 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#012)); political
expediency being made in all ages the pretext for dishonoring God and
persecuting His servants ([Joh
11:48-50](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#048)). So in the case of Paul
([Act 17:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#006); [Act
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#005)).

in the midst of . . . Israel--probably alluding to Amos' own words, "in
the midst of . . . Israel" ([Amo 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#008)),
foretelling the state's overthrow to the very center. Not secretly, or
in a corner, but openly, in the very center of the state, so as to upset
the whole utterly.

land is not able to bear all his words--They are so many and so
intolerable. A sedition will be the result. The mention of his being
"priest of Beth-el" implies that it was for his own priestly gain, not
for the king or state, he was so keen.

[Amos 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">amo 7:11</span></span>

Jeroboam shall die, &c.--Amos had not said this: but that "the house of
Jeroboam" should fall "with the sword" ([Amo
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#009)). But Amaziah exaggerates the
charge, to excite Jeroboam against him. The king, however, did not give
ear to Amaziah, probably from religious awe of the prophet of Jehovah.

[Amos 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">amo 7:12</span></span>

Also--Besides informing the king against Amos, lest that course should
fail, as it did, Amaziah urges the troublesome prophet himself to go
back to his own land Judah, pretending to advise him in friendliness.

seer--said contemptuously in reference to Amos visions which precede.

there eat bread--You can earn a livelihood there, whereas remaining here
you will be ruined. He judges of Amos by his own selfishness, as if
regard to one's own safety and livelihood are the paramount
considerations. So the false prophets ([Eze
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#019)) were ready to say whatever
pleased their hearers, however false, for "handfuls of barley and pieces
of bread."

[Amos 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">amo 7:13</span></span>

prophesy not again-- ([Amo 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#012)).

at Beth-el--Amaziah wants to be let alone at least in his own residence.

the king's chapel--Beth-el was preferred by the king to Dan, the other
seat of the calf-worship, as being nearer Samaria, the capital, and as
hallowed by Jacob of old ([Gen 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#016),
[Gen 28:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#019); [Gen
35:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#006)). He argues by implication
against Amos' presumption, as a private man, in speaking against the
worship sanctioned by the king, and that in the very place consecrated
to it for the king's own devotions.

king's court--that is, residence: the seat of empire, where the king
holds his court, and which thou oughtest to have reverenced. Samaria was
the usual king's residence: but for the convenience of attending the
calf-worship, a royal palace was at Beth-el also.

[Amos 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">amo 7:14</span></span>

I was no prophet--in answer to Amaziah's insinuation ([Amo
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#012)), that he discharged the
prophetical office to earn his "bread" (like Israel's mercenary
prophets). So far from being rewarded, Jehovah's prophets had to expect
imprisonment and even death as the result of their prophesying in
Samaria or Israel: whereas the prophets of Baal were maintained at the
king's expense (compare [Kg1 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#019)). I
was not, says Amos, of the order of prophets, or educated in their
schools, and deriving a livelihood from exercising the public functions
of a prophet. I am a shepherd (compare [Amo
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#015), "flock"; the Hebrew for
"herdsman" includes the meaning, shepherd, compare [Amo
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001)) in humble position, who did not
even think of prophesying among you, until a divine call impelled me to
it.

prophet's son--that is, disciple. Schools of prophets are mentioned
first in First Samuel; in these youths were educated to serve the
theocracy as public instructors. Only in the kingdom of the ten tribes
is the continuance of the schools of the prophets mentioned. They were
missionary stations near the chief seats of superstition in Israel, and
associations endowed with the Spirit of God; none were admitted but
those to whom the Spirit had been previously imparted. Their spiritual
fathers travelled about to visit the training schools, and cared for the
members and even their widows ([Kg2
4:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#001)). The pupils had their common
board in them, and after leaving them still continued members. The
offerings which in Judah were given by the pious to the Levites, in
Israel went to the schools of the prophets ([Kg2
4:42](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#042)). Prophecy (for example, Elijah
and Elisha) in Israel was more connected with extraordinary events than
in Judah, inasmuch as, in the absence of the legal hierarchy of the
latter, it needed to have more palpable divine sanction.

sycamore--abounding in Palestine. The fruit was like the fig, but
inferior; according to PLINY, a sort of compound, as the name expresses,
of the fig and the mulberry. It was only eaten by the poorest (compare
[Kg1 10:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#027)).

gatherer--one occupied with their cultivation \[MAURER\]. To cultivate
it, an incision was made in the fruit when of a certain size, and on the
fourth day afterwards it ripened \[PLINY, Natural History, 13.7,14\].
GROTIUS from JEROME says, if it be not plucked off and "gathered" (which
favors English Version), it is spoiled by gnats.

[Amos 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">amo 7:15</span></span>

took me as I followed the flock--So David was taken ([Sa2
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#008); [Psa
78:70-71](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#070)). Messiah is the antitypical
Shepherd ([Psa 23:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#001); John 10:1-18).

unto my people--"against" \[MAURER\]; so [Amo
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#016). Jehovah claims them still as His
by right, though slighting His authority. God would recover them to His
service by the prophet's ministry.

[Amos 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">amo 7:16</span></span>

drop--distil as the refreshing drops of rain ([Deu
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#002); [Eze
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#002); compare [Mic
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#006), [Mic
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#011)).

[Amos 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">amo 7:17</span></span>

Thy wife shall be an harlot in the city--that is, shall be forced by the
enemy, while thou art looking on, unable to prevent her dishonor ([Isa
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#016); [Lam
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#011)). The words, "saith the Lord,"
are in striking opposition to "Thou sayest ([Amo
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#016)).

divided by line--among the foe.

a polluted land--Israel regarded every foreign land as that which really
her own land was now, "polluted" ([Isa
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#005); [Jer
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#007)).
