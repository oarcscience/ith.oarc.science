### [Amos Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#001)

[Amos 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">amo 4:1</span></span>

DENUNCIATION OF ISRAEL'S NOBLES FOR OPPRESSION; AND OF THE WHOLE NATION
FOR IDOLATRY; AND FOR THEIR BEING UNREFORMED EVEN BY GOD'S JUDGMENTS:
THEREFORE THEY MUST PREPARE FOR THE LAST AND WORST JUDGMENT OF ALL.
([Amo 4:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#001))

kine of Bashan--fat and wanton cattle such as the rich pasture of Bashan
(east of Jordan, between Hermon and Gilead) was famed for ([Deu
32:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#014); [Psa
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#012); [Eze
39:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#018)). Figurative for those luxurious
nobles mentioned, [Amo 3:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#009), [Amo
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#012), [Amo
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#015). The feminine, kine, or cows, not
bulls, expresses their effeminacy. This accounts for masculine forms in
the Hebrew being intermixed with feminine; the latter being figurative,
the former the real persons meant.

say to their masters--that is to their king, with whom the princes
indulged in potations ([Hos 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#005)), and
whom here they importune for more wine. "Bring" is singular, in the
Hebrew implying that one "master" alone is meant.

[Amos 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">amo 4:2</span></span>

The Lord--the same Hebrew as "masters" ([Amo
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#001)). Israel's nobles say to their
master or lord, Bring us drink: but "the Lord" of him and them "hath
sworn," &c.

by his holiness--which binds Him to punish the guilty ([Psa
89:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#035)).

he will take yon away--that is God by the instrumentality of the enemy.

with hooks--literally, "thorns" (compare [Ch2
33:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#011)). As fish are taken out of the
water by hooks, so the Israelites are to be taken out of their cities by
the enemy ([Eze 29:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#004); compare [Job
41:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#001); [Jer
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#016); [Hab
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#015)). The image is the more
appropriate, as anciently captives were led by their conquerors by a
hook made to pass through the nose ([Kg2
19:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#028)), as is to be seen in the
Assyrian remains.

[Amos 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">amo 4:3</span></span>

go out at the breaches--namely, of the city walls broken by the enemy.

every cow at that which is before her--figurative for the once luxurious
nobles (compare "kine of Bashan," [Amo
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#001)) shall go out each one right
before her; not through the gates, but each at the breach before him,
not turning to the right or left, apart from one another.

ye shall cast them into the palace--"them," that is, "your posterity,"
from [Amo 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#002). You yourselves shall
escape through the breaches, after having cast your little children into
the palace, so as not to see their destruction, and to escape the more
quickly. Rather, "ye shall cast yourselves into the palace," so as to
escape from it out of the city \[CALVIN\]. The palace, the scene of the
princes riots ([Amo 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#010), [Amo
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#015); [Amo
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#001)), is to be the scene of their
ignominious flight. Compare in the similar case of Jerusalem's capture,
the king's escape by way of the palace, through a breach in the wall
([Eze 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#005), [Eze
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#012)). GESENIUS translates, "Ye shall
be cast (as captives) into the (enemy's) stronghold"; in this view, the
enemy's stronghold is called "palace," in retributive contrast to the
"palaces" of Israel's nobles, the store houses of their robberies ([Amo
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#010)).

[Amos 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">amo 4:4</span></span>

God gives them up to their self-willed idolatry, that they may see how
unable their idols are to save them from their coming calamities. So
[Eze 20:39](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#039).

Beth-el-- ([Amo 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#014)).

Gilgal-- ([Hos 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#015); [Hos
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#015); [Hos
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#011)).

sacrifices every morning--as commanded in the law ([Num
28:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#003)). They imitated the letter,
while violating by calf-worship the spirit, of the Jerusalem
temple-worship.

after three years--every third year; literally, "after three (years of)
days" (that is, the fullest complement of days, or a year); "after three
full years." Compare [Lev 25:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#020); [Jdg
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#010), and "the days" for the years,
[Joe 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#002). So a month of days is used
for a full month, wanting no day to complete it ([Gen
29:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#014), Margin; [Num
11:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#020)). The Israelites here also
kept to the letter of the law in bringing in the tithes of their
increase every third year ([Deu 14:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#028);
[Deu 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#012)).

[Amos 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">amo 4:5</span></span>

offer--literally, "burn incense"; that is, "offer a sacrifice of
thanksgiving with burnt incense and with leavened bread." The
frankincense was laid on the meat offering, and taken by the priest from
it to burn on the altar ([Lev 2:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#001),
[Lev 2:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#008)). Though unleavened cakes
were to accompany the peace offering sacrifice of animals, leavened
bread was also commanded ([Lev
7:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#012)), but not as a "meat offering"
([Lev 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#011)).

this liketh you--that is, this is what ye like.

[Amos 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">amo 4:6</span></span>

Jehovah details His several chastisements inflicted with a view to
reclaiming them: but adds to each the same sad result, "yet have ye not
returned unto Me" ([Isa 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#013); [Jer
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#003); [Hos
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#010)); the monotonous repetition of
the same burden marking their pitiable obstinacy.

cleanness of teeth--explained by the parallel, "want of bread." The
famine alluded to is that mentioned in [Kg2
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#001) \[GROTIUS\]. Where there is no
food to masticate, the teeth are free from uncleanness, but it is the
cleanness of want. Compare [Pro 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#004),
"Where no oxen are, the crib is clean." So spiritually, where all is
outwardly smooth and clean, it is often because there is no solid
religion. Better fighting and fears with real piety, than peace and
respectable decorum without spiritual life.

[Amos 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">amo 4:7</span></span>

withholden . . . rain . . . three months to . . . harvest--the time when
rain was most needed, and when usually "the latter rain" fell, namely,
in spring, the latter half of February, and the whole of March and April
([Hos 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#003); [Joe
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#023)). The drought meant is that
mentioned in [Kg1 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#001) \[GROTIUS\].

rain upon one city . . . not . . . upon another--My rain that fell was
only partial.

[Amos 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">amo 4:8</span></span>

three cities wandered--that is, the inhabitants of three cities (compare
[Jer 14:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#001)). GROTIUS explains this
verse and [Amo 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#007), "The rain fell on
neighboring countries, but not on Israel, which marked the drought to
be, not accidental, but the special judgment of God." The Israelites
were obliged to leave their cities and homes to seek water at a distance
\[CALVIN\].

[Amos 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">amo 4:9</span></span>

blasting--the blighting influence of the east wind on the corn ([Gen
41:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#006)).

when . . . gardens . . . increased--In vain ye multiplied your gardens,
&c., for I destroyed their produce. BOCHART supports Margin, "the
multitude of your gardens."

palmer worm--A species of locust is here meant, hurtful to fruits of
trees, not to herbage or corn. The same east wind which brought the
drought, blasting, and mildew, brought also the locusts into Judea
\[BOCHART\], ([Exo 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#013)).

[Amos 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">amo 4:10</span></span>

pestilence after the manner of Egypt--such as I formerly sent on the
Egyptians ([Exo 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#003), [Exo
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#008), &c.; [Exo
12:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#029); [Deu
28:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#027), [Deu
28:60](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#060)). Compare the same phrase, [Isa
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#024).

have taken away your horses--literally, "accompanied with the captivity
of your horses"; I have given up your young men to be slain, and their
horses to be taken by the foe (compare [Kg2
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#007)).

stink of your camps--that is, of your slain men (compare [Isa
34:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#003); [Joe
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#020)).

to come up unto your nostrils--The Hebrew is more emphatic, "to come up,
and that unto your nostrils."

[Amos 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">amo 4:11</span></span>

some of you--some parts of your territory.

as God overthrew Sodom-- ([Deu 29:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#023);
[Isa 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#019); [Jer
49:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#018); [Jer
50:40](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#040); [Pe2
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#006); [Jde
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#007)). "God" is often repeated in
Hebrew instead of "I." The earthquake here apparently alluded to is not
that in the reign of Uzziah, which occurred "two years" later ([Amo
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001)). Traces of earthquakes and
volcanic agency abound in Palestine. The allusion here is to some of the
effects of these in previous times. Compare the prophecy, Deu. 28:15-68,
with [Amo 4:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#006) here.

as a firebrand plucked out of . . . burning--(Compare [Isa
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#004); [Zac
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#002)). The phrase is proverbial for a
narrow escape from utter extinction. Though Israel revived as a nation
under Jeroboam II, it was but for a time, and that after an almost utter
destruction previously ([Kg2 14:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#026)).

[Amos 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">amo 4:12</span></span>

Therefore--as all chastisements have failed to make thee "return unto
Me."

thus will I do unto thee--as I have threatened ([Amo
4:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#002)).

prepare to meet thy God--God is about to inflict the last and worst
judgment on thee, the extinction of thy nationality; consider then what
preparation thou canst make for encountering Him as thy foe ([Jer
46:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#014); [Luk
14:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#031)). But as that would be
madness to think of ([Isa 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#004); [Eze
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#014); [Heb
10:31](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#031)), see what can be done towards
mitigating the severity of the coming judgment, by penitence ([Isa
27:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#005); [Co1
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#031)). This latter exhortation is
followed up in [Amo 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#004), [Amo
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#006), [Amo
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#008), [Amo
5:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#014).

[Amos 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">amo 4:13</span></span>

The God whom Israel is to "prepare to meet" ([Amo
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#012)) is here described in sublime
terms.

wind--not as the Margin, "spirit." The God with whom thou hast to do is
the Omnipotent Maker of things seen, such as the stupendous mountains,
and of things too subtle to be seen, though of powerful agency, as the
"wind."

declareth unto man . . . his thought-- ([Psa
139:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#002)). Ye think that your secret
thoughts escape My cognizance, but I am the searcher of hearts.

maketh . . . morning darkness-- ([Amo
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#008); [Amo
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#009)). Both literally turning the
sunshine into darkness, and figuratively turning the prosperity of the
ungodly into sudden adversity ([Psa
73:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#012), [Psa
73:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#018); compare [Jer
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#016)).

treadeth upon . . . high places--God treadeth down the proud of the
earth. He subjects to Him all things however high they be ([Mic
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#003)). Compare [Deu
32:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#013); [Deu
33:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#029), where the same phrase is used
of God's people, elevated by God above every other human height.
