### [Malachi Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#001)

[Malachi 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mal 4:1</span></span>

GOD'S COMING JUDGMENT: TRIUMPH OF THE GODLY: RETURN TO THE LAW THE BEST
PREPARATION FOR JEHOVAH'S COMING: ELIJAH'S PREPARATORY MISSION OF
REFORMATION. ([Mal 4:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#001))

the day cometh . . . burn-- ([Mal 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#002);
[Pe2 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#007)). Primarily is meant the
judgment coming on Jerusalem; but as this will not exhaust the meaning,
without supposing what is inadmissible in Scripture--exaggeration--the
final and full accomplishment, of which the former was the earnest, is
the day of general judgment. This principle of interpretation is not
double, but successive fulfilment. The language is abrupt, "Behold, the
day cometh! It burns like a furnace." The abruptness imparts terrible
reality to the picture, as if it suddenly burst on the prophet's view.

all the proud--in opposition to the cavil above ([Mal
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#015)), "now we call the proud (haughty
despisers of God) happy."

stubble-- ([Oba 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#018); [Mat
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#012)). As Canaan, the inheritance of
the Israelites, was prepared for their possession by purging out the
heathen, so judgment on the apostates shall usher in the entrance of the
saints upon the Lord's inheritance, of which Canaan is the type--not
heaven, but earth to its utmost bounds ([Psa
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#008)) purged of all things that offend
([Mat 13:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#041)), which are to be
"gathered out of His kingdom," the scene of the judgment being that also
of the kingdom. The present dispensation is a spiritual kingdom,
parenthetical between the Jews' literal kingdom and its antitype, the
coming literal kingdom of the Lord Jesus.

neither root nor branch--proverbial for utter destruction ([Amo
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#009)).

[Malachi 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mal 4:2</span></span>

The effect of the judgment on the righteous, as contrasted with its
effect on the wicked ([Mal 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#001)). To
the wicked it shall be as an oven that consumes the stubble ([Mat
6:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#030)); to the righteous it shall be
the advent of the gladdening Sun, not of condemnation, but "of
righteousness"; not destroying, but "healing" ([Jer
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#006)).

you that fear my name--The same as those in [Mal
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#016), who confessed God amidst
abounding blasphemy ([Isa 66:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#005); [Mat
10:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#032)). The spiritual blessings
brought by Him are summed up in the two, "righteousness" ([Co1
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#030)) and spiritual "healing" ([Psa
103:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#003); [Isa
57:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#019)). Those who walk in the dark now
may take comfort in the certainty that they shall walk hereafter in
eternal light ([Isa 50:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#010)).

in his wings--implying the winged swiftness with which He shall appear
(compare "suddenly," [Mal 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001)) for the
relief of His people. The beams of the Sun are His "wings." Compare
"wings of the morning," [Psa 139:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#009).
The "Sun" gladdening the righteous is suggested by the previous "day" of
terror consuming the wicked. Compare as to Christ, [Sa2
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#004); [Psa
84:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#011); [Luk
1:78](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#078); [Joh
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009); [Joh
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#012); [Eph
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#014); and in His second coming, [Pe2
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#019). The Church is the moon
reflecting His light ([Rev 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#001)). The
righteous shall by His righteousness "shine as the Sun in the kingdom of
the Father" ([Mat 13:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#043)).

ye shall go forth--from the straits in which you were, as it were, held
captive. An earnest of this was given in the escape of the Christians to
Pella before the destruction of Jerusalem.

grow up--rather, "leap" as frisking calves \[CALVIN\]; literally,
"spread," "take a wide range."

as calves of the stall--which when set free from the stall disport with
joy ([Act 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#008); [Act
13:52](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#052); [Act
20:24](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#024); [Rom
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#017); [Gal
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#022); [Phi
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#004); [Pe1
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#008)). Especially the godly shall
rejoice at their final deliverance at Christ's second coming ([Isa
61:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#010)).

[Malachi 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mal 4:3</span></span>

Solving the difficulty ([Mal 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#015))
that the wicked often now prosper. Their prosperity and the adversity of
the godly shall soon be reversed. Yea, the righteous shall be the army
attending Christ in His final destruction of the ungodly ([Sa2
22:43](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#043); [Psa
49:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#014); [Psa
47:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#003); [Mic
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#010); [Zac
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#005); [Co1
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#002); [Rev
2:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#026); [Rev
19:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#014)).

ashes--after having been burnt with the fire of judgment ([Mal
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#001)).

[Malachi 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mal 4:4</span></span>

Remember . . . law--"The law and all the prophets" were to be in force
until John ([Mat 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#013)), no prophet
intervening after Malachi; therefore they are told, "Remember the law,"
for in the absence of living prophets, they were likely to forget it.
The office of Christ's forerunner was to bring them back to the law,
which they had too much forgotten, and so "to make ready a people
prepared for the Lord" at His coming ([Luk
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#017)). God withheld prophets for a
time that men might seek after Christ with the greater desire
\[CALVIN\]. The history of human advancement is marked by periods of
rest, and again progress. So in Revelation: it is given for a time; then
during its suspension men live on the memories of the past. After
Malachi there was a silence of four hundred years; then a harbinger of
light in the wilderness, ushering in the brightest of all the lights
that had been manifested, but short-lived; then eighteen centuries
during which we have been guided by the light which shone in that last
manifestation. The silence has been longer than before, and will be
succeeded by a more glorious and awful revelation than ever. John the
Baptist was to "restore" the defaced image of "the law," so that the
original might be recognized when it appeared among men \[HINDS\]. Just
as "Moses" and "Elias" are here connected with the Lord's coming, so at
the transfiguration they converse with Him, implying that the law and
prophets which had prepared His way were now fulfilled in Him.

statutes . . . judgments--ceremonial "statutes": "judgments" in civil
questions at issue. "The law" refers to morals and religion.

[Malachi 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mal 4:5</span></span>

I send you Elijah--as a means towards your "remembering the law" ([Mal
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#004)).

the prophet--emphatical; not "the Tishbite"; for it is in his official,
not his personal capacity, that his coming is here predicted. In this
sense, John the Baptist was an Elijah in spirit ([Luk
1:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#016)), but not the literal Elijah;
whence when asked, "Art thou Elias?" ([Joh
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#021)), He answered, "I am not." "Art
thou that prophet?" "No." This implies that John, though knowing from
the angel's announcement to his father that he was referred to by [Mal
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#005) ([Luk
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#017)), whence he wore the costume of
Elijah, yet knew by inspiration that he did not exhaustively fulfil all
that is included in this prophecy: that there is a further fulfilment
(compare Note, see on [Mal 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001)). As
Moses in [Mal 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#004) represents the law,
so Elijah represents the prophets. The Jews always understood it of the
literal Elijah. Their saying is, "Messiah must be anointed by Elijah."
As there is another consummating advent of Messiah Himself, so also of
His forerunner Elijah; perhaps in person, as at the transfiguration
([Mat 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#003); compare [Mat
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#011)). He in his appearance at the
transfiguration in that body on which death had never passed is the
forerunner of the saints who shall be found alive at the Lord's second
coming. [Rev 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#003) may refer to the
same witnesses as at the transfiguration, Moses and Elijah; [Rev
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#006) identifies the latter (compare
[Kg1 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#001); [Jam
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#017)). Even after the transfiguration
Jesus ([Mat 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#011)) speaks of Elijah's
coming "to restore all things" as still future, though He adds that
Elijah (in the person of John the Baptist) is come already in a sense
(compare [Act 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#021)). However, the
future forerunner of Messiah at His second coming may be a prophet or
number of prophets clothed with Elijah's power, who, with zealous
upholders of "the law" clothed in the spirit of "Moses," may be the
forerunning witnesses alluded to here and in [Rev
11:2-12](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#002). The words "before the . . .
dreadful day of the Lord," show that John cannot be exclusively meant;
for he came before the day of Christ's coming in grace, not before His
coming in terror, of which last the destruction of Jerusalem was the
earnest ([Mal 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#001); [Joe
2:31](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#031)).

[Malachi 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mal 4:6</span></span>

turn . . . heart of . . . fathers to . . . children, &c.--Explained by
some, that John's preaching should restore harmony in families. But [Luk
1:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#016) substitutes for "the heart of
the children to the fathers," "the disobedient to the wisdom of the
just," implying that the reconciliation to be effected was that between
the unbelieving disobedient children and the believing ancestors, Jacob,
Levi, "Moses," and "Elijah" (just mentioned) (compare [Mal
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#002); [Mal
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#004), [Mal
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#006); [Mal
3:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#003)). The threat here is that, if
this restoration were not effected, Messiah's coming would prove "a
curse" to the "earth," not a blessing. It proved so to guilty Jerusalem
and the "earth," that is, the land of Judea when it rejected Messiah at
His first advent, though He brought blessings ([Gen
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#003)) to those who accepted Him ([Joh
1:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#011)). Many were delivered from the
common destruction of the nation through John's preaching ([Rom
9:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#029); [Rom
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#005)). It will prove so to the
disobedient at His second advent, though He comes to be glorified in His
saints ([Th2 1:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#006)).

curse--Hebrew, Cherem, "a ban"; the fearful term applied by the Jews to
the extermination of the guilty Canaanites. Under this ban Judea has
long lain. Similar is the awful curse on all of Gentile churches who
love not the Lord Jesus now ([Co1
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#022)). For if God spare not the
natural branches, the Jews, much less will He spare unbelieving
professors of the Gentiles ([Rom
11:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#020)). It is deeply suggestive
that the last utterance from heaven for four hundred years before
Messiah was the awful word "curse." Messiah's first word on the mount
was "Blessed" ([Mat 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#003)). The law
speaks wrath; the Gospel, blessing. Judea is now under the "curse"
because it rejects Messiah; when the spirit of Elijah, or a literal
Elijah, shall bring the Jewish children back to the Hope of their
"fathers," blessing shall be theirs, whereas the apostate "earth" shall
be "smitten with the curse" previous to the coming restoration of all
things ([Zac 12:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#013)).

May the writer of this Commentary and his readers have grace "to take
heed to the sure word of prophecy as unto a light shining in a dark
place, until the day dawn!" To the triune Jehovah be all glory ascribed
for ever!
