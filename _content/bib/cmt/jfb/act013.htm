<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">act 13:1</A></FONT></span></p>BARNABAS AND SAUL, DIVINELY CALLED TO LABOR AMONG THE GENTILES, ARE SET APART AND SENT FORTH BY THE CHURCH AT ANTIOCH. (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#001">Act 13:1-3</A>)
<p>
<p>there were . . . certain prophets--(See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#027">Act 11:27</A>). 
<p>
<p>and teachers; as Barnabas, &amp;c.--implying that there were others there, besides; but, according to what appears the true reading, the meaning is simply that those here mentioned were in the Church at Antioch as prophets and teachers. 
<p>
<p>Simeon . . . Niger--of whom nothing is known. 
<p>
<p>Lucius of Cyrene-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#020">Act 2:20</A>). He is mentioned, in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#021">Rom 16:21</A>, as one of Paul's kinsmen. 
<p>
<p>Manaen--or Menahem, the name of one of the kings of Israel (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#014">Kg2 15:14</A>). 
<p>
<p>which had been brought up with--or, the foster brother of. 
<p>
<p>Herod the tetrarch--that is, Antipas, who was himself "brought up with a certain private person at Rome" [JOSEPHUS, Antiquities, 17.1,3]. How differently did these two foster brothers turn out--the one, abandoned to a licentious life and stained with the blood of the most distinguished of God's prophets, though not without his fits of reformation and seasons of remorse; the other, a devoted disciple of the Lord Jesus and prophet of the Church at Antioch! But this is only what may be seen in every age: "Even so, Father, for so it seemeth good in Thy sight.' If the courtier, whose son, at the point of death, was healed by our Lord (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#046">Joh 4:46</A>) was of Herod's establishment, while Susanna's husband was his steward (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#003">Luk 8:3</A>), his foster brother's becoming a Christian and a prophet is something remarkable. 
<p>
<p>and Saul--last of all, but soon to become first. Henceforward this book is almost exclusively occupied with him; and his impress on the New Testament, on Christendom, and on the world is paramount.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#002">Acts 13:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">act 13:2</A></FONT></span></p>As they ministered to the Lord--The word denotes the performance of official duties of any kind, and was used to express the priestly functions under the Old Testament. Here it signifies the corresponding ministrations of the Christian Church. 
<p>
<p>and fasted--As this was done in other cases on special occasions (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#003">Act 13:3</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#014">Act 13:14</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#023">Act 13:23</A>), it is not improbable that they had been led to expect some such prophetic announcement at this time. 
<p>
<p>the Holy Ghost said--through some of the prophets mentioned in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#001">Act 13:1</A>. 
<p>
<p>Separate me--So <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#001">Rom 1:1</A>. 
<p>
<p>for the work whereunto I have called them--by some communication, perhaps, to themselves: in the case of Saul at least, such a designation was indicated from the first (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#021">Act 22:21</A>). Note.--While the personality of the Holy Ghost is manifest from this language, His supreme divinity will appear equally so by comparing it with <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#004">Heb 5:4</A>.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#003">Acts 13:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">act 13:3</A></FONT></span></p>laid their hands on them--(See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#006">Act 6:6</A>) --"recommending them to the grace of God for the work which they had to fulfil" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#026">Act 14:26</A>). 
<p>
<p>sent them away--with the double call--of the Spirit first, and next of the Church. So clothed, their mission is thus described: "They being sent forth by the Holy Ghost." Have we not here for all time the true principle of appointment to sacred offices?
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#004">Acts 13:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">act 13:4</A></FONT></span></p>ARRIVING IN CYPRUS THEY PREACH IN THE SYNAGOGUES OF SALAMIS--AT PAPHOS, ELYMAS IS STRUCK BLIND, AND THE GOVERNOR OF THE ISLAND IS CONVERTED. (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#004">Act 13:4-12</A>)
<p>
<p>departed unto Seleucia--the seaport of Antioch, from which it lay nearly due west fifteen miles, and five from the Mediterranean shore, on the river Orontes. 
<p>
<p>thence sailed to Cyprus--whose high mountain summits are easily seen in clear weather from the coast [COLONEL CHESNEY in HOWSON]. "Four reasons may have induced them to turn in first to this island: (1) Its nearness to the mainland; (2) It was the native place of Barnabas, and since the time when Andrew found his brother Simon, and brought him to Jesus, and "Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus," family ties had not been without effect on the progress of the Gospel. (3) It could not be unnatural to suppose that the truth would be welcomed in Cyprus when brought by Barnabas and his kinsman Mark, to their own connections or friends. The Jews were numerous in Salamis. By sailing to that city, they were following the track of the synagogues; and though their mission was chiefly to the Gentiles, their surest course for reaching them was through the proselytes and Hellenizing Jews. (4) Some of the Cypriotes were already Christians. Indeed, no one place out of Palestine, except Antioch, had been so honorably associated with the work of successful evangelization" [HOWSON].
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#005">Acts 13:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">act 13:5</A></FONT></span></p>and when they were at Salamis--the Grecian capital of the island, on the eastern side, and not many hours' sail from Seleucia. At this busy mercantile port immense numbers of Jews were settled, which accounts for what is here said, that they had more than one synagogue, in which Barnabas and Saul preached, while other cities had one only. 
<p>
<p>they had . . . John--Mark. 
<p>
<p>to their minister--"for their officer". (See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#020">Luk 4:20</A>). With what fruit they preached here is not said. Probably their feeling was what Paul afterwards expressed at Antioch in Pisidia (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#046">Act 13:46</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#006">Acts 13:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">act 13:6</A></FONT></span></p>when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos--on the opposite or west side of the island, about one hundred miles by land, along the south coast; the Roman capital, where the governor resided. 
<p>
<p>they found a . . . sorcerer--one of a numerous class of impostors who, at this time of general unbelief, were encouraged even by cultivated Romans.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#007">Acts 13:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">act 13:7</A></FONT></span></p>Which was with the deputy--properly, "the proconsul." This name was reserved for the governors of settled provinces, which were placed under the Roman Senate, and is never given in the New Testament to Pilate, Felix, or Festus, who were but procurators, or subordinate administrators of unsettled, imperial, military provinces. Now as Augustus reserved Cyprus for himself, its governor would in that case have been not a proconsul, but simply a procurator, had not the emperor afterwards restored it to the Senate, as a Roman historian [DIO CASSIUS] expressly states. In most striking confirmation of this minute accuracy of the sacred historian, coins have actually been found in the island, stamped with the names of proconsuls, both in Greek and Latin [AKERMAN, Numismatic Illustrations of the New Testament]. (GROTIUS and BENGEL, not aware of this, have missed the mark here). 
<p>
<p>Sergius Paulus, a prudent man--an intelligent man, who thirsting for truth, sent for Barnabas and Saul, desiring ("earnestly desiring") to hear the Word of God.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#008">Acts 13:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">act 13:8</A></FONT></span></p>But Elymas--or "the wise." 
<p>
<p>for so is his name by interpretation--the word is from the Arabic. 
<p>
<p>withstood them--perceiving, probably, how eagerly the proconsul was drinking in the word, and fearing a dismissal. (Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#008">Ti2 3:8</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#009">Acts 13:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">act 13:9</A></FONT></span></p>Then Saul . . . also . . . called Paul--and henceforward Paul only; a softening of his former name, in accommodation to Roman ears, and (as the word signifies "little") probably with allusion as elsewhere to his insignificance of stature and appearance (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#001">Co2 10:1</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#010">Co2 10:10</A>) [WEBSTER and WILKINSON]. 
<p>
<p>filled with the Holy Ghost--the Spirit coming mightily upon him. 
<p>
<p>set his eyes on him and said--Henceforward Barnabas sinks into the background. The whole soul of his great colleague, now drawn out, as never before, shoots, by the lightning gaze of his eye, through the dark and tortuous spirit of the sorcerer. What a picture!
<p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">act 13:10</A></FONT></span></p>full of all subtlety--referring to his magic arts. 
<p>
<p>and all malice--The word signifies "readiness for anything," knavish dexterity. 
<p>
<p>thou child of the devil . . . enemy of all righteousness--These were not words of passion, for immediately before uttering them, it is said he was "filled with the Holy Ghost" [CHRYSOSTOM]. 
<p>
<p>wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord--referring to his having to that hour made a trade of leading his fellow creatures astray.

<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#012">Acts 13:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">act 13:12</A></FONT></span></p>Then the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord--so marvellously attested; compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#027">Mar 1:27</A>.

<p>
<p>they came to Perga in Pamphylia--The distance from Paphos to Attalia, on the Gulf of Pamphylia (see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#025">Act 14:25</A>), sailing in a northwest direction, is not much greater than from Seleucia to Salamis on the east. Perga was the metropolis of Pamphylia, on the river Cestrus, and about seven miles inland from Attalia. 
<p>
<p>and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem--As Paul afterwards peremptorily refused to take Mark with him on his second missionary journey, because he "had departed [or 'fallen off'] from them and had not gone with them to the work" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#038">Act 15:38</A>), there can be no doubt that he had either wearied of it or been deterred by the prospect of the dangers which lay before him. (But see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#037">Act 15:37</A>, &amp;c.).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#014">Acts 13:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">act 13:14</A></FONT></span></p>departed from Perga--apparently without making any stay or doing any work: compare the different language of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#025">Act 14:25</A>, and see immediately below. 
<p>
<p>came to Antioch in Pisidia--usually so called, to distinguish it from Antioch in Syria, from which they had started, though it actually lies in Phrygia, and almost due north from Perga. It was a long journey, and as it lay almost entirely through rugged mountain passes, while "rivers burst out at the base of huge cliffs, or dash down wildly through narrow ravines," it must have been a perilous one. The whole region was, and to this day is, infested by robbers, as ancient history and modern travels abundantly attest; and there can be but little doubt that to this very journey Paul many years after alludes, when he speaks amidst his "journeyings often," of his "perils of rivers" (as the word is), and his "perils of robbers" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#026">Co2 11:26</A>). If this journey were taken in May--and earlier than that the passes would have been blocked up with snow--it would account for their not staying at Perga, whose hot streets are then deserted; "men, women, and children, flocks, herds, camels, and asses, all ascending at the beginning of the hot season from the plains to the cool basin-like hollows on the mountains, moving in the same direction with our missionaries" [HOWSON].

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">act 13:20</A></FONT></span></p>after that he gave . . . judges . . . about the space of four hundred and fifty years--As this appears to contradict <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#001">Kg1 6:1</A>, various solutions have been proposed. Taking the words as they stand in the Greek, thus, "after that, by the space of four hundred fifty years, He gave judges," the meaning may be, that about four hundred fifty years elapsed from the time of the covenant with Abraham until the period of the judges; which is historically correct, the word "about" showing that chronological exactness was not aimed at. But taking the sense to be as in our version, that it was the period of the judges itself which lasted about four hundred fifty years, this statement also will appear historically correct, if we include in it the interval of subjection to foreign powers which occurred during the period of the judges, and understand it to describe the whole period from the settlement of the tribes in Canaan to the establishment of royalty. Thus, from the Exodus to the building of the temple were five hundred ninety-two years [JOSEPHUS, Antiquities, 8.3.1]; deduct forty years in the wilderness; twenty-five years of Joshua's rule [JOSEPHUS, Antiquities, 5.1.29]; forty years of Saul's reign (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#002">Act 13:2</A>); forty of David's and the first four years of Solomon's reign (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#001">Kg1 6:1</A>), and there remain, just four hundred forty-three years; or, in round numbers, "about four hundred fifty years."

His personal name "JESUS" is emphatically added, as designed to express that very character. (See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021">Mat 1:21</A>).

<p>
<p>as it is written in the second psalm--in many manuscripts "the first Psalm"; what we call the first being regarded by the ancient Jews as only an introduction to the Psalter, which was considered to begin with the second. 
<p>
<p>this day have I begotten thee--As the apostle in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#004">Rom 1:4</A> regards the resurrection of Christ merely as the manifestation of a prior Sonship, which he afterwards (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#032">Act 8:32</A>) represents as essential, it is plain that this is his meaning here. (Such declarative meaning of the verb "to be" is familiar to every reader of the Bible). See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#008">Joh 15:8</A>, "So shall ye be," that is, be seen to be "My disciples." It is against the whole sense of the New Testament to ascribe the origin of Christ's Sonship to His resurrection.

<p>
<p>I will give you the sure mercies of David-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#003">Isa 55:3</A>). The word rendered "mercies" is peculiar, denoting the sanctity of them, as comprehending the whole riches of the new covenant; while the other word, "sure," points to the certainty with which they would, through David's Seed, be at length all substantiated. See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014">Joh 1:14</A>. But how do these words prove the resurrection of Christ? "They presuppose it; for since an eternal kingdom was promised to David, the Ruler of this kingdom could not remain under the power of death. But to strengthen the indefinite prediction by one more definite, the apostle adduces <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#010">Psa 16:10</A>, of which Peter had given the same explanation (see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#027">Act 2:27</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#030">Act 2:30-31</A>), both apostles denying the possibility of its proper reference to David" [OLSHAUSEN].

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_036">act 13:36</A></FONT></span></p>For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God--rather, "served," in his own generation, the will (or "counsel") of God; yielding himself an instrument for the accomplishment of God's high designs, and in this respect being emphatically "the man after God's own heart." This done, he "fell asleep, and was gathered to his fathers, and saw corruption." David, therefore (argues the apostle), could not be the subject of his own prediction, which had its proper fulfilment only in the resurrection of the uncorrupted body of the Son of God, emphatically God's "Holy One."

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_039">act 13:39</A></FONT></span></p>by him all that believe are justified from all things--The sense requires that a pause in the sentence be made here: "By him the believer is absolved from all charges of the law." What follows, 
<p>
<p>from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses--is not an exceptional but an explanatory clause. The meaning is not, "Though the law justifies from many things, it cannot justify from all things, but Christ makes up all deficiencies"; but the meaning is, "By Christ the believer is justified from all things, whereas the law justifies from nothing." (Note.--The deeper sense of justification, the positive side of it, is reserved for the Epistles, addressed to the justified themselves: and whereas it is the resurrection of Christ here, and throughout the Acts chiefly, which is dwelt on, because the first thing in order to bring peace to the guilty through Christ was to establish His Messiahship by His resurrection, in the Epistles to believers His death as the way of reconciliation is fully unfolded).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_040">act 13:40</A></FONT></span></p>Beware, therefore, &amp;c.--By this awful warning of the Old Testament the apostle would fain "shut them up unto the faith."

The words, from <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#005">Hab 1:5</A>, were originally a merciful but fruitless warning against the approaching destruction of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans and the Babylonish captivity. As such nothing could more fitly describe the more awful calamity impending over the generation which the apostle addressed.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_042">act 13:42</A></FONT></span></p>And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath--rather (according to what is beyond doubt the true reading), "Now, as they were going out [of the synagogue], they besought"--that is, not the Gentiles, whose case comes in afterwards, but the mixed congregation of Jews and proselytes, to whom the discourse had been addressed, entreated to have another hearing of such truths; those of them, that is, who had been impressed. "And after the breaking up of the synagogue, many of" both classes, Jews and religious; proselytes, followed Paul and Barnabas (observe, from this time forward, the inverted order of these names; except <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#014">Act 14:14</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#007">Act 13:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#025">Act 12:25</A>; see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#014">Act 14:14</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#007">Act 13:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#025">Act 12:25</A>). These names evidently been won to the Gospel by what they had heard, and felt a clinging to their spiritual benefactors.

<p>
<p>persuaded them to continue in the grace of God--which they had experienced through the Gospel. (Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#023">Act 11:23</A>).

<p>
<p>saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy--rather, "indignation," and broke out in their usual manner. 
<p>
<p>contradicting and blaspheming--There is nothing more awful than Jewish fury and execration of the name of Jesus of Nazareth, when thoroughly roused.

<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#046">Acts 13:46</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_046">act 13:46</A></FONT></span></p>Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, &amp;c.--This is in the highest style of a last and solemn protestation. 
<p>
<p>It was necessary that the word should first have been spoken to you--See the direction of Christ in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#047">Luk 24:47</A>; also <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#016">Rom 1:16</A>.

<p>
<p>I have set thee--that is, Messiah; from which Paul inferred that he was but following out this destination of his Lord, in transferring to the Gentiles those "unsearchable riches" which were now by the Jews rejected and despised.

<p>
<p>and glorified the word of the Lord--by a cordial reception of it. 
<p>
<p>and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed--a very remarkable statement, which cannot, without force, be interpreted of anything lower than this, that a divine ordination to eternal life is the cause, not the effect, of any man's believing.
