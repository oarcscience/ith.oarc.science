### [Hosea Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#001)

[Hosea 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hos 13:1</span></span>

EPHRAIM'S SINFUL INGRATITUDE TO GOD, AND ITS FATAL CONSEQUENCE; GOD'S
PROMISE AT LAST. (Hos. 13:1-16)

This chapter and the fourteenth chapter probably belong to the troubled
times that followed Pekah's murder by Hoshea (compare [Hos
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#011); [Kg2
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#030)). The subject is the idolatry of
Ephraim, notwithstanding God's past benefits, destined to be his ruin.

When Ephraim spake trembling--rather, "When Ephraim (the tribe most
powerful among the twelve in Israel's early history) spake
(authoritatively) there was trembling"; all reverentially feared him
\[JEROME\], (compare [Job 29:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#008), [Job
29:21](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#021)).

offended in Baal--that is, in respect to Baal, by worshipping him ([Kg1
16:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#031)), under Ahab; a more heinous
offense than even the calves. Therefore it is at this climax of guilt
that Ephraim "died." Sin has, in the sight of God, within itself the
germ of death, though that death may not visibly take effect till long
after. Compare [Rom 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#009), "Sin revived,
and I died." So Adam in the day of his sin was to die, though the
sentence was not visibly executed till long after ([Gen
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#017); [Gen
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#005)). Israel is similarly represented
as politically dead in Eze. 37:1-28.

[Hosea 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">hos 13:2</span></span>

according to their own understanding--that is, their arbitrary devising.
Compare "will-worship," [Col 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#023). Men
are not to be "wise above that which is written," or to follow their own
understanding, but God's command in worship.

kiss the calves--an act of adoration to the golden calves (compare [Kg1
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#018); [Job
31:27](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#027); [Psa
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#012)).

[Hosea 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">hos 13:3</span></span>

they shall be as the morning cloud . . . dew-- ([Hos
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#004)). As their "goodness" soon
vanished like the morning cloud and dew, so they shall perish like them.

the floor--the threshing-floor, generally an open area, on a height,
exposed to the winds.

chimney--generally in the East an orifice in the wall, at once admitting
the light, and giving egress to the smoke.

[Hosea 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hos 13:4</span></span>

([Hos 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#009); [Isa
43:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#011)).

no saviour--temporal as well as spiritual.

besides me-- ([Isa 45:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#021)).

[Hosea 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">hos 13:5</span></span>

I did know thee--did acknowledge thee as Mine, and so took care of thee
([Psa 144:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#003); [Amo
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#002)). As I knew thee as Mine, so thou
shouldest know no God but Me ([Hos
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#004)).

in . . . land of . . . drought-- ([Deu
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#015)).

[Hosea 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">hos 13:6</span></span>

Image from cattle, waxing wanton in abundant pasture (compare [Hos
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#005), [Hos
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#008); [Deu
32:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#013)). In proportion as I fed them
to the full, they were so satiated that "their heart was exalted"; a sad
contrast to the time when, by God's blessing, Ephraim truly "exalted
himself in Israel" ([Hos 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#001)).

therefore have they forgotten me--the very reason why men should
remember God (namely, prosperity, which comes from Him) is the cause
often of their forgetting Him. God had warned them of this danger ([Deu
6:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#011)).

[Hosea 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">hos 13:7</span></span>

([Hos 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#014); [Lam
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#010)).

leopard--The Hebrew comes from a root meaning "spotted" (compare [Jer
13:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#023)). Leopards lurk in thickets and
thence spring on their victims.

observe--that is, lie in wait for them. Several manuscripts, the
Septuagint, Vulgate, Syriac, and Arabic read, by a slight change of the
Hebrew vowel pointing, "by the way of Assyria," a region abounding in
leopards and lions. English Version is better.

[Hosea 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">hos 13:8</span></span>

"Writers on the natures of beasts say that none is more savage than a
she bear, when bereaved of her whelps" \[JEROME\].

caul of . . . heart--the membrane enclosing it: the pericardium.

there--"by the way" ([Hos 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#007)).

[Hosea 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">hos 13:9</span></span>

thou . . . in me--in contrast.

hast destroyed thyself--that is, thy destruction is of thyself ([Pro
6:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#032); [Pro
8:36](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#036)).

in me is thine help--literally, "in thine help" (compare [Deu
33:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#026)). Hadst thou rested thy hope in
Me, I would have been always ready at hand for thy help \[GROTIUS\].

[Hosea 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">hos 13:10</span></span>

I will be thy king; where--rather, as the Margin and the Septuagint,
Syriac, Vulgate, "Where now is thy king?" \[MAURER\]. English Version
is, however, favored both by the Hebrew, by the antithesis between
Israel's self-chosen and perishing kings, and God, Israel's abiding King
(compare [Hos 3:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#004)).

where . . . Give me a king--Where now is the king whom ye substituted in
My stead? Neither Saul, whom the whole nation begged for, not contented
with Me their true king ([Sa1 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#005),
[Sa1 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#007), [Sa1
8:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#019); [Sa1
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#019)), nor Jeroboam, whom
subsequently the ten tribes chose instead of the line of David My
anointed, can save thee now. They had expected from their kings what is
the prerogative of God alone, namely, the power of saving them.

judges--including all civil authorities under the king (compare [Amo
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#003)).

[Hosea 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">hos 13:11</span></span>

I gave . . . king in . . . anger . . . took . . . away in . . .
wrath--true both of Saul ([Sa1
15:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#022); [Sa1
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#001)) and of Jeroboam's line ([Kg2
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#030)). Pekah was taken away through
Hoshea, as he himself took away Pekahiah; and as Hoshea was soon to be
taken away by the Assyrian king.

[Hosea 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">hos 13:12</span></span>

bound up . . . hid--Treasures, meant to be kept, are bound up and
hidden; that is, do not flatter yourselves, because of the delay, that I
have forgotten your sin. Nay ([Hos
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#009)), Ephraim's iniquity is kept as it
were safely sealed up, until the due time comes for bringing it forth
for punishment ([Deu 32:34](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#034); [Job
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#017); [Job
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#019); compare [Rom
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#005)). Opposed to "blotting out the
handwriting against" the sinner ([Col
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#014)).

[Hosea 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">hos 13:13</span></span>

sorrows of a travailing woman--calamities sudden and agonizing ([Jer
30:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#006)).

unwise--in not foreseeing the impending judgment, and averting it by
penitence ([Pro 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#003)).

he should not stay long in the place of the breaking forth of
children--When Israel might deliver himself from calamity by the pangs
of penitence, he brings ruin on himself by so long deferring a new birth
unto repentance, like a child whose mother has not strength to bring it
forth, and which therefore remains so long in the passage from the womb
as to run the risk of death ([Kg2
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#003); [Isa
37:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#003); [Isa
66:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#009)).

[Hosea 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">hos 13:14</span></span>

Applying primarily to God's restoration of Israel from Assyria
partially, and, in times yet future, fully from all the lands of their
present long-continued dispersion, and political death (compare [Hos
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#002); [Isa
25:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#008); [Isa
26:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#019); [Eze
37:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#012)). God's power and grace are
magnified in quickening what to the eye of flesh seems dead and hopeless
([Rom 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#017), [Rom
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#019)). As Israel's history, past and
future, has a representative character in relation to the Church, this
verse is expressed in language alluding to Messiah's (who is the ideal
Israel) grand victory over the grave and death, the first-fruits of His
own resurrection, the full harvest to come at the general resurrection;
hence the similarity between this verse and Paul's language as to the
latter ([Co1 15:55](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#055)). That similarity
becomes more obvious by translating as the Septuagint, from which Paul
plainly quotes; and as the same Hebrew word is translated in [Hos
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#010), "O death, where are thy plagues
(paraphrased by the Septuagint, 'thy victory')? O grave, where is thy
destruction (rendered by the Septuagint, 'thy sting')?" The question is
that of one triumphing over a foe, once a cruel tyrant, but now robbed
of all power to hurt.

repentance shall be hid from mine eyes--that is, I will not change My
purpose of fulfilling My promise by delivering Israel, on the condition
of their return to Me (compare [Hos
14:2-8](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#002); [Num
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#019); [Rom
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#029)).

[Hosea 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">hos 13:15</span></span>

fruitful--referring to the meaning of "Ephraim," from a Hebrew root, "to
be fruitful" ([Gen 41:52](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#052)). It was long
the most numerous and flourishing of the tribes ([Gen
48:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#019)).

wind of the Lord--that is, sent by the Lord (compare [Isa
40:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#007)), who has His instruments of
punishment always ready. The Assyrian, Shalmaneser, &c., is meant ([Jer
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#011); [Jer
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#017); [Eze
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#012)).

from the wilderness--that is, the desert part of Syria ([Kg1
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#015)), the route from Assyria into
Israel.

he--the Assyrian invader. Shalmaneser began the siege of Samaria in 723
B.C. Its close was in 721 B.C., the first year of Sargon, who seems to
have usurped the throne of Assyria while Shalmaneser was at the siege of
Samaria. Hence, while [Kg2 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#006)
states, "the king of Assyria took Samaria," [Kg2
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#010) says, "at the end of three years
they took it." In Sargon's magnificent palace at Khorsabad, inscriptions
mention the number--27,280--of Israelites carried captive from Samaria
and other places of Israel by the founder of the palace \[G. V. SMITH\].

[Hosea 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">hos 13:16</span></span>

This verse and [Hos 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#015) foretell the
calamities about to befall Israel before her restoration ([Hos
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#014)), owing to her impenitence.

her God--the greatest aggravation of her rebellion, that it was against
her God ([Hos 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#004)).

infants . . . dashed in pieces, &c.-- ([Kg2
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#012); [Kg2
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#016); [Amo
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#013)).
