### [Malachi Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#001)

[Malachi 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mal 2:1</span></span>

REPROOF OF THE PRIESTS FOR VIOLATING THE COVENANT; AND THE PEOPLE ALSO
FOR MIXED MARRIAGES AND UNFAITHFULNESS. (Mal. 2:1-17)

for you--The priests in particular are reproved, as their part was to
have led the people aright, and reproved sin, whereas they encouraged
and led them into sin. Ministers cannot sin or suffer alone. They drag
down others with them if they fall \[MOORE\].

[Malachi 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mal 2:2</span></span>

lay . . . to heart--My commands.

send a curse--rather, as Hebrew, "the curse"; namely, that denounced in
[Deu 27:15-26](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#015); Deu. 28:15-68.

curse your blessings--turn the blessings you enjoy into curses ([Psa
106:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#015)).

cursed them--Hebrew, them severally; that is, I have cursed each one of
your blessings.

[Malachi 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mal 2:3</span></span>

corrupt, &c.--literally, "rebuke," answering to the opposite prophecy of
blessing ([Mal 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#011)), "I will rebuke
the devourer." To rebuke the seed is to forbid its growing.

your--literally, "for you"; that is, to your hurt.

dung of . . . solemn feasts--The dung in the maw of the victims
sacrificed on the feast days; the maw was the perquisite of the priests
([Deu 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#003)), which gives peculiar
point to the threat here. You shall get the dung of the maw as your
perquisite, instead of the maw.

one shall take you away with it--that is, ye shall be taken away with
it; it shall cleave to you wherever ye go \[MOORE\]. Dung shall be
thrown on your faces, and ye shall be taken away as dung would be,
dung-begrimed as ye shall be ([Kg1
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#010); compare [Jer
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#004); [Jer
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#019)).

[Malachi 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mal 2:4</span></span>

ye shall know--by bitter experience of consequences, that it was with
this design I admonished you, in order "that My covenant with Levi might
be" maintained; that is, that it was for your own good (which would be
ensured by your maintaining the Levitical command) I admonished you,
that ye should return to your duty \[MAURER\] (compare [Mal
2:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#005)). Malachi's function was that of
a reformer, leading back the priests and people to the law ([Mal
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#004)).

[Malachi 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mal 2:5</span></span>

He describes the promises, and also the conditions of the covenant;
Levi's observance of the conditions and reward (compare [Num
25:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#011), Phinehas' zeal); and on the
other hand the violation of the conditions, and consequent punishment of
the present priests. "Life" here includes the perpetuity implied in [Num
25:13](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#013), "everlasting priesthood."
"Peace" is specified both here and there. MAURER thus explains it; the
Hebrew is, literally, "My covenant was with him, life and peace (to be
given him on My part), and I gave them to him: (and on his part) fear
(that is, reverence), and he did fear Me," &c. The former portion of the
verse expresses the promise, and Jehovah's fulfilment of it; the latter,
the condition, and Levi's steadfastness to it ([Deu
33:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#008)). The Jewish priests
self-deceivingly claimed the privileges of the covenant, while
neglecting the conditions of it, as if God were bound by it to bless
them, while they were free from all the obligation which it imposed to
serve Him. The covenant is said to be not merely "of life and peace,"
but "life and peace"; for the keeping of God's law is its own reward
([Psa 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#011)).

[Malachi 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mal 2:6</span></span>

law of truth was in his mouth--He taught the people the truths of the
law in all its fulness ([Deu 33:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#010)).
The priest was the ordinary expounder of the law; the prophets were so
only on special occasions.

iniquity . . . not found--no injustice in his judicial functions ([Deu
17:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#008); [Deu
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#017)).

walked with me--by faith and obedience ([Gen
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#022)).

in peace--namely, the "peace" which was the fruit of obeying the
covenant ([Mal 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#005)). Peace with God,
man, and one's own conscience, is the result of "walking with God"
(compare [Job 22:21](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#021); [Isa
27:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#005); [Jam
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#018)).

turn may . . . from iniquity--both by positive precept and by tacit
example "walking with God" ([Jer
23:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#022); [Dan
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#003); [Jam
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#020)).

[Malachi 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mal 2:7</span></span>

In doing so ([Mal 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#006)) he did his duty
as a priest, "for," &c.

knowledge--of the law, its doctrines, and positive and negative precepts
([Lev 10:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#010); [Deu
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#008); [Jer
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#018); [Hag
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#011)).

the law--that is, its true sense.

messenger of . . . Lord--the interpreter of His will; compare as to the
prophets, [Hag 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#013). So ministers are
called "ambassadors of Christ" ([Co2
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#020)); and the bishops of the seven
churches in Revelation, "angels" or messengers ([Rev
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#001), [Rev
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#008), [Rev
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#012), [Rev
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#018); [Rev
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#001), [Rev
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#007), [Rev
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#014); compare [Gal
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#014)).

[Malachi 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mal 2:8</span></span>

out of the way--that is, from the covenant.

caused many to stumble--By scandalous example, the worse inasmuch as the
people look up to you as ministers of religion ([Sa1
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#017); [Jer
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#015); [Mat
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#006); [Luk
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#001)).

at the law--that is, in respect to the observances of the law.

corrupted . . . covenant--made it of none effect, by not fulfilling its
conditions, and so forfeiting its promises ([Zac
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#010); [Neh
13:29](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#029)).

[Malachi 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mal 2:9</span></span>

Because ye do not keep the condition of the covenant, I will not fulfil
the promise.

partial in the law--having respect to persons rather than to truth in
the interpretation and administration of the law ([Lev
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#015)).

[Malachi 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mal 2:10</span></span>

Reproof of those who contracted marriages with foreigners and repudiated
their Jewish wives.

Have we not all one father?--Why, seeing we all have one common origin,
"do we deal treacherously against one another" ("His brother" being a
general expression implying that all are "brethren" and sisters as
children of the same Father above, [Th1
4:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#003) and so including the wives so
injured)? namely, by putting away our Jewish wives, and taking foreign
women to wife (compare [Mal 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#014) and
[Mal 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#011); [Ezr
9:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#001)), and so violating "the
covenant" made by Jehovah with "our fathers," by which it was ordained
that we should be a people separated from the other peoples of the world
([Exo 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005); [Lev
20:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#024), [Lev
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#026); [Deu
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#003)). To intermarry with the heathen
would defeat this purpose of Jehovah, who was the common Father of the
Israelites in a peculiar sense in which He was not Father of the
heathen. The "one Father" is Jehovah ([Job
31:15](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#015); [Co1
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#006); [Eph
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#006)). "Created us": not merely
physical creation, but "created us" to be His peculiar and chosen people
([Psa 102:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#018); [Isa
43:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#001); [Isa
45:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#008); [Isa
60:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#021); [Eph
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#010)), \[CALVIN\]. How marked the
contrast between the honor here done to the female sex, and the
degradation to which Oriental women are generally subjected!

[Malachi 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mal 2:11</span></span>

dealt treacherously--namely, in respect to the Jewish wives who were put
away ([Mal 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#014); also [Mal
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#010), [Mal
2:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#015)).

profaned the holiness of . . . Lord--by ill-treating the Israelites
(namely, the wives), who were set apart as a people holy unto the Lord:
"the holy seed" ([Ezr 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#002); compare
[Jer 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#003)). Or, "the holiness of the
Lord" means His holy ordinance and covenant ([Deu
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#003)). But "which He loved," seems to
refer to the holy people, Israel, whom God so gratuitously loved ([Mal
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#002)), without merit on their part
([Psa 47:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#004)).

married, &c.-- ([Ezr 9:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#001); [Ezr
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#002); [Neh
13:23](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#023), &c.).

daughter of a strange god--women worshipping idols: as the worshipper in
Scripture is regarded in the relation of a child to a father ([Jer
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#027)).

[Malachi 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mal 2:12</span></span>

master and . . . scholar--literally, "him that watcheth and him that
answereth." So "wakeneth" is used of the teacher or "master" ([Isa
50:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#004)); masters are watchful in
guarding their scholars. The reference is to the priests, who ought to
have taught the people piety, but who led them into evil. "Him that
answereth" is the scholar who has to answer the questions of his teacher
([Luk 2:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#047)) \[GROTIUS\]. The Arabs
have a proverb, "None calling and none answering," that is, there being
not one alive. So GESENIUS explains it of the Levite watches in the
temple ([Psa 134:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#001)), one watchman
calling and another answering. But the scholar is rather the people, the
pupils of the priests "in doing this," namely, forming unions with
foreign wives. "Out of the tabernacles of Jacob" proves it is not the
priests alone. God will spare neither priests nor people who act so.

him that offereth--His offerings will not avail to shield him from the
penalty of his sin in repudiating his Jewish wife and taking a foreign
one.

[Malachi 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mal 2:13</span></span>

done again--"a second time": an aggravation of your offense ([Neh
13:23-31](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#023)), in that it is a relapse
into the sin already checked once under Ezra ([Ezr
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#010)) \[HENDERSON\]. Or, "the second
time" means this: Your first sin was your blemished offerings to the
Lord: now "again" is added your sin towards your wives \[CALVIN\].

covering . . . altar . . . with tears--shed by your unoffending wives,
repudiated by you that ye might take foreign wives. CALVIN makes the
"tears" to be those of all the people on perceiving their sacrifices to
be sternly rejected by God.

[Malachi 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mal 2:14</span></span>

Wherefore?--Why does God reject our offerings?

Lord . . . witness between thee and . . . wife--(so [Gen
31:49-50](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#049)).

of thy youth--The Jews still marry very young, the husband often being
but thirteen years of age, the wife younger ([Pro
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#018); [Isa
54:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#006)).

wife of thy covenant--not merely joined to thee by the marriage covenant
generally, but by the covenant between God and Israel, the
covenant-people, whereby a sin against a wife, a daughter of Israel, is
a sin against God \[MOORE\]. Marriage also is called "the covenant of
God" ([Pro 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#017)), and to it the
reference may be ([Gen 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#024); [Mat
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#006); [Co1
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#010)).

[Malachi 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mal 2:15</span></span>

MAURER and HENGSTENBERG explain the verse thus: The Jews had defended
their conduct by the precedent of Abraham, who had taken Hagar to the
injury of Sarah, his lawful wife; to this Malachi says now, "No one
(ever) did so in whom there was a residue of intelligence
(discriminating between good and evil); and what did the one (Abraham,
to whom you appeal for support) do, seeking a godly seed?" His object
(namely, not to gratify passion, but to obtain the seed promised by God)
makes the case wholly inapplicable to defend your position. MOORE (from
FAIRBAIRN) better explains, in accordance with [Mal
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#010), "Did not He make (us Israelites)
one? Yet He had the residue of the Spirit (that is, His isolating us
from other nations was not because there was no residue of the Spirit
left for the rest of the world). And wherefore (that is, why then did He
thus isolate us as) the one (people; the Hebrew is 'the one')? In order
that He might seek a godly seed"; that is, that He might have "a seed of
God," a nation the repository of the covenant, and the stock of the
Messiah, and the witness for the one God amidst the surrounding
polytheisms. Marriage with foreign women, and repudiation of the wives
wedded in the Jewish covenant, utterly set aside this divine purpose.
CALVIN thinks "the one" to refer to the conjugal one body formed by the
original pair ([Gen 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#024)). God might
have joined many wives as one with the one husband, for He had no lack
of spiritual being to impart to others besides Eve; the design of the
restriction was to secure a pious offspring: but compare Note, see on
[Mal 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#010). One object of the marriage
relation is to raise a seed for God and for eternity.

[Malachi 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mal 2:16</span></span>

putting away--that is, divorce.

for one covereth violence with . . . garment--MAURER translates, "And
(Jehovah hateth him who) covereth his garment (that is, his wife, in
Arabic idiom; compare [Gen 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#016), 'He
is to thee a covering of thy eyes'; the husband was so to the wife, and
the wife to the husband; also [Deu
22:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#030); [Rut
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#009); [Eze
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#008)) with injury." The Hebrew favors
"garment," being accusative of the thing covered. Compare with English
Version, [Psa 73:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#006), "violence covereth
them as a garment." Their "violence" is the putting away of their wives;
the "garment" with which they try to cover it is the plea of Moses'
permission ([Deu 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#001); compare [Mat
19:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#006)).

[Malachi 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mal 2:17</span></span>

wearied . . . Lord-- ([Isa 43:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#024)).
This verse forms the transition to [Mal
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001), &c. The Jewish skeptics of that
day said virtually, God delighteth in evil-doers (inferring this from
the prosperity of the surrounding heathen, while they, the Jews, were
comparatively not prosperous: forgetting that their attendance to minor
and external duties did not make up for their neglect of the weightier
duties of the law; for example, the duty they owed their wives, just
previously discussed); or (if not) Where (is the proof that He is) the
God of judgment? To this the reply ([Mal
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001)) is, "The Lord whom ye seek, and
whom as messenger of the covenant (that is, divine ratifier of God's
covenant with Israel) ye delight in (thinking He will restore Israel to
its proper place as first of the nations), shall suddenly come," not as
a Restorer of Israel temporally, but as a consuming Judge against
Jerusalem ([Amo 5:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#018)). The
"suddenly" implies the unpreparedness of the Jews, who, to the last of
the siege, were expecting a temporal deliverer, whereas a destructive
judgment was about to destroy them. So skepticism shall be rife before
Christ's second coming. He shall suddenly and unexpectedly come then
also as a consuming Judge to unbelievers ([Pe2
3:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#003)). Then, too, they shall affect
to seek His coming, while really denying it ([Isa
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#019); [Jer
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#015); [Eze
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#022), [Eze
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#027)).
