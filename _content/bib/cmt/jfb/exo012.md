Testaments*, by Robert Jamieson, A.R. Fausset and David Brown \[1882\]

### [Exodus Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#001)

[Exodus 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 12:1</span></span>

THE PASSOVER INSTITUTED. ([Exo
12:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#001))

the Lord spake unto Moses--rather, "had spoken unto Moses and Aaron";
for it is evident that the communication here described must have been
made to them on or before the tenth of the month.

[Exodus 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">exo 12:2</span></span>

this month shall be unto you the beginning of months--the first not only
in order but in estimation. It had formerly been the seventh according
to the reckoning of the civil year, which began in September, and
continued unchanged, but it was thenceforth to stand first in the
national religious year which began in March, April.

[Exodus 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">exo 12:3</span></span>

Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel--The recent events had
prepared the Israelitish people for a crisis in their affairs, and they
seem to have yielded implicit obedience at this time to Moses. It is
observable that, amid all the hurry and bustle of such a departure,
their serious attention was to be given to a solemn act of religion.

a lamb for an house--a kid might be taken ([Exo
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#005)). The service was to be a
domestic one, for the deliverance was to be from an evil threatened to
every house in Egypt.

[Exodus 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">exo 12:4</span></span>

if the household be too little for the lamb, &c.--It appears from
JOSEPHUS that ten persons were required to make up the proper paschal
communion.

every man according to his eating--It is said that the quantity eaten of
the paschal lamb, by each individual, was about the size of an olive.

[Exodus 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">exo 12:5</span></span>

lamb . . . without blemish--The smallest deformity or defect made a lamb
unfit for sacrifice--a type of Christ ([Heb
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#026); [Pe1
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#019)).

a male of the first year--Christ in the prime of life.

[Exodus 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">exo 12:6</span></span>

keep it up until the fourteenth day, &c.--Being selected from the rest
of the flock, it was to be separated four days before sacrifice; and for
the same length of time was Christ under examination and His spotless
innocence declared before the world.

kill it in the evening--that is, the interval between the sun's
beginning to decline, and sunset, corresponding to our three o'clock in
the afternoon.

[Exodus 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">exo 12:7</span></span>

take of the blood, and strike it on the two side-posts, &c.--as a sign
of safety to those within. The posts must be considered of tents, in
which the Israelites generally lived, though some might be in houses.
Though the Israelites were sinners as well as the Egyptians, God was
pleased to accept the substitution of a lamb--the blood of which, being
seen sprinkled on the doorposts, procured them mercy. It was to be on
the sideposts and upper doorposts, where it might be looked to, not on
the threshold, where it might be trodden under foot. This was an emblem
of the blood of sprinkling ([Heb
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#024); [Heb
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#029)).

[Exodus 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">exo 12:8</span></span>

roast with fire--for the sake of expedition; and this difference was
always observed between the cooking of the paschal lamb and the other
offerings ([Ch2 35:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#013)).

unleavened bread--also for the sake of despatch ([Deu
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#003)), but as a kind of corruption
([Luk 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#001)) there seems to have been a
typical meaning under it ([Co1 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#008)).

bitter herbs--literally, "bitters"--to remind the Israelites of their
affliction in Egypt, and morally of the trials to which God's people are
subject on account of sin.

[Exodus 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">exo 12:9</span></span>

Eat not of it raw--that is, with any blood remaining; a caveat against
conformity to idolatrous practices. It was to be roasted whole, not a
bone to be broken, and this pointed to Christ ([Joh
19:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#036)).

[Exodus 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">exo 12:10</span></span>

let nothing of it remain until the morning--which might be applied in a
superstitious manner, or allowed to putrefy, which in a hot climate
would speedily have ensued; and which was not becoming in what had been
offered to God.

[Exodus 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">exo 12:11</span></span>

THE RITE OF THE PASSOVER. ([Exo
12:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#011))

thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on your
feet--as prepared for a journey. The first was done by the skirts of the
loose outer cloth being drawn up and fastened in the girdle, so as to
leave the leg and knee free for motion. As to the other, the Orientals
never wear shoes indoors, and the ancient Egyptians, as appears from the
monuments, did not usually wear either shoes or sandals. These
injunctions seem to have applied chiefly to the first celebration of the
rite.

it is the Lord's passover--called by this name from the blood-marked
dwellings of the Israelites being passed over figuratively by the
destroying angel.

[Exodus 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">exo 12:12</span></span>

smite . . . gods of Egypt--perhaps used here for princes and grandees.
But, according to Jewish tradition, the idols of Egypt were all on that
night broken in pieces (see [Num 33:4](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#004);
[Isa 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#001)).

[Exodus 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">exo 12:14</span></span>

for a memorial, &c.--The close analogy traceable in all points between
the Jewish and Christian passovers is seen also in the circumstance that
both festivals were instituted before the events they were to
commemorate had transpired.

[Exodus 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">exo 12:15</span></span>

UNLEAVENED BREAD. (Exo. 12:15-51)

Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread, &c.--This was to commemorate
another circumstance in the departure of the Israelites, who were urged
to leave so hurriedly that their dough was unleavened ([Exo
12:39](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#039)), and they had to eat unleavened
cakes ([Deu 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#003)). The greatest care
was always taken by the Jews to free their houses from leaven--the owner
searching every corner of his dwelling with a lighted candle. A
figurative allusion to this is made ([Co1
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#007)). The exclusion of leaven for
seven days would not be attended with inconvenience in the East, where
the usual leaven is dough kept till it becomes sour, and it is kept from
one day to another for the purpose of preserving leaven in readiness.
Thus even were there none in all the country, it could be got within
twenty-four hours \[HARMER\].

that soul shall be cut off--excommunicated from the community and
privileges of the chosen people.

[Exodus 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">exo 12:16</span></span>

there shall be an holy convocation--literally, calling of the people,
which was done by sound of trumpets ([Num
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#002)), a sacred assembly--for these
days were to be regarded as Sabbaths--excepting only that meat might be
cooked on them ([Exo 16:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#023)).

[Exodus 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">exo 12:17</span></span>

ye shall observe, &c.--The seven days of this feast were to commence the
day after the passover. It was a distinct festival following that feast;
but although this feast was instituted like the passover before the
departure, the observance of it did not take place till after.

[Exodus 12:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">exo 12:19</span></span>

stranger--No foreigner could partake of the passover, unless
circumcised; the "stranger" specified as admissible to the privilege
must, therefore, be considered a Gentile proselyte.

[Exodus 12:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">exo 12:21</span></span>

Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, &c.--Here are given
special directions for the observance.

[Exodus 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">exo 12:22</span></span>

hyssop--a small red moss \[HASSELQUIST\]; the caper-plant \[ROYLE\]. It
was used in the sprinkling, being well adapted for such purposes, as it
grows in bushes--putting out plenty of suckers from a single root. And
it is remarkable that it was ordained in the arrangements of an all-wise
Providence that the Roman soldiers should undesignedly, on their part,
make use of this symbolical plant to Christ when, as our Passover, He
was sacrificed for us \[[Joh 19:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#029)\].

none . . . shall go out at the door of his house until the morning--This
regulation was peculiar to the first celebration, and intended, as some
think, to prevent any suspicion attaching to them of being agents in the
impending destruction of the Egyptians; there is an allusion to it ([Isa
26:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#020)).

[Exodus 12:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">exo 12:26</span></span>

when your children shall say, . . . What mean ye by this
service--Independently of some observances which were not afterwards
repeated, the usages practised at this yearly commemorative feast were
so peculiar that the curiosity of the young would be stimulated, and
thus parents had an excellent opportunity, which they were enjoined to
embrace, for instructing each rising generation in the origin and
leading facts of the national faith.

[Exodus 12:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">exo 12:27</span></span>

the people bowed the head, and worshipped--All the preceding directions
were communicated through the elders, and the Israelites, being deeply
solemnized by the influence of past and prospective events, gave prompt
and faithful obedience.

[Exodus 12:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">exo 12:29</span></span>

at midnight the Lord smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt--At
the moment when the Israelites were observing the newly instituted feast
in the singular manner described, the threatened calamity overtook the
Egyptians. It is more easy to imagine than describe the confusion and
terror of that people suddenly roused from sleep and enveloped in
darkness--none could assist their neighbors when the groans of the dying
and the wild shrieks of mourners were heard everywhere around. The hope
of every family was destroyed at a stroke. This judgment, terrible
though it was, evinced the equity of divine retribution. For eighty
years the Egyptians had caused the male children of the Israelites to be
cast into the river \[[Exo 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#016)\], and
now all their own first-born fell under the stroke of the destroying
angel. They were made, in the justice of God, to feel something of what
they had made His people feel. Many a time have the hands of sinners
made the snares in which they have themselves been entangled, and fallen
into the pit which they have dug for the righteous \[[Pro
28:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#010)\]. "Verily there is a God that
judgeth in the earth" \[[Psa 58:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#011)\].

[Exodus 12:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">exo 12:30</span></span>

there was not a house where there was not one dead--Perhaps this
statement is not to be taken absolutely. The Scriptures frequently use
the words "all," "none," in a comparative sense--and so in this case.
There would be many a house in which there would be no child, and many
in which the first-born might be already dead. What is to be understood
is, that almost every house in Egypt had a death in it.

[Exodus 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">exo 12:31</span></span>

called for Moses and Aaron--a striking fulfilment of the words of Moses
([Exo 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#008)), and showing that they
were spoken under divine suggestion.

[Exodus 12:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">exo 12:32</span></span>

also take your flocks, &c.--All the terms the king had formerly insisted
on were now departed from; his pride had been effectually humbled.
Appalling judgments in such rapid succession showed plainly that the
hand of God was against him. His own family bereavement had so crushed
him to the earth that he not only showed impatience to rid his kingdom
of such formidable neighbors, but even begged an interest in their
prayers.

[Exodus 12:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">exo 12:34</span></span>

people took . . . their kneading-troughs--Having lived so long in Egypt,
they must have been in the habit of using the utensils common in that
country. The Egyptian kneading-trough was a bowl of wicker or rush work,
and it admitted of being hastily wrapped up with the dough in it and
slung over the shoulder in their hykes or loose upper garments.

[Exodus 12:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">exo 12:35</span></span>

children of Israel borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver--When the
Orientals go to their sacred festivals, they always put on their best
jewels. The Israelites themselves thought they were only going three
days' journey to hold a feast unto the Lord, and in these circumstances
it would be easy for them to borrow what was necessary for a sacred
festival. But borrow conveys a wrong meaning. The word rendered borrow
signifies properly to ask, demand, require. The Israelites had been kept
in great poverty, having received little or no wages. They now insisted
on full remuneration for all their labor, and it was paid in light and
valuable articles adapted for convenient carriage.

[Exodus 12:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">exo 12:36</span></span>

the Lord gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians--Such a
dread of them was inspired into the universal minds of the Egyptians,
that whatever they asked was readily given.

spoiled the Egyptians--The accumulated earnings of many years being paid
them at this moment, the Israelites were suddenly enriched, according to
the promise made to Abraham ([Gen
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#014)), and they left the country like
a victorious army laden with spoil ([Psa
105:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#037); [Eze
39:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#010)).

[Exodus 12:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">exo 12:37</span></span>

The children of Israel journeyed from Rameses--now generally identified
with the ancient Heroopolis, and fixed at the modern Abu-Keisheid. This
position agrees with the statement that the scene of the miraculous
judgments against Pharaoh was "in the field of Zoan" \[[Psa
78:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#012), [Psa
78:43](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#043)\]. And it is probable that, in
expectation of their departure, which the king on one pretext or another
delayed, the Israelites had been assembled there as a general
rendezvous. In journeying from Rameses to Palestine, there was a choice
of two routes--the one along the shores of the Mediterranean to
El-Arish, the other more circuitous round the head of the Red Sea and
the desert of Sinai. The latter Moses was directed to take ([Exo
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#017)).

to Succoth--that is, booths, probably nothing more than a place of
temporary encampment. The Hebrew word signifies a covering or shelter
formed by the boughs of trees; and hence, in memory of this lodgment,
the Israelites kept the feast of tabernacles yearly in this manner.

six hundred thousand . . . men--It appears from [Num
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#003) that the enumeration is of men
above twenty years of age. Assuming, what is now ascertained by
statistical tables, that the number of males above that age is as nearly
as possible the half of the total number of males, the whole male
population of Israel, on this computation, would amount to 1,200,000;
and adding an equal number for women and children, the aggregate number
of Israelites who left Egypt would be 2,400,000.

[Exodus 12:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">exo 12:38</span></span>

a mixed multitude went with them--literally, "a great rabble" (see also
[Num 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#004); [Deu
29:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#011)); slaves, persons in the lowest
grades of society, partly natives and partly foreigners, bound close to
them as companions in misery, and gladly availing themselves of the
opportunity to escape in the crowd. (Compare [Zac
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#023)).

[Exodus 12:40](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">exo 12:40</span></span>

the sojourning of the children of Israel . . . four hundred and thirty
years--The Septuagint renders it thus: "The sojourning of the children
and of their fathers, which they sojourned in the land of Canaan and in
the land of Egypt." These additions are important, for the period of
sojourn in Egypt did not exceed two hundred fifteen years; but if we
reckon from the time that Abraham entered Canaan and the promise was
made in which the sojourn of his posterity in Egypt was announced, this
makes up the time to four hundred thirty years.

[Exodus 12:41](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">exo 12:41</span></span>

even the selfsame day--implying an exact and literal fulfilment of the
predicted period.

[Exodus 12:49](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#049)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">exo 12:49</span></span>

One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger--This
regulation displays the liberal spirit of the Hebrew institutions. Any
foreigner might obtain admission to the privileges of the nation on
complying with their sacred ordinances. In the Mosaic equally as in the
Christian dispensation, privilege and duty were inseparably conjoined.
