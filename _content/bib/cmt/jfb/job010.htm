<p>
<p>leave my complaint upon myself--rather, "I will give loose to my complaint" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#011">Job 7:11</A>).

<p>shine upon--favor with prosperity (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#002">Psa 50:2</A>).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">job 10:4</A></FONT></span></p>Dost Thou see as feebly as man? that is, with the same uncharitable eye, as, for instance, Job's friends? Is Thy time as short? Impossible! Yet one might think, from the rapid succession of Thy strokes, that Thou hadst no time to spare in overwhelming me.

<p>
<p>and . . . that none that can deliver out of thine hand--Therefore Thou hast no need to deal with me with the rapid violence which man would use (see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#006">Job 10:6</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#008">Job 10:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">job 10:8</A></FONT></span></p>Made--with pains; implying a work of difficulty and art; applying to God language applicable only to man. 
<p>
<p>together round about--implying that the human body is a complete unity, the parts of which on all sides will bear the closest scrutiny.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">job 10:14</A></FONT></span></p>Job is perplexed because God "marks" every sin of his with such ceaseless rigor. Whether "wicked" (godless and a hypocrite) or "righteous" (comparatively sincere), God condemns and punishes alike.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#015">Job 10:15</A></p>

<p>see thou--rather, "and seeing I see (I too well see) mine affliction," (which seems to prove me guilty) [UMBREIT].
<p>

<p>
<p>and again--as if a lion should not kill his prey at once, but come back and torture it again.
<p>

<p>
<p>changes and war--rather, "(thou settest in array) against me host after host" (literally, "changes and a host," that is, a succession of hosts); namely, his afflictions, and then reproach upon reproach from his friends.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#020">Job 10:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">job 10:20</A></FONT></span></p>But, since I was destined from my birth to these ills, at least give me a little breathing time during the few days left me (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#034">Job 9:34</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#021">Job 13:21</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#013">Psa 39:13</A>).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">job 10:22</A></FONT></span></p>The ideas of order and light, disorder and darkness, harmonize (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#002">Gen 1:2</A>). Three Hebrew words are used for darkness; in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#021">Job 10:21</A> (1) the common word "darkness"; here (2) "a land of gloom" (from a Hebrew root, "to cover up"); (3) as "thick darkness" or blackness (from a root, expressing sunset). "Where the light thereof is like blackness." Its only sunshine is thick darkness. A bold figure of poetry. Job in a better frame has brighter thoughts of the unseen world. But his views at best wanted the definite clearness of the Christian's. Compare with his words here <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#023">Rev 21:23</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#005">Rev 22:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#010">Ti2 1:10</A>.
