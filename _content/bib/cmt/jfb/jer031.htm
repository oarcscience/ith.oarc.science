<p>At the same time--"In the latter days" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#024">Jer 30:24</A>). 
<p>
<p>the God of--manifesting My grace to (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#007">Gen 17:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#032">Mat 22:32</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#003">Rev 21:3</A>). 
<p>
<p>all . . . Israel--not the exiles of the south kingdom of Judah only, but also the north kingdom of the ten tribes; and not merely Israel in general, but "all the families of Israel." Never yet fulfilled (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#026">Rom 11:26</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#002">Jeremiah 31:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">jer 31:2</A></FONT></span></p>Upon the grace manifested to Israel "in the wilderness" God grounds His argument for renewing His favors to them now in their exile; because His covenant is "everlasting" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#003">Jer 31:3</A>), and changes not. The same argument occurs in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#005">Hos 13:5</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#009">Hos 13:9-10</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#004">Hos 14:4-5</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#008">Hos 14:8</A>. Babylon is fitly compared to the "wilderness," as in both alike Israel was as a stranger far from his appointed "rest" or home, and Babylon is in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#003">Isa 40:3</A> called a "desert" (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#012">Jer 50:12</A>). 
<p>
<p>I went to cause him to rest--namely, in the pillar of cloud and fire, the symbol of God's presence, which went before Israel to search a resting-place (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#033">Num 10:33</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#014">Isa 63:14</A>) for the people, both a temporary one at each halt in the wilderness, and a permanent one in Canaan (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#014">Exo 33:14</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#020">Deu 3:20</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#044">Jos 21:44</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#011">Psa 95:11</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#011">Heb 3:11</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#003">Jeremiah 31:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">jer 31:3</A></FONT></span></p>Israel gratefully acknowledges in reply God's past grace; but at the same time tacitly implies by the expression "of old," that God does not appear to her now. "God appeared to me of old, but now I am forsaken!" God replies, Nay, I love thee with the same love now as of old. My love was not a momentary impulse, but from "everlasting" in My counsels, and to "everlasting" in its continuance; hence originated the covenant whereby I gratuitously adopted thee (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#002">Mal 1:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#028">Rom 11:28-29</A>). Margin translates, "from afar," which does not answer so well as "of old," to "in the wilderness" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#002">Jer 31:2</A>), which refers to the olden times of Israel's history. 
<p>
<p>with loving kindness . . . drawn-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#004">Hos 11:4</A>). Rather, "I have drawn out continually My loving kindness toward thee." So <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#010">Psa 36:10</A>, "Continue (Margin, 'Draw out at length') Thy loving kindness." By virtue of My everlasting love I will still extend My loving kindness to thee. So <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#021">Isa 44:21</A>, "O Israel, thou shalt not be forgotten of Me."
<p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">jer 31:4</A></FONT></span></p>I will build . . . thou shalt be built--The combination of the active and passive to express the same fact implies the infallible certainty of its accomplishment. "Build," that is, establish in prosperity (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#007">Jer 33:7</A>). 
<p>
<p>adorned with . . . tabrets-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#006">Sa1 18:6</A>). Or, "adorn thyself with thy timbrels"; used by damsels on occasions of public rejoicings (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#020">Exo 15:20</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#034">Jdg 11:34</A>). Israel had cast away all instruments of joy in her exile (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#004">Psa 137:4</A>). 
<p>
<p>dances--holy joy, not carnal mirth.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#005">Jeremiah 31:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">jer 31:5</A></FONT></span></p>Samaria--the metropolis of the ten tribes; here equivalent to Israel. The mountainous nature of their country suited the growth of the vine. 
<p>
<p>eat . . . as common--literally, "shall profane," that is, shall put to common use. For the first three years after planting, the vine was "not to be eaten of"; on the fourth year the fruit was to be "holy to praise the Lord withal"; on the fifth year the fruit was to be eaten as common, no longer restricted to holy use (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#023">Lev 19:23-25</A>; compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#006">Deu 20:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#030">Deu 28:30</A>, Margin). Thus the idea here is, "The same persons who plant shall reap the fruits"; it shall no longer be that one shall plant and another reap the fruit.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#006">Jeremiah 31:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">jer 31:6</A></FONT></span></p>The watchmen stationed on eminences (types of the preachers of the gospel), shall summon the ten tribes to go up to the annual feasts at Jerusalem ("Zion"), as they used to do before the revolt and the setting up of the idol calves at Dan and Beer-sheba (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#021">Eze 37:21-22</A>). 
<p>
<p>Mount Ephraim--not one single mountain, but the whole mountainous region of the ten tribes. 
<p>
<p>our God--from whom we formerly revolted, but who is now our God. An earnest of that good time to come is given in the partial success of the gospel in its first preaching in Samaria (John 4:1-42; Acts 8:5-25).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#007">Jeremiah 31:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">jer 31:7</A></FONT></span></p>The people are urged with praises and prayers to supplicate for their universal restoration. Jehovah is represented in the context (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#001">Jer 31:1</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#008">Jer 31:8</A>), as promising immediately to restore Israel. They therefore praise God for the restoration, being as certain of it as if it were actually accomplished; and at the same time pray for it, as prayer was a means to the desired end. Prayer does not move God to grant our wishes, but when God has determined to grant our wishes, He puts it into our hearts to pray for the thing desired. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#013">Psa 102:13-17</A>, as to the connection of Israel's restoration with the prayers of His people (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#001">Isa 62:1-6</A>). 
<p>
<p>for Jacob--on account of Jacob; on account of his approaching deliverance by Jehovah. 
<p>
<p>among--"for," that is, on account of, would more exactly suit the parallelism to "for Jacob." 
<p>
<p>chief of the nations--Israel: as the parallelism to "Jacob" proves (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005">Exo 19:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#004">Psa 135:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#001">Amo 6:1</A>). God estimates the greatness of nations not by man's standard of material resources, but by His electing favor.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">jer 31:15</A></FONT></span></p>Ramah--In Benjamin, east of the great northern road, two hours' journey from Jerusalem. Rachel, who all her life had pined for children (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#001">Gen 30:1</A>), and who died with "sorrow" in giving birth to Benjamin (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#018">Gen 35:18-19</A>, Margin; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#002">Sa1 10:2</A>), and was buried at Ramah, near Beth-lehem, is represented as raising her head from the tomb, and as breaking forth into "weeping" at seeing the whole land depopulated of her sons, the Ephraimites. Ramah was the place where Nebuzara-dan collected all the Jews in chains, previous to their removal to Babylon (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#001">Jer 40:1</A>). God therefore consoles her with the promise of their restoration. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#017">Mat 2:17-18</A> quotes this as fulfilled in the massacre of the innocents under Herod. "A lesser and a greater event, of different times, may answer to the single sense of one passage of Scripture, until the prophecy is exhausted" [BENGEL]. Besides the temporary reference to the exiles in Babylon, the Holy Spirit foreshadowed ultimately Messiah's exile in Egypt, and the desolation caused in the neighborhood of Rachel's tomb by Herod's massacre of the children, whose mothers had "sons of sorrow" (Ben-oni), just as Rachel had. The return of Messiah (the representative of Israel) from Egypt, and the future restoration of Israel, both the literal and the spiritual (including the innocents), at the Lord's second advent, are antitypical of the restoration of Israel from Babylon, which is the ground of consolation held out here by Jeremiah. The clause, "They were not," that is, were dead (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#013">Gen 42:13</A>), does not apply so strictly to the exiles in Babylon as it does to the history of Messiah and His people--past, present, and future. So the words, "There is hope in thine end," are to be fulfilled ultimately, when Rachel shall meet her murdered children at the resurrection, at the same time that literal Israel is to be restored. "They were not," in Hebrew, is singular; each was not: each mother at the Beth-lehem massacre had but one child to lament, as the limitation of age in Herod's order, "two years and under," implies; this use of the singular distributively (the mothers weeping severally, each for her own child), is a coincidence between the prophecy of the Beth-lehem massacre and the event, the more remarkable as not being obvious: the singular, too, is appropriate as to Messiah in His Egyptian exile, who was to be a leading object of Rachel's lamentation.

Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#005">Act 9:5</A>, where the same figure is used of Saul while unconverted. Israel has had a longer chastisement than Judah, not having been restored even at the Jews' return from Babylon. Hereafter, at its restoration, it shall confess the sore discipline was all needed to "accustom" it to God's "easy yoke" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#029">Mat 11:29-30</A>).

The Jews' "looking to Him whom they pierced" shall result in their "mourning for Him." Repentance is the tear that flows from the eye of faith turned to Jesus. He Himself gives it: we give it not of ourselves, but must come to Him for it (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#031">Act 5:31</A>).

Who would have thought that one so undutiful to His heavenly Father as Ephraim had been should still be regarded by God as a "pleasant child?" Certainly he was not so in respect to his sin. But by virtue of God's "everlasting love" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#003">Jer 31:3</A>) on Ephraim's being "turned" to God, he was immediately welcomed as God's "dear son." This verse sets forth God's readiness to welcome the penitent (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#018">Jer 31:18-19</A>), anticipating his return with prevenient grace and love. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#020">Luk 15:20</A> : "When he was yet a great way off, his father saw him and had compassion," &amp;c.

Why not return immediately to me? MAURER translates, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#006">Sol 5:6</A>, "How long wilt thou withdraw thyself?" Let thy past backslidings suffice thee now that a new era approaches. What God finds fault with in them is, that they looked hither and thither, leaning on contingencies, instead of at once trusting the word of God, which promised their restoration. To assure them of this, God promises to create a new thing in their land, A woman shall compass a man. CALVIN explains this: Israel, who is feeble as a woman, shall be superior to the warlike Chaldeans; the captives shall reduce their captors to captivity. HENGSTENBERG makes the "woman" the Jewish Church, and the "man" Jehovah, her husband, whose love she will again seek (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#006">Hos 2:6-7</A>). MAURER, A woman shall protect (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#010">Deu 32:10</A>, Margin; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#010">Psa 32:10</A>) a man, that is, You need fear no foes in returning, for all things shall be so peaceful that a woman would be able to take man's part, and act as his protector. But the Christian fathers (Augustine, &amp;c.) almost unanimously interpreted it of the Virgin Mary compassing Christ in her womb. This view is favored:--(1) By the connection; it gives a reason why the exiles should desire a return to their country, namely, because Christ was conceived there. (2) The word "created" implies a divine power put forth in the creation of a body in the Virgin's womb by the Holy Ghost for the second Adam, such as was exerted in creating the first Adam (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#035">Luk 1:35</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005">Heb 10:5</A>). (3) The phrase, "a new thing," something unprecedented; a man whose like had never existed before, at once God and man; a mother out of the ordinary course of nature, at once mother and virgin. An extraordinary mode of generation; one conceived by the Holy Ghost without man. (4) The specification "in the land" (not "earth," as English Version), namely, of Judah, where probably Christ was conceived, in Hebron (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#039">Luk 1:39</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#042">Luk 1:42</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#044">Luk 1:44</A>, with <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#011">Jos 21:11</A>) or else in Nazareth, "in the territory" of Israel, to whom <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#005">Jer 31:5-6</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#015">Jer 31:15</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#018">Jer 31:18</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#021">Jer 31:21</A> refer; His birth was at Beth-lehem (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#002">Mic 5:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#005">Mat 2:5-6</A>). As the place of His nativity, and of His being reared (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#023">Mat 2:23</A>), and of His preaching (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#007">Hag 2:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001">Mal 3:1</A>), are specified, so it is likely the Holy Spirit designated the place of His being conceived. (5) The Hebrew for "woman" implies an individual, as the Virgin Mary, rather than a collection of persons. (6) The restoration of Israel is grounded on God's covenant in Christ, to whom, therefore, allusion is naturally made as the foundation of Israel's hope (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014">Isa 7:14</A>). The Virgin Mary's conception of Messiah in the womb answers to the "Virgin of Israel" (therefore so called, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#021">Jer 31:21</A>), that is, Israel and her sons at their final restoration, receiving Jesus as Messiah (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010">Zac 12:10</A>). (7) The reference to the conception of the child Messiah accords with the mention of the massacre of "children" referred to in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#015">Jer 31:15</A> (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#017">Mat 2:17</A>). (8) The Hebrew for "man" is properly "mighty man," a term applied to God (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#017">Deu 10:17</A>); and to Christ (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#007">Zac 13:7</A>; compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#003">Psa 45:3</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006">Isa 9:6</A>) [CALOVIUS].
