### [Jeremiah Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 19:1</span></span>

THE DESOLATION OF THE JEWS FOR THEIR SINS FORETOLD IN THE VALLEY OF
HINNOM; THE SYMBOL OF BREAKING A BOTTLE. ([Jer
19:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#001))

bottle--Hebrew, bakuk, so called from the gurgling sound which it makes
when being emptied.

ancients--elders. As witnesses of the symbolic action ([Jer
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#010); [Isa
8:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#001)), that the Jews might not
afterwards plead ignorance of the prophecy. The seventy-two elders,
composing the Sanhedrim, or Great Council, were taken partly from "the
priests," partly from the other tribes, that is, "the people," the
former presiding over spiritual matters, the latter over civil; the
seventy-two represented the whole people.

[Jeremiah 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 19:2</span></span>

valley of the son of Hinnom--or Tophet, south of Jerusalem, where human
victims were offered, and children made to pass through the fire, in
honor of Molech.

east gate--Margin, "sun gate," sunrise being in the east. MAURER
translates, the "potter's gate." Through it lay the road to the valley
of Hinnom ([Jos 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#008)). The potters
there formed vessels for the use of the temple, which was close by
(compare [Jer 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#010), [Jer
19:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#014); [Jer
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#002); [Zac
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#013)). The same as "the water gate
toward the east" ([Neh 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#026); [Neh
12:37](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#037)); so called from the brook
Kedron. CALVIN translates, as English Version and Margin. "It was
monstrous perversity to tread the law under foot in so conspicuous a
place, over which the sun daily rising reminded them of the light of
God's law."

[Jeremiah 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 19:3</span></span>

The scene of their guilt is chosen as the scene of the denunciation
against them.

kings--the king and queen ([Jer
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#018)); or including the king's
counsellors and governors under him.

tingle--as if struck by a thunder peal ([Sa1
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#011); [Kg2
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#012)).

[Jeremiah 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 19:4</span></span>

([Isa 65:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#011)).

estranged this place--devoted it to the worship of strange gods:
alienating a portion of the sacred city from God, the rightful Lord of
the temple, city, and whole land.

nor their fathers--namely, the godly among them; their ungodly fathers
God makes no account of.

blood of innocents--slain in honor of Molech ([Jer
7:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#031); [Psa
106:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#037)).

[Jeremiah 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 19:5</span></span>

commanded not--nay, more, I commanded the opposite ([Lev
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#021); see [Jer
7:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#031)).

[Jeremiah 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 19:6</span></span>

no more . . . Tophet--from Hebrew, toph, "drum"; for in sacrificing
children to Molech drums were beaten to drown their cries. Thus the name
indicated the joy of the people at the fancied propitiation of the god
by this sacrifice; in antithesis to its joyless name subsequently.

valley of slaughter--It should be the scene of slaughter, no longer of
children, but of men; not of "innocents" ([Jer
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#004)), but of those who richly
deserved their fate. The city could not be assailed without first
occupying the valley of Hinnom, in which was the only fountain: hence
arose the violent battle there.

[Jeremiah 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 19:7</span></span>

make void the counsel--defeat their plans for repelling the enemy ([Ch2
32:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#001); [Isa
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#003); [Isa
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#009), [Isa
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#011)). Or their schemes of getting
help by having recourse to idols \[CALVIN\].

in this place--The valley of Hinnom was to be the place of the Chaldean
encampment; the very place where they looked for help from idols was to
be the scene of their own slaughter.

[Jeremiah 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 19:8</span></span>

(See on [Jer 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#016)).

[Jeremiah 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 19:9</span></span>

([Deu 28:53](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#053); [Lam
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#010)).

[Jeremiah 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 19:10</span></span>

break . . . bottle--a symbolical action, explained in [Jer
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#011).

the men--the elders of the people and of the priests ([Jer
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#001); compare [Jer
51:63-64](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#063)).

[Jeremiah 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 19:11</span></span>

as one breaketh a potters vessel--expressing God's absolute sovereignty
([Jer 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#006); [Psa
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#009); [Isa
30:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#014), Margin; [Lam
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#002); [Rom
9:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#020)).

cannot be made whole again--A broken potter's vessel cannot be restored,
but a new one may be made of the same material. So God raised a new
Jewish seed, not identical with the destroyed rebels, but by
substituting another generation in their stead \[GROTIUS\].

no place to bury-- ([Jer 7:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#032)).

[Jeremiah 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 19:12</span></span>

make this city as Tophet--that is, as defiled with dead bodies as
Tophet.

[Jeremiah 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 19:13</span></span>

shall be defiled--with dead bodies ([Jer
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#012); [Kg2
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#010)).

because of all the houses--Rather, (explanatory of the previous "the
houses . . . and . . . houses"), "even all the houses," &c. \[CALVIN\].

roofs--being flat, they were used as high places for sacrifices to the
sun and planets ([Jer 32:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#029); [Kg2
23:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#011); [Zep
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#005)). The Nabateans, south and east of
the Dead Sea, a nation most friendly to the Jews, according to STRABO,
had the same usage.

[Jeremiah 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 19:14</span></span>

court of the Lord's house--near Tophet; the largest court, under the
open air, where was the greatest crowd ([Ch2
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#005)).

[Jeremiah 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 19:15</span></span>

her towns--the suburban villages and towns near Jerusalem, such as
Bethany.
