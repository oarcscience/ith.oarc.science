(Pro. 12:1-28)

loveth knowledge--as the fruit of instruction or training ([Pro
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#002)).

hateth reproof-- ([Pro 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#017)).

brutish--stupid, regardless of his own welfare ([Psa
49:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#010); [Psa
73:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#022)).

[Proverbs 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 12:3</span></span>

15:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#005); [Jer
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#008)).

[Proverbs 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#004)

A virtuous woman--in the wide sense of well-disposed to all moral duties

thoughts--or, "purposes."

are right--literally, "are judgment," that is, true decisions.

counsels--(Compare [Pro 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#014)).

deceit--contrary to truth and honesty.

[Proverbs 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 12:6</span></span>

The words--or, "expressed designs" of the wicked are for evil purposes.

the mouth--or, "words" of the righteous delivering instead of ensnaring
men.

[Proverbs 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 12:7</span></span>

Such conduct brings a proper return, by the destruction of the wicked
and well-being of the righteous and his family.

[Proverbs 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 12:8</span></span>

despised--as opposed to commended ([Pro
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#012)).

perverse heart--or, "wicked principles," as opposed to one of wisdom.

[Proverbs 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 12:9</span></span>

despised--held in little repute, obscure ([Sa1
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#023); [Isa

regardeth--literally, "knoweth" ([Psa
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#006)).

mercies . . . cruel--as acts of compassion ungraciously rendered to the
needy. The righteous more regards a beast than the wicked a man.

[Proverbs 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 12:11</span></span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 12:12</span></span>

the wicked . . . evil--They love the crafty arts of deception.

the root . . . fruit--their own resources supply them; or, it may be
rendered: "He (God) giveth, or, sets ([Eze
17:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#022)) the root of the righteous," and
hence it is firm: or, the verb is impersonal; "As to the root . . . it
is firm" ([Pro 17:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#019)).

[Proverbs 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 12:13</span></span>

The wicked is snared, &c.--The sentiment expanded. While the wicked,
such as liars, flatterers, &c., fall by their own words, the righteous
are unhurt. Their good conduct makes friends, and God rewards them.

[Proverbs 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 12:18</span></span>

speaketh--literally, "speaketh hastily," or indiscreetly ([Psa
106:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#033)), as an angry man retorts harsh
and provoking invectives.

tongue . . . health--by soothing and gentle language.

[Proverbs 12:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 12:19</span></span>

that imagine--or, "plan" ([Pro 3:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#029)).

to others and themselves, the happiness of peace-makers is opposed
(compare [Mat 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#009); [Rom
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#018)).

God's wise limitations ([Rom 8:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#028)).

mischief--as penal evil.

[Proverbs 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 12:22</span></span>

deal truly--or, "faithfully," that is, according to promises (compare
[Joh 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#021)).

[Proverbs 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#023)

10:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#014); [Pro

[Proverbs 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#024)

more excellent--(Compare Margin); or, "more successful," while the
wicked fail; or, we may read it: "The righteous guides his friend, but,"
&c., that is, The ability of the righteous to aid others is contrasted
with the ruin to which the way of the wicked leads themselves.

[Proverbs 12:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#027)
