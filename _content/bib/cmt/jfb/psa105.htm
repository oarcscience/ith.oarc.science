<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">psa 105:1</A></FONT></span></p>After an exhortation to praise God, addressed especially to the chosen people, the writer presents the special reason for praise, in a summary of their history from the calling of Abraham to their settlement in Canaan, and reminds them that their obedience was the end of all God's gracious dealings. (Psa. 105:1-45)
<p>

After the example of Abraham, who, as often as God acquired for Himself a name in guiding him, called in solemn worship upon the name of the Lord (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#008">Gen 12:8</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#004">Gen 13:4</A>).

<p>
<p>Glory . . . name--boast in His perfections. The world glories in its horses and chariots against the Church of God lying in the dust; but our hope is in the name, that is, the power and love of God to His people, manifested in past deliverances.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">psa 105:7</A></FONT></span></p>Rather, "He, Jehovah, is our God." His title, "JEHOVAH," implies that He, the unchangeable, self-existing Being, makes things to be, that is, fulfils His promises, and therefore will not forsake His people. Though specially of His people, He is God over all.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">psa 105:10</A></FONT></span></p>Alluding to God's promise to Jacob (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#013">Gen 28:13</A>). Out of the whole storehouse of the promises of God, only one is prominently brought forward, namely, that concerning the possession of Canaan [<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#011">Psa 105:11</A>]. Everything revolves around this. The wonders and judgments have all for their ultimate design the fulfilment of this promise.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#012">Psalms 105:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">psa 105:12</A></FONT></span></p>few . . . in number--alluding to Jacob's words (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#030">Gen 34:30</A>), "I being few in number." 
<p>
<p>yea, very few--literally, "as a few," that is, like fewness itself (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#009">Isa 1:9</A>). 
<p>
<p>strangers--sojourners in the land of their future inheritance, as in a strange country (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#009">Heb 11:9</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#013">Psalms 105:13</A></p>

<p>
<p>mine anointed--as specially consecrated to Me (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#002">Psa 2:2</A>). The patriarch was the prophet, priest, and king of his family. 
<p>
<p>my prophets--in a similar sense, compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#007">Gen 20:7</A>. The "anointed" are those vessels of God, consecrated to His service, "in whom (as Pharaoh said of Joseph, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#038">Gen 41:38</A>) the Spirit of God is" [HENGSTENBERG].
<p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">psa 105:16</A></FONT></span></p>God ordered the famine. God 
<p>
<p>called for a famine--as if it were a servant, ready to come at God's bidding. Compare the centurion's words, as to disease being God's servant (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#008">Mat 8:8-9</A>). 
<p>
<p>upon the land--namely, Canaan (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#054">Gen 41:54</A>).

<p>
<p>was laid in iron--literally, "his soul" (see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#010">Psa 16:10</A>), or, "he came into iron," or, he was bound to his grief (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#002">Psa 3:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#001">Psa 11:1</A>). The "soul" is put for the whole person, because the soul of the captive suffers still more than the body. Joseph is referred to as being an appropriate type of those "bound in affliction and iron" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#010">Psa 107:10</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#019">Psalms 105:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">psa 105:19</A></FONT></span></p>his word came--His prophecy (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#011">Gen 41:11-20</A>) to the officers came to pass, or was fulfilled (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#012">Jdg 13:12</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#017">Jdg 13:17</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#006">Sa1 9:6</A>, explain the form of speech). 
<p>
<p>the word of the Lord--or, "saying," or "decree of the Lord." 
<p>
<p>tried him--or, "proved him," by the afflictions it appointed him to endure before his elevation (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#040">Gen 41:40-43</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#022">Psalms 105:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">psa 105:22</A></FONT></span></p>To bind--Not literally bind; but exercise over them absolute control, as the parallel in the second clause shows; also <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#040">Gen 41:40</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#044">Gen 41:44</A>, in which not literal fettering, but commanding obedience, is spoken of. It refers to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#018">Psa 105:18</A>. The soul that was once bound itself now binds others, even princes. The same moral binding is assigned to the saints (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#008">Psa 149:8</A>). 
<p>
<p>teach . . . senators wisdom--the ground of his exaltation by Pharaoh was his wisdom (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#039">Gen 41:39</A>); namely, in state policy, and ordering well a kingdom.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#023">Psalms 105:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">psa 105:23</A></FONT></span></p>Israel . . . and Jacob--that is, Jacob himself is meant, as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#024">Psa 105:24</A> speaks of "his people." Still, he came with his whole house (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#006">Gen 46:6-7</A>).

"When Saul had turned his back to go from (God's prophet) Samuel, God turned (Margin) him another heart" (see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#008">Exo 1:8</A>, &amp;c.). Whatever evil the wicked man plots against God's people, God holds bound even his heart, so as not to lay a single plan except what God permits. Thus Isaiah (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#017">Isa 43:17</A>) says it was God who brought forth the army of Pharaoh to pursue Israel to their own destruction (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#021">Exo 4:21</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#003">Exo 7:3</A>).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_027">psa 105:27</A></FONT></span></p>signs--literally, "words of signs," or rather, as "words" in Hebrew means "things," "things of His signs," that is, His marvellous tokens of power (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#005">Psa 145:5</A>, Margin). Compare the same Hebraism (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#003">Psa 65:3</A>, Margin).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_028">psa 105:28</A></FONT></span></p>The ninth plague is made prominent as peculiarly wonderful. 
<p>
<p>they rebelled not--Moses and Aaron promptly obeyed God (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#027">Heb 11:27</A>); (compare Exo. 7:1-11:10 and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#044">Psa 78:44-51</A>, with which this summary substantially agrees). Or, rather, the "darkness" here is figurative (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#016">Jer 13:16</A>), the literal plague of darkness (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#022">Exo 10:22-23</A>) being only alluded to as the symbol of God's wrath which overhung Egypt as a dark cloud during all the plagues. Hence, it is placed first, out of the historical order. Thus, "They rebelled not (that is, no longer) against His word," refers to the Egyptians. Whenever God sent a plague on them, they were ready to let Israel go, though refusing when the plague ceased. 
<p>
<p>his word--His command to let Israel go [HENGSTENBERG]. Of the ten plagues, only eight are mentioned, the fifth, the murrain of beasts, and the sixth, the boils, being omitted.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#029">Psalms 105:29</A></p>

His "gift" to Israel's foes is one of a very different kind from that bestowed on His people. 
<p>
<p>hail for rain--instead of fertilizing showers, hail destructive to trees. This forms the transition to the vegetable kingdom. The locusts in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#034">Psa 105:34</A> similarly are destructive to plants.
