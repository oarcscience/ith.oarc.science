*A Commentary, Critical, Practical, and Explanatory on the Old and New
Testaments*, by Robert Jamieson, A.R. Fausset and David Brown \[1882\]
at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Proverbs Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#001)

[Proverbs 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 11:1</span></span>

(Pro. 11:1-31)

(Compare Margin). The Hebrews used stones for weights.

just--complete in measure.

[Proverbs 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 11:2</span></span>

Self-conceit is unteachable; the humble grow wise (compare [Pro
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#018); [Pro
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#012)).

[Proverbs 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 11:3</span></span>

guide--to lead, as a shepherd ([Pro
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#007); [Psa
78:52](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#052)).

perverseness--ill-nature.

destroy--with violence.

[Proverbs 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 11:4</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#002)).

wrath--that is, of God.

[Proverbs 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 11:5</span></span>

direct--or, "make plain"; wicked ways are not plain ([Pro
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#017)).

[Proverbs 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 11:6</span></span>

deliver them--that is, from evil, which the wicked suffer by their own
doings ([Pro 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#022); [Psa
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#016)).

[Proverbs 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 11:7</span></span>

expectation . . . perish--for death cuts short all his plans ([Luk
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#025)).

hope of unjust--better, "hope of wealth," or "power" (compare [Isa
40:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#029), Hebrew). This gives an advance
on the sentiment of the first clause. Even hopes of gain die with him.

[Proverbs 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 11:8</span></span>

Perhaps the trouble prepared by the wicked, and which he inherits
(compare [Pro 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#006)).

[Proverbs 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 11:9</span></span>

(Compare [Psa 35:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#016); [Dan
11:32](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#032)). The just is saved by superior
discernment.

[Proverbs 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 11:10</span></span>

The last may be a reason for the first. Together, they set forth the
relative moral worth of good and bad men.

[Proverbs 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 11:11</span></span>

By the blessing--implying active benevolence.

[Proverbs 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 11:12</span></span>

despiseth--or, "reviles," a course contrasted with the prudent silence
of the wise.

holdeth his peace--as if neither hearing nor telling.

[Proverbs 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 11:13</span></span>

tale-bearer--(Compare Margin), one trading as a peddler in scandal,
whose propensity to talk leads him to betray confidence.

[Proverbs 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 11:14</span></span>

counsel--the art of governing ([Pro
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#005)).

counsellors--literally, "one giving counsel"; the participle used as a
collective.

[Proverbs 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 11:15</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#001)).

suretiship--(Compare Margin), the actors put for the action, which may
be lawfully hated.

[Proverbs 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 11:16</span></span>

retaineth--or literally, "lay hold of as a support." Honor is to a
feeble woman thus as valuable as riches to men.

[Proverbs 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 11:17</span></span>

merciful--kind to others; opposed to cruel. Such benefit themselves by
doing good to others (compare [Pro
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#005)), while the cruel injure
themselves as well as others.

flesh--that is, his body, by penuriousness ([Col
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#023)).

[Proverbs 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 11:18</span></span>

a deceitful work--or, "wages," which fail to satisfy, or flee away ([Pro
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#002); [Pro
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#005)).

sure reward--or, "gain," as from trading ([Hos
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#012); [Gal
6:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#008)).

[Proverbs 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 11:19</span></span>

Inference from [Pro 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#018) (compare
[Pro 11:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#005); [Pro
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#016)).

[Proverbs 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pro 11:20</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#005)).

froward--as in [Pro 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#015), opposed to
the simplicity and purity of the upright.

in their way--or, "conduct."

[Proverbs 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 11:21</span></span>

The combined power of the wicked cannot free them from just punishment,
while the unaided children of the righteous find deliverance by reason
of their pious relationship ([Psa
37:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#025)).

[Proverbs 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 11:22</span></span>

Jewels were often suspended from the nose ([Gen
24:47](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#047); [Isa
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#021)). Thus adorned, a hog disgusts
less than a fair and indiscreet woman.

[Proverbs 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 11:23</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 10:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#028)).

wrath--is that of God.

[Proverbs 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 11:24</span></span>

The scope of the whole is a comment on [Pro
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#023). Thus liberality, by God's
blessing, secures increase, while penuriousness, instead of expected
gain, procures poverty.

[Proverbs 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">pro 11:25</span></span>

liberal soul--(Compare Margin).

made fat--prospers ([Pro 28:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#025); [Deu
32:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#015); [Luk
6:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#038)).

watereth . . . watered--a common figure for blessing.

[Proverbs 11:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">pro 11:26</span></span>

Another example of the truth of [Pro
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#023); the miser loses reputation,
though he saves corn.

selleth it--that is, at a fair price.

[Proverbs 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 11:27</span></span>

good \[and\] mischief--that is, of others.

procureth . . . seeketh--implying success.

[Proverbs 11:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">pro 11:28</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#015); [Psa
49:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#006); [Ti1
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#017)).

righteous . . . branch-- ([Psa 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#003);
[Jer 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#008)).

[Proverbs 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">pro 11:29</span></span>

troubleth--as [Pro 15:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#027) explains, by
greediness for gain (compare [Pro
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#017)).

inherit . . . wind--Even successful, his gains are of no real value. So
the fool, thus acting, either comes to poverty, or heaps up for others.

[Proverbs 11:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">pro 11:30</span></span>

a tree of life--Blessings to others proceed from the works of the
righteous ([Pro 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#018)).

winneth souls--(Compare Margin) to do them good as opposed to [Pro
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#025); [Eze
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#018) (compare [Luk
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#010)).

[Proverbs 11:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">pro 11:31</span></span>

Behold--Thus calling attention to the illustrations (compare [Pro
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#023)), the sentiment of which is
confirmed even in time, not excluding future rewards and punishments.
