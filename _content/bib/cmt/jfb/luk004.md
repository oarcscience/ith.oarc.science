### [Luke Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#001)

[Luke 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">luk 4:16</span></span>

JESUS ENTERING ON HIS PUBLIC MINISTRY, MAKES A CIRCUIT OF
GALILEE--REJECTION AT NAZARETH. (Luke 4:14-32)

as his custom was--Compare [Act 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#002).

stood up for to read--Others besides rabbins were allowed to address the
congregation. (See [Act 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#015).)

[Luke 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">luk 4:18</span></span>

To have fixed on any passage announcing His sufferings (as [Isa
53:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001)), would have been unsuitable
at that early stage of His ministry. But He selects a passage announcing
the sublime object of His whole mission, its divine character, and His
special endowments for it; expressed in the first person, and so
singularly adapted to the first opening of the mouth in His prophetic
capacity, that it seems as if made expressly for this occasion. It is
from the well-known section of Isaiah's prophecies whose burden is that
mysterious "SERVANT OF THE LORD," despised of man, abhorred of the
nation, but before whom kings on seeing Him are to arise, and princes to
worship; in visage more marred than any man and His form than the sons
of men, yet sprinkling many nations; laboring seemingly in vain, and
spending His strength for naught and in vain, yet Jehovah's Servant to
raise up the tribes of Jacob and be His Salvation to the ends of the
earth (Isa. 49:1-26, &c.). The quotation is chiefly from the Septuagint
version, used in the synagogues.

[Luke 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">luk 4:19</span></span>

acceptable year--an allusion to the jubilee year ([Lev
25:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#010)), a year of universal release
for person and property. (See also [Isa
49:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#008); [Co2
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#002).) As the maladies under which
humanity groans are here set forth under the names of poverty,
broken-heartedness, bondage, blindness, bruisedness (or crushedness),
so, as the glorious HEALER of all these maladies, Christ announces
Himself in the act of reading it, stopping the quotation just before it
comes to "the day of vengeance," which was only to come on the rejecters
of His message ([Joh 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#017)). The first
words, "THE SPIRIT of the LORD is upon ME," have been noted since the
days of the Church Fathers, as an illustrious example of Father, Son,
and Holy Ghost being exhibited as in distinct yet harmonious action in
the scheme of salvation.

[Luke 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">luk 4:20</span></span>

the minister--the chazan, or synagogue-officer.

all eyes . . . fastened on Him--astounded at His putting in such claims.

[Luke 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">luk 4:21</span></span>

began to say, &c.--His whole address was just a detailed application to
Himself of this and perhaps other like prophecies.

[Luke 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">luk 4:22</span></span>

gracious words--"the words of grace," referring both to the richness of
His matter and the sweetness of His manner ([Psa
45:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#002)).

Is not this, &c.--(See on [Mat
13:54-56](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#054)). They knew He had received
no rabbinical education, and anything supernatural they seemed incapable
of conceiving.

[Luke 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">luk 4:23</span></span>

this proverb--like our "Charity begins at home."

whatsoever, &c.--"Strange rumors have reached our ears of Thy doings at
Capernaum; but if such power resides in Thee to cure the ills of
humanity, why has none of it yet come nearer home, and why is all this
alleged power reserved for strangers?" His choice of Capernaum as a
place of residence since entering on public life was, it seems, already
well known at Nazareth; and when He did come thither, to give no
displays of His power when distant places were ringing with His fame,
wounded their pride. He had indeed "laid his hands on a few sick folk
and healed them" ([Mar 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#005)); but this
seems to have been done quite privately the general unbelief precluding
anything more open.

[Luke 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">luk 4:24</span></span>

And he said, &c.--He replies to the one proverb by another, equally
familiar, which we express in a rougher form--"Too much familiarity
breeds contempt." Our Lord's long residence in Nazareth merely as a
townsman had made Him too common, incapacitating them for appreciating
Him as others did who were less familiar with His everyday demeanor in
private life. A most important principle, to which the wise will pay due
regard. (See also [Mat 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#006), on which
our Lord Himself ever acted.)

[Luke 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">luk 4:25</span></span>

But I tell you, &c.--falling back for support on the well-known examples
of Elijah and Elisha (Eliseus), whose miraculous power, passing by those
who were near, expended itself on those at a distance, yea on heathens,
"the two great prophets who stand at the commencement of prophetic
antiquity, and whose miracles strikingly prefigured those of our Lord.
As He intended like them to feed the poor and cleanse the lepers, He
points to these miracles of mercy, and not to the fire from heaven and
the bears that tore the mockers" \[STIER\].

three years and six months--So [Jam
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#017), including perhaps the six months
after the last fall of rain, when there would be little or none at any
rate; whereas in [Kg1 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#001), which says
the rain returned "in the third year," that period is probably not
reckoned.

[Luke 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">luk 4:26</span></span>

save . . . saving--"but only." (Compare [Mar
13:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#032), Greek.)

Sarepta--"Zarephath" ([Kg1 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#009)), a
heathen village between Tyre and Sidon. (See [Mar
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#024).)

[Luke 4:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">luk 4:28</span></span>

when they heard these things--these allusions to the heathen, just as
afterwards with Paul ([Act 22:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#021)).

[Luke 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">luk 4:29</span></span>

rose up--broke up the service irreverently and rushed forth.

thrust him--with violence, as a prisoner in their hands.

brow, &c.--Nazareth, though not built on the ridge of a hill, is in part
surrounded by one to the west, having several such precipices. (See [Ch2
25:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#012); [Kg2
9:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#033).) It was a mode of capital
punishment not unusual among the Romans and others. This was the first
insult which the Son of God received, and it came from "them of His own
household!" ([Mat 10:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#036)).

[Luke 4:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">luk 4:30</span></span>

passing through the midst, &c.--evidently in a miraculous way, though
perhaps quite noiselessly, leading them to wonder afterwards what spell
could have come over them, that they allowed Him to escape. (Similar
escapes, however, in times of persecution, are not unexampled.)

[Luke 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">luk 4:31</span></span>

down to Capernaum--It lay on the Sea of Galilee ([Mat
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#013)), whereas Nazareth lay high.

[Luke 4:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">luk 4:33</span></span>

DEMONIAC HEALED. ([Luk 4:33-37](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#033))

unclean--The frequency with which this character of impurity is applied
to evil spirits is worthy of notice.

cried out, &c.--(See [Mat 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#029); [Mar
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#011)).

[Luke 4:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">luk 4:35</span></span>

rebuked them, &c.--(See on [Luk 4:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#041)).

thrown him, &c.--See on [Mar 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#020).

[Luke 4:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">luk 4:36</span></span>

What a word--a word from the Lord of spirits.

[Luke 4:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">luk 4:41</span></span>

PETER'S MOTHER-IN-LAW AND MANY OTHERS, HEALED. ([Luk
4:38-41](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#038))

suffered them not to speak--The marginal reading ("to say that they knew
him to be Christ") here is wrong. Our Lord ever refused testimony from
devils, for the very reason why they were eager to give it, because He
and they would thus seem to be one interest, as His enemies actually
alleged. (See on [Mat 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#024), &c.; see
also [Act 16:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#016).)

[Luke 4:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">luk 4:42</span></span>

JESUS SOUGHT OUT AT MORNING PRAYER, AND ENTREATED TO STAY, DECLINES FROM
THE URGENCY OF HIS WORK. ([Luk
4:42-44](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#042))

stayed him--"were staying Him," or sought to do it. What a contrast to
the Gadarenes! The nature of His mission required Him to keep moving,
that all might hear the glad tidings ([Mat
8:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#034)).

[Luke 4:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">luk 4:43</span></span>

I must, &c.--but duty only could move Him to deny entreaties so grateful
to His spirit.
