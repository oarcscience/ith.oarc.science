### [Psalms Chapter 50](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#001)

[Psalms 50:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 50:1</span></span>

In the grandeur and solemnity of a divine judgment, God is introduced as
instructing men in the nature of true worship, exposing hypocrisy,
warning the wicked, and encouraging the pious. (Psa. 50:1-23)

The description of this majestic appearance of God resembles that of His
giving the law (compare [Exo 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#016);
[Exo 20:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#018); [Deu
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#001)).

[Psalms 50:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 50:4</span></span>

above--literally, "above" ([Gen 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#007)).

heavens . . . earth--For all creatures are witnesses ([Deu
4:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#026); [Deu
30:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#019); [Isa
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#002)).

[Psalms 50:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 50:5</span></span>

my saints-- ([Psa 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#003)).

made--literally, "cut"

a covenant, &c.--alluding to the dividing of a victim of sacrifice, by
which covenants were ratified, the parties passing between the divided
portions (compare [Gen 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#010), [Gen
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#018)).

[Psalms 50:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 50:6</span></span>

The inhabitants of heaven, who well know God's character, attest His
righteousness as a judge.

[Psalms 50:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 50:7</span></span>

I will testify--that is, for failure to worship aught.

thy God--and so, by covenant as well as creation, entitled to a pure
worship.

[Psalms 50:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 50:8</span></span>

However scrupulous in external worship, it was offered as if they
conferred an obligation in giving God His own, and with a degrading view
of Him as needing it \[[Psa 50:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#009)\].
Reproving them for such foolish and blasphemous notions, He teaches them
to offer, or literally, "sacrifice," thanksgiving, and pay, or perform,
their vows--that is, to bring, with the external symbolical service, the
homage of the heart, and faith, penitence, and love. To this is added an
invitation to seek, and a promise to afford, all needed help in trouble.

[Psalms 50:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 50:16</span></span>

the wicked--that is, the formalists, as now exposed, and who lead
vicious lives (compare [Rom 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#021), [Rom
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#023)). They are unworthy to use even
the words of God's law. Their hypocrisy and vice are exposed by
illustrations from sins against the seventh, eighth, and ninth
commandments.

[Psalms 50:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">psa 50:21</span></span>

God, no longer (even in appearance) disregarding such, exposes their
sins and threatens a terrible punishment.

[Psalms 50:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">psa 50:22</span></span>

forget God--This denotes unmindfulness of His true character.

[Psalms 50:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">psa 50:23</span></span>

offereth praise-- ([Psa 50:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#014)), so
that the external worship is a true index of the heart.

ordereth . . . aright--acts in a straight, right manner, opposed to
turning aside ([Psa 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#005)). In such,
pure worship and a pure life evince their true piety, and they will
enjoy God's presence and favor.
