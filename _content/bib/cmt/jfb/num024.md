### [Numbers Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#001)

[Numbers 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 24:1</span></span>

BALAAM FORETELLS ISRAEL'S HAPPINESS. (Num. 24:1-25)

to seek for--that is, to use enchantments. His experience on the two
former occasions \[[Num 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#003), [Num
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#015)\] had taught him that these
superstitious accompaniments of his worship were useless, and therefore
he now simply looked towards the camp of Israel, either with a secret
design to curse them, or to await the divine afflatus.

[Numbers 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 24:2</span></span>

he saw Israel abiding in his tents according to their tribes--that is,
in the orderly distribution of the camp (Num. 2:1-34).

the spirit of God came upon him--Before the regular ministry of the
prophets was instituted, God made use of various persons as the
instruments through whom He revealed His will, and Balaam was one of
these ([Deu 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#005)).

[Numbers 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">num 24:3</span></span>

the man whose eyes are open--that is, a seer ([Sa1
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#009)), a prophet, to whom the visioned
future was disclosed--sometimes when falling into a sleep ([Gen
15:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#012)), frequently into "a trance."

[Numbers 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">num 24:5</span></span>

How goodly are thy tents, . . . O Israel!--a fine burst of admiration,
expressed in highly poetical strains. All travellers describe the beauty
which the circular area of Bedouin tents impart to the desert. How
impressive, then, must have been the view, as seen from the heights of
Abarim, of the immense camp of Israel extended over the subjacent
plains.

[Numbers 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">num 24:6</span></span>

As the valleys--Hebrew, "brooks," the watercourses of the mountains.

lign aloes--an aromatic shrub on the banks of his native Euphrates, the
conical form of which suggested an apt resemblance to a tent. The
redundant imagery of these verses depicts the humble origin, rapid
progress, and prosperity of Israel.

[Numbers 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">num 24:7</span></span>

his king shall be higher than Agag--The Amalekites were then the most
powerful of all the desert tribes, and "Agag" a title common to their
kings.

[Numbers 24:10](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">num 24:10</span></span>

Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his hands
together--The "smiting of the hands together" is, among Oriental people,
an indication of the most violent rage (see [Eze
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#017); [Eze
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#013)) and ignominious dismissal.

[Numbers 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">num 24:15</span></span>

he took his parable--or prophecy, uttered in a poetical style.

[Numbers 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">num 24:17</span></span>

I shall see him--rather, "I do see" or "I have seen him"--a prophetic
sight, like that of Abraham ([Joh
8:56](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#056)).

him--that is, Israel.

there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise out of
Israel--This imagery, in the hieroglyphic language of the East, denotes
some eminent ruler--primarily David; but secondarily and pre-eminently,
the Messiah (see on [Gen 49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010)).

corners--border, often used for a whole country ([Exo
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#002); [Psa
74:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#017)).

children of Sheth--some prince of Moab; or, according to some, "the
children of the East."

[Numbers 24:18](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">num 24:18</span></span>

Edom shall be a possession--This prophecy was accomplished by David
([Sa2 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#014)).

Seir--seen in the south, and poetically used for Edom. The double
conquest of Moab and Edom is alluded to ([Psa
60:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#008); [Psa
108:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#009)).

[Numbers 24:19](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">num 24:19</span></span>

Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion--David, and
particularly Christ.

that remaineth of the city--those who flee from the field to fortified
places ([Psa 60:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#009)).

[Numbers 24:20](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">num 24:20</span></span>

Amalek . . . his latter end shall be that he perish for ever--Their
territory was seen at the remote extremity of the desert. (See on [Exo
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#013); also 1Sa. 15:1-35).

[Numbers 24:21](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">num 24:21</span></span>

Kenites . . . nest in a rock--Though securely established among the
clefts in the high rocks of En-gedi towards the west, they should be
gradually reduced by a succession of enemies till the Assyrian invader
carried them into captivity ([Jdg
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#016); [Jdg
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#011), [Jdg
4:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#016); also [Kg2
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029); [Kg2
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#006)).

[Numbers 24:23](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">num 24:23</span></span>

who shall live when God doeth this!--Few shall escape the desolation
that shall send a Nebuchadnezzar to scourge all those regions.

[Numbers 24:24](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">num 24:24</span></span>

Chittim--the countries lying on the Mediterranean, particularly Greece
and Italy ([Dan 11:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#029)). The
Assyrians were themselves to be overthrown--first, by the Greeks under
Alexander the Great and his successors; secondly, by the Romans.

Eber--the posterity of the Hebrews ([Gen
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#024)).

he also shall perish--that is, the conqueror of Asher and Eber, namely,
the Greek and Roman empires.

[Numbers 24:25](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">num 24:25</span></span>

Balaam rose up, and went . . . to his place--Mesopotamia, to which,
however, he did not return. (See on [Num
31:8](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#008)).
