### [Jeremiah Chapter 41](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 41:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 41:1</span></span>

ISHMAEL MURDERS GEDALIAH AND OTHERS, THEN FLEES TO THE AMMONITES.
JOHANAN PURSUES HIM, RECOVERS THE CAPTIVES, AND PURPOSES TO FLEE TO
EGYPT FOR FEAR OF THE CHALDEANS. (Jer. 41:1-18)

seventh month--the second month after the burning of the city ([Jer
52:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#012)).

and the princes--not the nominative. And the princes came, for the
"princes" are not mentioned either in [Jer
41:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#002) or in [Kg2
25:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#025) : but, "Ishmael being of the
seed royal and of the princes of the king" \[MAURER\]. But the ten men
were the "princes of the king"; thus MAURER'S objection has no weight:
so English Version.

eat bread together--Ishmael murdered Gedaliah, by whom he was hospitably
received, in violation of the sacred right of hospitality ([Psa
41:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#009)).

[Jeremiah 41:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 41:2</span></span>

slew him whom the king of Babylon had made governor--This assigns a
reason for their slaying him, as well as showing the magnitude of their
crime ([Dan 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#021); [Rom
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#001)).

[Jeremiah 41:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 41:3</span></span>

slew all the Jews--namely, the attendants and ministers of Gedaliah; or,
the military alone, about his person; translate, "even (not 'and,' as
English Version) the men of war." The main portion of the people with
Gedaliah, including Jeremiah, Ishmael carried away captive ([Jer
41:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#010), [Jer
41:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#016)).

[Jeremiah 41:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 41:4</span></span>

no man knew it--that is, outside Mizpah. Before tidings of the murder
had gone abroad.

[Jeremiah 41:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 41:5</span></span>

beards shaven, &c.--indicating their deep sorrow at the destruction of
the temple and city.

cut themselves--a heathen custom, forbidden ([Lev
19:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#027); [Deu
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#001)). These men were mostly from
Samaria, where the ten tribes, previous to their deportation, had fallen
into heathen practices.

offerings--unbloody. They do not bring sacrificial victims, but
"incense," &c., to testify their piety.

house of . . . Lord--that is, the place where the house of the Lord had
stood ([Kg2 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#009)). The place in which
a temple had stood, even when it had been destroyed, was held sacred
\[PAPINIAN\]. Those "from Shiloh" would naturally seek the house of the
Lord, since it was at Shiloh it originally was set up ([Jos
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#001)).

[Jeremiah 41:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 41:6</span></span>

weeping--pretending to weep, as they did, for the ruin of the temple.

Come to Gedaliah--as if he was one of Gedaliah's retinue.

[Jeremiah 41:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 41:7</span></span>

and cast them into . . . pit--He had not killed them in the pit (compare
[Jer 41:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#009)); these words are therefore
rightly supplied in English Version. "The pit" or cistern made by Asa to
guard against a want of water when Baasha was about to besiege the city
([Kg1 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#022)). The trench or fosse
round the city \[GROTIUS\]. Ishmael's motive for the murder seems to
have been a suspicion that they were coming to live under Gedaliah.

[Jeremiah 41:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 41:8</span></span>

treasures--It was customary to hide grain in cavities underground in
troubled times. "We have treasures," which we will give, if our lives be
spared.

slew . . . not-- ([Pro 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#008)).
Ishmael's avarice and needs overcame his cruelty.

[Jeremiah 41:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 41:9</span></span>

because of Gedaliah--rather, "near Gedaliah," namely, those intercepted
by Ishmael on their way from Samaria to Jerusalem and killed at Mizpah,
where Gedaliah had lived. So [Ch2
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#015), "next"; [Neh
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#002), Margin, literally, as here, "at
his hand." "In the reign of Gedaliah" \[CALVIN\]. However, English
Version gives a good sense: Ishmael's reason for killing them was
because of his supposing them to be connected with Gedaliah.

[Jeremiah 41:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 41:10</span></span>

the king's daughters-- ([Jer 43:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#006)).
Zedekiah's. Ishmael must have got additional followers (whom the hope of
gain attracted), besides those who originally set out with him ([Jer
41:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#001)), so as to have been able to
carry off all the residue of the people. He probably meant to sell them
as slaves to the Ammonites (see on [Jer
40:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#014)).

[Jeremiah 41:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 41:11</span></span>

Johanan--the friend of Gedaliah who had warned him of Ishmael's
treachery, but in vain ([Jer 40:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#008),
[Jer 40:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#013)).

[Jeremiah 41:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 41:12</span></span>

the . . . waters-- ([Sa2 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#013)); a
large reservoir or lake.

in Gibeon--on the road from Mizpah to Ammon: one of the sacerdotal
cities of Benjamin, four miles northwest of Jerusalem, now Eljib.

[Jeremiah 41:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 41:13</span></span>

glad--at the prospect of having a deliverer from their captivity.

[Jeremiah 41:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 41:14</span></span>

cast about--came round.

[Jeremiah 41:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 41:16</span></span>

men of war--"The men of war," stated in [Jer
41:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#003) to have been slain by Ishmael,
must refer to the military about Gedaliah's person; "the men of war"
here to those not so.

eunuchs--The kings of Judah had adopted the bad practice of having
harems and eunuchs from the surrounding heathen kingdoms.

[Jeremiah 41:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 41:17</span></span>

dwelt--for a time, until they were ready for their journey to Egypt
(Jer. 42:1-22).

habitation to Chimham--his "caravanserai" close by Beth-lehem. David, in
reward for Barzillai's loyalty, took Chimham his son under his
patronage, and made over to him his own patrimony in the land of
Beth-lehem. It was thence called the habitation of Chimham
(Geruth-Chimham), though it reverted to David's heirs in the year of
jubilee. "Caravanserais" (a compound Persian word, meaning "the house of
a company of travellers") differ from our inns, in that there is no host
to supply food, but each traveller must carry with him his own.

[Jeremiah 41:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 41:18</span></span>

afraid--lest the Chaldeans should suspect all the Jews of being
implicated in Ishmael's treason, as though the Jews sought to have a
prince of the house of David ([Jer
41:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#001)). Their better way towards
gaining God's favor would have been to have laid the blame on the real
culprit, and to have cleared themselves. A tortuous policy is the parent
of fear. Righteousness inspires with boldness ([Psa
53:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#005); [Pro
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#001)).
