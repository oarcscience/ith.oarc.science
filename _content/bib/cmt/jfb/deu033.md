### [Deuteronomy Chapter 33](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#001)

[Deuteronomy 33:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 33:1</span></span>

THE MAJESTY OF GOD. (Deu. 33:1-28)

Moses the man of God--This was a common designation of a prophet ([Sa1
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#027); [Sa1
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#006)), and it is here applied to Moses,
when, like Jacob, he was about to deliver ministerially before his
death, a prophetic benediction to Israel.

[Deuteronomy 33:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">deu 33:2</span></span>

The Lord came--Under a beautiful metaphor, borrowed from the dawn and
progressive splendor of the sun, the Majesty of God is sublimely
described as a divine light which appeared in Sinai and scattered its
beams on all the adjoining region in directing Israel's march to Canaan.
In these descriptions of a theophania, God is represented as coming from
the south, and the allusion is in general to the thunderings and
lightnings of Sinai; but other mountains in the same direction are
mentioned with it. The location of Seir was on the east of the Ghor;
mount Paran was either the chain on the west of the Ghor, or rather the
mountains on the southern border of the desert towards the peninsula
\[ROBINSON\]. (Compare [Jdg 5:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#004);
[Psa 68:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#007); [Hab
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#003)).

ten thousands of saints--rendered by some, "with the ten thousand of
Kadesh," or perhaps better still, "from Meribah" \[EWALD\].

a fiery law--so called both because of the thunder and lightning which
accompanied its promulgation ([Exo
19:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#016); [Deu
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#011)), and the fierce, unrelenting
curse denounced against the violation of its precepts ([Co2
3:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#007)). Notwithstanding those
awe-inspiring symbols of Majesty that were displayed on Sinai, the law
was really given in kindness and love ([Deu
33:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#003)), as a means of promoting both
the temporal and eternal welfare of the people. And it was "the
inheritance of the congregation of Jacob," not only from the hereditary
obligation under which that people were laid to observe it, but from its
being the grand distinction, the peculiar privilege of the nation.

[Deuteronomy 33:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">deu 33:6</span></span>

Let Reuben live, and not die--Although deprived of the honor and
privileges of primogeniture, he was still to hold rank as one of the
tribes of Israel. He was more numerous than several other tribes ([Num
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#021); [Num
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#011)). Yet gradually he sank into a
mere nomadic tribe, which had enough to do merely "to live and not die."
Many eminent biblical scholars, resting on the most ancient and approved
manuscripts of the Septuagint, consider the latter clause as referring
to Simeon; "and Simeon, let his men be few," a reading of the text which
is in harmony with other statements of Scripture respecting this tribe
([Num 25:6-14](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#006); [Num
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#023); [Num
26:14](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#014); [Jos
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#001)).

[Deuteronomy 33:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">deu 33:7</span></span>

this is the blessing of Judah--Its general purport points to the great
power and independence of Judah, as well as its taking the lead in all
military expeditions.

[Deuteronomy 33:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">deu 33:8</span></span>

of Levi he said--The burden of this blessing is the appointment of the
Levites to the dignified and sacred office of the priesthood ([Lev
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#011); [Deu
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#008); [Deu
17:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#008)), a reward for their zeal in
supporting the cause of God, and their unsparing severity in chastising
even their nearest and dearest relatives who had participated in the
idolatry of the molten calf ([Exo
32:25-28](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#025); compare [Mal
2:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#004)).

[Deuteronomy 33:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">deu 33:12</span></span>

of Benjamin he said--A distinguishing favor was conferred on this tribe
in having its portion assigned near the temple of God.

between his shoulders--that is, on his sides or borders. Mount Zion, on
which stood the city of Jerusalem, belonged to Judah; but Mount Moriah,
the site of the sacred edifice, lay in the confines of Benjamin.

[Deuteronomy 33:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">deu 33:13</span></span>

of Joseph he said--The territory of this tribe, diversified by hill and
dale, wood and water, would be rich in all the productions--olives,
grapes, figs, &c., which are reared in a mountainous region, as well as
in the grain and herbs that grow in the level fields. "The firstling of
the bullock and the horns of the unicorn" (rhinoceros), indicate glory
and strength, and it is supposed that under these emblems were shadowed
forth the triumphs of Joshua and the new kingdom of Jeroboam, both of
whom were of Ephraim (compare [Gen
48:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#020)).

[Deuteronomy 33:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">deu 33:18</span></span>

Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out--on commercial enterprises and
voyages by sea.

and, Issachar in thy tents--preferring to reside in their maritime
towns.

[Deuteronomy 33:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">deu 33:19</span></span>

shall suck of the abundance of the seas, and of treasures hid in the
sand--Both tribes should traffic with the PhÅ“nicians in gold and
silver, pearl and coral, especially in murex, the shellfish that yielded
the famous Tyrian dye, and in glass, which was manufactured from the
sand of the river Belus, in their immediate neighborhood.

[Deuteronomy 33:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">deu 33:20</span></span>

of Gad he said--Its possessions were larger than they would have been
had they lain west of Jordan; and this tribe had the honor of being
settled by Moses himself in the first portion of land conquered. In the
forest region, south of the Jabbok, "he dwelt as a lion" (compare [Gen
30:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#011); [Gen
49:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#019)). Notwithstanding, they
faithfully kept their engagement to join the "heads of the people"
\[[Deu 33:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#021)\] in the invasion of
Canaan.

[Deuteronomy 33:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">deu 33:22</span></span>

Dan is a lion's whelp--His proper settlement in the south of Canaan
being too small, he by a sudden and successful irruption, established a
colony in the northern extremity of the land. This might well be
described as the leap of a young lion from the hills of Bashan.

[Deuteronomy 33:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">deu 33:23</span></span>

of Naphtali he said--The pleasant and fertile territory of this tribe
lay to "the west," on the borders of lakes Merom and Chinnereth, and to
"the south" of the northern Danites.

[Deuteronomy 33:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">deu 33:24</span></span>

of Asher he said--The condition of this tribe is described as combining
all the elements of earthly felicity.

dip his foot in oil--These words allude either to the process of
extracting the oil by foot presses, or to his district as particularly
fertile and adapted to the culture of the olive.

[Deuteronomy 33:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">deu 33:25</span></span>

shoes of iron and brass--These shoes suited his rocky coast from Carmel
to Sidon. Country people as well as ancient warriors had their lower
extremities protected by metallic greaves ([Sa1
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#006); [Eph
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#015)) and iron-soled shoes.

[Deuteronomy 33:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">deu 33:26</span></span>

There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun--The chapter concludes with
a congratulatory address to Israel on their peculiar happiness and
privilege in having Jehovah for their God and protector.

who rideth upon the heaven in thy help--an evident allusion to the
pillar of cloud and fire, which was both the guide and shelter of
Israel.

[Deuteronomy 33:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">deu 33:28</span></span>

the fountain of Jacob--The posterity of Israel shall dwell in a blessed
and favored land.
