<p>
<p>Mount Seir--that is, Idumea (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#009">Gen 36:9</A>). Singled out as badly pre-eminent in its bitterness against God's people, to represent all their enemies everywhere and in all ages. So in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#005">Isa 34:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#001">Isa 63:1-4</A>, Edom, the region of the greatest enmity towards God's people, is the ideal scene of the final judgments of all God's foes. "Seir" means "shaggy," alluding to its rugged hills and forests.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#003">Ezekiel 35:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">eze 35:3</A></FONT></span></p>most desolate--literally, "desolation and desolateness" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#017">Jer 49:17</A>, &amp;c.). It is only in their national character of foes to God's people, that the Edomites are to be utterly destroyed. A remnant of Edom, as of the other heathen, is to be "called by the name of God" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#012">Amo 9:12</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#005">Ezekiel 35:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">eze 35:5</A></FONT></span></p>perpetual hatred-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#007">Psa 137:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#011">Amo 1:11</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#010">Oba 1:10-16</A>). Edom perpetuated the hereditary hatred derived from Esau against Jacob. 
<p>
<p>shed the blood of, &amp;c.--The literal translation is better. "Thou hast poured out the children of Israel"; namely, like water. So <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#014">Psa 22:14</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#010">Psa 63:10</A>, Margin; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#021">Jer 18:21</A>. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#014">Sa2 14:14</A>. 
<p>
<p>by the force of the sword--literally, "by" or "upon the hands of the sword"; the sword being personified as a devourer whose "hands" were the instruments of destruction. 
<p>
<p>in the time that their iniquity had an end--that is, had its consummation (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#025">Eze 21:25</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#029">Eze 21:29</A>). Edom consummated his guilt when he exulted over Jerusalem's downfall, and helped the foe to destroy it (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#007">Psa 137:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#011">Oba 1:11</A>).

<p>
<p>sith--old English for "seeing that" or "since." 
<p>
<p>thou hast not hated blood--The Hebrew order is, "thou hast hated not blood"; that is, thou couldst not bear to live without bloodshed [GROTIUS]. There is a play on similar sounds in the Hebrew; Edom resembling dam, the Hebrew for "blood"; as "Edom" means "red," the transition to "blood" is easy. Edom, akin to blood in name, so also in nature and acts; "blood therefore shall pursue thee." The measure which Edom meted to others should be meted to himself (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#017">Psa 109:17</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#002">Mat 7:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#052">Mat 26:52</A>).

<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#009">Ezekiel 35:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">eze 35:9</A></FONT></span></p>shall not return--to their former state (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#055">Eze 16:55</A>); shall not be restored. The Hebrew text (Chetib) reads, "shall not be inhabited" (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#020">Eze 26:20</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#003">Mal 1:3-4</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#010">Ezekiel 35:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">eze 35:10</A></FONT></span></p>So far from being allowed to enter on Israel's vacated inheritance, as Edom hoped (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#005">Eze 36:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#004">Psa 83:4</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#012">Psa 83:12</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#013">Oba 1:13</A>), it shall be that he shall be deprived of his own; and whereas Israel's humiliation was temporary, Edom's shall be perpetual. 
<p>
<p>Lord was there-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#035">Eze 48:35</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#001">Psa 48:1</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#003">Psa 48:3</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#013">Psa 132:13-14</A>). Jehovah claimed Judea as His own, even when the Chaldeans had overthrown the state; they could not remove Him, as they did the idols of heathen lands. The broken sentences express the excited feelings of the prophet at Edom's wicked presumption. The transition from the "two nations and two countries" to "it" marks that the two are regarded as one whole. The last clause, "and Jehovah was there," bursts in, like a flash of lightning, reproving the wicked presumption of Edom's thought.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#011">Ezekiel 35:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">eze 35:11</A></FONT></span></p>according to thine anger-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#013">Jam 2:13</A>). As thou in anger and envy hast injured them, so I will injure thee. 
<p>
<p>I will make myself known among them--namely, the Israelites. I will manifest My favor to them, after I have punished thee.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#012">Ezekiel 35:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">eze 35:12</A></FONT></span></p>blasphemies . . . against . . . Israel . . . against me--God regards what is done against His people as done against Himself (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#045">Mat 25:45</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#002">Act 9:2</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#004">Act 9:4-5</A>). Edom implied, if he did not express it, in his taunts against Israel, that God had not sufficient power to protect His people. A type of the spirit of all the foes of God and His people (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#003">Sa1 2:3</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#006">Rev 13:6</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#014">Ezekiel 35:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">eze 35:14</A></FONT></span></p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#013">Isa 65:13-14</A>). "The whole earth" refers to Judea and the nations that submit themselves to Judea's God; when these rejoice, the foes of God and His people, represented by Edom as a nation, shall be desolate. Things shall be completely reversed; Israel, that now for a time mourns, shall then rejoice and for ever. Edom, that now rejoices over fallen Israel, shall then, when elsewhere all is joy, mourn, and for ever (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#017">Isa 65:17-19</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#004">Mat 5:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#025">Luk 6:25</A>). HAVERNICK loses this striking antithesis by translating, "According to the joy of the whole land (of Edom), so I will make thee desolate"; which would make <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#015">Eze 35:15</A> a mere repetition of this.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#015">Ezekiel 35:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">eze 35:15</A></FONT></span></p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#012">Oba 1:12</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#015">Oba 1:15</A>).
<p>
<p>The distinction between Israel and the heathen (as Edom) is: Israel has a covenant relation to God ensuring restoration after chastisement, so that the heathen's hope of getting possession of the elect people's inheritance must fail, and they themselves be made desolate (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#001">Eze 36:1-15</A>). The reason for the chastisement of Israel was Israel's sin and profanation of God's name (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#016">Eze 36:16-21</A>). God has good in store for Israel, for His own name's sake, to revive His people; first, by a spiritual renewal of their hearts, and, next, by an external restoration to prosperity (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#022">Eze 36:22-33</A>). The result is that the heathen shall be impressed with the power and goodness of God manifested so palpably towards the restored people (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#034">Eze 36:34-38</A>).
