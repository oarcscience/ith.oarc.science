<p>
<p>In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah, began Hoshea . . . to reign--The statement in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#030">Kg2 15:30</A> may be reconciled with the present passage in the following manner: Hoshea conspired against Pekah in the twentieth year of the latter, which was the eighteenth of Jotham's reign. It was two years before Hoshea was acknowledged king of Israel, that is, in the fourth of Ahaz, and twentieth of Jotham. In the twelfth year of Ahaz his reign began to be tranquil and prosperous [CALMET].
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#002">4 Kings (2 Kings) 17:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">kg2 17:2</A></FONT></span></p>he did evil . . . but not as the kings of Israel--Unlike his predecessors from the time of Jeroboam, he neither established the rites of Baal, nor compelled the people to adhere to the symbolic worship of the calves. [See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#001">Ch2 30:1</A>.] In these respects, Hoshea acted as became a constitutional king of Israel. Yet, through the influence of the nineteen princes who had swayed the scepter before him (all of whom had been zealous patrons of idolatry, and many of whom had been also infamous for personal crimes), the whole nation had become so completely demoralized that the righteous judgment of an angry Providence impended over it.

<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#003">4 Kings (2 Kings) 17:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">kg2 17:3</A></FONT></span></p>Against him came up Shalmaneser--or Shalman (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#014">Hos 10:14</A>), the same as the Sargon of Isaiah [<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#001">Isa 20:1</A>]. Very recently the name of this Assyrian king has been traced on the Ninevite monuments, as concerned in an expedition against a king of Samaria, whose name, though mutilated, COLONEL RAWLINSON reads as Hoshea.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#004">4 Kings (2 Kings) 17:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">kg2 17:4</A></FONT></span></p>found conspiracy in Hoshea--After having paid tribute for several years, Hoshea, determined on throwing off the Assyrian yoke, withheld the stipulated tribute. Shalmaneser, incensed at this rebellion, proclaimed war against Israel. This was in the sixth year of Hoshea's reign. 
<p>
<p>he had sent messengers to So, king of Egypt--the Sabaco of the classic historians, a famous Ethiopian who, for fifty years, occupied the Egyptian throne, and through whose aid Hoshea hoped to resist the threatened attack of the Assyrian conqueror. But Shalmaneser, marching against [Hoshea], scoured the whole country of Israel, besieged the capital Samaria, and carried the principal inhabitants into captivity in his own land, having taken the king himself, and imprisoned him for life. This ancient policy of transplanting a conquered people into a foreign land, was founded on the idea that, among a mixed multitude, differing in language and religion, they would be kept in better subjection, and have less opportunity of combining together to recover their independence.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#006">4 Kings (2 Kings) 17:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">kg2 17:6</A></FONT></span></p>carried Israel away--that is, the remaining tribes (see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029">Kg2 15:29</A>). 
<p>
<p>and placed them, &amp;c.--This passage GESENIUS renders thus, omitting the particle by, which is printed in italics to show it is not in the original: "and placed them in Halah, and on the Chabor, a river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes." 
<p>
<p>Halah--the same as Calah (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#011">Gen 10:11-12</A>), in the region of the Laycus or Zab river, about a day's journey from the ruins of Nineveh. 
<p>
<p>Chabor--is a river, and it is remarkable that there is a river rising in the central highlands of Assyria which retains this name Khabour unchanged to the present day. 
<p>
<p>Gozan--("pasture") or Zozan, are the highlands of Assyria, which afford pasturage. The region in which the Chabor and the Zab rise, and through which they flow, is peculiarly of this character. The Nestorians repair to it with their numerous flocks, spending the summer on the banks or in the highlands of the Chabor or the Zab. Considering the high authority we possess for regarding Gozan and Zozan as one name, there can be no doubt that this is the Gozan referred to in this passage. 
<p>
<p>cities of the Medes--"villages," according to the Syriac and Vulgate versions, or "mountains," according to the Septuagint. The Medish inhabitants of Gozan, having revolted, had been destroyed by the kings of Assyria, and nothing was more natural than that they should wish to place in it an industrious people, like the captive Israelites, while it was well suited to their pastoral life [GRANT, Nestorians].

<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#007">4 Kings (2 Kings) 17:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">kg2 17:7</A></FONT></span></p>SAMARIA TAKEN, AND ISRAEL FOR THEIR SINS CARRIED CAPTIVE. (2Ki. 17:7-41)
<p>
<p>For so it was, that the children of Israel had sinned--There is here given a very full and impressive vindication of the divine procedure in punishing His highly privileged, but rebellious and apostate, people. No wonder that amid so gross a perversion of the worship of the true God, and the national propensity to do reverence to idols, the divine patience was exhausted; and that the God whom they had forsaken permitted them to go into captivity, that they might learn the difference between His service and that of their despotic conquerors.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#024">4 Kings (2 Kings) 17:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">kg2 17:24</A></FONT></span></p>the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, etc.--This was not Shalmaneser, but Esar-haddon (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#002">Eze 4:2</A>). The places vacated by the captive Israelites he ordered to be occupied by several colonies of his own subjects from Babylon and other provinces. 
<p>
<p>from Cuthah--the Chaldee form of Cush or Susiana, now Khusistan. 
<p>
<p>Ava--supposed to be Ahivaz, situated on the river Karuns, which empties into the head of the Persian Gulf. 
<p>
<p>Hamath--on the Orontes. 
<p>
<p>Sepharvaim--Siphara, a city on the Euphrates above Babylon. 
<p>
<p>placed them in the cities of Samaria, &amp;c.--It must not be supposed that the Israelites were universally removed to a man. A remnant was left, chiefly however of the poor and lower classes, with whom these foreign colonists mingled; so that the prevailing character of society about Samaria was heathen, not Israelite. For the Assyrian colonists became masters of the land; and, forming partial intermarriages with the remnant Jews, the inhabitants became a mongrel race, no longer a people of Ephraim (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#006">Isa 7:6</A>). These people, imperfectly instructed in the creed of the Jews, acquired also a mongrel doctrine. Being too few to replenish the land, lions, by which the land had been infested (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#005">Jdg 14:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#034">Sa1 17:34</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#024">Kg1 13:24</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#036">Kg1 20:36</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#008">Sol 4:8</A>), multiplied and committed frequent ravages upon them. Recognizing in these attacks a judgment from the God of the land, whom they had not worshipped, they petitioned the Assyrian court to send them some Jewish priests who might instruct them in the right way of serving Him. The king, in compliance with their request, sent them one of the exiled priests of Israel [<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#027">Kg2 17:27</A>], who established his headquarters at Beth-el, and taught them how they should fear the Lord. It is not said that he took a copy of the Pentateuch with him, out of which he might teach them. Oral teaching was much better fitted for the superstitious people than instruction out of a written book. He could teach them more effectually by word of mouth. Believing that he would adopt the best and simplest method for them, it is unlikely that he took the written law with him, and so gave origin to the Samaritan copy of the Pentateuch [DAVIDSON, Criticism]. Besides, it is evident from his being one of the exiled priests, and from his settlement at Beth-el, that he was not a Levite, but one of the calf-worshipping priests. Consequently his instructions would be neither sound nor efficient.

<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#029">4 Kings (2 Kings) 17:29</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_029">kg2 17:29</A></FONT></span></p>Howbeit every nation made gods of their own--These Assyrian colonists, however, though instructed in the worship, and acknowledging the being of the God of Israel, did not suppose Him to be the only God. Like other heathens, they combined His worship with that of their own gods; and as they formed a promiscuous society from different nations or provinces, a variety of idols was acknowledged among them.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#030">4 Kings (2 Kings) 17:30</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_030">kg2 17:30</A></FONT></span></p>Succoth-benoth--that is, the "tents" or "booths of the daughters," similar to those in which the Babylonian damsels celebrated impure rites (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#008">Amo 2:8</A>). 
<p>
<p>Nergal--The Jewish writers say this idol was in the form of a cock, and it is certain that a cock is often associated with a priest on the Assyrian monuments [LAYARD]. But modern critics, looking to the astrological character of Assyrian idolatry, generally consider Nergal as the planet Mars, the god of war. The name of this idol formed part of the appellation of two of the king of Babylon's princes (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#003">Jer 39:3</A>). 
<p>
<p>Ashima--an idol under the form of an entirely bald he-goat.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#031">4 Kings (2 Kings) 17:31</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_031">kg2 17:31</A></FONT></span></p>Nibhaz--under that of a dog--that Egyptian form of animal-worship having prevailed in ancient Syria, as is evident from the image of a large dog at the mouth of the Nahr-el-Kelb, or Dog river. 
<p>
<p>Tartak--According to the rabbis, it was in the form of an ass, but others understand it as a planet of ill-omen, probably Saturn. 
<p>
<p>Adrammelech--supposed by some to be the same as Molech, and in Assyrian mythology to stand for the sun. It was worshipped in the form of a mule--others maintain in that of a peacock. 
<p>
<p>Anammelech--worshipped in the form of a hare; others say in that of a goat.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#034">4 Kings (2 Kings) 17:34</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_034">kg2 17:34</A></FONT></span></p>Unto this day--the time of the Babylonian exile, when this book was composed. Their religion was a strange medley or compound of the service of God and the service of idols. Such was the first settlement of the people, afterwards called Samaritans, who were sent from Assyria to colonize the land, when the kingdom of Israel, after having continued three hundred fifty-six years, was overthrown.
