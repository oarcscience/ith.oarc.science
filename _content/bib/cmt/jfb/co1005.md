### [1 Corinthians Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#001)

[1 Corinthians 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co1 5:1</span></span>

THE INCESTUOUS PERSON AT CORINTH: THE CORINTHIANS REPROVED FOR
CONNIVANCE, AND WARNED TO PURGE OUT THE BAD LEAVEN. QUALIFICATION OF HIS
FORMER COMMAND AS TO ASSOCIATION WITH SINNERS OF THE WORLD. ([Co1
5:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#001))

commonly--rather, "actually" \[ALFORD\]. Absolutely \[BENGEL\]. "It is
reported," implies, that the Corinthians, though they "wrote" ([Co1
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#001)) to Paul on other points, gave him
no information on those things which bore against themselves. These
latter matters reached the apostle indirectly ([Co1
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#011)).

so much as named--The oldest manuscripts and authorities omit "named":
"Fornication of such a gross kind as (exists) not even among the
heathen, so that one (of you) hath (in concubinage) his father's wife,"
that is, his stepmother, while his father is still alive ([Co2
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#012); compare [Lev
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#008)). She was perhaps a heathen, for
which reason he does not direct his rebuke against her (compare [Co1
5:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#012)). ALFORD thinks "have" means
have in marriage: but the connection is called "fornication," and
neither Christian nor Gentile law would have sanctioned such a marriage,
however Corinth's notorious profligacy might wink at the concubinage.

[1 Corinthians 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co1 5:2</span></span>

puffed up--with your own wisdom and knowledge, and the eloquence of your
favorite teachers: at a time when ye ought to be "mourning" at the
scandal caused to religion by the incest. Paul mourned because they did
not mourn ([Co2 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#004)). We ought to
mourn over the transgressions of others, and repent of our own ([Co2
12:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#021)) \[BENGEL\].

that--ye have not felt such mourning as would lead to the result that,
&c.

taken away from among you--by excommunication. The incestuous person was
hereby brought to bitter repentance, in the interval between the sending
of the first and second Epistles ([Co2
2:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#005)). Excommunication in the
Christian Church corresponded to that in the Jewish synagogue, in there
being a lighter and heavier form: the latter an utter separation from
church fellowship and the Lord's house, the former exclusion from the
Lord's Supper only but not from the Church.

[1 Corinthians 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co1 5:3</span></span>

as absent--The best manuscripts read, "being absent."

present in spirit-- ([Kg2 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#026); [Col
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#005)).

so done--rather, "perpetrated," as the Greek word here is stronger than
that for "done" in [Co1 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#002). "So,"
that is, so scandalously while called a brother.

[1 Corinthians 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co1 5:4</span></span>

In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ--By His authority and as
representing His person and will ([Co2
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#010)). Join this with "to deliver such
a one unto Satan" ([Co1 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#005)). The
clause, "When ye have been gathered together and my spirit (wherein I am
'present,' though 'absent in body,' [Co1
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#003)), with the power of our Lord
Jesus," stands in a parenthesis between. Paul speaking of himself uses
the word "spirit"; of Christ, "power." Christ's power was promised to be
present with HIS Church "gathered together in His name" ([Mat
18:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#018)): and here Paul by
inspiration gives a special promise of his apostolic spirit, which in
such cases was guided by the Holy Spirit, ratifying their decree passed
according to his judgment ("I have judged," [Co1
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#003)), as though he were present in
person ([Joh 20:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#021); [Co2
13:3-10](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#003)). This power of infallible
judgment was limited to the apostles; for they alone had the power of
working miracles as their credentials to attest their infallibility.
Their successors, to establish their claim to the latter, must produce
the former ([Co2 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#002)). Even the
apostles in ordinary cases, and where not specially and consciously
inspired, were fallible ([Act 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#013),
[Act 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#023); [Gal
2:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#011)).

[1 Corinthians 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co1 5:5</span></span>

Besides excommunication (of which the Corinthians themselves had the
power), Paul delegates here to the Corinthian Church his own special
power as an apostle, of inflicting corporeal disease or death in
punishment for sin ("to deliver to Satan such an one," that is, so
heinous a sinner). For instances of this power, see [Act
5:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#001); [Act
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#011); [Ti1
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#020). As Satan receives power at times
to try the godly, as Job ([Job 2:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#004))
and Paul ([Co2 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#007); compare also as
to Peter, [Luk 22:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#031)), much more the
ungodly. Satan, the "accuser of the brethren" ([Rev
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#010)) and the "adversary" ([Pe1
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#008)), demands the sinner for
punishment on account of sin ([Zac
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#001)). When God lets Satan have his
way, He is said to "deliver the sinner unto Satan" (compare [Psa
109:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#006)). Here it is not finally; but
for the affliction of the body with disease, and even death ([Co1
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#030), [Co1
11:32](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#032)), so as to destroy fleshly lust.
He does not say, "for the destruction of the body," for it shall share
in redemption ([Rom 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#023)); but of the
corrupt "flesh" which "cannot inherit the kingdom of God," and the lusts
of which had prompted this offender to incest ([Rom
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#005); [Rom
8:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#009)). The "destruction of the
flesh" answers to "mortify the deeds of the body" ([Rom
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#013)), only that the latter is done by
one's self, the former is effected by chastisement from God (compare
[Pe1 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#006)):

the spirit . . . saved--the spiritual part of man, in the believer the
organ of the Holy Spirit. Temporary affliction often leads to permanent
salvation ([Psa 83:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#016)).

[1 Corinthians 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co1 5:6</span></span>

Your glorying in your own attainments and those of your favorite
teachers ([Co1 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#021); [Co1
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#019); [Co1
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#002)), while all the while ye connive
at such a scandal, is quite unseemly.

a little leaven leaveth . . . whole lump-- ([Gal
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#009)), namely, with present complicity
in the guilt, and the danger of future contagion ([Co1
15:33](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#033); [Ti2
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#017)).

[1 Corinthians 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co1 5:7</span></span>

old leaven--The remnant of the "old" ([Eph
4:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#022)) heathenish and natural
corruption. The image is taken from the extreme care of the Jews in
searching every corner of their houses, and "purging out" every particle
of leaven from the time of killing the lamb before the Passover ([Deu
16:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#003)). So Christians are continually
to search and purify their hearts ([Psa
139:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#023)).

as ye are unleavened--normally, and as far as your Christian calling is
concerned: free from the leaven of sin and death ([Co1
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#011)). Paul often grounds exhortations
on the assumption of Christian professors' normal state as realized
([Rom 6:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#003)) \[ALFORD\]. Regarding the
Corinthian Church as the Passover "unleavened lump" or mass, he entreats
them to correspond in fact with this their normal state. "For Christ our
Passover ([Exo 12:5-11](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#005), [Exo
12:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#021); [Joh
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#029)) has been (English Version, "is")
sacrificed for us"; that is, as the Jews began the days of unleavened
bread with the slaying of the Passover lamb, so, Christ our Passover
having been already slain, let there be no leaven of evil in you who are
the "unleavened lump." Doubtless he alludes to the Passover which had
been two or three weeks before kept by the Jewish Christians ([Co1
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#008)): the Gentile Christians probably
also refraining from leavened bread at the love-feasts. Thus the Jewish
Passover naturally gave place to our Christian Easter. The time however,
of keeping feast (metaphorical; that is, leading the Christian life of
joy in Christ's finished work, compare [Pro
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#015)) among us Christians,
corresponding to the Jewish Passover, is not limited, as the latter, to
one season, but is ALL our time; for the transcendent benefits of the
once-for-all completed sacrifice of our Passover Lamb extends to all the
time of our lives and of this Christian dispensation; in no part of our
time is the leaven of evil to be admitted.

For even--an additional reason, besides that in [Co1
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#006), and a more cogent one for purging
out every leaven of evil; namely, that Christ has been already
sacrificed, whereas the old leaven is yet unremoved, which ought to have
been long ago purged out.

[1 Corinthians 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co1 5:8</span></span>

not . . . old leaven--of our unconverted state as Jews or heathen.

malice--the opposite of "sincerity," which allows no leaven of evil to
be mixed up with good ([Mat 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#006)).

wickedness--the opposite of "truth," which allows not evil to be
mistaken for good. The Greek for "malice" means the evil habit of mind;
"wickedness," the outcoming of the same in word and deed. The Greek for
"sincerity" expresses literally, a thing which, when examined by the
sun's light, is found pure and unadulterated.

[1 Corinthians 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co1 5:9</span></span>

I wrote . . . in an epistle--rather, "in the Epistle": a former one not
now extant. That Paul does not refer to the present letter is proved by
the fact that no direction "not to company with fornicators" occurs in
the previous part of it; also the words, "in an (or, the) epistle,"
could not have been added if he meant, "I have just written" ([Co2
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#010)). "His letters" (plural; not
applying to merely one) confirm this. [Co2
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#008) also refers to our first Epistle,
just as here a former letter is referred to by the same phrase. Paul
probably wrote a former brief reply to inquiries of the Corinthians: our
first Epistle, as it enters more fully into the same subject, has
superseded the former, which the Holy Spirit did not design for the
guidance of the Church in general, and which therefore has not been
preserved. See my Introduction.

[1 Corinthians 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co1 5:10</span></span>

Limitation of the prohibition alluded to in [Co1
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#009). As in dissolute Corinth to
"company with no fornicators," &c., would be almost to company with none
in the (unbelieving) world; ye need not utterly ("altogether") forego
intercourse with fornicators, &c., of the unbelieving world (compare
[Co1 10:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#027); [Joh
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#015); [Jo1
5:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#018)). As "fornicators" sin against
themselves, so "extortioners" against their neighbors, and "idolaters"
against God. The attempt to get "out of the world," in violation of
God's will that believers should remain in it but keep themselves from
its evil, led to monasticism and its consequent evils.

[1 Corinthians 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co1 5:11</span></span>

But now--"Now" does not express time, but "the case being so," namely,
that to avoid fornicators, &c., of the world, you would have to leave
the world altogether, which would be absurd. So "now" is used in [Heb
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#016). Thus we avoid making the
apostle now retract a command which he had before given.

I have written--that is, my meaning in the letter I wrote was "not to
keep company," &c.

a brother--contrasted with a "fornicator . . . of the world" ([Co1
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#010)). There is less danger in
associating with open worldlings than with carnal professors. Here, as
in [Eph 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#003), [Eph
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#005), "covetousness" is joined with
"fornication": the common fount of both being "the fierce and ever
fiercer longing of the creature, which has turned from God, to fill
itself with the inferior objects of sense" \[TRENCH, Greek Synonyms of
the New Testament\]. Hence "idolatry" is associated with them: and the
covetous man is termed an "idolater" ([Num
25:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#001)). The Corinthians did not fall
into open idolatry, but ate things offered to idols, so making a
compromise with the heathen; just as they connived at fornication. Thus
this verse prepares for the precepts in [Co1
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#004), &c. Compare the similar case of
fornication, combined with a similar idolatrous compromise, after the
pattern of Israel with the Midianites ([Rev
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#014)).

no not to eat--not to sit at the same table with such; whether at the
love-feasts (agapÃ&brvbr;) or in private intercourse, much more at the
Lord's table: at the last, too often now the guests "are not as children
in one family, but like a heterogeneous crowd of strangers in an inn"
\[BENGEL\] (compare [Gal 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#012); [Jo2
1:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#010)).

[1 Corinthians 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co1 5:12</span></span>

what have I to do--You might have easily understood that my concern is
not with unbelievers outside the Church, but that I referred to those
within it.

also--Implying, Those within give me enough to do without those outside.

do not ye, &c.--Ye judge your fellow citizens, not strangers: much more
should I \[BENGEL\]. Rather, Is it not your duty to judge them that are
within? God shall judge them that are without: do you look at home
\[GROTIUS\]. God is the Judge of the salvation of the heathen, not we
([Rom 2:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#012)). Paul here gives an
anticipatory censure of their going to law with saints before heathen
tribunals, instead of judging such causes among themselves within.

[1 Corinthians 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co1 5:13</span></span>

put away from among yourselves that wicked--Sentence of excommunication
in language taken from [Deu 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#007).
