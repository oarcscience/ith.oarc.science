### [Psalms Chapter 115](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#001)

[Psalms 115:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 115:1</span></span>

The Psalmist prays that God would vindicate His glory, which is
contrasted with the vanity of idols, while the folly of their
worshippers is contrasted with the trust of God's people, who are
encouraged to its exercise and to unite in the praise which it
occasions. (Psa. 115:1-18)

The vindication of God's mercy and faithfulness ([Psa
25:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#010); [Psa
36:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#006)) is the "glory" of His "name,"
which is desired to be illustrated in the deliverance of His people, as
the implied mode of its manifestation. In view of the taunts of the
heathen, faith in His dominion as enthroned in the heaven ([Psa
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#004); [Psa
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#004)) is avowed.

[Psalms 115:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 115:2</span></span>

Where is now, &c.--"now" is "not a particle of time, but of entreaty,"
as in our forms of speech, "Come now," "See now," &c.

[Psalms 115:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 115:4</span></span>

(Compare [Isa 40:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#018); [Isa
44:9-20](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#009)).

[Psalms 115:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 115:7</span></span>

speak . . . throat--literally, "mutter," not even utter articulate
sounds.

[Psalms 115:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 115:8</span></span>

every one that trusteth--they who trust, whether makers or not.

[Psalms 115:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 115:9</span></span>

The repetitions imply earnestness.

[Psalms 115:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 115:14</span></span>

Opposed to the decrease pending and during the captivity.

[Psalms 115:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 115:15</span></span>

They were not only God's peculiar people, but as living inhabitants of
earth, assigned the work of His praise as monuments of divine power,
wisdom, and goodness.

[Psalms 115:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 115:18</span></span>

Hence let us fulfil the purpose of our creation, and evermore show forth
His praise.
