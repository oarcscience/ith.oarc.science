### [Genesis Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#001)

[Genesis 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 10:1</span></span>

GENEALOGIES. (Gen. 10:1-32)

sons of Noah--The historian has not arranged this catalogue according to
seniority of birth; for the account begins with the descendants of
Japheth, and the line of Ham is given before that of Shem though he is
expressly said to be the youngest or younger son of Noah; and Shem was
the elder brother of Japheth ([Gen
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#021)), the true rendering of that
passage.

generations, &c.--the narrative of the settlement of nations existing in
the time of Moses, perhaps only the principal ones; for though the list
comprises the sons of Shem, Ham, and Japheth, all their descendants are
not enumerated. Those descendants, with one or two exceptions, are
described by names indicative of tribes and nations and ending in the
Hebrew im, or the English "-ite."

[Genesis 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 10:5</span></span>

the isles of the Gentiles--a phrase by which the Hebrews described all
countries which were accessible by sea ([Isa
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#011); [Isa
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#006); [Jer
25:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#022)). Such in relation to them were
the countries of Europe, the peninsula of Lesser Asia, and the region
lying on the east of the Euxine. Accordingly, it was in these quarters
the early descendants of Japheth had their settlements.

[Genesis 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gen 10:6</span></span>

sons of Ham--emigrated southward, and their settlements were: Cush in
Arabia, Canaan in the country known by his name, and Mizraim in Egypt,
Upper and Lower. It is generally thought that his father accompanied him
and personally superintended the formation of the settlement, whence
Egypt was called "the land of Ham" \[[Psa
105:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#023), [Psa
105:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#027); [Psa
106:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#022)\].

[Genesis 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 10:8</span></span>

Nimrod--mentioned as eclipsing all his family in renown. He early
distinguished himself by his daring and successful prowess in hunting
wild beasts. By those useful services he earned a title to public
gratitude; and, having established a permanent ascendancy over the
people, he founded the first kingdom in the world \[[Gen
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#010)\].

[Genesis 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gen 10:10</span></span>

the beginning of his kingdom--This kingdom, of course, though then
considered great, would be comparatively limited in extent, and the
towns but small forts.

[Genesis 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gen 10:11</span></span>

Out of that land went forth Asshur--or, as the Margin has it, "He
\[Nimrod\] at the head of his army went forth into Assyria," that is, he
pushed his conquests into that country.

and builded Nineveh--opposite the town of Mosul, on the Tigris, and the
other towns near it. This raid into Assyria was an invasion of the
territories of Shem, and hence the name "Nimrod," signifying "rebel," is
supposed to have been conferred on him from his daring revolt against
the divine distribution.

[Genesis 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">gen 10:21</span></span>

Unto Shem--The historian introduces him with marked distinction as "the
father of Eber," the ancestor of the Hebrews.

[Genesis 10:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">gen 10:23</span></span>

Aram--In the general division of the earth, the countries of Armenia,
Mesopotamia, and Syria, fell to his descendants.

[Genesis 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">gen 10:24</span></span>

Arphaxad--The settlement of his posterity was in the extensive valley of
Shinar, on the Tigris, towards the southern extremity of Mesopotamia,
including the country of Eden and the region on the east side of the
river.

[Genesis 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">gen 10:25</span></span>

Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided--After the flood ([Gen
11:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#010)) the descendants of Noah
settled at pleasure and enjoyed the produce of the undivided soil. But
according to divine instruction, made probably through Eber, who seems
to have been distinguished for piety or a prophetic character, the earth
was divided and his son's name, "Peleg," was given in memory of that
event (see [Deu 32:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#008); [Act
17:26](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#026)).

[Genesis 10:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">gen 10:32</span></span>

These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in
their nations, &c.--This division was made in the most orderly manner;
and the inspired historian evidently intimates that the sons of Noah
were ranged according to their nations, and every nation ranked by its
families, so that every nation had its assigned territory, and in every
nation the tribes, and in every tribe the families, were located by
themselves.
