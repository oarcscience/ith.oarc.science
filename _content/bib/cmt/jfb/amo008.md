### [Amos Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#001)

[Amos 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">amo 8:1</span></span>

VISION OF A BASKET OF SUMMER FRUIT SYMBOLICAL OF ISRAEL'S END. RESUMING
THE SERIES OF SYMBOLS INTERRUPTED BY AMAZIAH, AMOS ADDS A FOURTH. THE
AVARICE OF THE OPPRESSORS OF THE POOR: THE OVERTHROW OF THE NATION: THE
WISH FOR THE MEANS OF RELIGIOUS COUNSEL, WHEN THERE SHALL BE A FAMINE OF
THE WORD. ([Amo 8:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#001))

summer fruit--Hebrew, kitz. In [Amo
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#002) "end" is in Hebrew, keetz. The
similarity of sounds implies that, as the summer is the end of the year
and the time of the ripeness of fruits, so Israel is ripe for her last
punishment, ending her national existence. As the fruit is plucked when
ripe from the tree, so Israel from her land.

[Amos 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">amo 8:2</span></span>

end-- ([Eze 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#002), [Eze
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#006)).

[Amos 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">amo 8:3</span></span>

songs of . . . temple-- ([Amo 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#023)).
The joyous hymns in the temple of Judah (or rather, in the Beth-el
"royal temple," [Amo 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#013); for the
allusion is to Israel, not Judah, throughout this chapter) shall be
changed into "howlings." GROTIUS translates, "palace"; compare [Amo
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#005), as to the songs there. But [Amo
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#023), and [Amo
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#013), favor English Version.

they shall cast them forth with silence--not as the Margin, "be silent."
It is an adverb, "silently." There shall be such great slaughter as even
to prevent the bodies being buried \[CALVIN\]. There shall be none of
the usual professional mourners ([Amo
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#016)), but the bodies will be cast out
in silence. Perhaps also is meant that terror, both of God (compare [Amo
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#010)) and of the foe, shall close
their lips.

[Amos 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">amo 8:4</span></span>

Hear--The nobles needed to be urged thus, as hating to hear reproof.

swallow up the needy--or, "gape after," that is, pant for their goods;
so the word is used, [Job 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#002), Margin.

to make the poor . . . to fail--"that they (themselves) may be placed
alone in the midst of the earth" ([Isa
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#008)).

[Amos 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">amo 8:5</span></span>

So greedy are they of unjust gain that they cannot spare a single day,
however sacred, from pursuing it. They are strangers to God and enemies
to themselves, who love market days better than sabbath days; and they
who have lost piety will not long keep honesty. The new-2moons ([Num
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#010)) and sabbaths were to be kept
without working or trading ([Neh
10:31](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#031)).

set forth wheat--literally, "open out" stores of wheat for sale.

ephah--containing three seahs, or above three pecks.

making . . . small--making it below the just weight to purchasers.

shekel great--taking from purchasers a greater weight of money than was
due. Shekels used to be weighed out in payments ([Gen
23:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#016)). Thus they committed a double
fraud against the law ([Deu 25:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#013)).

[Amos 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">amo 8:6</span></span>

buy . . . poor for silver . . . pair of shoes--that is, that we may
compel the needy for money, or any other thing of however little worth,
to sell themselves to us as bondmen, in defiance of [Lev
25:39](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#039); the very thing which brings
down God's judgment ([Amo 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#006)).

sell the refuse of . . . wheat--which contains no nutriment, but which
the poor eat at a low price, being unable to pay for flour.

[Amos 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">amo 8:7</span></span>

Lord hath sworn by the excellency of Jacob--that is by Himself, in whom
Jacob's seed glory \[MAURER\]. Rather, by the spiritual privileges of
Israel, the adoption as His peculiar people \[CALVIN\], the temple, and
its Shekinah symbol of His presence. Compare [Amo
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#008), where it means Jehovah's temple
(compare [Amo 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#002)).

never forget--not pass by without punishing ([Amo
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#002); [Hos
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#013); [Hos
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#009)).

[Amos 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">amo 8:8</span></span>

the land . . . rise up wholly as a flood--The land will, as it were, be
wholly turned into a flooding river (a flood being the image of
overwhelming calamity, [Dan 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026)).

cast out and drowned, &c.--swept away and overwhelmed, as the land
adjoining the Nile is by it, when flooding ([Amo
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#005)). The Nile rises generally twenty
feet. The waters then "cast out" mire and dirt ([Isa
57:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#020)).

[Amos 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">amo 8:9</span></span>

"Darkness" made to rise "at noon" is the emblem of great calamities
([Jer 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#009); [Eze
32:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#007)).

[Amos 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">amo 8:10</span></span>

baldness--a sign of mourning ([Isa
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#002); [Jer
48:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#037); [Eze
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#018)).

I will make it as . . . mourning of an only son--"it," that is, "the
earth" ([Amo 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#009)). I will reduce the
land to such a state that there shall be the same occasion for mourning
as when parents mourn for an only son ([Jer
6:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#026); [Zac
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010)).

[Amos 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">amo 8:11</span></span>

famine of . . . hearing the words of the Lord--a just retribution on
those who now will not hear the Lord's prophets, nay even try to drive
them away, as Amaziah did ([Amo 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#012));
they shall look in vain, in their distress, for divine counsel, such as
the prophets now offer ([Eze 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#026);
[Mic 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#007)). Compare as to the Jews'
rejection of Messiah, and their consequent rejection by Him ([Mat
21:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#043)); and their desire for Messiah
too late ([Luk 17:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#022); [Joh
7:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#034); [Joh
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#021)). So, the prodigal when he had
sojourned awhile in the "far-off country, began to be in want" in the
"mighty famine" which arose ([Luk
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#014); compare [Sa1
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#001); [Sa1
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#002)). It is remarkable that the Jews'
religion is almost the only one that could be abolished against the will
of the people themselves, on account of its being dependent on a
particular place, namely, the temple. When that was destroyed, the
Mosaic ritual, which could not exist without it, necessarily ceased.
Providence designed it, that, as the law gave way to the Gospel, so all
men should perceive it was so, in spite of the Jews' obstinate rejection
of the Gospel.

[Amos 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">amo 8:12</span></span>

they shall wander from sea to sea--that is, from the Dead Sea to the
Mediterranean, from east to west.

from . . . north . . . to . . . east--where we might expect "from north
to south." But so alienated was Israel from Judah, that no Israelite
even then would think of repairing southward, that is, to Jerusalem for
religious information. The circuit is traced as in [Num
34:3](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#003), &c., except that the south is
omitted. Their "seeking the word of the Lord" would not be from a
sincere desire to obey God, but under the pressure of punishment.

[Amos 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">amo 8:13</span></span>

faint for thirst--namely, thirst for hearing the words of the Lord,
being destitute of all other comfort. If even the young and strong
faint, how much more the infirm ([Isa
40:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#030))!

[Amos 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">amo 8:14</span></span>

swear by the sin of Samaria--namely, the calves ([Deu
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#021); [Hos
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#015)). "Swear by" means to worship
([Psa 63:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#011)).

The manner--that is, as "the way" is used ([Psa
139:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#024); [Act
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#002)), the mode of worship.

Thy god, O Dan--the other golden calf at Dan ([Kg1
22:26-30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#026)).

liveth . . . liveth--rather, "May thy god . . . live . . . may the
manner . . . live." Or, "As (surely as) thy god, O Dan, liveth." This is
their formula when they swear; not "May Jehovah live!" or, "As Jehovah
liveth!"
