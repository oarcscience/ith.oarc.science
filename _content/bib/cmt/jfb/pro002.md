[Proverbs 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 2:1</span></span>

Men are invited to seek wisdom because it teaches those principles by
which they may obtain God's guidance and avoid the society and influence
of the wicked, whose pernicious courses are described. (Pro. 2:1-22)

Diligence in hearing and praying for instruction must be used to secure
the great principle of godliness, the fear of God.

hide . . . with thee--lay up in store (compare [Pro
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#001)).

[Proverbs 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 2:2</span></span>

Listen attentively and reflect seriously ([Pro
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#024); [Psa

find--obtain.

[Proverbs 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 2:6</span></span>

For--God is ready ([Jam 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#005); [Jam
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#008)).

out of his mouth--by revelation from Him.

[Proverbs 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 2:7</span></span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 2:10</span></span>

Idea of [Pro 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#009), amplified; on terms,

delight. They love most the worst things.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 2:15</span></span>

30:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#009)).
