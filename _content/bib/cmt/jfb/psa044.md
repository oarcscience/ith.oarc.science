### [Psalms Chapter 44](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#001)

[Psalms 44:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 44:1</span></span>

In a time of great national distress, probably in David's reign, the
Psalmist recounts God's gracious dealings in former times, and the
confidence they had learned to repose in Him. After a vivid picture of
their calamities, he humbly expostulates against God's apparent
forgetfulness, reminding Him of their faithfulness and mourning their
heavy sorrows. (Psa. 44:1-26)

This period is that of the settlement of Canaan ([Jos
24:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#012); [Jdg
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#003)).

have told--or, "related" (compare [Exo
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#002)).

[Psalms 44:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 44:2</span></span>

plantedst them--that is, "our fathers," who are also, from the parallel
construction of the last clause, to be regarded as the object of "cast
them out," which means--literally, "send" them out, or, "extend them."
Heathen and people denote the nations who were driven out to make room
for the Israelites.

[Psalms 44:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 44:4</span></span>

Thou art my King--literally, "he who is my King," sustaining the same
covenant relation as to the "fathers."

[Psalms 44:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 44:5</span></span>

The figure drawn from the habits of the ox.

[Psalms 44:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 44:6</span></span>

God is not only our sole help, but only worthy of praise.

[Psalms 44:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 44:7</span></span>

put . . . to shame--(compare [Psa
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#010)), disgraced.

[Psalms 44:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 44:8</span></span>

thy name--as in [Psa 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#011).

[Psalms 44:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 44:9</span></span>

But--contrasting, cast off as abhorrent ([Psa
43:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#002)).

goest not forth--literally, "will not go" ([Sa2
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#023)). In several consecutive verses
the leading verb is future, and the following one past (in Hebrew), thus
denoting the causes and effects. Thus ([Psa
44:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#010)), when defeated, spoiling
follows; when delivered as sheep, dispersion follows, &c.

[Psalms 44:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 44:11</span></span>

The Babylonian captivity not necessarily meant. There were others
(compare [Kg1 8:46](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#046)).

[Psalms 44:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 44:13</span></span>

(Compare [Deu 28:37](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#037); [Psa
79:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#004)).

[Psalms 44:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 44:15</span></span>

shame of . . . face--blushes in disgrace.

[Psalms 44:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 44:16</span></span>

Its cause, the taunts and presence of malignant enemies ([Psa
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#002)).

[Psalms 44:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 44:17</span></span>

They had not apostatized totally--were still God's people.

[Psalms 44:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 44:18</span></span>

declined--turned aside from God's law.

[Psalms 44:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 44:19</span></span>

sore broken--crushed.

place of dragons--desolate, barren, rocky wilderness ([Psa
63:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#010); [Isa
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#022)),

shadow of death--(Compare [Psa 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#004)).

[Psalms 44:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 44:20</span></span>

A solemn appeal to God to witness their constancy.

stretched out . . . hands--gesture of worship ([Exo
9:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#029); [Psa
88:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#009)).

[Psalms 44:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">psa 44:22</span></span>

Their protracted sufferings as God's people attests the constancy. Paul
([Rom 8:36](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#036)) uses this to describe
Christian steadfastness in persecution.

[Psalms 44:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">psa 44:23</span></span>

This style of addressing God, as indifferent, is frequent ([Psa
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#007); [Psa
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#019); [Psa
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#001), &c.). However low their
condition, God is appealed to, on the ground, and for the honor, of His
mercy.
