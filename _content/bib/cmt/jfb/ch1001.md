### [1 Chronicles Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001)

[1 Chronicles 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 1:1</span></span>

ADAM'S LINE TO NOAH. (1Ch. 1:1-23)

Adam, &c.--"Begat" must be understood. Only that one member of the
family is mentioned, who came in the direct order of succession.

[1 Chronicles 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch1 1:4</span></span>

Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth--The three sons of this patriarch are
enumerated, partly because they were the founders of the new world, and
partly because the fulfilment of Noah's prophecy ([Gen
9:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#025)) could not otherwise appear to
have been verified.

[1 Chronicles 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch1 1:12</span></span>

Casluhim (of whom came the Philistines), and Caphtorim--a better
rendering is, "and Casluhim, of whom came the Philistim and Caphtorim."
They were brethren, the sons of Casluhim, and at first dwelt together,
whence their names are used interchangeably. The Caphtorim are described
as inhabiting Azzah, or Gaza, the seat of the Philistines.

[1 Chronicles 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch1 1:14</span></span>

the Jebusite, &c.--At [Ch1 1:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#014) the
names are not those of individuals, but of people who all sprang from
Canaan; and as several of them became extinct or were amalgamated with
their brethren, their national appellations are given instead of the
personal names of their ancestors.

[1 Chronicles 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch1 1:17</span></span>

Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Meshech--or, "Mash"; these were the
children of Aram, and grandsons of Shem ([Gen
10:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#023)).

[1 Chronicles 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch1 1:18</span></span>

Arphaxad begat Shelah--Cainan, the father's name, is omitted here. (See
[Luk 3:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#036)).

[1 Chronicles 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch1 1:19</span></span>

Peleg--(See on [Gen 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#025)).

[1 Chronicles 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch1 1:22</span></span>

Ebal--or, "Obal" ([Gen 10:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#028)).

[1 Chronicles 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ch1 1:24</span></span>

SHEM'S LINE TO ABRAHAM. ([Ch1 1:24-28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#024))

Shem, &c.--This comprises a list of ten, inclusive of Abraham.

[1 Chronicles 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">ch1 1:29</span></span>

SONS OF ISHMAEL. ([Ch1 1:29-31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#029))

These are their generations--the heads of his twelve tribes. The great
northern desert of Arabia, including the entire neck, was colonized by
these tribes; and if we can recover, in the modern geography of this
part of the country, Arab tribes bearing the names of those patriarchs,
that is, names corresponding with those preserved in the original
catalogue of Scripture, we obtain at once so many evidences, not of mere
similarity, but of absolute identification \[FORSTER\].

Nebaioth--gave rise to the NabathÃ&brvbr;ans of the classic, and the
Beni Nabat of Oriental writers.

Kedar--the Arab tribe, El Khedeyre, on the coast of Hedgar.

Abdeel--Abdilla, the name of a tribe in Yemen.

[1 Chronicles 1:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">ch1 1:30</span></span>

Dumah--Dumah and Tema, the great Arab tribes of Beni Teman. Thus this
writer \[Historical Geography of Arabia\] traces the names of all the
heads of the twelve tribes of Ishmael as perpetuated in the clans or
tribes of the Arabs in the present day.

[1 Chronicles 1:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">ch1 1:32</span></span>

SONS OF KETURAH. ([Ch1 1:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#032))

sons of Keturah--These became founders of nomadic tribes in the north of
Arabia and Syria, as Midian of the Midianites ([Gen
36:35](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#035); [Jdg
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#002)).

and Shuah--from whom Bildad sprang ([Job
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#011)).

[1 Chronicles 1:36](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">ch1 1:36</span></span>

POSTERITY OF ABRAHAM BY ESAU. ([Ch1
1:34-42](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#034))

sons of Eliphaz--the tribe Adites, in the center country of the
Saracens, so called from his mother, Adah ([Gen
36:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#010)).

Teman--gave rise to the land of Teman, near the head of the Red Sea.

Omar--the tribe Beni-Amma, settled at the northern point of Djebel Shera
(Mount Seir).

Zephi--the tribe Dzaf.

Gatam--Katam, inhabited by the tribe Al Saruat, or "people of Sarah."

Kenaz--the tribe Aenezes, a tribe whose settlement lies in the
neighborhood of Syria.

Amalek--the Beni Malak of Zohran, and the Beni Maledj of the Shat el
Arab.

[1 Chronicles 1:37](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">ch1 1:37</span></span>

Reuel--a powerful branch of the great Aeneze tribe, the Rowalla Arabs.

Shammah--the great tribe Beni Shammar. In the same way, the names of the
other kings and dukes are traced in the modern tribes of Arabia. But it
is unnecessary to mention any more of these obscure nomads, except to
notice that Jobab ([Ch1 1:44](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#044)), one of
the kings of Edom, is considered to be Job, and that his seat was in the
royal city of Dinahab ([Gen 36:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#032);
[Ch1 1:43](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#043)), identified with O'Daeb, a
well-known town in the center of Al Dahna, a great northern desert in
the direction of Chaldea and the Euphrates \[FORSTER\].
