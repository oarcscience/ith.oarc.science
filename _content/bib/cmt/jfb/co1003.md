### [1 Corinthians Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#001)

[1 Corinthians 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co1 3:1</span></span>

PAUL COULD NOT SPEAK TO THEM OF DEEP SPIRITUAL TRUTHS, AS THEY WERE
CARNAL, CONTENDING FOR THEIR SEVERAL TEACHERS; THESE ARE NOTHING BUT
WORKERS FOR GOD, TO WHOM THEY MUST GIVE ACCOUNT IN THE DAY OF FIERY
JUDGMENT. THE HEARERS ARE GOD'S TEMPLE, WHICH THEY MUST NOT DEFILE BY
CONTENTIONS FOR TEACHERS, WHO, AS WELL AS ALL THINGS, ARE THEIRS, BEING
CHRIST'S. (1Co. 3:1-23)

And I--that is, as the natural (animal) man cannot receive, so I also
could not speak unto you the deep things of God, as I would to the
spiritual; but I was compelled to speak to you as I would to MEN OF
FLESH. The oldest manuscripts read this for "carnal." The former
(literally, "fleshy") implies men wholly of flesh, or natural. Carnal,
or fleshly, implies not they were wholly natural or unregenerate ([Co1
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#014)), but that they had much of a
carnal tendency; for example their divisions. Paul had to speak to them
as he would to men wholly natural, inasmuch as they are still carnal
([Co1 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#003)) in many respects,
notwithstanding their conversion ([Co1
1:4-9](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#004)).

babes--contrasted with the perfect (fully matured) in Christ ([Col
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#028); compare [Heb
5:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#013)). This implies they were not
men wholly of flesh, though carnal in tendencies. They had life in
Christ, but it was weak. He blames them for being still in a degree (not
altogether, compare [Co1 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#005), [Co1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#007); therefore he says as) babes in
Christ, when by this time they ought to have "come unto a perfect man,
unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ" ([Eph
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#013)). In [Rom
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#014), also the oldest manuscripts
read, "I am a man of flesh."

[1 Corinthians 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co1 3:2</span></span>

([Heb 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#012)).

milk--the elementary "principles of the doctrine of Christ."

[1 Corinthians 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co1 3:3</span></span>

envying--jealousy, rivalry. As this refers to their feelings, "strife"
refers to their words, and "divisions" to their actions \[BENGEL\].
There is a gradation, or ascending climax: envying had produced strife,
and strife divisions (factious parties) \[GROTIUS\]. His language
becomes severer now as He proceeds; in [Co1
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#011) he had only said "contentions,"
he now multiplies the words (compare the stronger term, [Co1
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#006), than in [Co1
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#021)).

carnal--For "strife" is a "work of the flesh" ([Gal
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#020)). The "flesh" includes all
feelings that aim not at the glory of God, and the good of our neighbor,
but at gratifying self.

walk as men--as unregenerate men (compare [Mat
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#023)). "After the flesh, not after
the Spirit" of God, as becomes you as regenerate by the Spirit ([Rom
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#004); [Gal
5:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#025)).

[1 Corinthians 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co1 3:4</span></span>

([Co1 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#012)).

are ye not carnal--The oldest manuscripts read, "Are ye not men?" that
is, "walking as men" unregenerate ([Co1
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#003)).

[1 Corinthians 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co1 3:5</span></span>

Who then--Seeing then that ye severally strive so for your favorite
teachers, "Who is (of what intrinsic power and dignity) Paul?" If so
great an apostle reasons so of himself, how much more does humility,
rather than self-seeking, become ordinary ministers!

Paul . . . Apollos--The oldest manuscripts read in the reverse order,
"Apollos," &c. Paul." He puts Apollos before himself in humility.

but ministers, &c.--The oldest manuscripts have no "but." "Who is
Apollos . . . Paul? (mere) ministers (a lowly word appropriate here,
servants), by whom (not "in whom"; by whose ministrations) ye believed."

as . . . Lord gave to every man--that is, to the several hearers, for it
was GOD that "gave the increase" ([Co1
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#006)).

[1 Corinthians 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co1 3:6</span></span>

I . . . planted, Apollos watered-- ([Act
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#001); [Act
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#001)). Apollos at his own desire ([Act
18:27](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#027)) was sent by the brethren to
Corinth, and there followed up the work which Paul had begun.

God gave the increase--that is, the growth ([Co1
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#010); [Act
18:27](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#027)). "Believed through grace."
Though ministers are nothing, and God all in all, yet God works by
instruments, and promises the Holy Spirit in the faithful use of means.
This is the dispensation of the Spirit, and ours is the ministry of the
Spirit.

[1 Corinthians 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co1 3:7</span></span>

neither is he that . . . anything . . . but God--namely, is all in all.
"God" is emphatically last in the Greek, "He that giveth the increase
(namely), GOD." Here follows a parenthesis, [Co1
3:8-21](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#008), where "Let no man glory in
men" stands in antithetic contrast to "God" here.

[1 Corinthians 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co1 3:8</span></span>

one--essentially in their aim they are one, engaged in one and the same
ministry; therefore they ought not to be made by you the occasion of
forming separate parties.

and every man--rather "but every man." Though in their service or
ministry, they are essentially "one," yet every minister is separately
responsible in "his own" work, and "shall receive his own (emphatically
repeated) reward, according to his own labor." The reward is something
over and above personal salvation ([Co1
3:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#014); [Jo2
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#008)). He shall be rewarded according
to, not his success or the amount of work done, but "according to his
own labor." It shall be said to him, "Well done, thou good and (not
successful, but) faithful servant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord"
([Mat 25:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#023)).

[1 Corinthians 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co1 3:9</span></span>

Translate, as the Greek collocation of words, and the emphasis on "God"
thrice repeated, requires, "For (in proof that "each shall receive
reward according to his own labor," namely, from God) it is of God that
we are the fellow workers (laboring with, but under, and belonging to
Him as His servants, [Co2 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#020); [Co2
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#001); compare [Act
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#004); see on [Th1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#002)) of God that ye are the field (or
tillage), of God that ye are the building" \[ALFORD\]. "Building" is a
new image introduced here, as suited better than that of husbandry, to
set forth the different kinds of teaching and their results, which he is
now about to discuss. "To edify" or "build up" the Church of Christ is
similarly used ([Eph 2:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#021); [Eph
4:29](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#029)).

[1 Corinthians 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co1 3:10</span></span>

grace . . . given unto me--Paul puts this first, to guard against
seeming to want humility, in pronouncing himself "a WISE master
builder," in the clause following \[CHRYSOSTOM\]. The "grace" is that
"given" to him in common with all Christians ([Co1
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#005)), only proportioned to the work
which God had for him to do \[ALFORD\].

wise--that is, skilful. His skill is shown in his laying a foundation.
The unskilful builder lays none ([Luk
6:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#049)). Christ is the foundation ([Co1
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#011)).

another--who ever comes after me. He does not name Apollos; for he
speaks generally of all successors, whoever they be. His warning, "Let
every man (every teacher) take heed how," &c., refers to other
successors rather than Apollos, who doubtless did not, as they, build
wood, hay, &c., on the foundation (compare [Co1
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#015)). "I have done my part, let them
who follow me see (so the Greek for 'take heed') to theirs" \[BENGEL\].

how--with what material \[ALFORD\]. How far wisely, and in builder-like
style ([Pe1 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#011)).

buildeth thereupon--Here the building or superstructure raised on Christ
the "foundation," laid by Paul ([Co1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#002)) is not, as in [Eph
2:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#020), the Christian Church made up
of believers, the "lively stones" ([Pe1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005)), but the doctrinal and practical
teaching which the teachers who succeeded Paul, superadded to his first
teaching; not that they taught what was false, but their teaching was
subtle and speculative reasoning, rather than solid and simple truth.

[1 Corinthians 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co1 3:11</span></span>

([Isa 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#016); [Act
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#012); [Eph
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#020)).

For--my warning ("take heed," &c. [Co1
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#010)) is as to the superstructure
("buildeth thereupon"), not as to the foundation: "For other foundation
can no man lay, than that which has (already) been laid (by God) Jesus
Christ," the person, not the mere abstract doctrine about Him, though
the latter also is included; Jesus, GOD-SAVIOUR; Christ, MESSIAH or
ANOINTED.

can--A man can not lay any other, since the only one recognized by God
has been already laid.

[1 Corinthians 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co1 3:12</span></span>

Now--rather, "But." The image is that of a building on a solid
foundation, and partly composed of durable and precious, partly of
perishable, materials. The "gold, silver, precious stones," which all
can withstand fire ([Rev 21:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#018)),
are teachings that will stand the fiery test of judgment; "wood, hay,
stubble," are those which cannot stand it; not positive heresy, for that
would destroy the foundation, but teaching mixed up with human
philosophy and Judaism, curious rather than useful. Besides the
teachings, the superstructure represents also the persons cemented to
the Church by them, the reality of whose conversion, through the
teachers' instrumentality, will be tested at the last day. Where there
is the least grain of real gold of faith, it shall never be lost ([Pe1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#007); compare [Co1
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#012)). On the other hand, the lightest
straw feeds the fire \[BENGEL\] ([Mat
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#019)).

[1 Corinthians 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co1 3:13</span></span>

Every man's work--each teacher's superstructure on the foundation.

the day--of the Lord ([Co1 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#008); [Heb
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#025); [Th1
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#004)). The article is emphatic, "The
day," that is, the great day of days, the long expected day.

declare it--old English for "make it clear" ([Co1
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#004)).

it shall be revealed by fire--it, that is, "every man's work." Rather,
"He," the Lord, whose day it is ([Th2
1:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#007)). Translate literally, "is being
revealed (the present in the Greek implies the certainty and nearness of
the event, [Rev 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#010), [Rev
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#020)) in fire" ([Mal
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#003); [Mal
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#001)). The fire (probably figurative
here, as the gold, hay, &c.) is not purgatory (as Rome teaches, that is,
purificatory and punitive), but probatory, not restricted to those dying
in "venial sin"; the supposed intermediate class between those entering
heaven at once, and those dying in mortal sin who go to hell, but
universal, testing the godly and ungodly alike ([Co2
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#010); compare [Mar
9:49](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#049)). This fire is not till the last
day, the supposed fire of purgatory begins at death. The fire of Paul is
to try the works, the fire of purgatory the persons, of men. Paul's fire
causes "loss" to the sufferers; Rome's purgatory, great gain, namely,
heaven at last to those purged by it, if only it were true. Thus this
passage, quoted by Rome for, is altogether against, purgatory. "It was
not this doctrine that gave rise to prayers for the dead; but the
practice of praying for the dead \[which crept in from the affectionate
but mistaken solicitude of survivors\] gave rise to the doctrine"
\[WHATELY\].

[1 Corinthians 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co1 3:14</span></span>

abide--abide the testing fire ([Mat
3:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#011)).

which he hath built thereupon--which he built on the foundation.

reward--wages, as a builder, that is, teacher. His converts built on
Christ the foundation, through his faithful teaching, shall be his
"crown of rejoicing" ([Co2 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#014); [Phi
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#016); [Th1
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#019)).

[1 Corinthians 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co1 3:15</span></span>

If . . . be burnt--if any teacher's work consist of such materials as
the fire will destroy \[ALFORD\].

suffer loss--that is, forfeit the special "reward"; not that he shall
lose salvation (which is altogether a free gift, not a "reward" or
wages), for he remains still on the foundation ([Co1
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#012); [Jo2
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#006)).

saved; yet so as by fire--rather, "so as through fire" ([Zac
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#002); [Amo
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#011); [Jde
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#023)). "Saved, yet not without fire"
([Rom 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#027)) \[BENGEL\]. As a builder
whose building, not the foundation, is consumed by fire, escapes, but
with the loss of his work \[ALFORD\]; as the shipwrecked merchant,
though he has lost his merchandise, is saved, though having to pass
through the waves \[BENGEL\]; [Mal
3:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001); [Mal
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#001), give the key to explain the
imagery. The "Lord suddenly coming to His temple" in flaming "fire," all
the parts of the building which will not stand that fire will be
consumed; the builders will escape with personal salvation, but with the
loss of their work, through the midst of the conflagration \[ALFORD\].
Again, a distinction is recognized between minor and fundamental
doctrines (if we regard the superstructure as representing the doctrines
superadded to the elementary essentials); a man may err as to the
former, and yet be saved, but not so as to the latter (compare [Phi
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#015)).

[1 Corinthians 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co1 3:16</span></span>

Know ye not--It is no new thing I tell you, in calling you "God's
building"; ye know and ought to remember, ye are the noblest kind of
building, "the temple of God."

ye--all Christians form together one vast temple. The expression is not,
"ye are temples," but "ye are the temple" collectively, and "lively
stones" ([Pe1 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005)) individually.

God . . . Spirit--God's indwelling, and that of the Holy Spirit, are
one; therefore the Holy Spirit is God. No literal "temple" is recognized
by the New Testament in the Christian Church. The only one is the
spiritual temple, the whole body of believing worshippers in which the
Holy Spirit dwells ([Co1 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#019); [Joh
4:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#023)). The synagogue, not the
temple, was the model of the Christian house of worship. The temple was
the house of sacrifice, rather than of prayer. Prayers in the temple
were silent and individual ([Luk 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#010);
[Luk 18:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#010)), not joint and public,
nor with reading of Scripture, as in the synagogue. The temple, as the
name means (from a Greek root "to dwell"), was the earthly
dwelling-place of God, where alone He put His name. The synagogue (as
the name means an assembly) was the place for assembling men. God now
too has His earthly temple, not one of wood and stone, but the
congregation of believers, the "living stones" on the "spiritual house."
Believers are all spiritual priests in it. Jesus Christ, our High
Priest, has the only literal priesthood ([Mal
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#011); [Mat
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#020); [Pe1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005)) \[VITRINGA\].

[1 Corinthians 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">co1 3:17</span></span>

If any . . . defile . . . destroy--rather as the Greek verb is the same
in both cases, "destroy . . . destroy." God repays in kind by a
righteous retaliation. The destroyer shall himself be destroyed. As
temporal death was the penalty of marring the material temple ([Lev
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#002); [Dan
5:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#002), [Dan
5:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#030)), so eternal death is the penalty
of marring the spiritual temple--the Church. The destroyers here ([Co1
3:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#016)), are distinct from the unwise
or unskilful builders ([Co1 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#012), [Co1
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#015)); the latter held fast the
"foundation" ([Co1 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#011)), and,
therefore, though they lose their work of superstructure and the special
reward, yet they are themselves saved; the destroyers, on the contrary,
assailed with false teaching the foundation, and so subvert the temple
itself, and shall therefore be destroyed. (See on [Co1
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#010)), \[ESTIUS and NEANDER\]. I think
Paul passes here from the teachers to all the members of the Church,
who, by profession, are "priests unto God" ([Exo
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#006); [Pe1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009); [Rev
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006)). As the Aaronic priests were
doomed to die if they violated the old temple ([Exo
28:43](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#043)), so any Christian who violates
the sanctity of the spiritual temple, shall perish eternally ([Heb
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#014); [Heb
10:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#026), [Heb
10:31](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#031)).

holy--inviolable ([Hab 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#020)).

which temple ye are--rather, "the which (that is, holy) are ye"
\[ALFORD\], and, therefore, want of holiness on the part of any of you
(or, as ESTIUS, "to tamper with the foundation in teaching you") is a
violation of the temple, which cannot be let to pass with impunity.
GROTIUS supports English Version.

[1 Corinthians 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">co1 3:18</span></span>

seemeth--that is, is, and is regarded by himself and others.

wise in this world--wise in mere worldly wisdom ([Co1
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#020)).

let him become a fool--by receiving the Gospel in its unworldly
simplicity, and so becoming a fool in the world's sight \[ALFORD\]. Let
him no longer think himself wise, but seek the true wisdom from God,
bringing his understanding into captivity to the obedience of faith
\[ESTIUS\].

with God--in the judgment of God.

it is written--in [Job 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#013). The
formula of quoting SCRIPTURE used here, establishes the canonicity of
Job.

He taketh . . . wise in . . . own craftiness--proving the "foolishness"
of the world's wisdom, since it is made by God the very snare to catch
those who think themselves so wise. Literally, "He who taketh . . . the
whole of the sentence not being quoted, but only the part which suited
Paul's purpose.

[1 Corinthians 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">co1 3:20</span></span>

Quotation from [Psa 94:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#011). There it is
of men; here it is "of the wise." Paul by inspiration states the class
of men whose "thoughts" (or rather, "reasonings," as suits the Greek and
the sense of the context) the Spirit designated in the Psalm, "vanity,"
namely, the "proud" ([Psa 94:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#002)) and
worldly-wise, whom God in [Psa 94:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#008)
calls "fools," though they "boast themselves" of their wisdom in pushing
their interests ([Psa 94:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#004)).

let no man glory in men--resuming the subject from [Co1
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#004); compare [Co1
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#012), [Co1
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#031), where the true object of
glorying is stated: "He that glorieth, let him glory in THE LORD." Also
[Co1 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#006), "That no one of you be
puffed up for one against another."

For all things--not only all men. For you to glory thus in men, is
lowering yourselves from your high position as heirs of all things. All
men (including your teachers) belong to Christ, and therefore to you, by
your union with Him; He makes them and all things work together for your
good ([Rom 8:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#028)). Ye are not for the
sake of them, but they for the sake of you ([Co2
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#005), [Co2
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#015)). They belong to you, not you to
them.

Enumeration of some of the "all things." The teachers, in whom they
gloried, he puts first ([Co1 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#012)). He
omits after "Cephas" or Christ (to whom exclusively some at Corinth,
[Co1 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#012), professed to belong); but,
instead, substitutes "ye are Christ's" ([Co1
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#023)).

world . . . life . . . death . . . things present . . . things to
come--Not only shall they not "separate you from the love of God in
Christ" ([Rom 8:38-39](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#038)), but they "all
are yours," that is, are for you ([Rom
8:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#028)), and belong to you, as they
belong to Christ your Head ([Heb 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002)).

things present--"things actually present" \[ALFORD\].

ye are Christ's--not Paul's, or Apollos,' or Cephas' ([Co1
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#003); [Mat
23:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#008)). "Neither be ye called
masters; for one is your Master, even Christ" ([Rom
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#008)). Not merely a particular section
of you, but ye all are Christ's ([Co1
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#012)).

Christ is God's-- ([Co1 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#003)). God is
the ultimate end of all, even of Christ, His co-equal Son ([Co1
15:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#028); [Phi
2:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006)).
