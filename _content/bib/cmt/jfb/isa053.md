### [Isaiah Chapter 53](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001)

[Isaiah 53:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 53:1</span></span>

MAN'S UNBELIEF: MESSIAH'S VICARIOUS SUFFERINGS, AND FINAL TRIUMPH FOR
MAN. ([Isa 53:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001))

report--literally, "the thing heard," referring to which sense Paul
says, "So, then, faith cometh by hearing" ([Rom
10:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#016)).

arm--power ([Isa 40:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#010)); exercised in
miracles and in saving men ([Rom 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#016);
[Co1 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#018)). The prophet, as if present
during Messiah's ministry on earth, is deeply moved to see how few
believed on Him ([Isa 49:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#004); [Mar
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#006); [Mar
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#019); [Act
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#015)). Two reasons are given why all
ought to have believed: (1) The "report" of the "ancient prophets." (2)
"The arm of Jehovah" exhibited in Messiah while on earth. In HORSLEY'S
view, this will be the penitent confession of the Jews, "How few of our
nation, in Messiah's days, believed in Him!"

[Isaiah 53:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 53:2</span></span>

tender plant--Messiah grew silently and insensibly, as a sucker from an
ancient stock, seemingly dead (namely, the house of David, then in a
decayed state) (see on [Isa 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001)).

shall grow . . . hath--rather, "grew up . . . had."

before him--before Jehovah. Though unknown to the world ([Joh
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#011)), Messiah was observed by God,
who ordered the most minute circumstances attending His growth.

root--that is, sprout from a root.

form--beautiful form: sorrow had marred His once beautiful form.

and when we shall see--rather, joined with the previous words, "Nor
comeliness (attractiveness) that we should look (with delight) on Him."

there is--rather, "was." The studied reticence of the New Testament as
to His form, stature, color, &c., was designed to prevent our dwelling
on the bodily, rather than on His moral beauty, holiness, love, &c.,
also a providential protest against the making and veneration of images
of Him. The letter of P. LENTULUS to the emperor Tiberius, describing
His person, is spurious; so also the story of His sending His portrait
to Abgar, king of Edessa; and the alleged impression of His countenance
on the handkerchief of Veronica. The former part of this verse refers to
His birth and childhood; the latter to His first public appearance
\[VITRINGA\].

[Isaiah 53:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 53:3</span></span>

rejected--"forsaken of men" \[GESENIUS\]. "Most abject of men."
Literally, "He who ceases from men," that is, is no longer regarded as a
man \[HENGSTENBERG\]. (See on [Isa
52:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#014); [Isa
49:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#007)).

man of sorrows--that is, whose distinguishing characteristic was
sorrows.

acquainted with--familiar by constant contact with.

grief--literally, "disease"; figuratively for all kinds of calamity
([Jer 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#014)); leprosy especially
represented this, being a direct judgment from God. It is remarkable
Jesus is not mentioned as having ever suffered under sickness.

and we hid . . . faces--rather, as one who causes men to hide their
faces from Him (in aversion) \[MAURER\]. Or, "He was as an hiding of the
face before it," that is, as a thing before which a man covers his face
in disgust \[HENGSTENBERG\]. Or, "as one before whom is the covering of
the face"; before whom one covers the face in disgust \[GESENIUS\].

we--the prophet identifying himself with the Jews. See HORSLEY'S view
(see on [Isa 53:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001)).

esteemed . . . not--negative contempt; the previous words express
positive.

[Isaiah 53:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 53:4</span></span>

Surely . . . our griefs--literally, "But yet He hath taken (or borne)
our sicknesses," that is, they who despised Him because of His human
infirmities ought rather to have esteemed Him on account of them; for
thereby "Himself took OUR infirmities" (bodily diseases). So [Mat
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#017) quotes it. In the Hebrew for
"borne," or took, there is probably the double notion, He took on
Himself vicariously (so [Isa 53:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#005),
[Isa 53:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#008), [Isa
53:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#012)), and so He took away; His
perfect humanity whereby He was bodily afflicted for us, and in all our
afflictions ([Isa 63:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#009); [Heb
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#015)) was the ground on which He cured
the sick; so that Matthew's quotation is not a mere accommodation. See
Note 42 of ARCHBISHOP MAGEE, Atonement. The Hebrew there may mean to
overwhelm with darkness; Messiah's time of darkness was temporary ([Mat
27:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#045)), answering to the bruising of
His heel; Satan's is to be eternal, answering to the bruising of his
head (compare [Isa 50:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#010)).

carried . . . sorrows--The notion of substitution strictly. "Carried,"
namely, as a burden. "Sorrows," that is, pains of the mind; as "griefs"
refer to pains of the body ([Psa
32:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#010); [Psa
38:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#017)). [Mat
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#017) might seem to oppose this: "And
bare our sicknesses." But he uses "sicknesses" figuratively for sins,
the cause of them. Christ took on Himself all man's "infirmities;" so as
to remove them; the bodily by direct miracle, grounded on His
participation in human infirmities; those of the soul by His vicarious
suffering, which did away with the source of both. Sin and sickness are
ethically connected as cause and effect ([Isa
33:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#024); [Psa
103:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#003); [Mat
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#002); [Joh
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#014); [Jam
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#015)).

we did esteem him stricken--judicially \[LOWTH\], namely, for His sins;
whereas it was for ours. "We thought Him to be a leper" \[JEROME,
Vulgate\], leprosy being the direct divine judgment for guilt (Lev.
13:1-59; [Num 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#010), [Num
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#015); [Ch2
26:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#018)).

smitten--by divine judgments.

afflicted--for His sins; this was the point in which they so erred ([Luk
23:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#034); [Act
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#017); [Co1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#008)). He was, it is true, "afflicted,"
but not for His sins.

[Isaiah 53:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 53:5</span></span>

wounded--a bodily wound; not mere mental sorrow; literally, "pierced";
minutely appropriate to Messiah, whose hands, feet, and side were
pierced ([Psa 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#016)). The Margin,
wrongly, from a Hebrew root, translates, "tormented."

for . . . for-- ([Rom 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#025); [Co2
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#021); [Heb
9:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#028); [Pe1
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#024); [Pe1
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#018)) --the cause for which He
suffered not His own, but our sins.

bruised--crushing inward and outward suffering (see on [Isa
53:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#010)).

chastisement--literally, the correction inflicted by a parent on
children for their good ([Heb 12:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#005),
[Heb 12:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#010)). Not punishment
strictly; for this can have place only where there is guilt, which He
had not; but He took on Himself the chastisement whereby the peace
(reconciliation with our Father; [Rom
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#001); [Eph
2:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014), [Eph
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#017)) of the children of God was to be
effected ([Heb 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#014)).

upon him--as a burden; parallel to "hath borne" and "carried."

stripes--minutely prophetical of His being scourged ([Mat
27:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#026); [Pe1
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#024)).

healed--spiritually ([Psa 41:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#004); [Jer
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#022)).

[Isaiah 53:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 53:6</span></span>

Penitent confession of believers and of Israel in the last days ([Zac
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010)).

sheep . . . astray-- ([Psa 119:176](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#176);
[Pe1 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#025)). The antithesis is, "In
ourselves we were scattered; in Christ we are collected together; by
nature we wander, driven headlong to destruction; in Christ we find the
way to the gate of life" \[CALVIN\]. True, also, literally of Israel
before its coming restoration ([Eze
34:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#005); [Zac
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#002), [Zac
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#006); compare with [Eze
34:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#023); [Jer
23:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#004); also [Mat
9:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#036)).

laid--"hath made to light on Him" \[LOWTH\]. Rather, "hath made to rush
upon Him" \[MAURER\].

the iniquity--that is, its penalty; or rather, as in [Co2
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#021); He was not merely a sin offering
(which would destroy the antithesis to "righteousness"), but "sin for
us"; sin itself vicariously; the representative of the aggregate sin of
all mankind; not sins in the plural, for the "sin" of the world is one
([Rom 5:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#016)); thus we are made not
merely righteous, but righteousness, even "the righteousness of God."
The innocent was punished as if guilty, that the guilty might be
rewarded as if innocent. This verse could be said of no mere martyr.

[Isaiah 53:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 53:7</span></span>

oppressed--LOWTH translates, "It was exacted, and He was made
answerable." The verb means, "to have payment of a debt sternly exacted"
([Deu 15:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#002)), and so to be oppressed
in general; the exaction of the full penalty for our sins in His
sufferings is probably alluded to.

and . . . afflicted--or, and yet He suffered, or bore Himself patiently,
&c. \[HENGSTENBERG and MAURER\]. LOWTH'S translation, "He was made
answerable," is hardly admitted by the Hebrew.

opened not . . . mouth-- [Jer 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#019);
and David in [Psa 38:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#013); [Psa
39:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#009), prefiguring Messiah ([Mat
26:63](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#063); [Mat
27:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#012), [Pe1
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#023)).

[Isaiah 53:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 53:8</span></span>

Rather, "He was taken away (that is, cut off) by oppression and by a
judicial sentence"; a hendiadys for, "by an oppressive judicial
sentence" \[LOWTH and HENGSTENBERG\]. GESENIUS not so well, "He was
delivered from oppression and punishment" only by death. English Version
also translates, "from . . . from," not "by . . . by." But "prison" is
not true of Jesus, who was not incarcerated; restraint and bonds ([Joh
18:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#024)) more accord with the Hebrew.
[Act 8:33](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#033); translate as the
Septuagint: "In His humiliation His judgment (legal trial) was taken
away"; the virtual sense of the Hebrew as rendered by LOWTH and
sanctioned by the inspired writer of Acts; He was treated as one so mean
that a fair trial was denied Him ([Mat
26:59](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#059); [Mar
14:55-59](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#055)). HORSLEY translates, "After
condemnation and judgment He was accepted."

who . . . declare . . . generation--who can set forth (the wickedness
of) His generation? that is, of His contemporaries \[ALFORD on [Act
8:33](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#033)\], which suits best the
parallelism, "the wickedness of His generation" corresponding to
"oppressive judgment." But LUTHER, "His length of life," that is, there
shall be no end of His future days ([Isa
53:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#010); [Rom
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#009)). CALVIN includes the days of His
Church, which is inseparable from Himself. HENGSTENBERG, "His
posterity." He, indeed, shall be cut off, but His race shall be so
numerous that none can fully declare it. CHYRSOSTOM, &c., "His eternal
sonship and miraculous incarnation."

cut off--implying a violent death ([Dan
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026)).

my people--Isaiah, including himself among them by the word "my"
\[HENGSTENBERG\]. Rather, JEHOVAH speaks in the person of His prophet,
"My people," by the election of grace ([Heb
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#013)).

was he stricken--Hebrew, "the stroke (was laid) upon Him." GESENIUS says
the Hebrew means "them"; the collective body, whether of the prophets or
people, to which the Jews refer the whole prophecy. But JEROME, the
Syriac, and Ethiopiac versions translate it "Him"; so it is singular in
some passages; [Psa 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#007), His; [Job
27:23](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#023), Him; [Isa
44:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#015), thereto. The Septuagint, the
Hebrew, lamo, "upon Him," read the similar words, lamuth, "unto death,"
which would at once set aside the Jewish interpretation, "upon them."
ORIGEN, who laboriously compared the Hebrew with the Septuagint, so read
it, and urged it against the Jews of his day, who would have denied it
to be the true reading if the word had not then really so stood in the
Hebrew text \[LOWTH\]. If his sole authority be thought insufficient,
perhaps lamo may imply that Messiah was the representative of the
collective body of all men; hence the equivocal plural-singular form.

[Isaiah 53:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 53:9</span></span>

Rather, "His grave was appointed," or "they appointed Him His grave"
\[HENGSTENBERG\]; that is, they intended (by crucifying Him with two
thieves, [Mat 27:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#038)) that He should
have His grave "with the wicked." Compare [Joh
19:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#031), the denial of honorable burial
being accounted a great ignominy (see on [Isa
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#019); [Jer
26:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#023)).

and with . . . rich--rather, "but He was with a rich man," &c. GESENIUS,
for the parallelism to "the wicked," translates "ungodly" (the effect of
riches being to make one ungodly); but the Hebrew everywhere means
"rich," never by itself ungodly; the parallelism, too, is one of
contrast; namely, between their design and the fact, as it was ordered
by God ([Mat 27:57](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#057); [Mar
15:43-46](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#043); [Joh
19:39-40](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#039)); two rich men honored Him at
His death, Joseph of ArimathÃ&brvbr;a, and Nicodemus.

in his death--Hebrew, "deaths." LOWTH translates, "His tomb"; bamoth,
from a different root, meaning "high places," and so mounds for
sepulture ([Eze 43:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#007)). But all the
versions oppose this, and the Hebrew hardly admits it. Rather translate,
"after His death" \[HENGSTENBERG\]; as we say, "at His death." The
plural, "deaths," intensifies the force; as Adam by sin "dying died"
([Gen 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#017), Margin); that is, incurred
death, physical and spiritual. So Messiah, His substitute, endured death
in both senses; spiritual, during His temporary abandonment by the
Father; physical, when He gave up the ghost.

because--rather, as the sense demands (so in [Job
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#017)), "although He had done no," &c.
\[HENGSTENBERG\], ([Pe1 2:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#020); [Jo1
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#005)).

violence--that is, wrong.

[Isaiah 53:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 53:10</span></span>

Transition from His humiliation to His exaltation.

pleased the Lord--the secret of His sufferings. They were voluntarily
borne by Messiah, in order that thereby He might "do Jehovah's will"
([Joh 6:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#038); [Heb
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#007), [Heb
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#009)), as to man's redemption; so at
the end of the verse, "the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in His
hand."

bruise--(see [Isa 53:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#005)); [Gen
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#015), was hereby fulfilled, though the
Hebrew word for "bruise," there, is not the one used here. The word
"Himself," in Matthew, implies a personal bearing on Himself of our
maladies, spiritual and physical, which included as a consequence His
ministration to our bodily ailments: these latter are the reverse side
of sin; His bearing on Him our spiritual malady involved with it His
bearing sympathetically, and healing, the outward: which is its fruits
and its type. HENGSTENBERG rightly objects to MAGEE'S translation,
"taken away," instead of "borne," that the parallelism to "carried"
would be destroyed. Besides, the Hebrew word elsewhere, when connected
with sin, means to bear it and its punishment ([Eze
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#020)). Matthew, elsewhere, also sets
forth His vicarious atonement ([Mat
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#028)).

when thou, &c.--rather, as Margin, "when His soul (that is, He) shall
have made an offering," &c. In the English Version the change of person
is harsh: from Jehovah, addressed in the second person ([Isa
53:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#010)), to Jehovah speaking in the
first person in [Isa 53:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#011). The Margin
rightly makes the prophet in the name of Jehovah Himself to speak in
this verse.

offering for sin-- ([Rom 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025); [Jo1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#002); [Jo1
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#010)).

his seed--His spiritual posterity shall be numerous ([Psa
22:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#030)); nay, more, though He must die,
He shall see them. A numerous posterity was accounted a high blessing
among the Hebrews; still more so, for one to live to see them ([Gen
48:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#011); [Psa
128:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#006)).

prolong . . . days--also esteemed a special blessing among the Jews
([Psa 91:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#016)). Messiah shall, after
death, rise again to an endless life ([Hos
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#002); [Rom
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#009)).

prosper-- ([Isa 52:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#013), Margin).

[Isaiah 53:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 53:11</span></span>

Jehovah is still speaking.

see of the travail--He shall see such blessed fruits resulting from His
sufferings as amply to repay Him for them ([Isa
49:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#004); [Isa
50:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#005), [Isa
50:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#009)). The "satisfaction," in seeing
the full fruit of His travail of soul in the conversion of Israel and
the world, is to be realized in the last days ([Isa
2:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002)).

his knowledge--rather, the knowledge (experimentally) of Him ([Joh
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#003); [Phi
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#010)).

my . . . servant--Messiah ([Isa 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001);
[Isa 52:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#013)).

righteous--the ground on which He justifies others, His own
righteousness ([Jo1 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#001)).

justify--treat as if righteous; forensically; on the ground of His
meritorious suffering, not their righteousness.

bear . . . iniquities-- ([Isa 53:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#004)),
as the sinner's substitute.

[Isaiah 53:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 53:12</span></span>

divide--as a conqueror dividing the spoil after a victory ([Psa
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#008); [Luk
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#022)).

him--for Him.

with . . . great--HENGSTENBERG translates, "I will give Him the mighty
for a portion"; so the Septuagint. But the parallel clause, "with the
strong," favors English Version. His triumphs shall be not merely among
the few and weak, but among the many and mighty.

spoil . . . strong-- ([Col 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#015);
compare [Pro 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#019)). "With the great;
with the mighty," may mean, as a great and mighty hero.

poured out . . . soul--that is, His life, which was considered as
residing in the blood ([Lev 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#011);
[Rom 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025)).

numbered with, &c.--not that He was a transgressor, but He was treated
as such, when crucified with thieves ([Mar
15:28](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#028); [Luk
22:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#037)).

made intercession, &c.--This office He began on the cross ([Luk
23:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#034)), and now continues in heaven
([Isa 59:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#016); [Heb
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#024); [Jo1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#001)). Understand because before "He
was numbered . . . He bare . . . made intercession." His meritorious
death and intercession are the cause of His ultimate triumph. MAURER,
for the parallelism, translates, "He was put on the same footing with
the transgressors." But English Version agrees better with the Hebrew,
and with the sense and fact as to Christ. MAURER'S translation would
make a tautology after "He was numbered with the transgressors";
parallelism does not need so servile a repetition. "He made intercession
for," &c., answers to the parallel. "He was numbered with," &c., as
effect answers to cause, His intercession for sinners being the effect
flowing from His having been numbered with them.

Israel converted is compared to a wife ([Isa
54:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#005); [Isa
62:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#005)) put away for unfaithfulness, but
now forgiven and taken home again. The converted Gentiles are
represented as a new progeny of the long-forsaken but now restored wife.
The pre-eminence of the Hebrew Church as the mother Church of
Christendom is the leading idea; the conversion of the Gentiles is
mentioned only as part of her felicity \[HORSLEY\].
