### [Psalms Chapter 62](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#001)

[Psalms 62:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 62:1</span></span>

To Jeduthun--(See on [Psa 39:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#001),
title). The general tone of this Psalm is expressive of confidence in
God. Occasion is taken to remind the wicked of their sin, their ruin,
and their meanness. ([Psa 62:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#001))

waiteth--literally, "is silent," trusts submissively and confidently as
a servant.

[Psalms 62:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 62:2</span></span>

The titles applied to God often occur ([Psa
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#009); [Psa
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#002)).

be greatly moved-- ([Psa 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#006)). No
injury shall be permanent, though devised by enemies.

[Psalms 62:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 62:3</span></span>

Their destruction will come; as a tottering wall they already are feeble
and failing.

bowing wall shall ye be--better supply "are." Some propose to apply
these phrases to describe the condition of "a man"--that is, the pious
suffer: thus, "Will ye slay him," &c.; but the other is a good sense.

[Psalms 62:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 62:4</span></span>

his excellency--or, elevation to which God had raised him ([Psa
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#002)). This they try to do by lies and
duplicity ([Psa 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#009)).

[Psalms 62:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 62:5</span></span>

(Compare [Psa 62:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#001)).

[Psalms 62:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 62:6</span></span>

not be moved--not at all; his confidence has increased.

[Psalms 62:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 62:7</span></span>

rock of my strength--or strongest support ([Psa
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#010); [Psa
61:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#003)).

[Psalms 62:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 62:8</span></span>

pour out your heart--give full expression to feeling ([Sa1
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#015); [Job
30:16](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#016); [Psa
42:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#004)).

ye people--God's people.

[Psalms 62:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 62:9</span></span>

No kind of men are reliable, compared with God ([Isa
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#022); [Jer
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#005)).

altogether--alike, one as the other ([Psa
34:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#003)).

[Psalms 62:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 62:10</span></span>

Not only are oppression and robbery, which are wicked means of wealth,
no grounds of boasting; but even wealth, increasing lawfully, ought not
to engross the heart.

[Psalms 62:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 62:11</span></span>

once; twice--(as in [Job 33:14](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#014); [Job
40:5](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#005)), are used to give emphasis to
the sentiment. God's power is tempered by His mercy, which it also
sustains.

[Psalms 62:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 62:12</span></span>

for thou renderest--literally, "that Thou renderest," &c., connected
with "I heard this," as the phrase--"that power," &c. \[[Psa
62:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#011)\] --teaching that by His power
He can show both mercy and justice.
