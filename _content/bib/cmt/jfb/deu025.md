### [Deuteronomy Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#001)

[Deuteronomy 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">deu 25:2</span></span>

STRIPES MUST NOT EXCEED FORTY. (Deu. 25:1-19)

if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten--In judicial sentences, which
awarded punishment short of capital, scourging, like the Egyptian
bastinado, was the most common form in which they were executed. The
Mosaic law, however, introduced two important restrictions; namely: (1)
The punishment should be inflicted in presence of the judge instead of
being inflicted in private by some heartless official; and (2) The
maximum amount of it should be limited to forty stripes, instead of
being awarded according to the arbitrary will or passion of the
magistrate. The Egyptian, like Turkish and Chinese rulers, often applied
the stick till they caused death or lameness for life. Of what the
scourge consisted at first we are not informed; but in later times, when
the Jews were exceedingly scrupulous in adhering to the letter of the
law and, for fear of miscalculation, were desirous of keeping within the
prescribed limit, it was formed of three cords, terminating in leathern
thongs, and thirteen strokes of this counted as thirty-nine stripes
([Co2 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#024)).

[Deuteronomy 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">deu 25:4</span></span>

Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn--In Judea, as
in modern Syria and Egypt, the larger grains were beaten out by the feet
of oxen, which, yoked together, day after day trod round the wide open
spaces which form the threshing-floors. The animals were allowed freely
to pick up a mouthful, when they chose to do so: a wise as well as
humane regulation, introduced by the law of Moses (compare [Co1
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#009); [Ti1
5:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#017)).

[Deuteronomy 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">deu 25:5</span></span>

the wife of the dead shall not marry without unto a stranger: her
husband's brother . . . shall take her to him to wife--This usage
existed before the age of Moses ([Gen
38:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#008)). But the Mosaic law rendered the
custom obligatory ([Mat 22:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#025)) on
younger brothers, or the nearest kinsman, to marry the widow ([Rut
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#004)), by associating the natural
desire of perpetuating a brother's name with the preservation of
property in the Hebrew families and tribes. If the younger brother
declined to comply with the law, the widow brought her claim before the
authorities of the place at a public assembly (the gate of the city);
and he having declared his refusal, she was ordered to loose the thong
of his shoe--a sign of degradation--following up that act by spitting on
the ground-- the strongest expression of ignominy and contempt among
Eastern people. The shoe was kept by the magistrate as an evidence of
the transaction, and the parties separated.

[Deuteronomy 25:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">deu 25:13</span></span>

Thou shalt not have . . . divers weights--Weights were anciently made of
stone and are frequently used still by Eastern shopkeepers and traders,
who take them out of the bag and put them in the balance. The man who is
not cheated by the trader and his bag of divers weights must be blessed
with more acuteness than most of his fellows \[ROBERTS\]. (Compare [Pro
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#011); [Pro
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#010)).

[Deuteronomy 25:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">deu 25:17</span></span>

Remember what Amalek did--This cold-blooded and dastardly atrocity is
not narrated in the previous history ([Exo
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#014)). It was an unprovoked outrage
on the laws of nature and humanity, as well as a daring defiance of that
God who had so signally shown His favor towards Israel (see on 1 Samuel
15; 27. 8; 30).
