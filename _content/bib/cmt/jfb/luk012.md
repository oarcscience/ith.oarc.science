Testaments*, by Robert Jamieson, A.R. Fausset and David Brown \[1882\]

### [Luke Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#001)

[Luke 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 12:1</span></span>

WARNING AGAINST HYPOCRISY. ([Luk
12:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#001))

meantime--in close connection, probably, with the foregoing scene. Our
Lord had been speaking out more plainly than ever before, as matters
were coming to a head between Him and His enemies, and this seems to
have suggested to His own mind the warning here. He had just Himself
illustriously exemplified His own precepts.

his disciples first of all--afterwards to "the multitudes" ([Luk
12:54](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#054)).

covered--from the view.

[Luke 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">luk 12:2</span></span>

hid--from knowledge. "Tis no use concealing anything, for all will one
day come out. Give free and fearless utterance then to all the truth."
(Compare [Co1 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#003), [Co1
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#005)).

[Luke 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">luk 12:4</span></span>

I say, &c.--You will say, That may cost us our life. Be it so; but, "My
friends, there their power ends." He calls them "my friends" here, not
in any loose sense, but, as we think, from the feeling He then had that
in this "killing of the body" He and they were going to be affectingly
one with each other.

[Luke 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">luk 12:5</span></span>

Fear Him . . . Fear Him--how striking the repetition here! Only the one
fear would effectually expel the other.

after he hath killed, &c.--Learn here--(1) To play false with one's
convictions to save one's life, may fail of its end after all, for God
can inflict a violent death in some other and equally formidable way.
(2) There is a hell, it seems, for the body as well as the soul;
consequently, sufferings adapted to the one as well as the other. (3)
Fear of hell is a divinely authorized and needed motive of action even
to Christ's "friends." (4) As Christ's meekness and gentleness were not
compromised by such harsh notes as these, so those servants of Christ
lack their Master's spirit who soften down all such language to please
ears "polite." (See on [Mar 9:43-48](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#043)).

[Luke 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">luk 12:6</span></span>

five . . . for two farthings--In [Mat
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#029) it is "two for one farthing"; so
if one took two farthings' worth, he got one in addition--of such small
value were they.

than many sparrows--not "than millions of sparrows"; the charm and power
of our Lord's teaching is very much in this simplicity.

[Luke 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">luk 12:8</span></span>

confess . . . deny--The point lies in doing it "before men," because one
has to do it "despising the shame." But when done, the Lord holds
Himself bound to repay it in kind by confessing such "before the angels
of God." For the rest, see on [Luk
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#026).

[Luke 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">luk 12:10</span></span>

Son of man . . . Holy Ghost--(See on [Mat
12:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#031)).

[Luke 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">luk 12:13</span></span>

COVETOUSNESS--WATCHFULNESS--SUPERIORITY TO EARTHLY TIES. (Luke 12:13-53)

Master, &c.--that is, "Great Preacher of righteousness, help; there is
need of Thee in this rapacious world; here am I the victim of injustice,
and that from my own brother, who withholds from me my rightful share of
the inheritance that has fallen to us." In this most inopportune
intrusion upon the solemnities of our Lord's teaching, there is a
mixture of the absurd and the irreverent, the one, however, occasioning
the other. The man had not the least idea that his case was not of as
urgent a nature, and as worthy the attention of our Lord, as anything
else He could deal with.

[Luke 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">luk 12:14</span></span>

Man, &c.--Contrast this style of address with "my friends," ([Luk
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#004)).

who, &c.--a question literally repudiating the office which Moses
assumed ([Exo 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#014)). The influence of
religious teachers in the external relations of life has ever been
immense, when only the INDIRECT effect of their teaching; but whenever
they intermeddle DIRECTLY with secular and political matters, the spell
of that influence is broken.

[Luke 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">luk 12:15</span></span>

unto them--the multitude around Him ([Luk
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#001)).

of covetousness--The best copies have "all," that is, "every kind of
covetousness"; because as this was one of the more plausible forms of
it, so He would strike at once at the root of the evil.

a man's life, &c.--a singularly weighty maxim, and not less so because
its meaning and its truth are equally evident.

[Luke 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">luk 12:16</span></span>

a certain rich man, &c.--Why is this man called a "fool?" ([Luk
12:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#020)) (1) Because he deemed a life of
secure and abundant earthly enjoyment the summit of human felicity. (2)
Because, possessing the means of this, through prosperity in his
calling, he flattered himself that he had a long lease of such
enjoyment, and nothing to do but give himself up to it. Nothing else is
laid to his charge.

[Luke 12:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">luk 12:20</span></span>

this night, &c.--This sudden cutting short of his career is designed to
express not only the folly of building securely upon the future, but of
throwing one's whole soul into what may at any moment be gone. "Thy soul
shall be required of thee" is put in opposition to his own treatment of
it, "I will say to my soul, Soul," &c.

whose shall those things be, &c.--Compare [Psa
39:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#006), "He heapeth up riches and
knoweth not who shall gather them."

[Luke 12:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">luk 12:21</span></span>

So is he, &c.--Such is a picture of his folly here, and of its awful
issue.

and is not rich toward God--lives to amass and enjoy riches which
terminate on self, but as to the riches of God's favor, which is life
([Psa 30:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#005)), of "precious" faith ([Pe2
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#001); [Jam
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#005)), of good works ([Ti1
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#018)), of wisdom which is better than
rubies ([Pro 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#011)) --lives and dies a
beggar!

[Luke 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">luk 12:22</span></span>

(See on [Mat 6:25-33](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#025)).

[Luke 12:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">luk 12:25</span></span>

which of you, &c.--Corroding solicitude will not bring you the least of
the things ye fret about, though it may double the evil of wanting them.
And if not the least, why vex yourselves about things of more
consequence?

[Luke 12:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">luk 12:29</span></span>

of doubtful, &c.--unsettled mind; put off your balance.

[Luke 12:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">luk 12:32</span></span>

little flock, &c.--How sublime and touching a contrast between this
tender and pitying appellation, "Little flock" (in the original a double
diminutive, which in German can be expressed, but not in English)--and
the "good pleasure" of the Father to give them the Kingdom; the one
recalling the insignificance and helplessness of that then literal
handful of disciples, the other holding up to their view the eternal
love that encircled them, the everlasting arms that were underneath
them, and the high inheritance awaiting them!--"the kingdom"; grand
word; then why not "bread" ([Luk 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#031)
\[BENGEL\]). Well might He say, "Fear not!"

[Luke 12:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">luk 12:33</span></span>

Sell, &c.--This is but a more vivid expression of [Mat
6:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#019) (see on [Mat
6:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#019)).

[Luke 12:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">luk 12:35</span></span>

loins . . . girded--to fasten up the long outer garment, always done
before travel and work ([Kg2 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#029);
[Act 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#008)). The meaning is, Be in
readiness.

lights, &c.--(See on [Mat 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#001)).

[Luke 12:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">luk 12:36</span></span>

return from the wedding--not come to it, as in the parable of the
virgins. Both have their spiritual significance; but preparedness for
Christ's coming is the prominent idea.

[Luke 12:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">luk 12:37</span></span>

gird himself, &c.--"a promise the most august of all: Thus will the
Bridegroom entertain his friends (nay, servants) on the solemn Nuptial
Day" \[BENGEL\].

[Luke 12:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">luk 12:38</span></span>

second . . . third watch--To find them ready to receive Him at any hour
of day or night, when one might least of all expect Him, is peculiarly
blessed. A servant may be truly faithful, even though taken so far
unawares that he has not everything in such order and readiness for his
master's return as he thinks is due to him, and both could and would
have had if he had had notice of the time of his coming, and so may not
be willing to open to him "immediately," but fly to preparation, and let
his master knock again ere he admit him, and even then not with full
joy. A too common case this with Christians. But if the servant have
himself and all under his charge in such a state that at any hour when
his master knocks, he can open to him "immediately," and hail his
"return"--that is the most enviable, "blessed" servant of all.

[Luke 12:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">luk 12:41</span></span>

unto us or even to all?--us the Twelve, or all this vast audience?

[Luke 12:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">luk 12:42</span></span>

Who then, &c.--answering the question indirectly by another question,
from which they were left to gather what it would be:--To you certainly
in the first instance, representing the "stewards" of the "household" I
am about to collect, but generally to all "servants" in My house.

faithful and wise--Fidelity is the first requisite in a servant, wisdom
(discretion and judgment in the exercise of his functions), the next.

steward--house steward, whose it was to distribute to the servants their
allotted portion of food.

shall make--will deem fit to be made.

[Luke 12:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">luk 12:44</span></span>

make him ruler over all he hath--will advance him to the highest post,
referring to the world to come. (See [Mat
25:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#021), [Mat
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#023)).

[Luke 12:45](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#045)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">luk 12:45</span></span>

begin to beat, &c.--In the confidence that his Lord's return will not be
speedy, he throws off the role of servant and plays the master,
maltreating those faithful servants who refuse to join him, seizing on
and revelling in the fulness of his master's board; intending, when he
has got his fill, to resume the mask of fidelity ere his master appear.

[Luke 12:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#046)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">luk 12:46</span></span>

cut him in sunder--a punishment not unknown in the East; compare [Heb
11:37](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#037), "sawn asunder" ([Sa1
15:33](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#033); [Dan
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#005)).

the unbelievers--the unfaithful, those unworthy of trust ([Mat
24:51](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#051)), "the hypocrites," falsely
calling themselves "servants."

[Luke 12:48](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#048)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">luk 12:48</span></span>

knew not--that is knew but partially; for some knowledge is presupposed
both in the name "servant" of Christ, and his being liable to punishment
at all.

many . . . few stripes--degrees of future punishment proportioned to the
knowledge sinned against. Even heathens are not without knowledge enough
for future judgment; but the reference here is not to such. It is a
solemn truth, and though general, like all other revelations of the
future world, discloses a tangible and momentous principle in its
awards.

[Luke 12:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#049)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">luk 12:49</span></span>

to send--cast.

fire--"the higher spiritual element of life which Jesus came to
introduce into this earth (compare [Mat
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#011)), with reference to its mighty
effects in quickening all that is akin to it and destroying all that is
opposed. To cause this element of life to take up its abode on earth,
and wholly to pervade human hearts with its warmth, was the lofty
destiny of the Redeemer" \[OLSHAUSEN: so CALVIN, STIER, ALFORD, &c.\].

what will I, &c.--an obscure expression, uttered under deep and
half-smothered emotion. In its general import all are agreed; but the
nearest to the precise meaning seems to be, "And what should I have to
desire if it were once already kindled?" \[BENGEL and BLOOMFIELD\].

[Luke 12:50](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#050)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">luk 12:50</span></span>

But . . . a baptism, &c.--clearly, His own bloody baptism, first to take
place.

how . . . straitened--not, "how do I long for its accomplishment," as
many understand it, thus making it but a repetition of [Luk
12:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#049); but "what a pressure of spirit
is upon Me."

till it be accomplished--till it be over. Before a promiscuous audience,
such obscure language was fit on a theme like this; but oh, what surges
of mysterious emotion in the view of what was now so near at hand does
it reveal!

[Luke 12:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#051)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">luk 12:51</span></span>

peace . . . ? Nay, &c.--the reverse of peace, in the first instance.
(See on [Mat 10:34-36](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#034).) The connection
of all this with the foregoing warnings about hypocrisy, covetousness,
and watchfulness, is deeply solemn: "My conflict hasten apace; Mine
over, yours begins; and then, let the servants tread in their Master's
steps, uttering their testimony entire and fearless, neither loving nor
dreading the world, anticipating awful wrenches of the dearest ties in
life, but looking forward, as I do, to the completion of their
testimony, when, reaching the haven after the tempest, they shall enter
into the joy of their Lord."

[Luke 12:54](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#054)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">luk 12:54</span></span>

NOT DISCERNING THE SIGNS OF THE TIME. ([Luk
12:54-59](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#054))

to the people--"the multitude," a word of special warning to the
thoughtless crowd, before dismissing them. (See on [Mat
16:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#002)).

[Luke 12:56](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#056)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_056">luk 12:56</span></span>

how . . . not discern, &c.--unable to perceive what a critical period
that was for the Jewish Church.

[Luke 12:57](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#057)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_057">luk 12:57</span></span>

why even of yourselves, &c.--They might say, To do this requires more
knowledge of Scripture and providence than we possess; but He sends them
to their own conscience, as enough to show them who He was, and win them
to immediate discipleship.

[Luke 12:58](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#058)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_058">luk 12:58</span></span>

When thou goest, &c.--(See on [Mat
5:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#025)). The urgency of the case with
them, and the necessity, for their own safety, of immediate decision,
was the object of these striking words.
