Testaments*, by Robert Jamieson, A.R. Fausset and David Brown \[1882\]

### [Job Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#001)

[Job 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 12:2</span></span>

JOB'S REPLY TO ZOPHAR (Job 12:1-14:22)

wisdom shall die with you--Ironical, as if all the wisdom in the world
was concentrated in them and would expire when they expired. Wisdom
makes "a people:" a foolish nation is "not a people" ([Rom
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#019)).

[Job 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 12:3</span></span>

not inferior--not vanquished in argument and "wisdom" ([Job
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#002)).

such things as these--such commonplace maxims as you so pompously
adduce.

[Job 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 12:4</span></span>

The unfounded accusations of Job's friends were a "mockery" of him. He
alludes to Zophar's word, "mockest" ([Job
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#003)).

neighbour, who calleth, &c.--rather, "I who call upon God that he may
answer me favorably" \[UMBREIT\].

[Job 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 12:5</span></span>

Rather, "a torch" (lamp) is an object of contempt in the thoughts of him
who rests securely (is at ease), though it was prepared for the
falterings of the feet \[UMBREIT\] ([Pro
25:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#019)). "Thoughts" and "feet" are in
contrast; also rests "securely," and "falterings." The wanderer, arrived
at his night-quarters, contemptuously throws aside the torch which had
guided his uncertain steps through the darkness. As the torch is to the
wanderer, so Job to his friends. Once they gladly used his aid in their
need; now they in prosperity mock him in his need.

[Job 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 12:6</span></span>

Job shows that the matter of fact opposes Zophar's theory ([Job
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#014), [Job
11:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#019)) that wickedness causes
insecurity in men's "tabernacles." On the contrary, they who rob the
"tabernacles" ("dwellings") of others "prosper securely" in their own.

into whose hand, &c.--rather, "who make a god of their own hand," that
is, who regard their might as their only ruling principle \[UMBREIT\].

[Job 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 12:7</span></span>

Beasts, birds, fishes, and plants, reasons Job, teach that the violent
live the most securely ([Job 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#006)).
The vulture lives more securely than the dove, the lion than the ox, the
shark than the dolphin, the rose than the thorn which tears it.

[Job 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 12:8</span></span>

speak to the earth--rather, "the shrubs of the earth" \[UMBREIT\].

[Job 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 12:9</span></span>

In all these cases, says Job, the agency must be referred to Jehovah,
though they may seem to man to imply imperfection ([Job
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#006); [Job
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#024)). This is the only undisputed
passage of the poetical part in which the name "Jehovah" occurs; in the
historical parts it occurs frequently.

[Job 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 12:10</span></span>

the soul--that is, the animal life. Man, reasons Job, is subjected to
the same laws as the lower animals.

[Job 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 12:11</span></span>

As the mouth by tasting meats selects what pleases it, so the ear tries
the words of others and retains what is convincing. Each chooses
according to his taste. The connection with [Job
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#012) is in reference to Bildad's
appeal to the "ancients" ([Job 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#008)).
You are right in appealing to them, since "with them was wisdom," &c.
But you select such proverbs of theirs as suit your views; so I may
borrow from the same such as suit mine.

[Job 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 12:12</span></span>

ancient--aged ([Job 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#010)).

[Job 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 12:13</span></span>

In contrast to, "with the ancient is wisdom" ([Job
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#012)), Job quotes a saying of the
ancients which suits his argument, "with Him (God) is (the true) wisdom"
([Pro 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#014)); and by that "wisdom and
strength" "He breaketh down," &c., as an absolute Sovereign, not
allowing man to penetrate His mysteries; man's part is to bow to His
unchangeable decrees ([Job 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#021)). The
Mohammedan saying is, "if God will, and how God will."

[Job 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 12:14</span></span>

shutteth up-- ([Isa 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#022)). Job refers
to Zophar's "shut up" ([Job 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#010)).

[Job 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 12:15</span></span>

Probably alluding to the flood.

[Job 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 12:16</span></span>

([Eze 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#009)).

[Job 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 12:18</span></span>

He looseth the bond of kings--He looseth the authority of kings--the
"bond" with which they bind their subjects ([Isa
45:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001); [Gen
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#004); [Dan
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#021)).

a girdle--the cord, with which they are bound as captives, instead of
the royal "girdle" they once wore ([Isa
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#021)), and the bond they once bound
others with. So "gird"--put on one the bonds of a prisoner instead of
the ordinary girdle ([Joh 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#018)).

[Job 12:19](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 12:19</span></span>

princes--rather, "priests," as the Hebrew is rendered ([Psa
99:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#006)). Even the sacred ministers of
religion are not exempt from reverses and captivity.

the mighty--rather, "the firm-rooted in power"; the Arabic root
expresses ever-flowing water \[UMBREIT\].

[Job 12:20](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 12:20</span></span>

the trusty--rather, "those secure in their eloquence"; for example, the
speakers in the gate ([Isa 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#003))
\[BEZA\].

understanding--literally, "taste," that is, insight or spiritual
discernment, which experience gives the aged. The same Hebrew word is
applied to Daniel's wisdom in interpretation ([Dan
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#014)).

[Job 12:21](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 12:21</span></span>

[Psa 107:40](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#040) quotes, in its first
clause, this verse and, in its second, [Job
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#024).

weakeneth the strength--literally, "looseth the girdle"; Orientals wear
flowing garments; when active strength is to be put forth, they gird up
their garments with a girdle. Hence here--"He destroyeth their power" in
the eyes of the people.

[Job 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 12:22</span></span>

([Dan 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#022)).

[Job 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">job 12:23</span></span>

[Isa 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#003); [Psa
107:38-39](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#038), which Psalm quotes this
chapter elsewhere. (See on [Job
12:21](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#021)).

straiteneth--literally, "leadeth in," that is, "reduces."

[Job 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">job 12:24</span></span>

heart--intelligence.

wander in a wilderness--figurative; not referring to any actual fact.
This cannot be quoted to prove Job lived after Israel's wanderings in
the desert. [Psa 107:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#004), [Psa
107:40](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#040) quotes this passage.

[Job 12:25](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">job 12:25</span></span>

[Deu 28:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#029); [Psa
107:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#027) again quote Job, but in a
different connection.
