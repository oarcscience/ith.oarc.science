### [Psalms Chapter 32](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001)

[Psalms 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 32:1</span></span>

Maschil--literally, "giving instruction." The Psalmist describes the
blessings of His forgiveness, succeeding the pains of conviction, and
deduces from his own experience instruction and exhortation to others.
([Psa 32:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001))

(Compare [Rom 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#006)).

forgiven--literally, "taken away," opposed to retain ([Joh
20:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#023)).

covered--so that God no longer regards the sin ([Psa
85:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#003)).

[Psalms 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 32:2</span></span>

imputeth--charge to him, and treat him accordingly.

no guile--or, deceit, no false estimate of himself, nor insincerity
before God (compare [Rom 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#001)).

[Psalms 32:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 32:3</span></span>

A vivid description of felt, but unacknowledged, sin.

When--literally, "for," as in [Psa
32:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#004).

[Psalms 32:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 32:4</span></span>

thy hand--of God, or power in distressing him ([Psa
38:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#002)).

moisture--vital juices of the body, the parching heat of which expresses
the anguish of the soul. On the other figures, compare [Psa
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#002), [Psa
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#007); [Psa
31:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#009). If composed on the occasion
of the fifty-first Psalm, this distress may have been protracted for
several months.

[Psalms 32:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 32:5</span></span>

A prompt fulfilment of the purposed confession is followed by a prompt
forgiveness.

[Psalms 32:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 32:6</span></span>

For this--that is, my happy experience.

godly--pious in the sense of [Psa 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#003).

a time-- ([Isa 55:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#006)); when God's
Spirit inclines us to seek pardon, He is ready to forgive.

floods, &c.--denotes great danger ([Psa
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#017); [Psa
66:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#012)).

[Psalms 32:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 32:7</span></span>

His experience illustrates the statement of [Psa
32:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#006).

[Psalms 32:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 32:8</span></span>

Whether, as most likely, the language of David (compare [Psa
51:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#013)), or that of God, this is a
promise of divine guidance.

I will . . . mine eye--or, My eye shall be on thee, watching and
directing thy way.

[Psalms 32:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 32:9</span></span>

The latter clause, more literally, "in that they come not near thee";
that is, because they will not come, &c., unless forced by bit and
bridle.

[Psalms 32:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 32:10</span></span>

The sorrows of the impenitent contrasted with the peace and safety
secured by God's mercy.

[Psalms 32:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 32:11</span></span>

The righteous and upright, or those conforming to the divine teaching
for securing the divine blessing, may well rejoice with shouting.
