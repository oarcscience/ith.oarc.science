### [Leviticus Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#001)

[Leviticus 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lev 20:2</span></span>

GIVING ONE'S SEED TO MOLECH. (Lev. 20:1-27)

Whosoever . . . giveth any of his seed unto Molech--(See on [Lev
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#021)).

the people of the land shall stone him with stones, &c.--Criminals who
were condemned to be stoned were led, with their hands bound, without
the gates to a small eminence, where was a large stone placed at the
bottom. When they had approached within ten cubits of the spot, they
were exhorted to confess, that, by faith and repentance, their souls
might be saved. When led forward to within four cubits, they were
stripped almost naked, and received some stupefying draught, during
which the witnesses prepared, by laying aside their outer garments, to
carry into execution the capital sentence which the law bound them to
do. The criminal, being placed on the edge of the precipice, was then
pushed backwards, so that he fell down the perpendicular height on the
stone lying below: if not killed by the fall, the second witness dashed
a large stone down upon his breast, and then the "people of the land,"
who were by-standers, rushed forward, and with stones completed the work
of death ([Mat 21:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#044); [Act
7:58](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#058)).

[Leviticus 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lev 20:4</span></span>

If the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the man,
&c.--that is, connive at their countrymen practising the horrid rites of
Molech. Awful was it that any Hebrew parents could so violate their
national covenant, and no wonder that God denounced the severest
penalties against them and their families.

[Leviticus 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">lev 20:7</span></span>

Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy--The minute specification
of the incestuous and unnatural crimes here enumerated shows their sad
prevalence amongst the idolatrous nations around, and the extreme
proneness of the Israelites to follow the customs of their neighbors. It
is to be understood, that, whenever mention is made that the offender
was "to be put to death" without describing the mode, stoning is meant.
The only instance of another form of capital punishment occurs in [Lev
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#014), that of being burnt with fire;
and yet it is probable that even here death was first inflicted by
stoning, and the body of the criminal afterwards consumed by fire ([Jos
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#015)).

[Leviticus 20:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">lev 20:20</span></span>

they shall die childless--Either by the judgment of God they shall have
no children, or their spurious offspring shall be denied by human
authority the ordinary privileges of children in Israel.

[Leviticus 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">lev 20:24</span></span>

I . . . have separated you from other people--Their selection from the
rest of the nations was for the all-important end of preserving the
knowledge and worship of the true God amid the universal apostasy; and
as the distinction of meats was one great means of completing that
separation, the law about making a difference between clean and unclean
beasts is here repeated with emphatic solemnity.
