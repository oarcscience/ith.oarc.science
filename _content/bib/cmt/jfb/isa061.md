### [Isaiah Chapter 61](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001)

[Isaiah 61:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 61:1</span></span>

MESSIAH'S OFFICES: RESTORATION OF ISRAEL. ([Isa
61:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001))

is upon me; because . . . hath anointed me--quoted by Jesus as His
credentials in preaching ([Luk
4:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#018)). The Spirit is upon Me in
preaching, because Jehovah hath anointed Me from the womb ([Luk
1:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#035)), and at baptism, with the Spirit
"without measure," and permanently "abiding" on Me ([Isa
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#002); [Joh
1:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#032); [Joh
3:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#034); [Psa
45:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#007); with which compare [Kg1
1:39-40](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#039); [Kg1
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#016); [Exo
29:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#007)). "Anointed" as Messiah, Prophet,
Priest, and King.

good tidings--as the word "gospel" means.

the meek--rather, "the poor," as [Luk
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#018) has it; that is, those afflicted
with calamity, poor in circumstances and in spirit ([Mat
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#005)).

proclaim liberty-- ([Joh 8:31-36](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#031)).
Language drawn from the deliverance of the Babylonian captives, to
describe the deliverance from sin and death ([Heb
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#015)); also from the "liberty
proclaimed" to all bond-servants in the year of jubilee ([Isa
61:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#002); [Lev
25:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#010); [Jer
34:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#008)).

opening of the prison--The Hebrew rather is, "the most complete
opening," namely, of the eyes to them that are bound, that is,
deliverance from prison, for captives are as it were blind in the
darkness of prison ([Isa 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#017); [Isa
35:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#005); [Isa
42:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#007)) \[EWALD\]. So [Luk
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#018) and the Septuagint interpret it;
[Luk 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#018), under inspiration, adds to
this, for the fuller explanation of the single clause in the Hebrew, "to
set at liberty them that are bruised"; thus expressing the double
"opening" implied; namely, that of the eyes ([Joh
9:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#039)), and that of the prison ([Rom
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#018); [Rom
7:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#024) [Heb
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#015)). His miracles were acted
parables.

[Isaiah 61:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 61:2</span></span>

acceptable year--the year of jubilee on which "liberty was proclaimed to
the captives" ([Isa 61:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001) [Co2
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#002)).

day of vengeance--The "acceptable time of grace" is a "year"; the time
of "vengeance" but "a day" (so [Isa
34:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#008); [Isa
63:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#004); [Mal
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#001)). Jesus ([Luk
4:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#020)) "closed the book" before this
clause; for the interval from His first to His second coming is "the
acceptable year"; the day of vengeance" will not be till He comes again
([Th2 1:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#007)).

our God--The saints call Him "our God"; for He cometh to "avenge" them
([Rev 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#010); [Rev
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#002)).

all that mourn--The "all" seems to include the spiritual Israelite
mourners, as well as the literal, who are in [Isa
61:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#003) called "them that mourn in Zion,"
and to whom [Isa 57:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#018) refers.

[Isaiah 61:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 61:3</span></span>

To appoint . . . to give--The double verb, with the one and the same
accusative, imparts glowing vehemence to the style.

beauty for ashes--There is a play on the sound and meaning of the Hebrew
words, peer, epher, literally, "ornamental headdress" or tiara ([Eze
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#017)), worn in times of joy, instead
of a headdress of "ashes," cast on the head in mourning ([Sa2
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#019)).

oil of joy--Perfumed ointment was poured on the guests at joyous feasts
([Psa 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#005); [Psa
45:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#007); [Amo
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#006)). On occasions of grief its use
was laid aside ([Sa2 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#002)).

garment of praise--bright-colored garments, indicative of thankfulness,
instead of those that indicate despondency, as sackcloth ([Joh
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#020)).

trees of righteousness--Hebrew, terebinth trees; symbolical of men
strong in righteousness, instead of being, as heretofore, bowed down as
a reed with sin and calamity ([Isa
1:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#029); [Isa
42:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#003); [Kg1
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#015); [Psa
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#003); [Psa
92:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#012); [Jer
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#008)).

planting of . . . Lord--(See on [Isa
60:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#021)).

that he might be glorified-- ([Joh
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#008)).

[Isaiah 61:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 61:4</span></span>

old wastes--Jerusalem and the cities of Judah which long lay in ruins
(see on [Isa 58:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#012)).

[Isaiah 61:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 61:5</span></span>

stand--shall wait on you as servants ([Isa
14:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#001); [Isa
60:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#010)).

[Isaiah 61:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 61:6</span></span>

But ye--as contrasted with the strangers. Ye shall have no need to
attend to your flocks and lands: "strangers" will do that for you; your
exclusive business will be the service of Jehovah as His "priests" ([Exo
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#006), which remains yet to be
realized; compare as to the spiritual Israel, [Isa
66:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#021); [Pe1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005), [Pe1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009); [Rev
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006); [Rev
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#010)).

Ministers-- ([Eze 44:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#011)).

eat . . . riches of . . . Gentiles-- ([Isa
60:5-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#005)).

in their glory . . . boast yourselves--rather, "in their splendor ye
shall be substituted in their stead"; ye shall substitute yourselves
\[MAURER\].

[Isaiah 61:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 61:7</span></span>

double--Instead of your past share, ye shall have not merely as much,
but "double" as much reward ([Isa
40:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#002); [Zac
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#012); compare the third clause in this
verse).

confusion--rather, "humiliation," or "contumely."

rejoice--They shall celebrate with jubilation their portion \[MAURER\].
Transition from the second to the third person.

in their land--marking the reference to literal Israel, not to the
Church at large.

everlasting joy-- ([Isa 35:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#010)).

[Isaiah 61:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 61:8</span></span>

judgment--justice, which requires that I should restore My people, and
give them double in compensation for their sufferings.

robbery for burnt offering--rather, from a different Hebrew root, the
spoil of iniquity \[HORSLEY\]. So in [Job
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#006). Hating, as I do, the rapine,
combined with iniquity, perpetrated on My people by their enemies, I
will vindicate Israel.

direct . . . work in truth--rather, "I will give them the reward of
their work" (compare [Isa 40:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#010),
Margin; [Isa 49:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#004), Margin; [Isa
62:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#011), Margin).

[Isaiah 61:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 61:9</span></span>

known--honorably; shall be illustrious ([Psa
67:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#002)).

people--rather, "peoples."

seed . . . blessed-- ([Isa 65:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#023)).

[Isaiah 61:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 61:10</span></span>

Zion ([Isa 61:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#003)) gives thanks for
God's returning favor (compare [Luk
1:46-47](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#046); [Hab
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#018)).

salvation . . . righteousness--inseparably connected together. The
"robe" is a loose mantle thrown over the other parts of the dress ([Psa
132:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#009), [Psa
132:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#016); [Psa
149:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#004); [Rev
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#002); [Rev
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#008)).

decketh himself with ornaments--rather "maketh himself a priestly
headdress," that is, a magnificent headdress, such as was worn by the
high priest, namely, a miter and a plate, or crown of gold worn in front
of it \[AQUILA, &c.\]; appropriate to the "kingdom of priests,"
dedicated to the offering of spiritual sacrifices to God continually
([Exo 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#006); [Rev
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#010); [Rev
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#006)).

jewels--rather, "ornaments" in general \[BARNES\].

[Isaiah 61:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 61:11</span></span>

([Isa 45:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#008), [Isa
55:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#010); [Psa
72:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#003); [Psa
85:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#011)).

bud--the tender shoots.

praise-- ([Isa 60:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#018); [Isa
62:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#007)).
