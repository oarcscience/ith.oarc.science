<p>
<p>Now--rather, "But"; marking the transition from his prayers for them to entreaties to them. 
<p>
<p>we beseech you--or "entreat you." He uses affectionate entreaty, rather than stern reproof, to win them over to the right view. 
<p>
<p>by--rather, "with respect to"; as the Greek for "of" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#008">Co2 1:8</A>). 
<p>
<p>our gathering together unto him--the consummating or final gathering together of the saints to Him at His coming, as announced, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#031">Mat 24:31</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#017">Th1 4:17</A>. The Greek noun is nowhere else found except in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#025">Heb 10:25</A>, said of the assembling together of believers for congregational worship. Our instinctive fears of the judgment are dispelled by the thought of being gathered together UNTO HIM ("even as the hen gathereth her chickens under her wings"), which ensures our safety.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#002">2 Thessalonians 2:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">th2 2:2</A></FONT></span></p>soon--on trifling grounds, without due consideration. 
<p>
<p>shaken--literally, "tossed" as ships tossed by an agitated sea. Compare for the same image, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#014">Eph 4:14</A>. 
<p>
<p>in mind--rather as the Greek, "from your mind," that is, from your mental steadfastness on the subject. 
<p>
<p>troubled--This verb applies to emotional agitation; as "shaken" to intellectual. 
<p>
<p>by spirit--by a person professing to have the spirit of prophecy (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#008">Co1 12:8-10</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#001">Jo1 4:1-3</A>). The Thessalonians had been warned (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#020">Th1 5:20-21</A>) to "prove" such professed prophesyings, and to "hold fast (only) that which is good." 
<p>
<p>by word--of mouth (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#005">Th2 2:5</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#015">Th2 2:15</A>); some word or saying alleged to be that of Paul, orally communicated. If oral tradition was liable to such perversion in the apostolic age (compare a similar instance, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#023">Joh 21:23</A>), how much more in our age! 
<p>
<p>by letter as from us--purporting to be from us, whereas it is a forgery. Hence he gives a test by which to know his genuine letters (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#017">Th2 3:17</A>). 
<p>
<p>day of Christ--The oldest manuscripts read, "day of the Lord." 
<p>
<p>is at hand--rather, "is immediately imminent," literally, "is present"; "is instantly coming." Christ and His apostles always taught that the day of the Lord's coming is at hand; and it is not likely that Paul would imply anything contrary here; what he denies is, that it is so immediately imminent, instant, or present, as to justify the neglect of everyday worldly duties. CHRYSOSTOM, and after him ALFORD, translates, "is (already) present" (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#018">Ti2 2:18</A>), a kindred error. But in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#001">Ti2 3:1</A>, the same Greek verb is translated "come." WAHL supports this view. The Greek is usually used of actual presence; but is quite susceptible of the translation, "is all but present."
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#003">2 Thessalonians 2:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">th2 2:3</A></FONT></span></p>by any means--Greek, "in any manner." Christ, in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#004">Mat 24:4</A>, gives the same warning in connection with the same event. He had indicated three ways (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#002">Th2 2:2</A>) in which they might be deceived (compare other ways, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#009">Th2 2:9</A>, and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#005">Mat 24:5</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#024">Mat 24:24</A>). 
<p>
<p>a falling away--rather as the Greek, "the falling away," or "apostasy," namely, the one of which "I told you" before (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#005">Th2 2:5</A>), "when I was yet with you," and of which the Lord gave some intimation (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#010">Mat 24:10-12</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#043">Joh 5:43</A>). 
<p>
<p>that man of sin be revealed--The Greek order is, "And there have been revealed the man of sin." As Christ was first in mystery, and afterwards revealed (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016">Ti1 3:16</A>), so Antichrist (the term used <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#018">Jo1 2:18</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#003">Jo1 4:3</A>) is first in mystery, and afterwards shall be developed and revealed (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#007">Th2 2:7-9</A>). As righteousness found its embodiment in Christ, "the Lord our righteousness," so "sin" shall have its embodiment in "the man of sin." The hindering power meanwhile restrains its manifestation; when that shall be removed, then this manifestation shall take place. The articles, "the apostasy," and "the man of sin," may also refer to their being well known as foretold in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#008">Dan 7:8</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#025">Dan 7:25</A>, "the little horn speaking great words against the Most High, and thinking to change times and laws"; and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#036">Dan 11:36</A>, the wilful king who "shall exalt and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods; neither shall he regard any god." 
<p>
<p>the son of perdition--a title applied besides to Judas (the traitor, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#012">Joh 17:12</A>), and to none else. Antichrist (the second "beast" coming up out of the earth); therefore he shall at first be "like a lamb, while he speaks as a dragon" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#011">Rev 13:11</A>); "coming in peaceably and by flatteries," "working deceitfully," but "his heart shall be against the holy covenant" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#021">Dan 11:21</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#023">Dan 11:23</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#028">Dan 11:28</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#030">Dan 11:30</A>). Seeds of "the falling away" soon appear (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#001">Ti1 4:1-3</A>), but the full development and concentration of these anti-Christian elements in one person are still to appear. Contrast the King of Zion's coming as JESUS: (1) righteous or just; (2) having salvation; (3) lowly; whereas Antichrist is: (1) "the man of (the embodiment of) sin; (2) the son of perdition; (3) exalting himself above all that is worshipped. He is the son of perdition, as consigning many to it, and finally doomed to it himself (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#008">Rev 17:8</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#011">Rev 17:11</A>). "He whose essence and inheritance is perdition" [ALFORD]. As "the kingdom of heaven" is first brought before us in the abstract, then in the concrete, the King, the Lord Jesus; so here, first we have (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#007">Th2 2:7</A>) "the mystery of iniquity," then "the iniquitous one" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#008">Th2 2:8</A>). Doubtless "the apostasy" of Romanism (the abstract) is one of the greatest instances of the working of the mystery of iniquity, and its blasphemous claims for the Pope (the concrete) are forerunners of the final concentration of blasphemy in the man of sin, who shall not merely, as the Pope, usurp God's honor as vicegerent of God, but oppose God openly at last.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#004">2 Thessalonians 2:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">th2 2:4</A></FONT></span></p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#036">Dan 11:36-37</A> is here referred to. The words used there as to Antiochus Epiphanes, Paul implies, shall even be more applicable to the man of sin, who is the New Testament actual Antichrist, as Antiochus was the Old Testament typical Antichrist. The previous world kingdoms had each one extraordinary person as its representative head and embodiment (thus Babylon had Nebuchadnezzar, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#038">Dan 2:38</A>, end; Medo-Persia had Cyrus; Greece had Alexander, and Antiochus Epiphanes, the forerunner of Antichrist); so the fourth and last world kingdom, under which we now live, shall have one final head, the concentrated embodiment of all the sin and lawless iniquity which have been in pagan and papal Rome. Rome's final phase will probably be an unholy alliance between idolatrous superstition and godless infidelity. 
<p>
<p>Who opposeth and exalteth himself--There is but one Greek article to both participles, implying that the reason why he opposeth himself is in order that he may exalt himself above, &amp;c. ALFORD takes the former clause absolutely, "He that withstands (CHRIST)," that is, Antichrist (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#018">Jo1 2:18</A>). As at the conclusion of the Old Testament period, Israel apostate allied itself with the heathen world power against Jesus and His apostles (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#012">Luk 23:12</A>; and at Thessalonica, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#005">Act 17:5-9</A>), and was in righteous retribution punished by the instrumentality of the world power itself (Jerusalem being destroyed by Rome), <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026">Dan 9:26-27</A>; so the degenerate Church (become an "harlot"), allying itself with the godless world power (the "beast" of Revelation) against vital religion (that is, the harlot sitting on the beast), shall be judged by that world power which shall be finally embodied in Antichrist (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#008">Zac 13:8-9</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#002">Zac 14:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#016">Rev 17:16-17</A>). In this early Epistle, the apostate Jewish Church as the harlot, and pagan Rome as the beast, form the historical background on which Paul draws his prophetic sketch of the apostasy. In the Pastoral Epistles, which were later, this prophecy appears in connection with Gnosticism, which had at that time infected the Church. The harlot (the apostate Church) is first to be judged by the beast (the world power) and its kings (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#016">Rev 17:16</A>); and afterwards the beasts and their allies (with the personal Antichrist at their head, who seems to rise after the judgment on the harlot, or apostate Church) shall be judged by the coming of Jesus Himself (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#020">Rev 19:20</A>). Anti-Christian tendencies produce different Antichrists: these separate Antichrists shall hereafter find their consummation in an individual exceeding them all in the intensity of his evil character [AUBERLEN]. But judgment soon overtakes him. He is necessarily a child of death, immediately after his ascent as the beast out of the bottomless pit going into perdition (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#008">Rev 17:8</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#011">Rev 17:11</A>). Idolatry of self, spiritual pride, and rebellion against God, are his characteristics; as Christ-worship, humility, and dependence on God, characterize Christianity. He not merely assumes Christ's character (as the "false Christs," <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#024">Mat 24:24</A>), but "opposes" Christ. The Greek implies one situated on an opposite side (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#022">Jo1 2:22</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#007">Jo2 1:7</A>). One who, on the destruction of every religion, shall seek to establish his own throne, and for God's great truth, "God is man," to substitute his own lie, "Man is God" [TRENCH]. 
<p>
<p>above all that is called God-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#005">Co1 8:5</A>). The Pope (for instance, Clement VI) has even commanded the angels to admit into Paradise, without the alleged pains of purgatory, certain souls. But still this is only a foreshadowing of the Antichrist, who will not, as the Pope, act in God's name, but against God. 
<p>
<p>or that is worshipped--Rome here again gives a presage of Antichrist. The Greek is Sebasma; and Sebastus is the Greek for Augustus, who was worshipped as the secular ruler and divine vicegerent. The papacy has risen on the overthrow of C&Atilde;&brvbr;sar's power. Antichrist shall exalt himself above every object of worship, whether on earth as the C&Atilde;&brvbr;sar, or in heaven as God. The various prefigurations of Antichrist, Mohammed, Rome, Napoleon, and modern infidel secularism, contain only some, not all, his characteristics. It is the union of all in some one person that shall form the full Antichrist, as the union in one Person, Jesus, of all the types and prophecies constituted the full Christ [OLSHAUSEN]. 
<p>
<p>in the temple of God . . . that he is God--"He will reign a time, times, and half a time" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#025">Dan 7:25</A>), that is, three and a half years, and will sit in the temple at Jerusalem: then the Lord shall come from heaven and cast him into the take of fire and shall bring to the saints the times of their reigning, the seventh day of hallowed rest, and give to Abraham the promised inheritance" [IREN&Atilde;&#134;US, Against Heresies, 30.4]. 
<p>
<p>showing himself--with blasphemous and arrogant DISPLAY (compare a type, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#021">Act 12:21-23</A>). The earliest Fathers unanimously looked for a personal Antichrist. Two objections exist to Romanism being regarded the Antichrist, though probably Romanism will leave its culmination in him: (1) So far is Romanism from opposing all that is called God, that adoration of gods and lords many (the Virgin Mary and saints) is a leading feature in it; (2) the papacy has existed for more than twelve centuries, and yet Christ is not come, whereas the prophecy regards the final Antichrist as short-lived, and soon going to perdition through the coming of Christ (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#008">Rev 17:8</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#011">Rev 17:11</A>). Gregory the Great declared against the patriarch of Constantinople, that whosoever should assume the title of "universal bishop" would be "the forerunner of Antichrist." The papacy fulfilled this his undesigned prophecy. The Pope has been called by his followers, "Our Lord God the Pope"; and at his inauguration in St. Peter's, seated in his chair upon the high altar, which is treated as his footstool, he has vividly foreshadowed him who "exalteth himself above all that is called God." An objection fatal to interpreting the temple of God here as the Church (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#016">Co1 3:16-17</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#019">Co1 6:19</A>) is, the apostle would never designate the apostate anti-Christian Church "the temple of God." It is likely that, as Messiah was revealed among the Jews at Jerusalem, so Antimessiah shall appear among them when restored to their own land, and after they have rebuilt their temple at Jerusalem. Thus <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#041">Dan 11:41</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#045">Dan 11:45</A> (see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#041">Dan 11:41</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#045">Dan 11:45</A>), corresponds, "He shall enter the glorious land (Judea), and he shall plant the tabernacles of his palaces between the seas in the glorious holy mountain"; and then (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001">Dan 12:1</A>) "Michael, the great prince, shall stand up" to deliver God's people. Compare Note, see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026">Dan 9:26-27</A>. Also the king of Assyria, type of Antichrist (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#012">Isa 14:12-14</A>). "Lucifer" (a title of Messiah, assumed by Antichrist, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#016">Rev 22:16</A>); "I will exalt my throne above the stars of God." "I will sit upon the mount of the congregation (that is, God's place of meeting His people of old, the temple), in the sides of the north (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#002">Psa 48:2</A>); I will be like the Most High." <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#001">Rev 11:1-2</A>, "The temple of God . . . the holy city" (namely, Jerusalem, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#005">Mat 4:5</A>), compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#018">Psa 68:18</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#029">Psa 68:29</A>, referring to a period since Christ's ascension, therefore not yet fulfilled (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#001">Isa 2:1-3</A>; Eze. 40:1-44:31; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#016">Zac 14:16-20</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001">Mal 3:1</A>). "In the temple of God," implies that it an internal, not an external, enemy which shall assail the Church. Antichrist shall, the first three and a half years of the prophetical week, keep the covenant, then break it and usurp divine honors in the midst of the week. Some think Antichrist will be a Jew. At all events he will, "by flatteries," bring many, not only of the Gentiles, but also of "the tribes" of Israel (so the Greek for "kindreds," <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#008">Rev 11:8-9</A>), to own him as their long-looked-for Messiah, in the same "city where our Lord was crucified." "Sitteth" here implies his occupying the place of power and majesty in opposition to Him who "sitteth on the right hand of the Majesty on high" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003">Heb 1:3</A>), and who shall come to "sit" there where the usurper had sat (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#064">Mat 26:64</A>). See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027">Dan 9:27</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#002">Rev 11:2-3</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#009">Rev 11:9</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#011">Rev 11:11</A>. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#002">Eze 38:2-3</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#006">Eze 38:6</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#009">Eze 38:9-10</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#013">Eze 38:13-14</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#016">Eze 38:16</A>, as to Tyre, the type of Antichrist, characterized by similar blasphemous arrogance.

<p>
<p>what withholdeth--that which holds him back; "keeps him in check": the power that has restrained the man of sin from his full and final development, is the moral and conservative influence of political states [OLSHAUSEN]: the fabric of human polity as a coercive power; as "he who now letteth" refers to those who rule that polity by which the great upbursting of godlessness is kept down [ALFORD]. The "what withholdeth" refers to the general hindrance; "he who now letteth," to the person in whom that hindrance is summed up. Romanism, as a forerunner of Antichrist, was thus kept in check by the Romanemperor (the then representative of the coercive power) until Constantine, having removed the seat of empire to Constantinople, the Roman bishop by degrees first raised himself to precedency, then to primacy, and then to sole empire above the secular power. The historical fact from which Paul starts in his prediction was probably the emperor Claudius' expulsion of the Jews, the representative of the anti-Christian adversary in Paul's day, from Rome, thus "withholding" them in some degree in their attacks on Christianity; this suggested the principle holding good to the end of time, and about to find its final fulfilment in the removal of the withholding person or authority, whereupon Antichrist in his worst shape shall start up. 
<p>
<p>that he might be--Greek, "in order that": ye know that which keeps him back, in God's purposes, from being sooner manifested, "in order that he may be revealed in his own time" (that is, the time appointed by God to him as his proper time for being manifested), not sooner (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#035">Dan 11:35</A>). The removal of the withholding power will be when the civil polity, derived from the Roman empire, which is to be, in its last form, divided into ten kingdoms (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#003">Rev 17:3</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#011">Rev 17:11-13</A>), shall, with its leading representative head for the time being ("he who now letteth," Greek, "withholdeth," as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#006">Th2 2:6</A>), yield to the prevalent godless "lawlessness" with "the lawless one" as its embodiment. The elect Church and the Spirit cannot well be, as DE BURGH suggests, the withholding power meant; for both shall never be wholly "taken out of the way" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#020">Mat 28:20</A>). However, the testimony of the elect Church, and the Spirit in her, are the great hindrance to the rise of the apostasy; and it is possible that, though the Lord shall have a faithful few even then, yet the full energy of the Spirit in the visible Church, counteracting the energy or "working" of "the mystery of lawlessness" by the testimony of the elect, shall have been so far "taken out of the way," or set aside, as to admit the manifestation of "the lawless one"; and so DE BURGH'S'S view may be right (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#008">Luk 18:8</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#003">Rev 11:3-12</A>). This was a power of which the Thessalonians might easily "know" through Paul's instruction.

Anti-Christianity latently working, as distinguished from its final open manifestation. "Mystery" in Scripture means, not what remains always a secret, but that which is for a while hidden, but in due time manifested (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#004">Eph 3:4-5</A>). Satan will resort to a mode of opposition more conformed to the then imminent "appearing" and "presence" of the Saviour, and will anticipate Him with a last effort to maintain the dominion of the world [DE BURGH], just as at His first advent he rushed into open opposition, by taking possession of the bodies of men. "Iniquity," Greek, "lawlessness"; defiant rejection of God's law (compare Note, see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#009">Zac 5:9</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#010">Zac 5:10</A>). "Wickedness" (translated by the Septuagint by the same Greek, meaning "lawlessness," which Paul employs here), embodied there as a woman, answers to "the mystery of iniquity," here embodied finally in "the man of sin": as the former was ultimately banished for ever from the Holy Land to her own congenial soil, Babylon, so iniquity and the man of sin shall fall before Michael and the Lord Himself, who shall appear as the Deliverer of His people (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001">Dan 12:1-3</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#003">Zac 14:3-9</A>). Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#043">Mat 12:43</A>. The Jewish nation dispossessed of the evil spirit, the demon of idolatry being cast out through the Babylonian captivity, receives ultimately a worse form of the evil spirit, Christ-opposing self-righteousness. Also, the Christian Church in course of time taken possession of by the demon of Romish idolatry, then dispossessed of it by the Reformation, then its house "garnished" by hypocrisy, secularity, and rationalism, but "swept empty" of living faith, then finally apostatizing and repossessed by "the man of sin," and outwardly destroyed for a brief time (though even then Christ shall have witnesses for Him among both the Jews, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#009">Zac 13:9</A>, and Gentiles, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#020">Mat 28:20</A>), when Christ shall suddenly come (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#032">Dan 11:32-45</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#007">Luk 18:7-8</A>). 
<p>
<p>already-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#009">Jo2 1:9-10</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#018">Col 2:18-23</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#001">Ti1 4:1</A>); compare "even now already" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#018">Jo1 2:18</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#003">Jo1 4:3</A>) as distinguished from "in his own time" of being revealed hereafter. Antiquity, it appears from hence, is not a justification for unscriptural usages or dogmas, since these were "already," even in Paul's time, beginning to spring up: the written word is the only sure test. "Judaism infecting Christianity is the fuel; the mystery of iniquity is the spark." "It is one and the same impurity diffusing itself over many ages" [BENGEL]. 
<p>
<p>only he who now letteth will let--The italicized words are not in the Greek. Therefore, translate rather, "only (that is, the continuance of the MYSTERY of iniquity-working will be only) until he who now withholdeth (the same Greek as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#006">Th2 2:6</A>) be taken out of the way." "Only (waiting, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#013">Heb 10:13</A>) until he," &amp;c. Then it will work no longer in mystery, but in open manifestation.

<p>
<p>whom the Lord--Some of the oldest manuscripts read, "the Lord Jesus." How awful that He whose very name means God-Saviour, should appear as the Destroyer; but the salvation of the Church requires the destruction of her foe. As the reign of Israel in Canaan was ushered in by judgments on the nations for apostasy (for the Canaanites were originally worshippers of the true God: thus Melchisedek, king of Salem, was the "priest of the most high God," <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#018">Gen 14:18</A> : Ammon and Moab came from righteous Lot), so the Son of David's reign in Zion and over the whole earth, is to be ushered in by judgments on the apostate Christian world. 
<p>
<p>consume . . . and . . . destroy--So <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#026">Dan 7:26</A>, "consume and destroy"; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#045">Dan 11:45</A>. He shall "consume" him by His mere breath (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#004">Isa 11:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#033">Isa 30:33</A>) : the sentence of judgment being the sharp sword that goeth out of His mouth (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#015">Rev 19:15</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#021">Rev 19:21</A>). Antichrist's manifestation and destruction are declared in the same breath; at his greatest height he is nearest his fall, like Herod his type (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#024">Isa 1:24-27</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#020">Act 12:20-23</A>). As the advancing fire, while still at a distance consumes little insects [CHRYSOSTOM] by its mere heat, so Christ's mere approach is enough to consume Antichrist. The mere "appearance of the coming" of the Lord of glory is sufficient to show to Antichrist his perfect nothingness. He is seized and "cast alive into the take of fire" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#020">Rev 19:20</A>). So the world kingdoms, and the kingdom of the beast, give place to that of the Son of man and His saints. The Greek for "destroy" means "abolish" (the same Greek is so translated, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#010">Ti2 1:10</A>); that is, cause every vestige of him to disappear. Compare as to Gog attacking Israel and destroyed by Jehovah (Eze. 38:1-39:29), so as not to leave a vestige of him. 
<p>
<p>with the brightness of his coming--Greek, "the manifestation, (or appearance) of His presence": the first outburst of His advent--the first gleam of His presence--is enough to abolish utterly all traces of Antichrist, as darkness disappears before the dawning day. Next, his adherents are "slain with the sword out of His mouth" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#021">Rev 19:21</A>). BENGEL'S distinction between "the appearance of His coming" and the "coming" itself is not justified by <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#014">Ti1 6:14</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#010">Ti2 1:10</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#001">Ti2 4:1</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#008">Ti2 4:8</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#013">Tit 2:13</A>, where the same Greek for "appearing" (English Version, here "the brightness") plainly refers to the coming itself. The expression, "manifestation (appearing) of His presence," is used in awful contrast to the revelation of the wicked one in the beginning of the verse.

<p>after--according to the working ("energy") of Satan, as opposed to the energy or working of the Holy Spirit in the Church (see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#019">Eph 1:19</A>). As Christ is related to God, so is Antichrist to Satan, his visible embodiment and manifestation: Satan works through him. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#002">Rev 13:2</A>, "The dragon gave him (the beast) his power . . . seat . . . great authority." 
<p>
<p>lying wonders--literally, "wonders" or "prodigies of falsehood." His "power, signs, and wonders," all have falsehood for their base, essence, and aim (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#044">Joh 8:44</A>), [ALFORD]. In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#024">Mat 24:24</A> Jesus implies that the miracles shall be real, though demoniac, such mysterious effects of the powers of darkness as we read of in the case of the Egyptian sorcerers, not such as Jesus performed in their character, power, or aim; for they are against the revealed Word, and therefore not to be accepted as evidences of truth; nay, on the authority of that sure Word of prophecy (here, and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#024">Mat 24:24</A>), to be known and rejected as wrought in support of falsehood (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#001">Deu 13:1-3</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#005">Deu 13:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#008">Gal 1:8-9</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#011">Rev 13:11-15</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#020">Rev 19:20</A>). The same three Greek words occur for miracles of Jesus (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#022">Act 2:22</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#004">Heb 2:4</A>); showing that as the Egyptian magicians imitated Moses (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#001">Ti2 3:1-8</A>), so Antichrist will try to imitate Christ's works as a "sign," or proof of divinity.

They first cast off the love of the truth, then God gives them up to Satan's delusions, then they settle down into "believing the lie": an awful climax (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#022">Kg1 22:22-23</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#009">Eze 14:9</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#016">Job 12:16</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#005">Mat 24:5</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#011">Mat 24:11</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#001">Ti1 4:1</A>). 
<p>
<p>strong delusion--Greek, "the powerful working of error," answering to the energizing "working of Satan" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#009">Th2 2:9</A>); the same expression as is applied to the Holy Ghost's operation in believers: "powerful" or "effectual (energizing) working" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#019">Eph 1:19</A>).

Some of the oldest manuscripts read as English Version, but other oldest manuscripts and Vulgate read, "as first-fruits." The Thessalonians were among the first converts in Europe (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#005">Rom 16:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#015">Co1 16:15</A>).

<p>
<p>chosen you--The Greek, is not the ordinary word for "elected," implying His eternal selection; but taken for Himself, implying His having adopted them in His eternal purpose.

<p>
<p>of the Spirit--wrought by the Spirit who sanctifies all the elect people of God, first by eternally consecrating them to perfect holiness in Christ, once for all, next by progressively imparting it.

<p>hold--so as not to let go. Adding nothing, subtracting nothing [BENGEL].

The Greek verb from which the noun comes, is used by Paul in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#023">Co1 11:23</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#003">Co1 15:3</A>. From the three passages in which "tradition" is used in a good sense, Rome has argued for her accumulation of uninspired traditions, virtually overriding God's Word, while put forward as of co-ordinate authority with it. She forgets the ten passages (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#002">Mat 15:2-3</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#006">Mat 15:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#003">Mar 7:3</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#005">Mar 7:5</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#008">Mar 7:8-9</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#013">Mar 7:13</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#014">Gal 1:14</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#008">Col 2:8</A>) stigmatizing man's uninspired traditions. Not even the apostles' sayings were all inspired (for example, Peter's dissimulation, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#011">Gal 2:11-14</A>), but only when they claimed to be so, as in their words afterwards embodied in their canonical writings. Oral inspiration was necessary in their case, until the canon of the written Word should be complete; they proved their possession of inspiration by miracles wrought in support of the new revelation, which revelation, moreover, accorded with the existing Old Testament revelation; an additional test needed besides miracles (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#001">Deu 13:1-6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#011">Act 17:11</A>). When the canon was complete, the infallibility of the living men was transferred to the written Word, now the sole unerring guide, interpreted by the Holy Spirit. Little else has come down to us by the most ancient and universal tradition save this, the all-sufficiency of Scripture for salvation. Therefore, by tradition, we are constrained to cast off all tradition not contained in, or not provable by, Scripture. The Fathers are valuable witnesses to historical facts, which give force to the intimations of Scripture: such as the Christian Lord's day, the baptism of infants, and the genuineness of the canon of Scripture. Tradition (in the sense of human testimony) cannot establish a doctrine, but can authenticate a fact, such as the facts just mentioned. Inspired tradition, in Paul's sense, is not a supplementary oral tradition completing our written Word, but it is identical with the written Word now complete; then the latter not being complete, the tradition was necessarily in part oral, in part written, and continued so until, the latter being complete before the death of St. John, the last apostle, the former was no longer needed. Scripture is, according to Paul, the complete and sufficient rule in all that appertains to making "the man of God perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#016">Ti2 3:16-17</A>). It is by leaving Paul's God-inspired tradition for human traditions that Rome has become the forerunner and parent of the Antichrist. It is striking that, from this very chapter denouncing Antichrist, she should draw an argument for her "traditions" by which she fosters anti-Christianity. Because the apostles' oral word was as trustworthy as their written word, it by no means follows that the oral word of those not apostles is as trustworthy as the written word of those who were apostles or inspired evangelists. No tradition of the apostles except their written word can be proved genuine on satisfactory evidence. We are no more bound to accept implicitly the Fathers' interpretations of Scripture, because we accept the Scripture canon on their testimony, than we are bound to accept the Jews' interpretation of the Old Testament, because we accept the Old Testament canon on their testimony.

<p>our epistle--as distinguished from a "letter AS from us," <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#002">Th2 2:2</A>, namely, that purports to be from us, but is not. He refers to his first Epistle to the Thessalonians.

<p>good word and work--The oldest manuscripts invert the order, "work and word." Establishment in these were what the young converts at Thessalonica needed, not fanatical teaching (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#058">Co1 15:58</A>).
