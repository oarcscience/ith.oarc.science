Testaments*, by Robert Jamieson, A.R. Fausset and David Brown \[1882\]

### [Luke Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#001)

[Luke 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">luk 7:4</span></span>

CENTURION'S SERVANT HEALED. ([Luk
7:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#001))

he was worthy--a testimony most precious, coming from those who probably
were strangers to the principle from which he acted ([Ecc
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#001)).

[Luke 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">luk 7:5</span></span>

loved our nation--Having found that "salvation was of the Jews," he
loved them for it.

built, &c.--His love took this practical and appropriate form.

[Luke 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">luk 7:11</span></span>

WIDOW OF NAIN'S SON RAISED TO LIFE. (In Luke only). ([Luk
7:11-17](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#011))

Nain--a small village not elsewhere mentioned in Scripture, and only
this once probably visited by our Lord; it lay a little to the south of
Mount Tabor, about twelve miles from Capernaum.

[Luke 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">luk 7:12</span></span>

carried out--"was being carried out." Dead bodies, being ceremonially
unclean, were not allowed to be buried within the cities (though the
kings of David's house were buried m the city of David), and the funeral
was usually on the same day as the death.

only son, &c.--affecting particulars, told with delightful simplicity.

[Luke 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">luk 7:13</span></span>

the Lord--"This sublime appellation is more usual with Luke and John
than Matthew; Mark holds the mean" \[BENGEL\].

saw her, he had compassion, &c.--What consolation to thousands of the
bereaved has this single verse carried from age to age!

[Luke 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">luk 7:14</span></span>

What mingled majesty and grace shines in this scene! The Resurrection
and the Life in human flesh, with a word of command, bringing back life
to the dead body; Incarnate Compassion summoning its absolute power to
dry a widow's tears!

[Luke 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">luk 7:16</span></span>

visited his people--more than bringing back the days of Elijah and
Elisha ([Kg1 17:17-24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#017); [Kg2
4:32-37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#032); and see [Mat
15:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#031)).

[Luke 7:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">luk 7:29</span></span>

THE BAPTIST'S MESSAGE THE REPLY, AND CONSEQUENT DISCOURSE. (Luke
7:18-35)

And all the people that heard--"on hearing (this)." These are the
observations of the Evangelist, not of our Lord.

and the publicans--a striking clause.

justified God, being baptized, &c.--rather, "having been baptized." The
meaning is, They acknowledged the divine wisdom of such a preparatory
ministry as John's, in leading them to Him who now spake to them (see
[Luk 1:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#016)); whereas the Pharisees
and lawyers, true to themselves in refusing the baptism of John, set at
naught also the merciful design of God in the Saviour Himself, to their
own destruction.

[Luke 7:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">luk 7:31</span></span>

the Lord said, &c.--As cross, capricious children, invited by their
playmates to join them in their amusements, will play with them neither
at weddings nor funerals (juvenile imitations of the joyous and mournful
scenes of life), so that generation rejected both John and his Master:
the one because he was too unsocial--more like a demoniac than a
rational man; the other, because He was too much the reverse, given to
animal indulgences, and consorting with the lowest classes of society.
But the children of Wisdom recognize and honor her, whether in the
austere garb of the Baptist or in the more attractive style of his
Master, whether in the Law or in the Gospel, whether in rags or in
royalty, for "the full soul loatheth an honeycomb, but to the hungry
soul every bitter thing is sweet" ([Pro
27:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#007)).

[Luke 7:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">luk 7:37</span></span>

CHRIST'S FEET WASHED WITH TEARS. ([Luk
7:36-50](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#036))

a sinner--one who had led a profligate life. Note.--There is no ground
whatever for the popular notion that this woman was Mary Magdalene, nor
do we know what her name was. (See on [Luk
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#002).)

an alabaster box of ointment--a perfume vessel, in some cases very
costly ([Joh 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#005)). "The ointment has
here a peculiar interest, as the offering by a penitent of what had been
an accessory in her unhallowed work of sin" \[ALFORD\].

[Luke 7:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">luk 7:38</span></span>

at his feet behind him--the posture at meals being a reclining one, with
the feet out behind.

began to wash, &c.--to "water with a shower." The tears, which were
quite involuntary, poured down in a flood upon His naked feet, as she
bent down to kiss them; and deeming them rather fouled than washed by
this, she hastened to wipe them off with the only towel she had, the
long tresses of her own hair, "with which slaves were wont to wash their
masters' feet" \[STIER\].

kissed--The word signifies "to kiss fondly, to caress," or to "kiss
again and again," which [Luk 7:45](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#045)
shows is meant here. What prompted this? Much love, springing from a
sense of much forgiveness. So says He who knew her heart ([Luk
7:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#047)). Where she had met with Christ
before, or what words of His had brought life to her dead heart and a
sense of divine pardon to her guilty soul, we know not. But probably she
was of the crowd of "publicans and sinners" whom Incarnate Compassion
drew so often around Him, and heard from His lips some of those words
such as never man spake, "Come unto Me, all ye that labour," &c. No
personal interview had up to this time taken place between them; but she
could keep her feelings no longer to herself, and having found her way
to Him (and entered along with him, [Luk
7:45](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#045)), they burst forth in this
surpassing yet most artless style, as if her whole soul would go out to
Him.

[Luke 7:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">luk 7:39</span></span>

the Pharisee--who had formed no definite opinion of our Lord, and
invited Him apparently to obtain materials for a judgment.

spake within himself, &c.--"Ha! I have Him now; He plainly knows nothing
of the person He allows to touch Him; and so, He can be no prophet." Not
so fast, Simon; thou hast not seen through thy Guest yet, but He hath
seen through thee.

[Luke 7:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">luk 7:40</span></span>

Like Nathan with David, our Lord conceals His home thrust under the veil
of a parable, and makes His host himself pronounce upon the case. The
two debtors are the woman and Simon; the criminality of the one was ten
times that of the other (in the proportion of "five hundred" to
"fifty"); but both being equally insolvent, both are with equal
frankness forgiven; and Simon is made to own that the greatest debtor to
forgiving mercy will cling to her Divine Benefactor with the deepest
gratitude. Does our Lord then admit that Simon was a forgiving man? Let
us see.

[Luke 7:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">luk 7:44</span></span>

I entered . . . no water--a compliment to guests. Was this "much love?"
Was it any?

[Luke 7:45](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#045)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">luk 7:45</span></span>

no kiss--of salutation. How much love was here? Any at all?

[Luke 7:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#046)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">luk 7:46</span></span>

with oil . . . not anoint--even common olive oil in contrast with the
woman's "ointment" or aromatic balsam. What evidence was thus afforded
of any feeling which forgiveness prompts? Our Lord speaks this with
delicate politeness, as if hurt at these inattentions of His host, which
though not invariably shown to guests, were the customary marks of
studied respect and regard. The inference is plain--only one of the
debtors was really forgiven, though in the first instance, to give room
for the play of withheld feelings, the forgiveness of both is supposed
in the parable.

[Luke 7:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#047)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">luk 7:47</span></span>

Her sins which are many--"Those many sins of hers," our Lord, who
admitted how much more she owed than the Pharisee, now proclaims in
naked terms the forgiveness of her guilt.

for--not because, as if love were the cause of forgiveness, but
"inasmuch as," or "in proof of which." The latter clause of the verse,
and the whole structure of the parable, plainly show this to be the
meaning.

little forgiven . . . loveth little--delicately ironical intimation of
no love and no forgiveness in the present case.

[Luke 7:48](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#048)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">luk 7:48</span></span>

said unto her, &c.--an unsought assurance, usually springing up
unexpected in the midst of active duty and warm affections, while often
it flies from those who mope and are paralyzed for want of it.

[Luke 7:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#049)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">luk 7:49</span></span>

they that sat . . . Who is this, &c.--No wonder they were startled to
hear One who was reclining at the same couch, and partaking of the same
hospitalities with themselves, assume the awful prerogative of "even
forgiving sins." But so far from receding from this claim, or softening
it down, our Lord only repeats it, with two precious additions: one,
announcing what was the one secret of the "forgiveness" she had
experienced, and which carried "salvation" in its bosom; the other, a
glorious dismissal of her in that "peace" which she had already felt,
but is now assured she has His full warrant to enjoy! This wonderful
scene teaches two very weighty truths: (1) Though there be degrees of
guilt, insolvency, or inability to wipe out the dishonor done to God, is
common to all sinners. (2) As Christ is the Great Creditor to whom all
debt, whether great or small, contracted by sinners is owing, so to Him
belongs the prerogative of forgiving it. This latter truth is brought
out in the structure and application of the present parable as it is
nowhere else. Either then Jesus was a blaspheming deceiver, or He is God
manifest in the flesh.
