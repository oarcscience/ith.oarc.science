### [Genesis Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#001)

[Genesis 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 25:1</span></span>

SONS OF ABRAHAM. ([Gen 25:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#001))

Abraham took a wife--rather, "had taken"; for Keturah is called
Abraham's concubine, or secondary wife ([Ch1
1:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#032)); and as, from her bearing six
sons to him, it is improbable that he married after Sarah's death; and
also as he sent them all out to seek their own independence, during his
lifetime, it is clear that this marriage is related here out of its
chronological order, merely to form a proper winding up of the
patriarch's history.

[Genesis 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 25:5</span></span>

Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac . . . unto the sons of the
concubines . . . Abraham gave gifts--While the chief part of the
inheritance went to Isaac; the other sons (Ishmael included) migrated to
"the East country," that is, Arabia, but received each a portion of the
patrimony, perhaps in cattle and other things; and this settlement of
Abraham's must have given satisfaction, since it is still the rule
followed among the pastoral tribes.

[Genesis 25:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 25:7</span></span>

DEATH OF ABRAHAM. ([Gen 25:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#007))

these are the days of . . . Abraham--His death is here related, though
he lived till Jacob and Esau were fifteen years, just one hundred years
after coming to Canaan; "the father of the faithful," "the friend of
God" \[[Jam 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#023)\], died; and even in
his death, the promises were fulfilled (compare [Gen
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#015)). We might have wished some
memorials of his deathbed experience; but the Spirit of God has withheld
them--nor was it necessary; for (see [Mat
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#016)) from earth he passed into heaven
([Luk 16:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#022)). Though dead he yet
liveth ([Mat 22:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#032)).

[Genesis 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 25:9</span></span>

his sons . . . buried him--Death often puts an end to strife, reconciles
those who have been alienated, and brings rival relations, as in this
instance, to mingle tears over a father's grave.

[Genesis 25:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">gen 25:18</span></span>

DESCENDANTS OF ISHMAEL. Before passing to the line of the promised seed,
the historian gives a brief notice of Ishmael, to show that the promises
respecting that son of Abraham were fulfilled--first, in the greatness
of his posterity (compare [Gen 17:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#020));
and, secondly, in their independence. ([Gen
25:12-18](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#012))

he died--rather, "it \[their lot\] fell" in the presence of his brethren
(compare [Gen 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#012)).

[Genesis 25:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">gen 25:19</span></span>

HISTORY OF ISAAC. ([Gen 25:19-34](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#019))

these are the generations--account of the leading events in his life.

[Genesis 25:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">gen 25:21</span></span>

Isaac entreated the Lord for his wife--Though tried in a similar way to
his father, he did not follow the same crooked policy. Twenty years he
continued unblessed with offspring, whose seed was to be "as the stars"
\[[Gen 26:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#004)\]. But in answer to their
mutual prayers ([Pe1 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#007)), Rebekah was
divinely informed that she was to be the mother of twins, who should be
the progenitors of two independent nations; that the descendants of the
younger should be the more powerful and subdue those of the other ([Rom
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#012); [Ch2
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#008)).

[Genesis 25:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">gen 25:27</span></span>

the boys grew--from the first, opposite to each other in character,
manners, and habits.

[Genesis 25:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">gen 25:28</span></span>

The parents were divided in their affection; and while the grounds, at
least of the father's partiality, were weak, the distinction made
between the children led, as such conduct always does, to unhappy
consequences.

[Genesis 25:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">gen 25:29</span></span>

Jacob sod pottage--made of lentils or small beans, which are common in
Egypt and Syria. It is probable that it was made of Egyptian beans,
which Jacob had procured as a dainty; for Esau was a stranger to it. It
is very palatable; and to the weary hunter, faint with hunger, its odor
must have been irresistibly tempting.

[Genesis 25:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">gen 25:31</span></span>

Jacob said, Sell me . . . thy birthright--that is, the rights and
privileges of the first-born, which were very important, the chief being
that they were the family priests ([Exo
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#022)) and had a double portion of the
inheritance ([Deu 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#017)).

[Genesis 25:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">gen 25:32</span></span>

Esau said . . . I am at the point to die--that is, I am running daily
risk of my life; and of what use will the birthright be to me: so he
despised or cared little about it, in comparison with gratifying his
appetite--he threw away his religious privileges for a trifle; and
thence he is styled "a profane person" ([Heb
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#016); also [Job
31:7](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#007), [Job
31:16](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#016); [Job
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#013); [Phi
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#019)). "There was never any meat,
except the forbidden fruit, so dear bought, as this broth of Jacob"
\[BISHOP HALL\].
