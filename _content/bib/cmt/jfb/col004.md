### [Colossians Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#001)

[Colossians 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">col 4:1</span></span>

EXHORTATIONS CONTINUED. TO PRAYER: WISDOM IN RELATION TO THE
UNCONVERTED: AS TO THE BEARERS OF THE EPISTLE, TYCHICUS AND ONESIMUS:
CLOSING SALUTATIONS. (Col. 4:1-18)

give--Greek "render": literally, "afford."

equal--that is, as the slaves owe their duties to you, so you equally
owe to them your duties as masters. Compare "ye masters do the same
things" (see on [Eph 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#009)). ALFORD
translates, "fairness," "equity," which gives a large and liberal
interpretation of justice in common matters ([Plm
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#016)).

knowing-- ([Col 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#024)).

ye also--as well as they.

[Colossians 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">col 4:2</span></span>

Continue--Greek, "Continue perseveringly," "persevere" ([Eph
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#018)), "watching thereunto"; here,
"watch in the same," or "in it," that is, in prayer: watching against
the indolence as to prayer, and in prayer, of our corrupt wills.

with thanksgiving--for everything, whether joyful, or sorrowful, mercies
temporal and spiritual, national, family, and individual ([Co1
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#017); [Phi
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#006); [Th1
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#018)).

[Colossians 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">col 4:3</span></span>

for us--myself and Timothy ([Col 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#001)).

a door of utterance--Translate, "a door for the word." Not as in [Eph
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#019), where power of "utterance" is
his petition. Here it is an opportunity for preaching the word, which
would be best afforded by his release from prison ([Co1
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#009); [Co2
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#012); [Plm
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#022); [Rev
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#008)).

to speak--so that we may speak.

the mystery of Christ-- ([Col 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#027)).

for which . . . also--on account of which I am (not only "an
ambassador," [Eph 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#020), but) ALSO in
bonds.

[Colossians 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">col 4:4</span></span>

ALFORD thinks that Paul asks their prayers for his release as if it were
the "only" way by which he could "make it (the Gospel) manifest" as he
ought. But while this is included in their subject of prayer, [Phi
1:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#012), written somewhat later in his
imprisonment, clearly shows that "a door for the word" could be opened,
and was opened, for its manifestation, even while he remained imprisoned
(compare [Ti2 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#009)).

[Colossians 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">col 4:5</span></span>

(See on [Eph 5:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#015).)

in wisdom--practical Christian prudence.

them . . . without--Those not in the Christian brotherhood ([Co1
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#012); [Th1
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#012)). The brethren, through love,
will make allowances for an indiscreet act or word of a brother; the
world will make none. Therefore be the more on your guard in your
intercourse with the latter, lest you be a stumbling-block to their
conversion.

redeeming the time--The Greek expresses, buying up for yourselves, and
buying off from worldly vanities the opportunity, whenever it is
afforded you, of good to yourselves and others. "Forestall the
opportunity, that is, to buy up an article out of the market, so as to
make the largest profit from it" \[CONYBEARE and HOWSON\].

[Colossians 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">col 4:6</span></span>

with grace--Greek, "IN grace" as its element ([Col
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#016); [Eph
4:29](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#029)). Contrast the case of those "of
the world" who "therefore speak of the world" ([Jo1
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#005)). Even the smallest leaf of the
believer should be full of the sap of the Holy Spirit ([Jer
17:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#007)). His conversation should be
cheerful without levity, serious without gloom. Compare [Luk
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#022); [Joh
7:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#046), as to Jesus' speech.

seasoned with salt--that is, the savor of fresh and lively spiritual
wisdom and earnestness, excluding all "corrupt communication," and also
tasteless insipidity ([Mat 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#013); [Mar
9:50](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#050); [Eph
4:29](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#029)). Compare all the sacrifices
seasoned with salt ([Lev 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#013)). Not
far from Colosse, in Phrygia, there was a salt lake, which gives to the
image here the more appropriateness.

how ye ought to answer every man-- ([Pe1
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#015)).

[Colossians 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">col 4:7</span></span>

Tychicus--(See on [Eph 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#002)).

who is a beloved brother--rather, "the beloved brother"; the article
"the" marks him as well known to them.

[Colossians 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">col 4:8</span></span>

for the same purpose--Greek, "for this very purpose."

that he might know your estate--Translate, "that he may know your
state": answering to [Col 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#007). So one
very old manuscript and Vulgate read. But the oldest manuscripts and the
old Latin versions, "that YE may know OUR state." However, the latter
reading seems likely to have crept in from [Eph
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#022). Paul was the more anxious to
know the state of the Colossians, on account of the seductions to which
they were exposed from false teachers; owing to which he had "great
conflict for" them ([Col 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#001)).

comfort your hearts--distressed as ye are by my imprisonment, as well as
by your own trials.

[Colossians 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">col 4:9</span></span>

Onesimus--the slave mentioned in the Epistle to Philemon ([Plm
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#010), [Plm
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#016)), "a brother beloved."

a faithful . . . brother--rather, "the faithful brother," he being known
to the Colossians as the slave of Philemon, their fellow townsman and
fellow Christian.

one of you--belonging to your city.

They shall make known unto you all things--Greek, "all the things here."
This substantial repetition of "all my state shall Tychicus declare unto
you," strongly favors the reading of English Version in [Col
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#008), "that he might (may) know your
state," as it is unlikely the same thing should be stated thrice.

[Colossians 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">col 4:10</span></span>

Aristarchus--a Macedonian of Thessalonica ([Act
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#002)), who was dragged into the
theater at Ephesus, during the tumult with Gaius, they being "Paul's
companions in travel." He accompanied Paul to Asia ([Act
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#004)), and subsequently ([Act
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#002)) to Rome. He was now at Rome with
Paul (compare [Plm 1:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#023)). As he is
here spoken of as Paul's "fellow prisoner," but in [Plm
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#024) as Paul's "fellow laborer"; and
vice versa, Epaphras in [Plm 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#023), as
his "fellow prisoner," but here ([Col
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#007)) "fellow servant," MEYER in
ALFORD, conjectures that Paul's friends voluntarily shared his
imprisonment by turns, Aristarchus being his fellow prisoner when he
wrote to the Colossians, Epaphras when he wrote to Philemon. The Greek
for "fellow prisoner" is literally, fellow captive, an image from
prisoners taken in warfare, Christians being "fellow soldiers" ([Phi
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#025); [Plm
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#002)), whose warfare is "the good fight
of faith."

Mark--John Mark ([Act 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#012), [Act
12:25](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#025)); the Evangelist according to
tradition.

sister's son--rather, "cousin," or "kinsman to Barnabas"; the latter
being the better known is introduced to designate Mark. The relationship
naturally accounts for Barnabas' selection of Mark as his companion when
otherwise qualified; and also for Mark's mother's house at Jerusalem
being the place of resort of Christians there ([Act
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#012)). The family belonged to Cyprus
([Act 4:36](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#036)); this accounts for
Barnabas' choice of Cyprus as the first station on their journey ([Act
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#004)), and for Mark's accompanying
them readily so far, it being the country of his family; and for Paul's
rejecting him at the second journey for not having gone further than
Perga, in Pamphylia, but having gone thence home to his mother at
Jerusalem ([Mat 10:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#037)) on the first
journey ([Act 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#013)).

touching whom--namely, Mark.

ye received commandments--possibly before the writing of this Epistle;
or the "commandments" were verbal by Tychicus, and accompanying this
letter, since the past tense was used by the ancients (where we use the
present) in relation to the time which it would be when the letter was
read by the Colossians. Thus ([Plm
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#019)), "I have written," for "I
write." The substance of them was, "If he come unto you, receive him."
Paul's rejection of him on his second missionary journey, because he had
turned back at Perga on the first journey ([Act
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#013); [Act
15:37-39](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#037)), had caused an alienation
between himself and Barnabas. Christian love soon healed the breach; for
here he implies his restored confidence in Mark, makes honorable
allusion to Barnabas, and desires that those at Colosse who had regarded
Mark in consequence of that past error with suspicion, should now
"receive" him with kindness. Colosse is only about one hundred ten miles
from Perga, and less than twenty from the confines of Pisidia, through
which province Paul and Barnabas preached on their return during the
same journey. Hence, though Paul had not personally visited the
Colossian Church, they knew of the past unfaithfulness of Mark; and
needed this recommendation of him, after the temporary cloud on him, so
as to receive him, now that he was about to visit them as an evangelist.
Again, in Paul's last imprisonment, he, for the last time, speaks of
Mark ([Ti2 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#011)).

[Colossians 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">col 4:11</span></span>

Justus--that is, righteous; a common name among the Jews; Hebrew,
"tzadik" ([Act 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#023)).

of the circumcision--This implies that Epaphras, Luke, and Demas ([Col
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#012), [Col
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#014)) were not of the circumcision.
This agrees with Luke's Gentile name (the same as Lucanus), and the
Gentile aspect of his Gospel.

These only, &c.--namely, of the Jews. For the Jewish teachers were
generally opposed to the apostle of the Gentiles ([Phi
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#015)). Epaphras, &c., were also fellow
laborers, but Gentiles.

unto--that is, in promoting the Gospel kingdom.

which have been--Greek, "which have been made," or "have become," that
is, inasmuch as they have become a comfort to me. The Greek implies
comfort in forensic dangers; a different Greek word expresses comfort in
domestic affliction \[BENGEL\].

[Colossians 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">col 4:12</span></span>

Christ--The oldest manuscripts add "Jesus."

labouring fervently--As the Greek, is the same, translate, "striving
earnestly" (see on [Col 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#029) and [Col
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#001)), literally, "striving as in the
agony of a contest."

in prayers--Translate as Greek, "in his prayers."

complete--The oldest manuscripts read, "fully assured." It is
translated, "fully persuaded," [Rom
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#021); [Rom
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#005). In the expression "perfect," he
refers to what he has already said, [Col
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#028); [Col
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#002); [Col
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#014). "Perfect" implies the attainment
of the full maturity of a Christian. BENGEL joins "in all the will of
God" with "stand."

[Colossians 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">col 4:13</span></span>

a great zeal--The oldest manuscripts and Vulgate have "much labor."

for you--lest you should be seduced ([Col
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#004)); a motive why you should be
anxious for yourselves.

them that are in Laodicea . . . Hierapolis--churches probably founded by
Epaphras, as the Church in Colosse was. Laodicea, called from Laodice,
queen of Antiochus II, on the river Lycus, was, according to the
subscription to First Timothy, "the chiefest city of Phrygia Pacatiana"
([Ti1 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#021)). All the three cities were
destroyed by an earthquake in A.D. 62 \[TACITUS, Annals, 14.27\].
Hierapolis was six Roman miles north of Laodicea.

[Colossians 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">col 4:14</span></span>

It is conjectured that Luke "the beloved physician" (the same as the
Evangelist), may have first become connected with Paul in professionally
attending on him in the sickness under which he labored in Phrygia and
Galatia (in which latter place he was detained by sickness), in the
early part of that journey wherein Luke first is found in his company
([Act 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#010); compare Note, see on [Gal
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#013)). Thus the allusion to his
medical profession is appropriate in writing to men of Phrygia. Luke
ministered to Paul in his last imprisonment ([Ti2
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#011)).

Demas--included among his "fellow laborers" ([Plm
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#024)), but afterwards a deserter from
him through love of this world ([Ti2
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#010)). He alone has here no honorable
or descriptive epithet attached to his name. Perhaps, already, his real
character was betraying itself.

[Colossians 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">col 4:15</span></span>

Nymphas--of Laodicea.

church . . . in his house--So old manuscripts and Vulgate read. The
oldest read, "THEIR house"; and one manuscript, "HER house," which makes
Nymphas a woman.

[Colossians 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">col 4:16</span></span>

the epistle from Laodicea--namely, the Epistle which I wrote to the
Laodiceans, and which you will get from them on applying to them. Not
the Epistle to the Ephesians. See Introduction to Ephesians and
Introduction to Colossians. The Epistles from the apostles were publicly
read in the church assemblies. IGNATIUS \[Epistle to the Ephesians,
12\], POLYCARP \[Epistle to the Philippians, 3.11,12\], CLEMENT
\[Epistle to the Corinthians, 1. 47\], [Th1
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#027); [Rev
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#003), "Blessed is he that readeth, and
they that hear." Thus, they and the Gospels were put on a level with the
Old Testament, which was similarly read ([Deu
31:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#011)). The Holy Spirit inspired Paul
to write, besides those extant, other Epistles which He saw necessary
for that day, and for particular churches; and which were not so for the
Church of all ages and places. It is possible that as the Epistle to the
Colossians was to be read for the edification of other churches besides
that of Colosse; so the Epistle to the Ephesians was to be read in
various churches besides Ephesus, and that Laodicea was the last of such
churches before Colosse, whence he might designate the Epistle to the
Ephesians here as "the Epistle from Laodicea." But it is equally
possible that the Epistle meant was one to the Laodiceans themselves.

[Colossians 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">col 4:17</span></span>

say to Archippus--The Colossians (not merely the clergy, but the laymen)
are directed, "Speak ye to Archippus." This proves that Scripture
belongs to the laity as well as the clergy; and that laymen may
profitably admonish the clergy in particular cases when they do so in
meekness. BENGEL suggests that Archippus was perhaps prevented from
going to the Church assembly by weak health or age. The word, "fulfil,"
accords with his ministry being near its close ([Col
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#025); compare [Plm
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#002)). However, "fulfil" may mean, as
in [Ti2 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#005), "make full proof of thy
ministry." "Give all diligence to follow it out fully"; a monition
perhaps needed by Archippus.

in the Lord--The element in which every work of the Christian, and
especially the Christian minister, is to be done ([Col
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#007); [Co1
7:39](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#039); [Phi
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#002)).

[Colossians 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">col 4:18</span></span>

Paul's autograph salutation (so [Co1
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#021); [Th2
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#017)), attesting that the preceding
letter, though written by an amanuensis, is from himself.

Remember my bonds--Already in this chapter he had mentioned his "bonds"
([Col 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#003)), and again [Col
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#010), an incentive why they should
love and pray ([Col 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#003)) for him; and
still more, that they should, in reverential obedience to his monitions
in this Epistle, shrink from the false teaching herein stigmatized,
remembering what a conflict ([Col 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#001))
he had in their behalf amidst his bonds. "When we read of his chains, we
should not forget that they moved over the paper as he wrote; his
\[right\] hand was chained to the \[left hand of the\] soldier who kept
him" \[ALFORD\].

Grace be with you--Greek, "THE grace" which every Christian enjoys in
some degree, and which flows from God in Christ by the Holy Ghost ([Tit
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#015); [Heb
13:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#025))
