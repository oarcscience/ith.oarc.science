Testaments*, by Robert Jamieson, A.R. Fausset and David Brown \[1882\]

### [Jude Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#001)

[Jude 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jde 1:1</span></span>

servant of Jesus Christ--as His minister and apostle.

brother of James--who was more widely known as bishop of Jerusalem and
"brother of the Lord" (that is, either cousin, or stepbrother, being son
of Joseph by a former marriage; for ancient traditions universally agree
that Mary, Jesus' mother, continued perpetually a virgin). Jude
therefore calls himself modestly "brother of James." See my
Introduction.

to them . . . sanctified by God the Father--The oldest manuscripts and
versions, ORIGEN, LUCIFER, and others read, "beloved" for sanctified. If
English Version be read, compare [Col
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#012); [Pe1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#002). The Greek is not "by," but "in."
God the Father's love is the element IN which they are "beloved." Thus
the conclusion, [Jde 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#021),
corresponds, "Keep yourselves in the love of God." Compare "beloved of
the Lord" [Th2 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#013).

preserved in Jesus Christ--"kept." Translate not "in," but as Greek,
"FOR Jesus Christ." "Kept continually (so the Greek perfect participle
means) by God the Father for Jesus Christ," against the day of His
coming. Jude, beforehand, mentions the source and guarantee for the
final accomplishment of believers' salvation; lest they should be
disheartened by the dreadful evils which he proceeds to announce
\[BENGEL\].

and called--predicated of "them that are beloved in God the Father, and
preserved in Jesus Christ: who are called." God's effectual calling in
the exercise of His divine prerogative, guarantees their eternal safety.

[Jude 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jde 1:2</span></span>

Mercy--in a time of wretchedness. Therefore mercy stands first; the
mercy of Christ ([Jde 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#021)).

peace--in the Holy Ghost ([Jde 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#020)).

love--of God ([Jde 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#021)). The three
answer to the divine Trinity.

be multiplied--in you and towards you.

[Jude 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jde 1:3</span></span>

Design of the Epistle (compare [Jde
1:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#020)).

all diligence-- ([Pe2 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#005)). As the
minister is to give all diligence to admonish, so the people should, in
accordance with his admonition, give all diligence to have all Christian
graces, and to make their calling sure.

the common salvation--wrought by Christ. Compare Note, see on [Pe2
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#001), "obtained LIKE precious faith,"
This community of faith, and of the object of faith, salvation, forms
the ground of mutual exhortation by appeals to common hopes and fears.

it was needful for me--rather, "I felt it necessary to write (now at
once; so the Greek aorist means; the present infinitive 'to write,'
which precedes, expresses merely the general fact of writing) exhorting
you." The reason why he felt it necessary "to write with exhortation,"
he states, [Jde 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#004), "For there are
certain men crept in," &c. Having intended to write generally of "the
common salvation," he found it necessary from the existing evils in the
Church, to write specially that they should contend for the faith
against those evils.

earnestly contend--Compare [Phi 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#027),
"striving together for the faith of the Gospel."

once, &c.--Greek, "once for all delivered." No other faith or revelation
is to supersede it. A strong argument for resisting heretical innovators
([Jde 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#004)). Believers, like Nehemiah's
workmen ([Neh 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#017)), with one hand
"build themselves up in their most holy faith"; with the other they"
contend earnestly for the faith" against its foes.

the saints--all Christians, holy (that is, consecrated to God) by their
calling, and in God's design.

[Jude 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jde 1:4</span></span>

certain men--implying disparagement.

crept in unawares--stealthily and unlawfully. See on [Pe2
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#001), "privily shall bring in damnable
heresies."

before . . . ordained--Greek, "forewritten," namely, in Peter's prophecy
[Jde 1:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#017); and in Paul's before
that, [Ti1 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#001); [Ti2
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#001); and by implication in the
judgments which overtook the apostate angels. The disobedient
Israelites, Sodom and Gomorrah, Balaam and Core, and which are written
"for an example" ([Jde 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#007), and [Jde
1:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#005), [Jde
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#011)). God's eternal character as the
Punisher of sin, as set forth in Scripture "of old," is the ground on
which such apostate characters are ordained to condemnation. Scripture
is the reflection of God's book of life in which believers are "written
among the living." "Forewritten" is applied also in [Rom
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#004) to the things written in
Scripture. Scripture itself reflects God's character from everlasting,
which is the ground of His decrees from everlasting. BENGEL explains it
as an abbreviated phrase for, "They were of old foretold by Enoch ([Jde
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#014), who did not write his
prophecies), and afterwards marked out by the written word."

to this condemnation--Jude graphically puts their judgment as it were
present before the eyes, "THIS." Enoch's prophecy comprises the "ungodly
men" of the last days before Christ's coming to judgment, as well as
their forerunners, the "ungodly men" before the flood, the type of the
last judgment ([Mat 24:37-39](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#037); [Pe2
3:3-7](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#003)). The disposition and the doom
of both correspond.

the grace of our God--A phrase for the Gospel especially sweet to
believers who appropriate God in Christ as "our God," and so rendering
the more odious the vile perversity of those who turn the Gospel state
of grace and liberty into a ground of licentiousness, as if their
exemption from the law gave them a license to sin.

denying the only Lord--The oldest manuscripts, versions, and Fathers
omit "God," which follows in English Version. Translate as the Greek,
"the only Master"; here used of Jesus Christ, who is at once Master and
"Lord" (a different Greek word). See on [Pe2
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#001). By virtue of Christ's perfect
oneness with the Father, He, as well as the Father, is termed "the ONLY"
God and "MASTER." Greek, "Master," implies God's absolute ownership to
dispose of His creatures as He likes.

[Jude 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jde 1:5</span></span>

([Heb 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#016); [Heb
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#013).)

therefore--Other oldest manuscripts and Vulgate read, "But"; in contrast
to the ungodly [Jde 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#004).

though ye once--rather, "once for all." Translate, "I wish to remind
you, as knowing ALL (namely, that I am referring to; so the oldest
manuscripts, versions, and Fathers) once for all." As already they know
all the facts once for all, he needs only to "remind" them.

the Lord--The oldest manuscripts and versions read, "Jesus." So "Christ"
is said to have accompanied the Israelites in the wilderness; so
perfectly is Jesus one with the God of the Israelite theocracy.

saved--brought safely, and into a state of safety and salvation.

afterward--Greek, "secondly"; in the next instance "destroyed them that
believed not," as contrasted with His in the first instance having saved
them.

[Jude 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jde 1:6</span></span>

([Pe2 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#004).)

kept not their first estate--Vulgate translates, "their own
principality," which the fact of angels being elsewhere called
"principalities," favors: "their own" implies that, instead of being
content with the dignity once for all assigned to them under the Son of
God, they aspired higher. ALFORD thinks the narrative in [Gen
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#002) is alluded to, not the fall of the
devil and his angels, as he thinks "giving themselves over to
fornication" ([Jde 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#007)) proves;
compare Greek, "in like manner to these," namely, to the angels ([Jde
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#006)). It seems to me more natural to
take "sons of God" ([Gen 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#002)) of the
Sethites, than of angels, who, as "spirits," do not seem capable of
carnal connection. The parallel, [Pe2
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#004), plainly refers to the fall of the
apostate angels. And "in like manner to these," [Jde
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#007), refers to the inhabitants of
Sodom and Gomorrah, "the cities about them" sinning "in like manner" as
"they" did \[ESTIUS and CALVIN\]. Even if Greek "these," [Jde
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#007), refer to the angels, the sense of
"in like manner as these" will be, not that the angels carnally
fornicated with the daughters of men, but that their ambition, whereby
their affections went away from God and they fell, is in God's view a
sin of like kind spiritually as Sodom's going away from God's order of
nature after strange flesh; the sin of the apostate angels after their
kind is analogous to that of the human Sodomites after their kind.
Compare the somewhat similar spiritual connection of whoremongers and
covetousness. The apocryphal book of Enoch interprets [Gen
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#002) as ALFORD. But though Jude accords
with it in some particulars, it does not follow that he accords with it
in all. The Hebrews name the fallen angels Aza and Azael.

left--on their own accord.

their own--Greek, "their proper."

habitation--heaven, all bright and glorious, as opposed to the
"darkness" to which they now are doomed. Their ambitious designs seem to
have had a peculiar connection with this earth, of which Satan before
his fall may have been God's vicegerent, whence arises his subsequent
connection with it as first the Tempter, then "the prince of this
world."

reserved--As the Greek is the same, and there is an evident reference to
their having "kept not their first estate," translate, "He hath kept."
Probably what is meant is, He hath kept them in His purpose; that is
their sure doom; moreover, as yet, Satan and his demons roam at large on
the earth. An earnest of their doom is their having been cast out of
heaven, being already restricted to "the darkness of this present
world," the "air" that surrounds the earth, their peculiar element now.
They lurk in places of gloom and death, looking forward with agonizing
fear to their final torment in the bottomless pit. He means not literal
chains and darkness, but figurative in this present world where, with
restricted powers and liberties, shut out from heaven, they, like
condemned prisoners, await their doom.

[Jude 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jde 1:7</span></span>

Even as--ALFORD translates, "I wish to remind you ([Jde
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#005)) that."

Sodom, &c.-- ([Pe2 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#006)).

giving themselves over to fornication--following fornication
extraordinarily, that is, out of the order of nature. On "in like manner
to them" (Greek), compare Note, see on [Jde
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#006). Compare on spiritual fornication,
"go a whoring from thee," [Psa 73:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#027).

going after strange flesh--departing from the course of nature, and
going after that which is unnatural. In later times the most enlightened
heathen nations indulged in the sin of Sodom without compunction or
shame.

are set forth--before our eyes.

suffering--undergoing to this present time; alluding to the marks of
volcanic fire about the Dead Sea.

the vengeance--Greek, "righteous retribution."

eternal fire--The lasting marks of the fire that consumed the cities
irreparably, is a type of the eternal fire to which the inhabitants have
been consigned. BENGEL translates as the Greek will admit, "Suffering
(the) punishment (which they endure) as an example or sample of eternal
fire (namely, that which shall consume the wicked)." [Eze
16:53-55](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#053) shows that Sodom's
punishment, as a nation, is not eternal. Compare also [Pe2
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#006).

[Jude 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jde 1:8</span></span>

also--rather, "In like manner nevertheless" (notwithstanding these
warning examples) \[ALFORD\].

these . . . dreamers--The Greek has not "filthy" of English Version. The
clause, "these men dreaming" (that is, in their dreams), belongs to all
the verbs, "defile," "despise," and "speak evil." All sinners are
spiritually asleep, and their carnal activity is as it were a dream
([Th1 5:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#006)). Their speaking evil of
dignities is because they are dreaming, and know not what they are
speaking evil of ([Jde 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#010)). "As a
man dreaming seems to himself to be seeing and nearing many things, so
the natural man's lusts are agitated by joy, distress, fear, and the
other passions. But he is a stranger to self-command. Hence, though he
bring into play all the powers of reason, he cannot conceive the true
liberty which the sons of light, who are awake and in the daylight;
enjoy" \[BENGEL\].

defile the flesh-- ([Jde 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#007)).

dominion--"lordship."

dignities--literally, "glories." Earthly and heavenly dignities.

[Jude 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jde 1:9</span></span>

Michael, the archangel--Nowhere in Scripture is the plural used,
"archangels"; but only ONE, "archangel." The only other passage in the
New Testament where it occurs, is [Th1
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#016), where Christ is distinguished
from the archangel, with whose voice He shall descend to raise the dead;
they therefore err who confound Christ with Michael. The name means, Who
is like God? In [Dan 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#013) he is
called "One ('the first,' Margin) of the chief princes." He is the
champion angel of Israel. In [Rev 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#007)
the conflict between Michael and Satan is again alluded to.

about the body of Moses--his literal body. Satan, as having the power of
death, opposed the raising of it again, on the ground of Moses' sin at
Meribah, and his murder of the Egyptian. That Moses' body was raised,
appears from his presence with Elijah and Jesus (who were in the body)
at the Transfiguration: the sample and earnest of the coming
resurrection kingdom, to be ushered in by Michael's standing up for
God's people. Thus in each dispensation a sample and pledge of the
future resurrection was given: Enoch in the patriarchal dispensation,
Moses in the Levitical, Elijah in the prophetical. It is noteworthy that
the same rebuke is recorded here as was used by the Angel of the Lord,
or Jehovah the Second Person, in pleading for Joshua, the representative
of the Jewish Church, against Satan, in [Zac
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#002); whence some have thought that
also here "the body of Moses" means the Jewish Church accused by Satan,
before God, for its filthiness, on which ground he demands that divine
justice should take its course against Israel, but is rebuked by the
Lord who has "chosen Jerusalem": thus, as "the body of Christ" is the
Christian Church, so "the body of Moses" is the Jewish Church. But the
literal body is evidently here meant (though, secondarily, the Jewish
Church is typified by Moses' body, as it was there represented by Joshua
the high priest); and Michael, whose connection seems to be so close
with Jehovah-Messiah on the one hand, and with Israel on the other,
naturally uses the same language as his Lord. As Satan (adversary in
court) or the devil (accuser) accuses alike the Church collectively and
"the brethren" individually, so Christ pleads for us as our Advocate.
Israel's, and all believers' full justification, and the accuser's being
rebuked finally, is yet future. JOSEPHUS \[Antiquities,4.8\], states
that God hid Moses' body, lest, if it had been exposed to view, it would
have been made an idol of. Jude, in this account, either adopts it from
the apocryphal "assumption of Moses" (as ORIGEN \[Concerning
Principalities, 3.2\] thinks), or else from the ancient tradition on
which that work was founded. Jude, as inspired, could distinguish how
much of the tradition was true, how much false. We have no such means of
distinguishing, and therefore can be sure of no tradition, save that
which is in the written word.

durst not--from reverence for Satan's former dignity ([Jde
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#008)).

railing accusation--Greek, "judgment of blasphemy," or evil-speaking.
Peter said, Angels do not, in order to avenge themselves, rail at
dignities, though ungodly, when they have to contend with them: Jude
says that the archangel Michael himself did not rail even at the time
when he fought with the devil, the prince of evil spirits--not from fear
of him, but from reverence of God, whose delegated power in this world
Satan once had, and even in some degree still has. From the word
"disputed," or debated in controversy, it is plain it was a judicial
contest.

[Jude 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jde 1:10</span></span>

([Pe2 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#012).)

those things which--Greek, "all things whatsoever they understand not,"
namely, the things of the spiritual world.

but what . . . naturally--Connect thus, "Whatever (so the Greek) things
naturally (by natural, blind instinct), as the unreasoning (so the
Greek) animals, they know," &c. The Greek for the former "know" implies
deeper knowledge; the latter "know," the mere perception of the "animal
senses and faculties."

[Jude 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jde 1:11</span></span>

Woe--See on [Pe2 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#014), "cursed
children."

Cain--the murderer: the root of whose sin was hatred and envy of the
godly, as it is the sin of these seducers.

ran greedily--literally, "have been poured forth" like a torrent that
has burst its banks. Reckless of what it costs, the loss of God's favor
and heaven, on they rush after gain like Balaam.

perished in the gainsaying of Core--(compare Note, see on [Jde
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#012)). When we read of Korah perishing
by gainsaying, we read virtually also of these perishing in like manner
through the same: for the same seed bears the same harvest.

[Jude 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jde 1:12</span></span>

spots--So [Pe2 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#013), Greek, "spiloi";
but here the Greek is spilades, which elsewhere, in secular writers,
means rocks, namely, on which the Christian love-feasts were in danger
of being shipwrecked. The oldest manuscript prefixes the article
emphatically, "THE rocks." The reference to "clouds . . . winds . . .
waves of the sea," accords with this image of rocks. Vulgate seems to
have been misled by the similar sounding word to translate, as English
Version, "spots"; compare however, [Jde
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#023), which favors English Version, if
the Greek will bear it. Two oldest manuscripts, by the transcriber's
effort to make Jude say the same as Peter, read here "deceivings" for
"love-feasts," but the weightiest manuscript and authorities support
English Version reading. The love-feast accompanied the Lord's Supper
(1Co. 11:17-34, end). Korah the Levite, not satisfied with his ministry,
aspired to the sacrificing priesthood also: so ministers in the Lord's
Supper have sought to make it a sacrifice, and themselves the
sacrificing priests, usurping the function of our only Christian
sacerdotal Priest, Christ Jesus. Let them beware of Korah's doom!

feeding themselves--Greek, "pasturing (tending) themselves." What they
look to is the pampering of themselves, not the feeding of the flock.

without fear--Join these words not as English Version, but with "feast."
Sacred feasts especially ought to be celebrated with fear. Feasting is
not faulty in itself \[BENGEL\], but it needs to be accompanied with
fear of forgetting God, as Job in the case of his sons' feasts.

clouds--from which one would expect refreshing rains. [Pe2
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#017), "wells without water."
Professors without practice.

carried about--The oldest manuscripts have "carried aside," that is, out
of the right course (compare [Eph
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#014)).

trees whose fruit withereth--rather, "trees of the late (or waning)
autumn," namely, when there are no longer leaves or fruits on the trees
\[BENGEL\].

without fruit--having no good fruit of knowledge and practice; sometimes
used of what is positively bad.

twice dead--First when they cast their leaves in autumn, and seem during
winter dead, but revive again in spring; secondly, when they are
"plucked up by the roots." So these apostates, once dead in unbelief,
and then by profession and baptism raised from the death of sin to the
life of righteousness, but now having become dead again by apostasy, and
so hopelessly dead. There is a climax. Not only without leaves, like
trees in late autumn, but without fruit: not only so, but dead twice;
and to crown all, "plucked up by the roots."

[Jude 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jde 1:13</span></span>

Raging--wild. Jude has in mind [Isa
57:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#020).

shame--plural in Greek, "shames" (compare [Phi
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#019)).

wandering stars--instead of moving on in a regular orbit, as lights to
the world, bursting forth on the world like erratic comets, or rather,
meteors of fire, with a strange glare, and then doomed to fall back
again into the blackness of gloom.

[Jude 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jde 1:14</span></span>

See Introduction on the source whence Jude derived this prophecy of
Enoch. The Holy Spirit, by Jude, has sealed the truth of this much of
the matter contained in the book of Enoch, though probably that book, as
well as Jude, derived it from tradition (compare Note, see on [Jde
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#009)). There are reasons given by some
for thinking the book of Enoch copied from Jude rather than vice versa.
It is striking how, from the first, prophecy hastened towards its
consummation. The earliest prophecies of the Redeemer dwell on His
second coming in glory, rather than His first coming in lowliness
(compare [Gen 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#015) with [Rom
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#020)). Enoch, in his translation
without death, illustrated that truth which he all his life preached to
the unbelieving world, the certainty of the Lord's coming, and the
resurrection of the dead, as the only effectual antidote to their
skepticism and self-wise confidence in nature's permanence.

And Enoch--Greek, "Moreover, also Enoch," &c.

seventh from Adam--Seven is the sacred number. In Enoch, freedom from
death and the sacred number are combined: for every seventh object is
most highly valued. Jude thus shows the antiquity of the prophecies.
Compare Note, see on [Jde 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#004), "of
old." There were only five fathers between Enoch and Adam. The seventh
from Adam prophesied the things which shall close the seventh age of the
world \[BENGEL\].

of these--in relation to these. The reference of his prophecies was not
to the antediluvians alone, but to all the ungodly ([Jde
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#015)). His prophecy applied primarily
indeed to the flood, but ultimately to the final judgment.

cometh--literally, "came." Prophecy regards the future as certain as if
it were past.

saints--Holy angels (compare [Deu
33:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#002); [Dan
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#010); [Zac
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#005); [Mat
25:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#031); [Heb
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#022)).

[Jude 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jde 1:15</span></span>

This verse and the beginning of Enoch's prophecy is composed in Hebrew
poetic parallelism, the oldest specimen extant. Some think Lamech's
speech, which is also in poetic parallelism, was composed in mockery of
Enoch's prophecy: as Enoch foretold Jehovah's coming to judgment, so
Lamech presumes on impunity in polygamy and murder (just as Cain the
murderer seemed to escape with impunity).

convince--convict.

hard speeches--such as are noticed in [Jde
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#008), [Jde
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#010), [Jde
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#016); [Mal
3:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#013); contrast [Rom
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#017).

ungodly sinners--not merely sinners, but proud despisers of God:
impious.

against him--They who speak against God's children are regarded by God
as speaking against Himself.

[Jude 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jde 1:16</span></span>

murmurers--in secret: muttering murmurs against God's ordinances and
ministers in Church and state. Compare [Jde
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#008), "speak evil of dignities"; [Jde
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#015), "hard speeches"; against the
Lord.

complainers--never satisfied with their lot ([Num
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#001); compare the penalty, [Deu
28:47-48](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#047)).

walking after their own lusts-- ([Jde
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#018)). The secret of their murmuring
and complaining is the restless insatiability of their desires.

great swelling words-- ([Pe2 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#018)).

men's persons--their mere outward appearance and rank.

because of advantage--for the sake of what they may gain from them.
While they talk great swelling words, they are really mean and fawning
towards those of wealth and rank.

[Jude 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jde 1:17</span></span>

But; beloved . . . ye--in contrast to those reprobates, [Jde
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#020), again.

remember--implying that his readers had been contemporaries of the
apostles. For Peter uses the very same formula in reminding the
contemporaries of himself and the other apostles.

spoken before--spoken already before now.

the apostles--Peter (see on [Pe2
3:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#002)), and Paul before Peter ([Act
20:29](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#029); [Ti1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#001); [Ti2
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#001)). Jude does not exclude himself
from the number of the apostles here, for in [Jde
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#018), immediately after, he says,
"they told You," not us (rather as Greek, "used to tell you" implying
that Jude's readers were contemporaries of the apostles, who used to
tell them).

[Jude 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jde 1:18</span></span>

mockers--In the parallel, [Pe2 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#003),
the same Greek is translated, "scoffers." The word is found nowhere else
in the New Testament. How ALFORD can deny that [Pe2
3:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#002) is referred to (at least in
part), I cannot imagine, seeing that Jude quotes the very words of Peter
as the words which the apostles used to speak to his (Jude's) readers.

walk after their own ungodly lusts--literally, "after (according to)
their own lusts of ungodliness."

[Jude 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jde 1:19</span></span>

These be they--showing that their characters are such as Peter and Paul
had foretold.

separate themselves--from Church communion in its vital, spiritual
reality: for outwardly they took part in Church ordinances ([Jde
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#012)). Some oldest manuscripts omit
"themselves": then understand it, "separate," cast out members of the
Church by excommunication ([Isa 65:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#005);
[Isa 66:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#005); [Luk
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#022); [Joh
9:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#034); compare "casteth them out of the
Church;" [Jo3 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#010)). Many, however,
understand "themselves," which indeed is read in some of the oldest
manuscripts as English Version has it. Arrogant setting up of
themselves, as having greater sanctity and a wisdom and peculiar
doctrine, distinct from others, is implied.

sensual--literally, "animal-souled": as opposed to the spiritual, or
"having the Spirit." It is translated, "the natural man," [Co1
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#014). In the threefold division of
man's being, body, soul, and spirit, the due state in God's design is,
that "the spirit," which is the recipient of the Holy Spirit uniting man
to God, should be first, and should rule the soul, which stands
intermediate between the body and spirit: but in the animal, or natural
man, the spirit is sunk into subserviency to the animal soul, which is
earthly in its motives and aims. The "carnal" sink somewhat lower, for
in these the flesh, the lowest element and corrupt side of man's bodily
nature, reigns paramount.

having not the Spirit--In the animal and natural man the spirit, his
higher part, which ought to be the receiver of the Holy Spirit, is not
so; and therefore, his spirit not being in its normal state, he is said
not to have the spirit (compare [Joh
3:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#005)). In the completion of
redemption the parts of redeemed man shall be placed in their due
relation: whereas in the ungodly, the soul severed from the spirit shall
have for ever animal life without union to God and heaven--a living
death.

[Jude 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jde 1:20</span></span>

Resuming [Jde 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#017).

building up yourselves--the opposite to the "separate themselves" ([Jde
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#019)): as "in the Holy Ghost" is
opposed to "having not the Spirit."

on--as on a foundation. Building on THE FAITH is equivalent to building
on Christ, the object of faith.

praying in the Holy Ghost-- ([Rom
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#026); [Eph
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#018)). The Holy Spirit teaches what we
are to pray for, and how. None can pray aright save by being in the
Spirit, that is, in the element of His influence. CHRYSOSTOM states
that, among the charisms bestowed at the beginning of the New Testament
dispensation, was the gift of prayer, bestowed on someone who prayed in
the name of the rest, and taught others to pray. Moreover, their prayers
so conceived and often used, were received and preserved among
Christians, and out of them forms of prayer were framed. Such is the
origin of liturgies \[HAMMOND\].

[Jude 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jde 1:21</span></span>

In [Jde 1:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#020), Jude combines the
Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost: and faith, hope, and love.

Keep yourselves--not in your own strength, but "in the love of God,"
that is, God's love to you and all His believing children, the only
guarantee for their being kept safe. Man's need of watching is implied;
at the same time he cannot keep himself, unless God in His love keep
him.

looking for--in hope.

the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ--to be fully manifested at His
coming. Mercy is usually attributed to the Father: here to the Son; so
entirely one are they.

[Jude 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jde 1:22</span></span>

None but those who "keep themselves" are likely to "save" others.

have compassion--So one oldest manuscript reads. But two oldest
manuscripts, Vulgate, &c., read, "convict"; "reprove to their
conviction"; "confute, so as to convince."

making a difference--The oldest manuscripts and versions read the
accusative for the nominative, "when separating themselves" \[WAHL\],
referring to [Jde 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#019); or "when
contending with you," as the Greek is translated, [Jde
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#009).

[Jude 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jde 1:23</span></span>

save with fear--The oldest manuscripts do not read "with fear" in this
position: but after "snatching them out of the fire" (with which,
compare [Amo 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#011); [Co1
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#015); [Zac
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#002), said of a most narrow escape),
they add the following words, forming a THIRD class, "and others
compassionate with (IN) fear." Three kinds of patients require three
kinds of medical treatment. Ministers and Christians are said to "save"
those whom they are made the instruments of saving; the Greek for "save"
is present, therefore meaning "try to save." Jude already ([Jde
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#009)) had reference to the same passage
([Zac 3:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#001)). The three classes are:
(1) those who contend with you (accusative case in oldest manuscripts),
whom you should convict; (2) those who are as brands already in the
fire, of which hell-fire is the consummation: these you should try to
save by snatching them out; (3) those who are objects of compassion,
whom accordingly you should compassionate (and help if occasion should
offer), but at the same time not let pity degenerate into connivance at
their error. Your compassion is to be accompanied "with fear" of being
at all defiled by them.

hating--Even hatred has its legitimate field of exercise. Sin is the
only thing which God hates: so ought we.

even the garment--a proverbial phrase: avoiding the most remote contact
with sin, and hating that which borders on it. As garments of the
apostles wrought miracles of good in healing, so the very garment of
sinners metaphorically, that is, anything brought into contact with
their pollution, is to be avoided. Compare as to lepers and other
persons defiled, [Lev 13:52-57](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#052); [Lev
15:4-17](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#004) : the garments were held
polluted; and anyone touching them was excluded, until purified, from
religious and civil communion with the sanctified people of Israel.
Christians who received at baptism the white garment in token of purity,
are not to defile it by any approach to what is defiled.

[Jude 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jde 1:24</span></span>

Concluding doxology.

Now--Greek, "But."

you--ALFORD, on inferior authority, reads, "them." You is in
contradistinction to those ungodly men mentioned above.

keep . . . from falling--rather, "guard . . . (so as to be) without
falling," or stumbling.

faultless--Greek, "blameless."

before the presence of his glory--that is, before Himself, when He shall
be revealed in glory.

with exceeding joy--literally, "with exultation" as of those who leap
for joy.

[Jude 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jde 1:25</span></span>

To the only . . . God our Saviour--The oldest manuscripts add, "through
Jesus Christ our Lord." The transcribers, fancying that "Saviour"
applied to Christ alone, omitted the words. The sense is, To the only
God (the Father) who is our Saviour through (that is, by the mediation
of) Jesus Christ our Lord.

dominion--Greek, "might."

power--authority: legitimate power. The oldest manuscripts and Vulgate,
after "power," have "before all the age," that is, before all time as to
the past: "and now," as to the present; "and to all the ages," that is,
for ever, as to the time to come.
