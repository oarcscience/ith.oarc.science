### [Zechariah Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#001)

[Zechariah 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">zac 6:1</span></span>

EIGHTH VISION. THE FOUR CHARIOTS. ([Zac
6:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#001))

four chariots--symbolizing the various dispensations of Providence
towards the Gentile nations which had been more or less brought into
contact with Judea; especially in punishing Babylon. Compare [Zac
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#008) ("the north country," that is,
Babylon); [Zac 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#015); [Zac
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#006). The number "four" is specified
not merely in reference to the four quarters of the horizon (implying
universal judgments), but in allusion to the four world kingdoms of
Daniel.

from between two mountains--the valley of Jehoshaphat, between Moriah
and Mount Olivet \[MOORE\]; or the valley between Zion and Moriah, where
the Lord is ([Zac 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#010)), and whence He
sends forth His ministers of judgment on the heathen \[MAURER\]. The
temple on Mount Moriah is the symbol of the theocracy; hence the nearest
spot accessible to chariots in the valley below is the most suitable for
a vision affecting Judah in relation to the Gentile world powers. The
chariot is the symbol of war, and so of judgments.

of brass--the metal among the ancients representing hard solidity; so
the immovable and resistless firmness of God's people (compare [Jer
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#018)). CALVIN explains the "two
mountains" thus: The secret purpose of God from eternity does not come
forth to view before the execution, but is hidden and kept back
irresistibly till the fit time, as it were between lofty mountains; the
chariots are the various changes wrought in nations, which, as swift
heralds, announce to us what before we knew not. The "two" may thus
correspond to the number of the "olive trees" ([Zac
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#003)); the allusion to the "two
mountains" near the temple is not necessarily excluded in this view.
HENDERSON explains them to be the Medo-Persian kingdom, represented by
the "two horns" ([Dan 8:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#003)), now
employed to execute God's purpose in punishing the nations; but the
prophecy reaches far beyond those times.

[Zechariah 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">zac 6:2</span></span>

red--implying carnage.

black--representing sorrow; also famine ([Rev
6:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#005); compare [Zac
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#008)).

[Zechariah 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">zac 6:3</span></span>

white--implying joy and victory \[CALVIN\].

grizzled--piebald. Implying a mixed dispensation, partly prosperity,
partly adversity. All four dispensations, though various in character to
the Gentile nation, portended alike good to God's people.

bay--rather, "strong" or "fleet"; so Vulgate \[GESENIUS\]. The horses
have this epithet, whose part it was to "walk to and fro through the
earth" ([Zac 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#007)). However, the
Septuagint and Chaldee agree with English Version in referring the
Hebrew to color, not strength.

[Zechariah 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">zac 6:4</span></span>

The prophet humbly and teachably seeks instruction from God, and
therefore seeks not in vain.

[Zechariah 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">zac 6:5</span></span>

four spirits of the heavens--heavenly spirits who "stand before Jehovah"
to receive God's commands ([Zac 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#014);
[Kg1 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#019); [Job
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#001); [Luk
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#019)) in heaven (of which Zion is the
counterpart on earth, see on [Zac
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#001)), and proceed with chariot speed
([Kg2 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#017); [Psa
68:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#017)) to execute them on earth in its
four various quarters ([Psa 104:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#004);
[Heb 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#007), [Heb
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#014)) \[PEMBELLUS\]. Or, the secret
impulses of God which emanate from His counsel and providence; the
prophet implies that all the revolutions in the world are from the
Spirit of God and are as it were, His messengers or spirits \[CALVIN\].

[Zechariah 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">zac 6:6</span></span>

north country--Babylon (see on [Jer
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#014)). The north is the quarter
specified in particular whence Judah and Israel are hereafter to return
to their own land ([Zac 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#006); [Jer
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#018)). "The black horses" go to
Babylon, primarily to represent the awful desolation with which Darius
visited it in the fifth year of his reign (two years after this
prophecy) for revolting \[HENDERSON\]. The "white" go after the "black"
horses to the same country; two sets being sent to it because of its
greater cruelty and guilt in respect to Judea. The white represent
Darius triumphant subjugation of it \[MOORE\]. Rather, I think, the
white are sent to victoriously subdue Medo-Persia, the second world
kingdom, lying in the same quarter as Babylon, namely, north.

grizzled . . . toward the south--that is, to Egypt, the other great foe
of God's people. It, being a part of the GrÃ&brvbr;co-Macedonian
kingdom, stands for the whole of it, the third world kingdom.

[Zechariah 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">zac 6:7</span></span>

bay--rather, the "fleet" (or "strong"). As the "red" are not otherwise
mentioned, the epithet "fleet" (as the Hebrew for "bay" ought to be
translated) in [Zac 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#003) seems to apply
to all four, and here especially to the "red." Their office is to
complete hereafter the work already in part executed by the previous
three who have stilled Babylon, Medo-Persia, and GrÃ&brvbr;co-Macedonia;
namely, to punish finally the last great foe of Israel, the final form
assumed by the fourth world kingdom, Rome, which is to continue down to
the second advent of Christ. Hence they "walk to and fro through the
earth," counterworking Satan's "going to and fro in the earth" ([Job
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#007); [Th2
2:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#008); [Ti1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#001)), in connection with the last
awful development of the fourth world kingdom. Their "fleetness" is
needed to counteract his restless activity; their red color implies the
final great carnage (Eze. 39:1-29; [Rev
19:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#017), [Rev
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#021)).

[Zechariah 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">zac 6:8</span></span>

north . . . quieted . . . my spirit--that is, caused My anger to rest
([Jdg 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#003), Margin; [Ecc
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#004); [Eze
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#013); [Eze
16:42](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#042)). Babylon alone of the four
great world kingdoms had in Zechariah's time been finally punished;
therefore, in its case alone does God now say His anger is satisfied;
the others had as yet to expiate their sin; the fourth has still to do
so.

The double crown is placed on Joshua's head, symbolizing that the true
priesthood and the kingdom shall be conferred on the one Messiah.
Compare [Heb 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#020); Heb. 7:1-21, on
Melchisedek, who similarly combined the kingdom and priesthood as type
of Messiah.

[Zechariah 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">zac 6:10</span></span>

NINTH VISION. THE CROWNING OF JOSHUA. ([Zac
6:9-15](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#009))

Take of them of the captivity--Take silver and gold ([Zac
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#011)) from them. The three named came
from Babylon (where some of the exiled Jews still were left) to present
gifts of silver and gold towards the building of the temple. But in [Zac
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#011), [Zac
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#014), "crowns" are directed to be made
of them, then to be set on Joshua's head, and to be deposited in the
temple as a memorial of the donors, until Messiah shall appear.

Heldai--meaning "robust." Called Helem below.

Tobijah--that is, "the goodness of God."

Jedaiah--that is, "God knows."

which are come from Babylon--This clause in the Hebrew comes after
"Josiah son of Zephaniah." Therefore, MOORE thinks Josiah as well as the
three "came from Babylon." But as he has a "house" at Jerusalem, he is
plainly a resident, not a visitor. Therefore English Version is right;
or MAURER, "Josiah son of Zephaniah, to whom they are come (as guests)
from Babylon."

the same day--No time was to be lost to mark the significancy of their
coming from afar to offer gifts to the temple, typifying, in the double
crown made of their gifts and set on Joshua's head, the gathering in of
Israel's outcasts to Messiah hereafter, who shall then be recognized as
the true king and priest.

[Zechariah 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">zac 6:11</span></span>

The high priest wore a crown above the miter ([Zac
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#005); [Lev
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#009)). Messiah shall wear many crowns,
one surmounting the other ([Rev
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#012)). It was a thing before unknown
in the Levitical priesthood that the same person should wear at once the
crown of a king and that of a high priest ([Psa
110:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#004); [Heb
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#010)). Messiah shall be revealed fully
in this twofold dignity when He shall "restore the kingdom to Israel"
([Act 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#006)).

[Zechariah 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">zac 6:12</span></span>

Behold, the man--namely, shall arise. Pilate unconsciously spake God's
will concerning Him, "Behold the man" ([Joh
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#005)). The sense here is, "Behold in
Joshua a remarkable shadowing forth of Messiah." It is not for his own
sake that the crown is placed on him, but as type of Messiah about to be
at once king and priest. Joshua could not personally be crowned king,
not being of the royal line of David, but only in his representative
character.

Branch--(See on [Zac 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#008); [Isa
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#002); [Jer
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005); [Jer
33:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#015)).

he shall grow up out of his place--retaining the image of a "Branch";
"He shall sprout up from His place," that is, the place peculiar to Him:
not merely from Beth-lehem or Nazareth, but by His own power, without
man's aid, in His miraculous conception \[HENDERSON\]; a sense brought
out in the original, "from under Himself," or "from (of) Himself"
\[CALVIN\]. MOORE makes it refer to His growing lowly in His place of
obscurity, "as a tender plant and a root out of a dry ground" ([Isa
53:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#002)), for thirty years unknown except
as the son of a carpenter. MAURER translates, "Under Him there shall be
growth (in the Church)." English Version accords better with the Hebrew
(compare [Exo 10:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#023)). The idea in a
Branch is that Christ's glory is growing, not yet fully manifested as a
full-grown tree. Therefore men reject Him now.

build the temple--The promise of the future true building of the
spiritual temple by Messiah ([Mat
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018); [Co1
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#017); [Co2
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#016); [Eph
2:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#020); [Heb
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#003)) is an earnest to assure the Jews,
that the material temple will be built by Joshua and Zerubbabel, in
spite of all seeming obstacles. It also raises their thoughts beyond the
material to the spiritual temple, and also to the future glorious
temple, to be reared in Israel under Messiah's superintendence (Eze.
40:1-43:27). The repetition of the same clause ([Zac
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#013)) gives emphasis to the statement
as to Messiah's work.

[Zechariah 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">zac 6:13</span></span>

bear the glory--that is, wear the insignia of the kingly glory, "the
crowns" ([Psa 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#005); [Psa
102:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#016); [Isa
52:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#013)). He himself shall bear the
glory, not thou, Joshua, though thou dost bear the crowns. The Church's
dignity is in her head alone, Christ. So Eliakim, type of Messiah, was
to have "all the glory of his father's house hung upon him" ([Isa
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#024)).

sit--implying security and permanence.

priest . . . throne-- ([Gen 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#018);
[Psa 110:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#004); [Heb
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#006), [Heb
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#010); [Heb
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#020); Heb. 7:1-28).

counsel of peace . . . between . . . both--Joshua and Zerubbabel, the
religious and civil authorities co-operating in the temple, typify the
peace, or harmonious union, between both the kingly and priestly
offices. The kingly majesty shall not depress the priestly dignity, nor
the priestly dignity the kingly majesty \[JEROME\]. The peace of the
Church, formerly sought for in the mutual "counsels" of the kings and
the priests, who had been always distinct, shall be perfectly ensured by
the concurrence of the two offices in the one Messiah, who by His
mediatorial priesthood purchases it, and by His kingly rule maintains
it. VITRINGA takes "His throne" to be Jehovah the Father's. Thus it will
be, "there shall be . . . peace between the Branch and Jehovah"
\[LUDOVICUS DE DIEU\]. The other view is better, namely, "Messiah's
throne." As Priest He expiates sin; as King, extirpates it. "Counsel of
peace," implies that it is the plan of infinite "wisdom," whence Messiah
is called "Counsellor" ([Isa 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006); [Eph
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#008), [Eph
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#011); [Heb
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#017)). Peace between the kingly and
priestly attributes of Messiah implies the harmonizing of the
conflicting claims of God's justice as a King, and His love as a Father
and Priest. Hence is produced peace to man ([Luk
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#014); [Act
10:36](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#036); [Eph
2:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#013)). It is only by being pardoned
through His atonement and ruled by His laws, that we can find "peace."
The royal "throne" was always connected with the "temple," as is the
case in the Apocalypse ([Rev 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#015)),
because Christ is to be a king on His throne and a priest, and because
the people, whose "king" the Lord is, cannot approach Him except by a
priestly mediation \[ROOS\]. Jesus shall come to effect, by His presence
([Isa 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#004); [Dan
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#017)), that which in vain is looked
for, in His absence, by other means. He shall exercise His power
mediatorially as priest on His throne ([Zac
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#013)); therefore His reign is for a
limited period, which it could not be if it were the final and
everlasting state of glory. But being for a special purpose, to
reconcile all things in this world, now disordered by sin, and so
present it to God the Father that He may again for the first time since
the fall come into direct connection with His creatures; therefore it is
limited, forming the dispensation in the fulness of times ([Eph
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#010)), when God shall gather in one
all things in Christ, the final end of which shall be, "God all in all"
([Co1 15:24-28](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#024)).

[Zechariah 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">zac 6:14</span></span>

the crowns shall be to Helem . . . a memorial--deposited in the temple,
to the honor of the donors; a memorial, too, of the coronation of
Joshua, to remind all of Messiah, the promised antitypical king-priest,
soon to come. Helem, the same as Heldai above. So Hen (that is, "favor")
is another name for Josiah (that is, "God founds") above. The same
person often had two names.

[Zechariah 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">zac 6:15</span></span>

they . . . far off shall . . . build--The reason why the crowns were
made of gold received from afar, namely, from the Jews of Babylon, was
to typify the conversion of the Gentiles to Messiah, King of Israel.
This, too, was included in the "peace" spoken of in [Zac
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#013) ([Act
2:39](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#039); [Eph
2:12-17](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#012)). Primarily, however, the
return of the dispersed Israelites "from afar" ([Isa
60:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#009)) to the king of the Jews at
Jerusalem is intended, to be followed, secondly, by the conversion of
the Gentiles from "far off" ([Zac
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#011); Zec. 8:2-23; [Isa
60:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#010); [Isa
57:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#019)).

build in the temple--Christ "builds the temple" ([Zac
6:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#012); [Heb
3:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#003)): His people "build in the
temple." Compare [Heb 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#002), "Moses in
His house."

ye shall know, &c.--when the event corresponds to the prediction ([Zac
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#009); [Zac
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#009)).

this shall come to pass, if ye . . . obey, &c.--To the Jews of
Zechariah's day a stimulus is given to diligent prosecution of the
temple building, the work which it was meanwhile their duty to fulfil,
relying on the hope of the Messiah afterwards to glorify it. The
completion of the temple shall "come to pass," if ye diligently on your
part "obey the Lord." It is not meant that their unbelief could set
aside God's gracious purpose as to Messiah's coming. But there is,
secondarily, meant, that Messiah's glory as priest-king of Israel shall
not be manifested to the Jews till they turn to Him with obedient
penitence. They meanwhile are cast away "branches" until they be grafted
in again on the Branch and their own olive tree ([Zac
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#008); [Zac
12:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010); [Mat
23:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#039); [Rom
11:16-24](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#016)).
