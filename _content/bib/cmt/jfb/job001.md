### [Job Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001)

[Job 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 1:1</span></span>

THE HOLINESS OF JOB, HIS WEALTH, &c. ([Job
1:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001))

Uz--north of Arabia-Deserta, lying towards the Euphrates. It was in this
neighborhood, and not in that of Idumea, that the Chaldeans and Sabeans
who plundered him dwell. The Arabs divide their country into the north,
called Sham, or "the left"; and the south, called Yemen, or "the right";
for they faced east; and so the west was on their left, and the south on
their right. Arabia-Deserta was on the east, Arabia-PetrÃ&brvbr;a on the
west, and Arabia-Felix on the south.

Job--The name comes from an Arabic word meaning "to return," namely, to
God, "to repent," referring to his end \[EICHORN\]; or rather from a
Hebrew word signifying one to whom enmity was shown, "greatly tried"
\[GESENIUS\]. Significant names were often given among the Hebrews, from
some event of later life (compare [Gen
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#002), Abel--a "feeder" of sheep). So
the emir of Uz was by general consent called Job, on account of his
"trials." The only other person so called was a son of Issachar ([Gen
46:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#013)).

perfect--not absolute or faultless perfection (compare [Job
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#020); [Ecc
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#020)), but integrity, sincerity, and
consistency on the whole, in all relations of life ([Gen
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#009); [Gen
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#001); [Pro
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#009); [Mat
5:48](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#048)). It was the fear of God that
kept Job from evil ([Pro 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#013)).

[Job 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 1:3</span></span>

she-asses--prized on account of their milk, and for riding ([Jdg
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#010)). Houses and lands are not
mentioned among the emir's wealth, as nomadic tribes dwell in movable
tents and live chiefly by pasture, the right to the soil not being
appropriated by individuals. The "five hundred yoke of oxen" imply,
however, that Job tilled the soil. He seems also to have had a dwelling
in a town, in which respect he differed from the patriarchs. Camels are
well called "ships of the desert," especially valuable for caravans, as
being able to lay in a store of water that suffices them for days, and
to sustain life on a very few thistles or thorns.

household-- ([Gen 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#014)). The other
rendering which the Hebrew admits, "husbandry," is not so probable.

men of the east--denoting in Scripture those living east of Palestine;
as the people of North Arabia-Deserta ([Jdg
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#003); [Eze
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#004)).

[Job 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 1:4</span></span>

every one his day--namely, the birthday ([Job
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#001)). Implying the love and harmony of
the members of the family, as contrasted with the ruin which soon broke
up such a scene of happiness. The sisters are specified, as these feasts
were not for revelry, which would be inconsistent with the presence of
sisters. These latter were invited by the brothers, though they gave no
invitations in return.

[Job 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 1:5</span></span>

when the days of their feasting were gone about--that is, at the end of
all the birthdays collectively, when the banquets had gone round through
all the families.

cursed God--The same Hebrew word means to "curse," and to "bless";
GESENIUS says, the original sense is to "kneel," and thus it came to
mean bending the knee in order to invoke either a blessing or a curse.
Cursing is a perversion of blessing, as all sin is of goodness. Sin is a
degeneracy, not a generation. It is not, however, likely that Job should
fear the possibility of his sons cursing God. The sense "bid farewell
to," derived from the blessing customary at parting, seems sufficient
([Gen 47:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#010)). Thus UMBREIT translates
"may have dismissed God from their hearts"; namely, amid the
intoxication of pleasure ([Pro 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#001)).
This act illustrates Job's "fear of God" ([Job
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001)).

[Job 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 1:6</span></span>

SATAN, APPEARING BEFORE GOD, FALSELY ACCUSES JOB. ([Job
1:6-12](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#006))

sons of God--angels ([Job 38:7](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#007); [Kg1
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#019)). They present themselves to
render account of their "ministry" in other parts of the universe ([Heb
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#014)).

the Lord--Hebrew, JEHOVAH, the self-existing God, faithful to His
promises. God says ([Exo 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#003)) that He
was not known to the patriarchs by this name. But, as the name occurs
previously in [Gen 2:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#007), &c., what
must be meant is, not until the time of delivering Israel by Moses was
He known peculiarly and publicly in the character which the name means;
namely, "making things to be," fulfilling the promises made to their
forefathers. This name, therefore, here, is no objection against the
antiquity of the Book of Job.

Satan--The tradition was widely spread that he had been the agent in
Adam's temptation. Hence his name is given without comment. The feeling
with which he looks on Job is similar to that with which he looked on
Adam in Paradise: emboldened by his success in the case of one not yet
fallen, he is confident that the piety of Job, one of a fallen race,
will not stand the test. He had fallen himself ([Job
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#019); [Job
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#015); [Jde
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#006)). In the Book of Job, Satan is
first designated by name: "Satan," Hebrew, "one who lies in wait"; an
"adversary" in a court of justice ([Ch1
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#001); [Psa
109:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#006); [Zac
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#001)); "accuser" ([Rev
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#010)). He has the law of God on his
side by man's sin, and against man. But Jesus Christ has fulfilled the
law for us; justice is once more on man's side against Satan ([Isa
42:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#021)); and so Jesus Christ can plead
as our Advocate against the adversary. "Devil" is the Greek name--the
"slanderer," or "accuser." He is subject to God, who uses his ministry
for chastising man. In Arabic, Satan is often applied to a serpent ([Gen
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#001)). He is called prince of this
world ([Joh 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#031)); the god of this
world ([Co2 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#004)); prince of the power
of the air ([Eph 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#002)). God here
questions him, in order to vindicate His own ways before angels.

[Job 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 1:7</span></span>

going to and fro--rather, "hurrying rapidly to and fro." The original
idea in Arabic is the heat of haste ([Mat
12:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#043); [Pe1
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#008)). Satan seems to have had some
peculiar connection with this earth. Perhaps he was formerly its ruler
under God. Man succeeded to the vice royalty ([Gen
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#026); [Psa
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#006)). Man then lost it and Satan
became prince of this world. The Son of man ([Psa
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#004)) --the representative man, regains
the forfeited inheritance ([Rev
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#015)). Satan's replies are
characteristically curt and short. When the angels appear before God,
Satan is among them, even as there was a Judas among the apostles.

[Job 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 1:8</span></span>

considered--Margin, "set thine heart on"; that is, considered
attentively. No true servant of God escapes the eye of the adversary of
God.

[Job 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 1:9</span></span>

fear God for naught--It is a mark of the children of Satan to sneer and
not give credit to any for disinterested piety. Not so much God's gifts,
as God Himself is "the reward" of His people ([Gen
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#001)).

[Job 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 1:10</span></span>

his substance is increased--literally, "spread out like a flood"; Job's
herds covered the face of the country.

[Job 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 1:11</span></span>

curse thee to thy face--in antithesis to God's praise of him ([Job
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#008)), "one that feareth God." Satan's
words are too true of many. Take away their prosperity and you take away
their religion ([Mal 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#014)).

[Job 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 1:12</span></span>

in thy power--Satan has no power against man till God gives it. God
would not touch Job with His own hand, though Satan asks this ([Job
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#011), "thine"), but He allows the
enemy to do so.

[Job 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 1:13</span></span>

JOB, IN AFFLICTION, BLESSES GOD, &c. ([Job
1:13-22](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#013))

wine--not specified in [Job 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#004). The
mirth inspired by the "wine" here contrasts the more sadly with the
alarm which interrupted it.

[Job 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 1:14</span></span>

the asses feeding beside them--Hebrew, "she asses." A graphic picture of
rural repose and peace; the more dreadful, therefore, by contrast is the
sudden attack of the plundering Arabs.

[Job 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 1:15</span></span>

Sabeans--not those of Arabia-Felix, but those of Arabia-Deserta,
descending from Sheba, grandson of Abraham and Keturah ([Gen
25:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#003)). The Bedouin Arabs of the
present day resemble, in marauding habits, these Sabeans (compare [Gen
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#012)).

I alone am escaped--cunningly contrived by Satan. One in each case
escapes ([Job 1:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#016), [Job
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#019)), and brings the same kind of
message. This was to overwhelm Job, and leave him no time to recover
from the rapid succession of calamities--"misfortunes seldom come
single."

[Job 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 1:16</span></span>

fire of God--Hebraism for "a mighty fire"; as "cedars of God"--"lofty
cedars" \[[Psa 80:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#010)\]. Not lightning,
which would not consume all the sheep and servants. UMBREIT understands
it of the burning wind of Arabia, called by the Turks "wind of poison."
"The prince of the power of the air" \[[Eph
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#002)\] is permitted to have control
over such destructive agents.

[Job 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 1:17</span></span>

Chaldeans--not merely robbers as the Sabeans; but experienced in war, as
is implied by "they set in array three bands" ([Hab
1:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#006)). RAWLINSON distinguishes three
periods: 1. When their seat of empire was in the south, towards the
confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates. The Chaldean period, from 2300
B.C. to 1500 B.C. In this period was Chedorlaomer ([Gen
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#001)), the Kudur of Hur or Ur of the
Chaldees, in the Assyrian inscriptions, and the conqueror of Syria. 2.
From 1500 to 625 B.C., the Assyrian period. 3. From 625 to 538 B.C.
(when Cyrus the Persian took Babylon), the Babylonian period. "Chaldees"
in Hebrew--Chasaim. They were akin, perhaps, to the Hebrews, as
Abraham's sojourn in Ur, and the name "Chesed," a nephew of Abraham,
imply. The three bands were probably in order to attack the three
separate thousands of Job's camels ([Job
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#003)).

[Job 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 1:19</span></span>

a great wind from the wilderness--south of Job's house. The tornado came
the more violently over the desert, being uninterrupted ([Isa
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#001); [Hos
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#015)).

the young men--rather, "the young people"; including the daughters (so
in [Rut 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#021)).

[Job 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 1:20</span></span>

Job arose--not necessarily from sitting. Inward excitement is implied,
and the beginning to do anything. He had heard the other messages
calmly, but on hearing of the death of his children, then he arose; or,
as EICHORN translates, he started up ([Sa2
13:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#031)). The rending of the mantle was
the conventional mark of deep grief ([Gen
37:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#034)). Orientals wear a tunic or
shirt, and loose pantaloons; and over these a flowing mantle (especially
great persons and women). Shaving the head was also usual in grief ([Jer
41:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#005); [Mic
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#016)).

[Job 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 1:21</span></span>

Naked-- ([Ti1 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#007)). "Mother's womb" is
poetically the earth, the universal mother ([Ecc
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#015); [Ecc
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#007); [Psa
139:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#015)). Job herein realizes God's
assertion ([Job 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#008)) against Satan's
([Job 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#011)). Instead of cursing, he
blesses the name of JEHOVAH (Hebrew). The name of Jehovah, is Jehovah
Himself, as manifested to us in His attributes ([Isa
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006)).

[Job 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 1:22</span></span>

nor charged God foolishly--rather, "allowed himself to commit no folly
against God" \[UMBREIT\]. [Job 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#010)
proves that this is the meaning. Not as Margin "attributed no folly to
God." Hasty words against God, though natural in the bitterness of
grief, are folly; literally, an "insipid, unsavory" thing ([Job
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#006); [Jer
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#013), Margin). Folly in Scripture is
continually equivalent to wickedness. For when man sins, it is himself,
not God, whom he injures ([Pro 8:36](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#036)).
We are to submit to trials, not because we see the reasons for them, nor
yet as though they were matters of chance, but because God wills them,
and has a right to send them, and has His own good reasons in sending
them.
