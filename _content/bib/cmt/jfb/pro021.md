### [Proverbs Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#001)

[Proverbs 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 21:1</span></span>

(Pro. 21:1-31)

rivers--irrigating channels ([Psa
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#003)), whose course was easily turned
(compare [Deu 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#010)). God disposes
even kings as He pleases ([Pro 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#009);
[Psa 33:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#015)).

[Proverbs 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 21:2</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#002); Pro. 16:2-25).

[Proverbs 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 21:3</span></span>

(Compare [Psa 50:7-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#007); [Isa
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#011), [Isa
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#017)).

[Proverbs 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 21:4</span></span>

high look--(Compare Margin; [Psa
131:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#001)).

proud heart--or, "heart of breadth," one that is swollen (compare [Psa
101:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#005)).

ploughing--better "lamp," a frequent figure for prosperity ([Pro
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#020)); hence joy or delight.

[Proverbs 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 21:5</span></span>

The contrast is between steady industry and rashness (compare [Pro
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#002)).

[Proverbs 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 21:6</span></span>

The getting--or, "what is obtained" (compare [Job
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#002); [Jer
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#013), Hebrew).

vanity . . . to and fro--as fleeting as chaff or stubble in the wind
(compare [Pro 20:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#017); [Psa
62:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#010)). Such gettings are
unsatisfactory.

them . . . death--act as if they did ([Pro
8:36](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#036); [Pro
17:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#019)).

[Proverbs 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 21:7</span></span>

robbery--or, "destruction," especially oppression, of which they are
authors.

shall destroy--literally, "cut with a saw" ([Kg1
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#009)), that is, utterly ruin them.
Their sins shall be visited on them in kind.

to do judgment--what is just and right.

[Proverbs 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 21:8</span></span>

of man--any one; his way is opposed to truth, and also estranged from
it. The pure proves himself such by his right conduct.

[Proverbs 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 21:9</span></span>

corner--a turret or arbor on the roof.

brawling--or contentious.

wide house--literally, "house of fellowship," large enough for several
families.

[Proverbs 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 21:10</span></span>

So strongly does he desire to do evil ([Psa
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#003); [Ecc
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#011)), that he will not even spare his
friend if in his way.

[Proverbs 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 21:11</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 19:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#025)). That which the
simple learn by the terrors of punishment, the wise learn by teaching.

[Proverbs 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 21:12</span></span>

(Compare [Psa 37:35-38](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#035); [Psa
73:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#017), [Psa
73:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#020)).

house--family or interests.

overthroweth--either supply "God" (compare [Pro
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#024)), or the word is used
impersonally.

[Proverbs 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 21:13</span></span>

The principles of retribution, often taught (compare [Psa
18:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#026); [Mat
7:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#001)).

[Proverbs 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 21:14</span></span>

The effect of bribery ([Pro 17:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#023)) is
enhanced by secrecy, as the bribed person does not wish his motives made
known.

[Proverbs 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 21:15</span></span>

But the just love right and need no bribes. The wicked at last meet
destruction, though for a time happy in concealing corruption.

[Proverbs 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 21:16</span></span>

the way of understanding--(Compare [Pro
12:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#026); [Pro
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#022)).

remain--that is, rest as at a journey's end; death will be his
unchanging home.

[Proverbs 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 21:17</span></span>

Costly luxuries impoverish.

[Proverbs 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 21:18</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#008)). By suffering what
they had devised for the righteous, or brought on them, the wicked
became their ransom, in the usual sense of substitutes (compare [Jos
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#026); [Est
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/est007.htm#009)).

[Proverbs 21:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 21:19</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#009)).

wilderness--pasture, though uninhabitable ground ([Psa
65:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#012)).

[Proverbs 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pro 21:20</span></span>

The wise, by diligence and care, lay up and increase wealth, while fools

spend--literally, "swallow it up," greedily.

[Proverbs 21:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 21:21</span></span>

He who tries to act justly and kindly ([Psa
34:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#014)) will prosper and obtain justice
and honor.

[Proverbs 21:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 21:22</span></span>

"Wisdom is better than strength" ([Ecc
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#019); [Ecc
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#015)).

strength . . . thereof--that in which they confide.

[Proverbs 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 21:23</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 13:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#002); [Jam
3:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#006)).

[Proverbs 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 21:24</span></span>

The reproachful name is deserved by those who treat others with anger
and contempt.

[Proverbs 21:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">pro 21:25</span></span>

desire--that is, of ease and idleness brings him to starvation.

[Proverbs 21:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">pro 21:26</span></span>

The sin of covetousness marks the sluggard, as the virtue of benevolence
the righteous.

[Proverbs 21:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 21:27</span></span>

God regards the heart, and hypocrisy is more odious than open
inconsistency.

wicked mind--or, "design" ([Pro 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#004)).

[Proverbs 21:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">pro 21:28</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#005)).

that heareth--or heeds instruction, and so grows wise.

speaketh constantly--or sincerely (compare [Hab
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#005)), and hence is believed ([Pro
12:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#019); [Jam
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#019)).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">pro 21:29</span></span>

hardeneth his face--is obstinate.

directeth . . . way--considers it, and acts advisedly.

[Proverbs 21:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">pro 21:30</span></span>

Men's best devices and reliances are vain compared with God's, or
without His aid ([Pro 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#021); [Psa
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#007); [Psa
33:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#017)).
