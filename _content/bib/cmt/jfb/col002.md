### [Colossians Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#001)

[Colossians 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">col 2:1</span></span>

HIS STRIVINGS IN PRAYER FOR THEIR STEADFASTNESS IN CHRIST; FROM WHOM HE
WARNS THEM NOT TO BE LED AWAY BY FALSE WISDOM. (Col. 2:1-23)

For--He explains in what respect he "labored striving" ([Col
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#029)). Translate as Greek, "I wish you
to know how great a conflict (the same Greek word as in [Col
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#029), "agony of a conflict" of
fervent, anxious prayer; not conflict with the false teachers, which
would have been impossible for him now in prison) I have for you."

them at Laodicea--exposed to the same danger from false teachers as the
Colossians (compare [Col 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#016)). This
danger was probably the cause of his writing to Laodicea, as well as to
Colosse.

not seen my face in the flesh--including those in Hierapolis ([Col
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#013)). Paul considered himself a
"debtor" to all the Gentiles ([Rom
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#014)). "His face" and presence would
have been a "comfort" ([Col 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#002); [Act
20:38](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#038)). Compare [Col
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#004), [Col
1:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#007), in proof that he had not seen,
but only heard of the Colossians. Hence he strives by earnest conflict
with God in anxious prayer for them, to make up for the loss of his
bodily presence among them. Though "absent in the flesh, I am with you
in the Spirit" ([Col 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#005)).

[Colossians 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">col 2:2</span></span>

Translate, "That their hearts may be comforted." The "their," compared
with "you" ([Col 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#004)), proves that in
[Col 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#001) the words, "have not seen my
face in the flesh," is a general designation of those for whom Paul
declares he has "conflict," including the particular species, "you
(Colossians) and them at Laodicea." For it is plain, the prayer "that
their hearts may be comforted," must include in it the Colossians for
whom he expressly says, "I have conflict." Thus it is an abbreviated
mode of expression for, "That your and their hearts may be comforted."
ALFORD translates, "confirmed," or allows "comforted" in its original
radical sense strengthened. But the Greek supports English Version: the
sense, too, is clear: comforted with the consolation of those whom Paul
had not seen, and for whom, in consequence, he strove in prayerful
conflict the more fervently; inasmuch as we are more anxious in behalf
of absent, than present, friends \[DAVENANT\]. Their hearts would be
comforted by "knowing what conflict he had for" them, and how much he is
interested for their welfare; and also by being released from doubts on
learning from the apostle, that the doctrine which they had heard from
Epaphras was true and certain. In writing to churches which he had
instructed face to face, he enters into particular details concerning
them, as a father directing his children. But to those among whom he had
not been in person, he treats of the more general truths of salvation.

being--Translate as Greek in oldest manuscripts, "They being knit
together."

in love--the bond and element of perfect knitting together; the antidote
to the dividing schismatical effect of false doctrine. Love to God and
to one another in Christ.

unto--the object and end of their being "knit together."

all riches--Greek, "all the riches of the full assurance ([Th1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#005); [Heb
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#011); [Heb
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#022)) of the (Christian)
understanding." The accumulation of phrases, not only "understanding,"
but "the full assurance of understanding"; not only this, but "the
riches of," &c., not only this, but "all the riches of," &c., implies
how he desires to impress them with the momentous importance of the
subject in hand.

to--Translate "unto."

acknowledgment--The Greek implies, "full and accurate knowledge." It is
a distinct Greek word from "knowledge," [Col
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#003). ALFORD translates, "thorough . .
. knowledge." Acknowledgment hardly is strong enough; they did in a
measure acknowledge the truth; what they wanted was the full and
accurate knowledge of it (compare Notes, see on [Col
1:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#009); [Phi
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#009)).

of God, and of the Father and of Christ--The oldest manuscripts omit
"and of the Father, and of"; then translate, "Of God (namely), Christ."
Two very old manuscripts and Vulgate read, "Of God the Father of
Christ."

[Colossians 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">col 2:3</span></span>

Translate in the Greek order, "In whom (not as ALFORD, 'in which')
mystery; Christ is Himself the 'mystery' ([Col
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#002); [Ti1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016)), and to Christ the relative
refers) are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge hidden." The "all"
here, answers to "all" in [Col 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#002); as
"treasures" answer to the "riches"; it is from the treasures that the
riches ([Col 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#002)) are derived. "Are"
is the predicate of the sentence; all the treasures ARE in Him; hidden
is predicated of the state or manner in which they are in Him. Like a
mine of unknown and inexhaustible wealth, the treasures of wisdom are
all in Him hidden, but not in order to remain so; they only need to be
explored for you to attain "unto the riches" in them ([Col
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#002)); but until you, Colossians, press
after attaining the full knowledge (see on [Col
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#002)) of them, they remain "hidden."
Compare the parable, [Mat 13:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#044),
"treasure hid." This sense suits the scope of the apostle, and sets
aside ALFORD'S objection that "the treasures are not hidden, but
revealed." "Hidden" plainly answers to "mystery" ([Col
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#002)), which is designed by God, if we
be faithful to our privileges, not to remain hidden, but to be revealed
(compare [Co1 2:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#007)). Still as the
mine is unfathomable, there will, through eternity, be always fresh
treasures in Him to be drawn forth from their hidden state.

wisdom--general, and as to experimental and practical truth; whence
comes "understanding" ([Col 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#002)).

knowledge--special and intellectual, in regard to doctrinal truth;
whence comes "the full knowledge" ([Col
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#002)).

[Colossians 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">col 2:4</span></span>

And--"Now." Compare with "lest any man," &c. [Col
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#008), [Col
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#016), [Col
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#018). He refers to the blending of
Judaism with Oriental philosophy, and the combination of this mixture
with Christianity.

enticing words--plausible as wearing the guise of wisdom and humility
([Col 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#018), [Col
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#023)).

[Colossians 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">col 2:5</span></span>

For--argument against their suffering themselves to be beguiled, drawn
from a regard to his personal authority as though he were present.

joying and beholding--beholding with joy.

order--your good order; answering to "knit together" ([Col
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#002)) as a well-organized body; the
same Greek as that for knit together, is used of the body" of the Church
compacted," in [Eph 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#016). Compare [Co1
14:33](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#033), [Co1
14:40](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#040).

steadfastness--Greek, "the firm (or 'solid') foundation." As "order"
expresses the outward aspect of the Church; so "steadfastness" expresses
the inner basis on which their Church rested. The Greek literally
implies not an abstract quality, but the thing in the concrete; thus
their "faith" here is the solid thing which constituted the basis of
their Church.

[Colossians 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">col 2:6</span></span>

"As therefore ye received (once for all; the aorist tense; from
Epaphras) Jesus the Christ as your Lord (compare [Co1
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#003); [Co2
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#005); [Phi
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#008)), so walk in Him." He says not
merely, "Ye received" the doctrine of Christ, but "Jesus" Himself; this
is the essence of faith ([Joh 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#021),
[Joh 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#023); [Gal
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#016)). Ye have received once for all
the Spirit of life in Christ; carry into practice that life in your walk
([Gal 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#025)). This is the main scope of
the Epistle.

[Colossians 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">col 2:7</span></span>

Rooted-- ([Eph 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#017)).

built up--Greek, "being builded up." As "rooted" implies their vitality;
so "builded up," massive solidity. As in the Song of Solomon, when one
image is not sufficient to express the varied aspects of divine truth,
another is employed to supply the idea required. Thus "walking," a third
image ([Col 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#006)), expresses the
thought which "rooted" and "built," though each suggesting a thought
peculiar to itself, could not express, namely, onward motion. "Rooted"
is in the past tense, implying their first conversion and vital grafting
"in Him." "Built up" is present (in the Greek), implying their
progressive increase in religion by union with Him. [Eph
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#020) refers to the Church; but the
passage here to their individual progress in edification ([Act
20:32](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#032)).

stablished--confirmed.

as--"even as."

abounding therein with thanksgiving--advancing to fuller maturity
(compare [Col 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#002)) in the faith, "with
thanksgiving" to God as the gracious Author of this whole blessing.

[Colossians 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">col 2:8</span></span>

Translate, "Beware (literally, 'Look' well) lest there shall be (as I
fear there is: the Greek indicative expresses this) any man (pointing to
some known emissary of evil, [Gal 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#007))
leading you away as his spoil (not merely gaining spoil out of you, but
making yourselves his spoil) through (by means of) his philosophy," &c.
The apostle does not condemn all philosophy, but "the philosophy" (so
Greek) of the Judaic-oriental heretics at Colosse, which afterwards was
developed into Gnosticism. You, who may have "the riches of full
assurance" and "the treasures of wisdom," should not suffer yourselves
to be led away as a spoil by empty, deceitful philosophy: "riches" are
contrasted with spoil; "full" with "vain," or empty ([Col
2:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#002), [Col
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#009)).

after--"according to."

tradition of men--opposed to, "the fulness of the Godhead." Applied to
Rabbinical traditions, [Mar 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#008). When
men could not make revelation even seem to tell about deep mysteries
which they were curious to pry into, they brought in human philosophy
and pretended traditions to help it, as if one should bring a lamp to
the sundial to find the hour \[Cauations for Times, p. 85\]. The false
teachers boasted of a higher wisdom in theory, transmitted by tradition
among the initiated; in practice they enjoined asceticism, as though
matter and the body were the sources of evil. Phrygia (in which was
Colosse) had a propensity for the mystical and magical, which appeared
in their worship of Cybele and subsequent Montanism \[NEANDER\].

rudiments of the world--(See on [Gal
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#003)). "The rudiments" or elementary
lessons "of the (outward) world," such as legal ordinances; our Judaic
childhood's lessons ([Col 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#011), [Col
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#016), [Col
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#020); [Gal
4:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#001)). But NEANDER, "the elements of
the world," in the sense, what is earthly, carnal and outward, not "the
rudiments of religion," in Judaism and heathenism.

not after Christ--"Their" boasted higher "philosophy" is but human
tradition, and a cleaving to the carnal and worldly, and not to Christ.
Though acknowledging Christ nominally, in spirit they by their doctrine
deny Him.

[Colossians 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">col 2:9</span></span>

For--"Because." Their "philosophy" ([Col
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#008)) is not "after Christ," as all
true philosophy is, everything which comes not from, and tends not to,
Him, being a delusion; "For in Him (alone) dwelleth" as in a temple, &c.

the fulness-- ([Col 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#019); [Joh
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#010)).

of the Godhead--The Greek (theotes) means the ESSENCE and NATURE of the
Godhead, not merely the divine perfections and attributes of Divinity
(Greek, "theiotes"). He, as man, was not merely God-like, but in the
fullest sense, God.

bodily--not merely as before His incarnation, but now "bodily in Him" as
the incarnate word ([Joh 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014), [Joh
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018)). Believers, by union with Him,
partake of His fulness of the divine nature ([Joh
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#016); [Pe2
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#004); see on [Eph
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#019)).

[Colossians 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">col 2:10</span></span>

And--And therefore; and so. Translate in the Greek order, "Ye are in Him
(by virtue of union with Him) filled full" of all that you need ([Joh
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#016)). Believers receive of the divine
unction which flows down from their Divine Head and High Priest ([Psa
133:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa133.htm#002)). He is full of the "fulness"
itself; we, filled from Him. Paul implies, Therefore ye Colossians need
no supplementary sources of grace, such as the false teachers dream of.
Christ is "the Head of all rule and authority" (so the Greek), [Eph
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#010); He, therefore, alone, not these
subject "authorities" also, is to be adored ([Col
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#018)).

[Colossians 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">col 2:11</span></span>

Implying that they did not need, as the Judaizers taught, the outward
rite of circumcision, since they had already the inward spiritual
reality of it.

are--rather, as the Greek, "Ye were (once for all) circumcised
(spiritually, at your conversion and baptism, [Rom
2:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#028); [Phi
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#003)) with a (so the Greek)
circumcision made without hands"; opposed to "the circumcision in the
flesh made by hands" ([Eph 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#011)).
Christ's own body, by which the believer is sanctified, is said to be
"not made with hands" ([Mar 14:58](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#058);
[Heb 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#011); compare [Dan
2:45](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#045)).

in putting off--rather as Greek, "in your putting off"; as an old
garment ([Eph 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#022)); alluding to the
putting off the foreskin in circumcision.

the body of the sins of the flesh--The oldest manuscripts read, "the
body of the flesh," omitting "of the sins," that is, "the body," of
which the prominent feature is fleshiness (compare [Rom
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#013), where "flesh" and "the body"
mutually correspond). This fleshly body, in its sinful aspect, is put
off in baptism (where baptism answers its ideal) as the seal of
regeneration where received in repentance and faith. In circumcision the
foreskin only was put off; in Christian regeneration "the body of the
flesh" is spiritually put off, at least it is so in its ideal
conception, however imperfectly believers realize that ideal.

by--Greek, "in." This spiritual circumcision is realized in, or by,
union with Christ, whose "circumcision," whereby He became responsible
for us to keep the whole law, is imputed to believers for justification;
and union with whom, in all His vicarious obedience, including HIS
CIRCUMCISION, is the source of our sanctification. ALFORD makes it
explanatory of the previous, "a circumcision made without hands,"
namely, "the circumcision brought about by your union with Christ." The
former view seems to me better to accord with [Col
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#012); [Col
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#001), [Col
3:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#003), which similarly makes the
believer, by spiritual union with Christ, to have personal fellowship in
the several states of Christ, namely, His death, resurrection, and
appearing in glory. Nothing was done or suffered by our Mediator as
such, but may be acted in our souls and represented in our spirits.
PEARSON'S view, however, is that of ALFORD. JOSHUA, the type (not Moses
in the wilderness), circumcised the Israelites in Canaan ([Jos
5:2-9](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#002)) the second time: the people
that came out of Egypt having been circumcised, and afterwards having
died in the wilderness; but those born after the Exodus not having been
so. Jesus, the Antitype, is the author of the true circumcision, which
is therefore called "the circumcision of Christ" ([Rom
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#029)). As Joshua was "Moses'
minister," so Jesus, "minister of the circumcision for the truth of God"
unto the Gentiles ([Rom 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#008)).

[Colossians 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">col 2:12</span></span>

Translate, "Having been buried with Him in your baptism." The past
participle is here coincident in time with the preceding verb, "ye were
(Greek) circumcised." Baptism is regarded as the burial of the old
carnal life, to which the act of immersion symbolically corresponds; and
in warm climates where immersion is safe, it is the mode most accordant
with the significance of the ordinance; but the spirit of the ordinance
is kept by affusion, where immersion would be inconvenient or dangerous;
to insist on literal immersion in all cases would be mere legal
ceremonialism ([Rom 6:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#003)).

are risen--rather as Greek, "were raised with Him."

through the faith, &c.--by means of your faith in the operation of God;
so "faith of," for "faith in" ([Eph
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#012); [Phi
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#009)). Faith in God's mighty operation
in raising again Jesus, is saving faith ([Rom
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#024); [Rom
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#009)); and it is wrought in the soul
by His same "mighty working" whereby He "raised Jesus from the dead"
([Eph 1:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#019)). BENGEL seems to me
(not as ALFORD understands him) to express the latter sense, namely,
"Through the faith which is a work of the operation of God who," &c.
[Eph 1:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#019) accords with this; the
same mighty power of God is exercised in raising one spiritually dead to
the life of faith, as was "wrought in Christ when God raised Him
literally from the dead." However, "faith of" usually is "faith in"
([Rom 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#022)); but there is no
grammatical impropriety in understanding it "the faith which is the
effect of the operation of God" ([Eph
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#008); [Th1
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#013)). As His literal resurrection is
the ground of the power put forth in our spiritual resurrection now, so
it is a pledge of our literal resurrection hereafter ([Rom
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#011)).

[Colossians 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">col 2:13</span></span>

you, being dead--formerly ([Eph
2:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#001)); even as Christ was among the
dead, before that God raised Him "from the dead" ([Col
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#012)).

sins--rather as Greek is translated at end of this verse, "trespasses,"
literally, "failings aside" from God's ways; actual transgressions, as
that of Adam.

uncircumcision of your flesh--your not having put off the old fleshly
nature, the carnal foreskin, or original sin, which now by spiritual
circumcision, that is, conversion and baptism, you have put off.

he quickened--GOD "quickened together with Him (CHRIST)." Just as
Christ's resurrection proved that He was delivered from the sin laid on
Him, so our spiritual quickening proves that we have been forgiven our
sins ([Pe1 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#022); [Pe1
4:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#001)).

forgiven you--So Vulgate and HILARY. But the oldest manuscripts read,
"us," passing from the particular persons, the Colossians, to the
general Church ([Col 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#014); [Eph
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#007)).

all trespasses--Greek, "all our trespasses."

[Colossians 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">col 2:14</span></span>

Blotting out--Greek, "Having wiped out"; coincident in time with "having
forgiven you" ([Col 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#013)); hereby
having cancelled the law's indictment against you. The law (including
especially the moral law, wherein lay the chief difficulty in obeying)
is abrogated to the believer, as far as it was a compulsory, accusing
code, and as far as "righteousness" (justification) and "life" were
sought for by it. It can only produce outward works, not inward
obedience of the will, which in the believer flows from the Holy Spirit
in Him ([Rom 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#021); [Rom
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#002), [Rom
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#004); [Gal
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#019)).

the handwriting of ordinances--rather, "IN ordinances" (see on [Eph
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#015)); "the law of commandments
contained in ordinances." "The handwriting" (alluding to the Decalogue,
the representative of the law, written by the hand of God) is the whole
law, the obligatory bond, under which all lay; the Jews primarily were
under the bond, but they in this respect were the representative people
of the world ([Rom 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#019)); and in their
inability to keep the law was involved the inability of the Gentiles
also, in whose hearts "the work of the law was written" ([Rom
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#015)); and as they did not keep this,
they were condemned by it.

that was against us . . . contrary to us--Greek "adversary to us"; so it
is translated, [Heb 10:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#027). "Not only
was the law against us by its demands, but also an adversary to us by
its accusations" \[BENGEL\]. TITTMANN explains the Greek, "having a
latent contrariety to us"; not open designed hostility, but virtual
unintentional opposition through our frailty; not through any opposition
in the law itself to our good ([Rom
7:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#007), [Rom
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#014); [Co1
15:56](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#056); [Gal
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#021); [Heb
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#003)). The "WRITING" is part of "that
which was contrary to us"; for "the letter killeth" (see on [Co2
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#006)).

and took it--Greek, and hath taken it out of the way" (so as to be no
longer a hindrance to us), by "nailing it to the cross." Christ, by
bearing the curse of the broken law, has redeemed us from its curse
([Gal 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#013)). In His person nailed to
the cross, the law itself was nailed to it. One ancient mode of
cancelling bonds was by striking a nail through the writing: this seems
at that time to have existed in Asia \[GROTIUS\]. The bond cancelled in
the present case was the obligation lying against the Jews as
representatives of the world, and attested by their amen, to keep the
whole law under penalty of the curse ([Deu
27:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#026); [Neh
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#029)).

[Colossians 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">col 2:15</span></span>

ALFORD, ELLICOTT, and others translate the Greek to accord with the
translation of the same Greek, [Col
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#009), "Stripping off from Himself the
principalities and the powers: " GOD put off from Himself the angels,
that is, their ministry, not employing them to be promulgators of the
Gospel in the way that He had given the law by their "disposition" or
ministry ([Act 7:53](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#053); [Gal
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#019); [Heb
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#002), [Heb
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#005)): God manifested Himself without a
veil in Jesus. "THE principalities and THE powers" refers back to [Col
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#010), Jesus, "the Head of all
principality and power," and [Col
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016). In the sacrifice of Jesus on the
cross, God subjected all the principalities, &c., to Jesus, declaring
them to be powerless as to His work and His people ([Eph
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#021)). Thus Paul's argument against
those grafting on Christianity Jewish observances, along with
angel-worship, is, whatever part angels may be supposed to have had
under the law, now at an end, God having put the legal dispensation
itself away. But the objection is, that the context seems to refer to a
triumph over bad angels: in [Co2 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#014),
however, Christ's triumph over those subjected to Him, is not a triumph
for destruction, but for their salvation, so that good angels may be
referred to ([Col 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#020)). But the Greek
middle is susceptible of English Version, "having spoiled," or,
literally \[TITTMANN\], "having completely stripped," or "despoiled" for
Himself (compare [Rom 8:38](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#038); [Co1
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#024); [Eph
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#002)). English Version accords with
[Mat 12:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#029); [Luk
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#022); [Heb
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#014). Translate as the Greek, "The
rules and authorities."

made a show of them--at His ascension (see on [Eph
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#008); confirming English Version of
this verse).

openly--[Joh 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#004); [Joh
11:54](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#054), support English Version against
ALFORD'S translation, "in openness of speech."

in it--namely, His cross, or crucifixion: so the Greek fathers
translate. Many of the Latins, "In Himself" or "in Him." [Eph
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#016) favors English Version,
"reconcile . . . by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby." If "in
Him," that is, Christ, be read, still the Cross will be the place and
means of God's triumph in Christ over the principalities ([Eph
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#020); [Eph
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#005)). Demons, like other angels, were
in heaven up to Christ's ascension, and influenced earth from their
heavenly abodes. As heaven was not yet opened to man before Christ ([Joh
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#013)), so it was not yet shut against
demons ([Job 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#006); [Job
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#001)). But at the ascension Satan and
his demons were "judged" and "cast out" by Christ's obedience unto death
([Joh 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#031); [Joh
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#011); [Heb
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#014); [Rev
12:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#005)), and the Son of man was
raised to the throne of God; thus His resurrection and ascension are a
public solemn triumph over the principalities and powers of death. It is
striking that the heathen oracles were silenced soon after Christ's
ascension.

[Colossians 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">col 2:16</span></span>

therefore--because ye are complete in Christ, and God in Him has
dispensed with all subordinate means as essential to acceptance with
Him.

meat . . . drink--Greek, "eating . . . drinking" (Rom. 14:1-17). Pay no
regard to any one who sits in judgment on you as to legal observances in
respect to foods.

holyday--a feast yearly. Compare the three, [Ch1
23:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#031).

new moon--monthly.

the sabbath--Omit "THE," which is not in the Greek (compare Note, see on
[Gal 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#010)). "SABBATHS" (not "the
sabbaths") of the day of atonement and feast of tabernacles have come to
an end with the Jewish services to which they belonged ([Lev
23:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#032), [Lev
23:37-39](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#037)). The weekly sabbath rests on
a more permanent foundation, having been instituted in Paradise to
commemorate the completion of creation in six days. [Lev
23:38](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#038) expressly distinguished "the
sabbath of the Lord" from the other sabbaths. A positive precept is
right because it is commanded, and ceases to be obligatory when
abrogated; a moral precept is commanded eternally, because it is
eternally right. If we could keep a perpetual sabbath, as we shall
hereafter, the positive precept of the sabbath, one in each week, would
not be needed. [Heb 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#009), "rests,"
Greek, "keeping of sabbath" ([Isa
66:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#023)). But we cannot, since even
Adam, in innocence, needed one amidst his earthly employments; therefore
the sabbath is still needed and is therefore still linked with the other
nine commandments, as obligatory in the spirit, though the letter of the
law has been superseded by that higher spirit of love which is the
essence of law and Gospel alike ([Rom
13:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#008)).

[Colossians 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">col 2:17</span></span>

things to come--the blessings of the Christian covenant, the substance
of which Jewish ordinances were but the type. Compare "ages to come,"
that is, the Gospel dispensation ([Eph
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#007)). [Heb
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#005), "the world to come."

the body is of Christ--The real substance (of the blessings typified by
the law) belongs to Christ ([Heb 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#005);
[Heb 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#001)).

[Colossians 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">col 2:18</span></span>

beguile--Translate, "Defraud you of your prize," literally, "to adjudge
a prize out of hostility away from him who deserves it" \[TRENCH\]. "To
be umpire in a contest to the detriment of one." This defrauding of
their prize the Colossians would suffer, by letting any self-constituted
arbitrator or judge (that is, false teacher) draw them away from
Christ," the righteous Judge" and Awarder of the prize ([Ti2
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#008); [Jam
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#012); [Pe1
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#004)), to angel-worship.

in a voluntary humility--So "will-worship" ([Col
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#023)). Literally, "Delighting
(\[WAHL\]) in humility"; loving (so the Greek is translated, [Mar
12:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#038), "love to go in long clothing")
to indulge himself in a humility of his own imposing: a volunteer in
humility \[DALLÃ†US\]. Not as ALFORD, "Let no one of purpose defraud
you," &c. Not as GROTIUS, "If he ever so much wish" (to defraud you).
For the participle "wishing" or "delighting," is one of the series, and
stands in the same category as "intruding," "puffed up," "not holding";
and the self-pleasing implied in it stands in happy contrast to the
(mock) humility with which it seems to me, therefore, to be connected.
His "humility," so called, is a pleasing of self: thus it stands in
parallelism to "his fleshly mind" (its real name, though he styles it
"humility"), as "wishing" or "delighting" does to "puffed up." The Greek
for "humility" is literally, "lowliness of mind," which forms a clearer
parallel to "puffed up by his fleshly mind." Under pretext of humility,
as if they durst not come directly to God and Christ (like the modern
Church of Rome), they invoked angels: as Judaizers, they justified this
on the ground that the law was given by angels. This error continued
long in Phrygia (where Colosse and Laodicea were), so that the Council
of Laodicea (A.D. 360) expressly framed its thirty-fifth canon against
the "Angelici" (as AUGUSTINE \[Heresies, 39\], calls them) or "invokers
of angels." Even as late as THEODORET'S time, there were oratories to
Michael the archangel. The modern Greeks have a legend that Michael
opened a chasm to draw off an inundation threatening the Colossian
Christians. Once men admit the inferior powers to share invocation with
the Supreme, the former gradually engrosses all our serious worship,
almost to the exclusion of the latter; thus the heathen, beginning with
adding the worship of other deities to that of the Supreme, ended with
ceasing to worship Him at all. Nor does it signify much, whether we
regard such as directly controlling us (the pagan view), or as only
influencing the Supreme in our behalf (the Church of Rome's view);
because he from whom I expect happiness or misery, becomes the uppermost
object in my mind, whether he give, or only procure it \[Cautions for
Times\]. Scripture opposes the idea of "patrons" or "intercessors" ([Ti1
2:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#005)). True Christian humility joins
consciousness of utter personal demerit, with a sense of participation
in the divine life through Christ, and in the dignity of our adoption by
God. Without the latter being realized, a false self-humiliation
results, which displays itself in ceremonies and ascetic self-abasement
([Col 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#023)), which after all is but
spiritual pride under the mock guise of humility. Contrast "glorying in
the Lord" ([Co1 1:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#031)).

intruding into . . . things which he hath not seen--So very old
manuscripts and Vulgate and ORIGEN read. But the oldest manuscripts and
LUCIFER omit "not"; then translate, "haughtily treading on ('Standing
on' \[ALFORD\]) the things which he hath seen." TREGELLES refers this to
fancied visions of angels. But if Paul had meant a fancied seeing, he
would have used some qualifying word, as, "which he seemed to see," not
"which he hath seen." Plainly the things were actually seen by him,
whether of demoniacal origination ([Sa1
28:11-20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#011)), or phenomena resulting from
natural causation, mistaken by him as if supernatural. Paul, not
stopping to discuss the nature of the things so seen, fixes on the
radical error, the tendency of such a one in all this to walk by SENSE
(namely, what he haughtily prides himself on having SEEN), rather than
by FAITH in the UNSEEN "Head" ([Col
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#019); compare [Joh
20:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#029); [Co2
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#007); [Heb
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#001)). Thus is the parallelism,
"vainly puffed up" answers to "haughtily treading on," or "setting his
foot on"; "his fleshly mind" answers to the things which he hath seen,"
since his fleshliness betrays itself in priding himself on what he hath
seen, rather than on the unseen objects of faith. That the things seen
may have been of demoniacal origination, appears from [Ti1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#001), "Some shall depart from the
faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils" (Greek,
"demons"). A warning to modern spiritualists.

puffed up--implying that the previous so called "humility" (Greek,
"lowliness of mind") was really a "puffing up."

fleshly mind--Greek, "By the mind of his own flesh." The flesh, or
sensuous principle, is the fountain head whence his mind draws its
craving after religious objects of sight, instead of, in true humility
as a member, "holding fast the (unseen) Head."

[Colossians 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">col 2:19</span></span>

Translate, "Not holding fast the Head." He who does not hold Christ
solely and supremely above all others, does not hold Him at all
\[BENGEL\]. The want of firm holding of Christ has set him loose to (pry
into, and so) "tread haughtily on (pride himself on) things which he
hath seen." Each must hold fast the Head for himself, not merely be
attached to the other members, however high in the body \[ALFORD\].

from which--rather, "from whom."

the body--that is, all the members of the body ([Eph
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#016)).

joints--the points of union where the supply of nourishment passes to
the different members, furnishing the body with the materials of growth.

bands--the sinews and nerves which bind together limb and limb. Faith,
love, and peace, are the spiritual bands. Compare "knit together in
love" ([Col 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#002); [Col
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#014); [Eph
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#003)).

having nourishment ministered--that is, supplied to it continually.
"Receiving ministration."

knit together--The Greek is translated, "compacted," [Eph
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#016) : implying firm consolidation.

with the increase of God-- ([Eph
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#016)); that is, wrought by God, the
Author and Sustainer of the believer's spiritual life, in union with
Christ, the Head ([Co1 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#006)); and
tending to the honor of God, being worthy of Him, its Author.

[Colossians 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">col 2:20</span></span>

Wherefore--The oldest manuscripts omit "Wherefore."

if ye be dead--Greek, "if ye died (so as to be freed) from," &c.
(compare [Rom 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#002); [Rom
7:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#002); [Gal
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#019)).

rudiments of the world-- ([Col 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#008)).
Carnal, outward, worldly, legal ordinances.

as though living--as though you were not dead to the world like your
crucified Lord, into whose death ye were buried ([Gal
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#014); [Pe1
4:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#001)).

are ye subject to ordinances--By do ye submit to be made subject to
ordinances? Referring to [Col 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#014) :
you are again being made subject to "ordinances," the "handwriting" of
which had been "blotted out" ([Col
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#014)).

[Colossians 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">col 2:21</span></span>

Compare [Col 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#016), "meat . . . drink."
He gives instances of the "ordinances" ([Col
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#020)) in the words of their imposers.
There is an ascending climax of superstitious prohibitions. The first
Greek word (hapse) is distinguished from the third (thiges), in that the
former means close contact and retention: the latter, momentary contact
(compare [Co1 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#001); [Joh
20:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#017), Greek, "Hold me not"; cling not
to me"). Translate, "Handle not, neither taste, nor even touch." The
three refer to meats. "Handle not" (a stronger term than "nor even
touch"), "nor taste" with the tongue, "nor even touch," however slight
the contact.

[Colossians 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">col 2:22</span></span>

Which--things, namely, the three things handled, touched, and tasted.

are to perish--literally, "are constituted (by their very nature) for
perishing (or 'destruction by corruption') in (or 'with') their using up
(consumption)." Therefore they cannot really and lastingly defile a man
([Mat 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#017); [Co1
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#013)).

after--according to. Referring to [Col
2:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#020). All these "ordinances" are
according to human, not divine, injunction.

doctrines--Greek, teachings." ALFORD translates, "(doctrinal) systems."

[Colossians 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">col 2:23</span></span>

have--Greek, "are having"; implying the permanent characteristic which
these ordinances are supposed to have.

show of wisdom--rather, "a reputation of wisdom" \[ALFORD\].

will-worship--arbitrarily invented worship: would-be worship, devised by
man's own will, not God's. So jealous is God of human will-worship, that
He struck Nadab and Abihu dead for burning strange incense ([Lev
10:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#001)). So Uzziah was stricken with
leprosy for usurping the office of priest ([Ch2
26:16-21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#016)). Compare the will-worship of
Saul ([Sa1 13:8-14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#008)) for which he was
doomed to lose his throne. This "voluntary worship" is the counterpart
to their "voluntary humility" ([Col
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#018)): both specious in appearance,
the former seeming in religion to do even more than God requires (as in
the dogmas of the Roman and Greek churches); but really setting aside
God's will for man's own; the latter seemingly self-abasing, but really
proud of man's self-willed "humility" (Greek, "lowliness of mind"),
while virtually rejecting the dignity of direct communion with Christ,
the Head; by worshipping of angels.

neglecting of the body--Greek, "not sparing of the body." This
asceticism seems to have rested on the Oriental theory that matter is
the source of evil. This also looked plausible (compare [Co1
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#027)).

not in any honour--of the body. As "neglecting of the body" describes
asceticism positively; so this clause, negatively. Not paying any of
that "honor" which is due to the body as redeemed by such a price as the
blood of Christ. We should not degrade, but have a just estimation of
ourselves, not in ourselves, but in Christ ([Act
13:46](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#046); [Co1
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#021); [Co1
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#015); [Co1
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#023); [Co1
12:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#023); [Th1
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#004)). True self-denial regards the
spirit, and not the forms of ascetical self-mortification in "meats
which profit not those occupied therein" ([Heb
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#009)), and is consistent with
Christian self-respect, the "honor" which belongs to the believer as
dedicated to the Lord. Compare "vainly," [Col
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#018).

to the satisfying of the flesh--This expresses the real tendency of
their human ordinances of bodily asceticism, voluntary humility, and
will-worship of angels. While seeming to deny self and the body, they
really are pampering the flesh. Thus "satisfying of the flesh" answers
to "puffed up by his fleshly mind" ([Col
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#018)), so that "flesh" is used in its
ethical sense, "the carnal nature" as opposed to the "spiritual"; not in
the sense, "body." The Greek for "satisfying" implies satiating to
repletion, or to excess. "A surfeit of the carnal sense is human
tradition" \[HILARY THE DEACON, in BENGEL\]. Tradition puffs up; it
clogs the heavenly perceptions. They put away true "honor" that they may
"satiate to the full THE FLESH." Self-imposed ordinances gratify the
flesh (namely, self-righteousness), though seeming to mortify it.
