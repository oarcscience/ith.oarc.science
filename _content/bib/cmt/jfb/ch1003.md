### [1 Chronicles Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#001)

[1 Chronicles 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 3:1</span></span>

SONS OF DAVID. ([Ch1 3:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#001))

Now these were the sons of David, which were born unto him in Hebron--It
is of consequence for the proper understanding of events in the domestic
history of David, to bear in mind the place and time of his sons' birth.
The oldest son, born after his father's accession to the sovereign
authority, is according to Eastern notions, the proper heir to the
throne. And hence the natural aspirations of ambition in Ammon, who was
long unaware of the alienation of the crown, and could not be easily
reconciled to the claims of a younger brother being placed above his own
(see on [Sa2 3:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#001)).

[1 Chronicles 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch1 3:3</span></span>

Eglah his wife--supposed to be another name of Michal, who, though she
had no son after her mockery of David for dancing before the ark \[[Sa2
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#016), [Sa2
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#020)\], might have had one previous to
that time. She has the title of wife appended to her name because she
was his proper wife; and the mention of her name last probably arose
from the circumstance that, having been withdrawn from David and married
to another husband but afterwards restored, she had in reality become
the last of his wives.

[1 Chronicles 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch1 3:5</span></span>

four, of Bath-shua the daughter of Ammiel--or, "Bath-sheba" ([Sa2
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#003)), and there her father is called
"Eliam." Of course Solomon was not her "only son," but he is called so
([Pro 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#003)) from the distinguished
affection of which he was the object; and though the oldest, he is named
the last of Bath-sheba's children.

[1 Chronicles 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 3:6</span></span>

Elishama and Eliphelet--Two sons of the same name are twice mentioned
([Ch1 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#008)). They were the children of
different mothers, and had probably some title or epithet appended by
which the one was distinguished from the other. Or, it might be, that
the former two were dead, and their names had been given to sons
afterwards born to preserve their memories.

[1 Chronicles 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch1 3:8</span></span>

nine--The number of David's sons born after his removal to Jerusalem,
was eleven ([Sa2 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#014)), but only nine
are mentioned here: two of them being omitted, either in consequence of
their early deaths or because they left no issue.

[1 Chronicles 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch1 3:10</span></span>

HIS LINE TO ZEDEKIAH. ([Ch1 3:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#010))

Solomon's son was Rehoboam, &c.--David's line is here drawn down to the
captivity, through a succession of good and bad, but still influential
and celebrated, monarchs. It has rarely happened that a crown has been
transmitted from father to son, in lineal descent, for seventeen reigns.
But this was the promised reward of David's piety. There is, indeed,
observable some vacillation towards the close of this period--the crown
passing from one brother to another, an even from uncle to nephew--a
sure sign of disorderly times and a disjointed government.

[1 Chronicles 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch1 3:15</span></span>

Zedekiah--called the son of Josiah (compare [Jer
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#003); [Jer
37:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#001)), but in [Ch2
36:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#019) he is described as the brother
of Jehoiachin, who was the son of Jehoiakim, and consequently the
grandson of Josiah. Words expressive of affinity or relationship are
used with great latitude in the Hebrew.

Shallum--No king of this name is mentioned in the history of Josiah's
sons (2Ki. 14:1-29; 2Ki. 23:1-37), but there is a notice of Shallum the
son of Josiah ([Jer 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#011)), who
reigned in the stead of his father, and who is generally supposed to be
Jehoahaz, a younger son, here called the fourth, of Josiah.

[1 Chronicles 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch1 3:17</span></span>

SUCCESSORS OF JECONIAH. ([Ch1 3:17-24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#017))

the sons of Jeconiah; Assir--rather, "Jeconiah the prisoner," or
"captive." This record of his condition was added to show that Salathiel
was born during the captivity in Babylon (compare [Mat
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#012)). Jeconiah was written childless
([Jer 22:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#030)), a prediction which (as
the words that follow explain) meant that this unfortunate monarch
should have no son succeeding him on the throne.

[1 Chronicles 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch1 3:18</span></span>

Malchiram also--As far as Jeconiah, everything is plain; but there is
reason to suspect that the text in the subsequent verses has been
dislocated and disarranged. The object of the sacred historian is to
trace the royal line through Zerubbabel; yet, according to the present
reading, the genealogical stem cannot be drawn from Jeconiah downwards.
The following arrangement of the text is given as removing all
difficulties \[DAVIDSON, Hermeneutics\]:-- [Ch1
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#017). And the sons of Jeconiah the the
captive, Salathiel (Shealtiel, [Ezr
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#002); [Neh
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#001); [Hag
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#012), [Hag
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#014); [Hag
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#002)) his son. [Ch1
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#018). And the sons of Salathiel;
Zerubbabel and Shimei; and the sons of Zerubbabel; Meshullam, Hananiah,
and Shelomith their sister. [Ch1 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#019).
And Hashubah, and Ohel, and Berechiah, and Hasadiah, Jushab-hezed. [Ch1
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#020). And Malchiram, and Rephaiah, and
Shenazar, Jecamiah, Hoshama, and Nedabiah. [Ch1
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#021). The sons of Hananiah; Pelatiah
and Jesaiah; the sons of Rephaiah; his son Arnan, his son Obadiah, his
son Shecaniah.
