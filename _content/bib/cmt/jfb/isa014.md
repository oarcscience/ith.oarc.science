### [Isaiah Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#001)

[Isaiah 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 14:1</span></span>

CONFIRMATION OF THIS BY THE HEREFORETOLD DESTRUCTION OF THE ASSYRIANS
UNDER SENNACHERIB; ([Isa 14:24-27](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#024))

choose--"set His choice upon." A deliberate predilection \[HORSLEY\].
Their restoration is grounded on their election (see [Psa
102:13-22](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#013)).

strangers--proselytes ([Est 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#017); [Act
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#010); [Act
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#004), [Act
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#017)). TACITUS, a heathen
\[Histories, 5.5\], attests the fact of numbers of the Gentiles having
become Jews in his time. An earnest of the future effect on the heathen
world of the Jews' spiritual restoration ([Isa
60:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#004), [Isa
60:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#010); [Mic
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#007); [Zac
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#016); [Rom
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#012)).

[Isaiah 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 14:2</span></span>

the people--of Babylon, primarily. Of the whole Gentile world ultimately
([Isa 49:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#022); [Isa
66:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#020); [Isa
60:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#009)).

their place--Judea ([Ezr 1:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001)).

possess--receive in possession.

captives--not by physical, but by moral might; the force of love, and
regard to Israel's God ([Isa 60:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#014)).

[Isaiah 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 14:3</span></span>

rest-- ([Isa 28:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#012); [Eze
28:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#025)).

The whole earth rejoices; the cedars of Lebanon taunt him.

[Isaiah 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 14:4</span></span>

A CHORUS OF JEWS EXPRESS THEIR JOYFUL SURPRISE AT BABYLON'S DOWNFALL.
([Isa 14:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#004))

proverb--The Orientals, having few books, embodied their thoughts in
weighty, figurative, briefly expressed gnomes. Here a taunting song of
triumph ([Mic 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#004); [Hab
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#006)).

the king--the ideal representative of Babylon; perhaps Belshazzar (Dan.
5:1-31). The mystical Babylon is ultimately meant.

golden city--rather, "the exactress of gold" \[MAURER\]. But the old
translators read differently in the Hebrew, "oppression," which the
parallelism favors (compare [Isa 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#005)).

[Isaiah 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 14:5</span></span>

staff--not the scepter ([Psa 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#009)), but
the staff with which one strikes others, as he is speaking of more
tyrants than one ([Isa 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#004); [Isa
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#024); [Isa
14:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#029)) \[MAURER\].

rulers--tyrants, as the parallelism "the wicked" proves (compare see on
[Isa 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#002)).

[Isaiah 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 14:6</span></span>

people--the peoples subjected to Babylon.

is persecuted--the Hebrew is rather, active, "which persecuted them,
without any to hinder him" \[Vulgate, JEROME, and HORSLEY\].

[Isaiah 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 14:7</span></span>

they--the once subject nations of the whole earth. HOUBIGANT places the
stop after "fir trees" ([Isa 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#008)),
"The very fir trees break forth," &c. But the parallelism is better in
English Version.

[Isaiah 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 14:8</span></span>

the fir trees--now left undisturbed. Probably a kind of evergreen.

rejoice at thee-- ([Psa 96:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#012)). At thy
fall ([Psa 35:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#019), [Psa
35:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#024)).

no feller--as formerly, when thou wast in power ([Isa
10:34](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#034); [Isa
37:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#024)).

Hades (the Amenthes of Egypt), the unseen abode of the departed; some of
its tenants, once mighty monarchs, are represented by a bold
personification as rising from their seats in astonishment at the
descent among them of the humbled king of Babylon. This proves, in
opposition to WARBURTON \[The Divine Legation\], that the belief existed
among the Jews that there was a Sheol or Hades, in which the "Rephaim"
or manes of the departed abode.

[Isaiah 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 14:9</span></span>

THE SCENE CHANGES FROM EARTH TO HELL. ([Isa
14:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#009))

moved--put into agitation.

for thee--that is, "at thee"; towards thee; explained by "to meet thee
at thy coming" \[MAURER\].

chief ones--literally, "goats"; so rams, leaders of the flock; princes
([Zac 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#003)). The idea of wickedness on
a gigantic scale is included ([Eze
34:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#017); [Mat
25:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#032)). MAGEE derives "Rephaim"
(English Version, "the dead") from a Hebrew root, "to resolve into first
elements"; so "the deceased" ([Isa
26:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#014)) "ghosts" ([Pro
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#016)). These being magnified by the
imagination of the living into gigantic stature, gave their name to
giants in general ([Gen 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#004); [Gen
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#005); [Eze
32:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#018), [Eze
32:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#021)). "Rephaim," translated in the
Septuagint, "giants" (compare see on [Job
26:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#005)). Thence, as the giant Rephaim
of Canaan were notorious even in that guilty land, enormous wickedness
became connected with the term. So the Rephaim came to be the wicked
spirits in Gehenna, the lower of the two portions into which Sheol is
divided.

[Isaiah 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 14:10</span></span>

They taunt him and derive from his calamity consolation under their own
([Eze 31:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#016)).

weak--as a shade bereft of blood and life. Rephaim, "the dead," may come
from a Hebrew root, meaning similarly "feeble," "powerless." The speech
of the departed closes with [Isa
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#011).

[Isaiah 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 14:11</span></span>

"Pomp" and music, the accompaniment of Babylon's former feastings ([Isa
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#012); [Isa
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#008)), give place to the corruption
and the stillness of the grave ([Eze
32:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#027)).

worm--that is bred in putridity.

worms--properly those from which the crimson dye is obtained.
Appropriate here; instead of the crimson coverlet, over thee shall be
"worms." Instead of the gorgeous couch, "under thee" shall be the
maggot.

The language is so framed as to apply to the Babylonian king primarily,
and at the same time to shadow forth through him, the great final enemy,
the man of sin, Antichrist, of Daniel, St. Paul, and St. John; he alone
shall fulfil exhaustively all the lineaments here given.

[Isaiah 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 14:12</span></span>

THE JEWS ADDRESS HIM AGAIN AS A FALLEN ONCE-BRIGHT STAR. ([Isa
14:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#012))

Lucifer--"day star." A title truly belonging to Christ ([Rev
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#016)), "the bright and morning star,"
and therefore hereafter to be assumed by Antichrist. GESENIUS, however,
renders the Hebrew here as in [Eze
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#012); [Zac
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#002), "howl."

weaken--"prostrate"; as in [Exo 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#013),
"discomfit."

[Isaiah 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 14:13</span></span>

above . . . God--In [Dan 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#010), "stars"
express earthly potentates. "The stars" are often also used to express
heavenly principalities ([Job 38:7](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#007)).

mount of the congregation--the place of solemn meeting between God and
His people in the temple at Jerusalem. In [Dan
11:37](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#037), and [Th2
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#004), this is attributed to Antichrist.

sides of the north--namely, the sides of Mount Moriah on which the
temple was built; north of Mount Zion ([Psa
48:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#002)). However, the parallelism
supports the notion that the Babylonian king expresses himself according
to his own, and not Jewish opinions (so in [Isa
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#010)) thus "mount of the
congregation" will mean the northern mountain (perhaps in Armenia)
fabled by the Babylonians to be the common meeting-place of their gods.
"Both sides" imply the angle in which the sides meet; and so the
expression comes to mean "the extreme parts of the north." So the Hindus
place the Meru, the dwelling-place of their gods, in the north, in the
Himalayan mountains. So the Greeks, in the northern Olympus. The Persian
followers of Zoroaster put the Ai-bordsch in the Caucasus north of them.
The allusion to the stars harmonizes with this; namely, that those near
the North Pole, the region of the aurora borealis (compare see on [Job
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#009); [Job
37:22](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#022)) \[MAURER, Septuagint, Syriac\].

[Isaiah 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 14:14</span></span>

clouds--rather, "the cloud," singular. Perhaps there is a reference to
the cloud, the symbol of the divine presence ([Isa
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#005); [Exo
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#021)). So this tallies with [Th2
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#004), "above all that is called God";
as here "above . . . the cloud"; and as the Shekinah-cloud was connected
with the temple, there follows, "he as God sitteth in the temple of
God," answering to "I will be like the Most High" here. Moreover, [Rev
17:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#004), represents Antichrist as
seated in BABYLON, to which city, literal and spiritual, Isaiah refers
here.

[Isaiah 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 14:15</span></span>

to hell--to Sheol ([Isa 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#006)), thou
who hast said, "I will ascend into heaven" ([Mat
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#023)).

sides of the pit--antithetical to the "sides of the north" ([Isa
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#013)). Thus the reference is to the
sides of the sepulcher round which the dead were arranged in niches. But
MAURER here, as in [Isa 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#013),
translates, "the extreme," or innermost parts of the sepulchre: as in
[Eze 32:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#023) (compare [Sa1
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#003)).

[Isaiah 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 14:16</span></span>

THE PASSERS-BY CONTEMPLATE WITH ASTONISHMENT THE BODY OF THE KING OF
BABYLON CAST OUT, INSTEAD OF LYING IN A SPLENDID MAUSOLEUM, AND CAN
HARDLY BELIEVE THEIR SENSES THAT IT IS HE. ([Isa
14:16-20](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#016))

narrowly look--to be certain they are not mistaken.

consider--"meditate upon" \[HORSLEY\].

[Isaiah 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 14:17</span></span>

opened not . . . house . . . prisoners--But MAURER, as Margin, "Did not
let his captives loose homewards."

[Isaiah 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 14:18</span></span>

All--that is, This is the usual practice.

in glory--in a grand mausoleum.

house--that is, "sepulchre," as in [Ecc
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#005); "grave" ([Isa
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#019)). To be excluded from the family
sepulcher was a mark of infamy ([Isa
34:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#003); [Jer
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#019); [Kg1
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#022); [Ch2
21:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#020); [Ch2
24:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#025); [Ch2
28:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#027)).

[Isaiah 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 14:19</span></span>

cast out of--not that he had lain in the grave and was then cast out of
it, but "cast out without a grave," such as might have been expected by
thee ("thy").

branch--a useless sucker starting up from the root of a tree, and cut
away by the husbandman.

raiment of those . . . slain--covered with gore, and regarded with
abhorrence as unclean by the Jews. Rather, "clothed (that is, covered)
with the slain"; as in [Job 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#005), "My
flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust" \[MAURER\].

thrust through--that is, "the slain who have been thrust through," &c.

stones of . . . pit--whose bodies are buried in sepulchres excavated
amidst stones, whereas the king of Babylon is an unburied "carcass
trodden under foot."

[Isaiah 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 14:20</span></span>

not . . . joined with them--whereas the princes slain with thee shall be
buried, thou shalt not.

thou . . . destroyed . . . land--Belshazzar (or Naboned) oppressed his
land with wars and tyranny, so that he was much hated \[XENOPHON,
CyropÃ&brvbr;dia 4.6, 3; 7.5, 32\].

seed . . . never be renowned--rather, "shall not be named for ever"; the
Babylonian dynasty shall end with Belshazzar; his family shall not be
perpetuated \[HORSLEY\].

[Isaiah 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 14:21</span></span>

GOD'S DETERMINATION TO DESTROY BABYLON. ([Isa
14:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#021))

Prepare, &c.--charge to the Medes and Persians, as if they were God's
conscious instruments.

his children--Belshazzar's ([Exo
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#005)).

rise--to occupy the places of their fathers.

fill . . . with cities--MAURER translates, "enemies," as the Hebrew
means in [Sa1 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#016); [Psa
139:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#020); namely, lest they inundate the
world with their armies. VITRINGA translates, "disturbers." In English
Version the meaning is, "lest they fill the land with such cities" of
pride as Babylon was.

[Isaiah 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 14:22</span></span>

against them--the family of the king of Babylon.

name--all the male representatives, so that the name shall become
extinct ([Isa 56:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#005); [Rut
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#005)).

remnant--all that is left of them. The dynasty shall cease ([Dan
5:28-31](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#028)). Compare as to Babylon in
general, [Jer 51:62](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#062).

[Isaiah 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">isa 14:23</span></span>

bittern--rather, "the hedgehog" \[MAURER and GESENIUS\]. STRABO (16:1)
states that enormous hedgehogs were found in the islands of the
Euphrates.

pools--owing to Cyrus turning the waters of the Euphrates over the
country.

besom--sweep-net \[MAURER\], ([Kg1
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#010); [Kg2
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#013)).

This would comfort the Jews when captives in Babylon, being a pledge
that God, who had by that time fulfilled the promise concerning
Sennacherib (though now still future), would also fulfil His promise as
to destroying Babylon, Judah's enemy.

[Isaiah 14:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">isa 14:24</span></span>

A FRAGMENT AS TO THE DESTRUCTION OF THE ASSYRIANS UNDER SENNACHERIB.
([Isa 14:24-27](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#024))

In this verse the Lord's thought (purpose) stands in antithesis to the
Assyrians' thoughts ([Isa 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#007)). (See
[Isa 46:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#010); [Sa1
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#029); [Mal
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#006)).

[Isaiah 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">isa 14:25</span></span>

That--My purpose, namely, "that."

break . . . yoke-- ([Isa 10:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#027)).

my mountains--Sennacherib's army was destroyed on the mountains near
Jerusalem ([Isa 10:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#033)). God
regarded Judah as peculiarly His.

[Isaiah 14:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">isa 14:26</span></span>

This is . . . purpose . . . whole earth--A hint that the prophecy
embraces the present world of all ages in its scope, of which the
purpose concerning Babylon and Assyria, the then representatives of the
world power, is but a part.

hand . . . stretched out upon--namely, in punishment ([Isa
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#025)).

[Isaiah 14:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">isa 14:27</span></span>

([Dan 4:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#035)).

To comfort the Jews, lest they should fear that people; not in order to
call the Philistines to repentance, since the prophecy was probably
never circulated among them. They had been subdued by Uzziah or Azariah
([Ch2 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#006)); but in the reign of Ahaz
([Ch2 28:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#018)), they took several towns
in south Judea. Now Isaiah denounces their final subjugation by
Hezekiah.

[Isaiah 14:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">isa 14:28</span></span>

PROPHECY AGAINST PHILISTIA. ([Isa
14:28-32](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#028))

In . . . year . . . Ahaz died--726 B.C. Probably it was in this year
that the Philistines threw off the yoke put on them by Uzziah.

[Isaiah 14:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">isa 14:29</span></span>

Palestina--literally, "the land of sojourners."

rod . . . broken--The yoke imposed by Uzziah ([Ch2
26:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#006)) was thrown off under Ahaz ([Ch2
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#018)).

serpent's root--the stock of Jesse ([Isa
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001)). Uzziah was doubtless regarded
by the Philistines as a biting "serpent." But though the effects of his
bite have been got rid of, a more deadly viper, or "cockatrice"
(literally, "viper's offspring," as Philistia would regard him), namely,
Hezekiah awaits you ([Kg2 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#008)).

[Isaiah 14:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">isa 14:30</span></span>

first-born of . . . poor--Hebraism, for the most abject poor; the
first-born being the foremost of the family. Compare "first-born of
death" ([Job 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#013)), for the most
fatal death. The Jews, heretofore exposed to Philistine invasions and
alarms, shall be in safety. Compare [Psa
72:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#004), "Children of the needy,"
expressing those "needy in condition."

feed--image from a flock feeding in safety.

root--radical destruction.

He shall slay--Jehovah shall. The change of person, "He" after "I," is a
common Hebraism.

gate--that is, ye who throng the gate; the chief place of concourse in a
city.

from . . . north--Judea, north and east of Palestine.

smoke--from the signal-fire, whereby a hostile army was called together;
the Jews' signal-fire is meant here, the "pillar of cloud and fire,"
([Exo 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#021); [Neh
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#019)); or else from the region
devastated by fire \[MAURER\]. GESENIUS less probably refers it to the
cloud of dust raised by the invading army.

none . . . alone . . . in . . . appointed times--Rather, "There shall
not be a straggler among his (the enemy's) levies." The Jewish host
shall advance on Palestine in close array; none shall fall back or lag
from weariness ([Isa 5:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#026)),
\[LOWTH\]. MAURER thinks the Hebrew will not bear the rendering "levies"
or "armies." He translates, "There is not one (of the Philistine watch
guards) who will remain alone (exposed to the enemy) at his post,"
through fright. On "alone," compare [Psa
102:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#007); [Hos
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#009).

messengers of the nation--When messengers come from Philistia to enquire
as to the state of Judea, the reply shall be, that the Lord . . . ([Psa
87:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#001), [Psa
87:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#005); [Psa

LOWTH thinks it was delivered in the first years of Hezekiah's reign and
fulfilled in the fourth when Shalmaneser, on his way to invade Israel,
may have seized on the strongholds of Moab. Moab probably had made
common cause with Israel and Syria in a league against Assyria. Hence it
incurred the vengeance of Assyria. Jeremiah has introduced much of this
prophecy into his forty-eighth chapter.
