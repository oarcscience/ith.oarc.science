### [Job Chapter 38](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#001)

[Job 38:1](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 38:1</span></span>

(Job 38:1-41)

Jehovah appears unexpectedly in a whirlwind (already gathering [Job
37:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#001)), the symbol of "judgment"
([Psa 50:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#003), &c.), to which Job had
challenged Him. He asks him now to get himself ready for the contest.
Can he explain the phenomena of God's natural government? How can he,
then, hope to understand the principles of His moral government? God
thus confirms Elihu's sentiment, that submission to, not reasonings on,
God's ways is man's part. This and the disciplinary design of trial to
the godly is the great lesson of this book. He does not solve the
difficulty by reference to future retribution: for this was not the
immediate question; glimpses of that truth were already given in the
fourteenth and nineteenth chapters, the full revelation of it being
reserved for Gospel times. Yet even now we need to learn the lesson
taught by Elihu and God in Job.

[Job 38:2](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 38:2</span></span>

this--Job.

counsel--impugning My divine wisdom in the providential arrangements of
the universe. Such "words" (including those of the friends) rather
obscure, than throw light on My ways. God is about to be Job's
Vindicator, but must first bring him to a right state of mind for
receiving relief.

[Job 38:3](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 38:3</span></span>

a man--hero, ready for battle ([Co1
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#013)), as he had wished ([Job
9:35](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#035); [Job
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#022); [Job
31:37](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#037)). The robe, usually worn
flowing, was girt up by a girdle when men ran, labored, or fought ([Pe1
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#013)).

[Job 38:4](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 38:4</span></span>

To understand the cause of things, man should have been present at their
origin. The finite creature cannot fathom the infinite wisdom of the
Creator ([Job 28:12](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#012); [Job
15:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#007)).

hast--"knowest."

understanding-- ([Pro 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#001)).

[Job 38:5](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 38:5</span></span>

measures--of its proportions. Image from an architect's plans of a
building.

line--of measurement ([Isa 28:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#017)). The
earth is formed on an all-wise plan.

[Job 38:6](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 38:6</span></span>

foundations--not "sockets," as Margin.

fastened--literally, "made to sink," as a foundation-stone let down till
it settles firmly in the clay ([Job
26:7](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#007)). Gravitation makes and keeps the
earth a sphere.

[Job 38:7](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 38:7</span></span>

So at the founding of Zerubbabel's temple ([Ezr
3:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#010)). So hereafter at the
completion of the Church, the temple of the Holy Ghost ([Zac
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#007)); as at its foundation ([Luk
2:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#013)).

morning stars--especially beautiful. The creation morn is appropriately
associated with these, it being the commencement of this world's day.
The stars are figuratively said to sing God's praises, as in [Psa
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#001); [Psa
148:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#003). They are symbols of the angels,
bearing the same relation to our earth, as angels do to us. Therefore
they answer to "sons of God," or angels, in the parallel. See on [Job
25:5](../../../bib/kjv/job025.htm#005).

[Job 38:8](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 38:8</span></span>

doors--floodgates; these when opened caused the flood ([Gen
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#002)); or else, the shores.

womb--of chaos. The bowels of the earth. Image from childbirth ([Job
38:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#008); [Eze
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#002); [Mic
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#010)). Ocean at its birth was wrapped
in clouds as its swaddling bands.

[Job 38:10](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 38:10</span></span>

brake up for--that is, appointed it. Shores are generally broken and
abrupt cliffs. The Greek for "shore" means "a broken place." I broke off
or measured off for it my limit, that is, the limit which I thought fit
([Job 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#010)).

[Job 38:11](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 38:11</span></span>

stayed--Hebrew, "a limit shall be set to."

[Job 38:12](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 38:12</span></span>

Passing from creation to phenomena in the existing inanimate world.

Hast thou--as God daily does.

commanded the morning--to rise.

since thy days--since thou hast come into being.

his place--It varies in its place of rising from day to day, and yet it
has its place each day according to fixed laws.

[Job 38:13](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 38:13</span></span>

take hold of the ends, &c.--spread itself over the earth to its utmost
bounds in a moment.

wicked--who hate the light, and do their evil works in the dark ([Job
24:13](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#013)).

shaken out of it--The corners (Hebrew, "wings" or "skirts") of it, as of
a garment, are taken hold of by the dayspring, so as to shake off the
wicked.

[Job 38:14](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 38:14</span></span>

Explaining the first clause of [Job
38:13](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#013), as [Job
38:15](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#015) does the second clause. As the
plastic clay presents the various figures impressed on it by a seal, so
the earth, which in the dark was void of all form, when illuminated by
the dayspring, presents a variety of forms, hills, valleys, &c.

turned--(Hebrew, "turns itself") alludes to the rolling cylinder seal,
such as is found in Babylon, which leaves its impressions on the clay,
as it is turned about; so the morning light rolling on over the earth.

they stand--The forms of beauty, unfolded by the dawn, stand forth as a
garment, in which the earth is clad.

[Job 38:15](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 38:15</span></span>

their light--by which they work; namely, darkness, which is their day
([Job 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#017)), is extinguished by
daylight.

high--Rather, "The arm uplifted" for murder or other crime is broken; it
falls down suddenly, powerless, through their fear of light.

[Job 38:16](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 38:16</span></span>

springs--fountains beneath the sea ([Psa
95:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#004)).

search--Rather, "the inmost recesses"; literally, "that which is only
found by searching," the deep caverns of ocean.

[Job 38:17](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 38:17</span></span>

seen--The second clause heightens the thought in the first. Man during
life does not even "see" the gates of the realm of the dead ("death,"
[Job 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#021)); much less are they
"opened" to him. But those are "naked before God" ([Job
26:6](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#006)).

[Job 38:18](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 38:18</span></span>

Hast thou--as God doth ([Job 28:24](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#024)).

[Job 38:19](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 38:19</span></span>

The marvels in heaven. "What is the way (to the place wherein) light
dwelleth?" The origin of light and darkness. In [Gen
1:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#003), [Gen
1:14-18](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#014), "light" is created distinct
from, and previous to, light-emitting bodies, the luminaries of heaven.

[Job 38:20](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 38:20</span></span>

Dost thou know its place so well as to be able to guide, ("take" as in
[Isa 36:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#017)) it to (but UMBREIT, "reach
it in") its own boundary, that is, the limit between light and darkness
([Job 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#010))?

[Job 38:21](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 38:21</span></span>

Or without the interrogation, in an ironical sense \[UMBREIT\].

then--when I created light and darkness ([Job
15:7](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#007)).

[Job 38:22](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 38:22</span></span>

treasures--storehouses, from which God draws forth snow and hail. Snow
is vapor congealed in the air before it is collected in drops large
enough to form hail. Its shape is that of a crystal in endless variety
of beautiful figures. Hail is formed by rain falling through dry cold
air.

[Job 38:23](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">job 38:23</span></span>

against the time of trouble--the time when I design to chastise men
([Exo 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#018); [Jos
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#011); [Rev
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#021); [Isa
28:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#017); [Psa
18:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#012); [Hag
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#017)).

[Job 38:24](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">job 38:24</span></span>

is . . . parted--parts, so as to diffuse itself over the whole earth,
though seeming to come from one point. Light travels from the sun to the
earth, ninety millions of miles, in eight minutes.

which scattereth--rather, "And by what way the east wind (personified)
spreads (scattereth) itself." The light and east wind are associated
together, as both come from one quarter, and often arise together ([Jon
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#008)).

[Job 38:25](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">job 38:25</span></span>

waters--Rain falls, not in a mass on one spot, but in countless separate
canals in the air marked out for them.

way for the lightning-- ([Job 28:26](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#026)).

[Job 38:26](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">job 38:26</span></span>

Since rain fails also on places uninhabited by man, it cannot be that
man guides its course. Such rain, though man cannot explain the reason
for it, is not lost. God has some wise design in it.

[Job 38:27](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">job 38:27</span></span>

As though the desolate ground thirsted for God's showers.
Personification. The beauty imparted to the uninhabited desert pleases
God, for whom primarily all things exist, and He has ulterior designs in
it.

[Job 38:28](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">job 38:28</span></span>

Can any visible origin of rain and dew be assigned by man? Dew is
moisture, which was suspended in the air, but becomes condensed on
reaching the--in the night--lower temperature of objects on the earth.

[Job 38:29](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">job 38:29</span></span>

[Job 37:10](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#010).

[Job 38:30](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">job 38:30</span></span>

The unfrozen waters are hid under the frozen, as with a covering of
stone.

frozen--literally, "is taken"; the particles take hold of one another so
as to cohere.

[Job 38:31](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">job 38:31</span></span>

sweet influences--the joy diffused by spring, the time when the Pleiades
appear. The Eastern poets, Hafiz, Sadi, &c., describe them as "brilliant
rosettes." GESENIUS translates: "bands" or "knot," which answers better
the parallelism. But English Version agrees better with the Hebrew. The
seven stars are closely "bound" together (see on [Job
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#009)). "Canst thou bind or loose the
tie?" "Canst thou loose the bonds by which the constellation Orion
(represented in the East as an impious giant chained to the sky) is held
fast?" (See on [Job 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#009)).

[Job 38:32](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">job 38:32</span></span>

Canst thou bring forth from their places or houses (Mazzaloth, [Kg2
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#005), Margin; to which Mazzaroth here
is equivalent) into the sky the signs of the Zodiac at their respective
seasons--the twelve lodgings in which the sun successively stays, or
appears, in the sky?

Arcturus--Ursa Major.

his sons?--the three stars in his tail. Canst thou make them appear in
the sky? ([Job 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#009)). The great and
less Bear are called by the Arabs "Daughters of the Bier," the
quadrangle being the bier, the three others the mourners.

[Job 38:33](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">job 38:33</span></span>

ordinances--which regulate the alternations of seasons, &c. ([Gen
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#022)).

dominion--controlling influence of the heavenly bodies, the sun, moon,
&c., on the earth (on the tides, weather) ([Gen
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#016); [Psa
136:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#007)).

[Job 38:34](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">job 38:34</span></span>

[Jer 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#022); above [Job
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#011), metaphorically.

[Job 38:35](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">job 38:35</span></span>

Here we are--at thy disposal ([Isa
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#008)).

[Job 38:36](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">job 38:36</span></span>

inward parts . . . heart--But "dark clouds" ("shining phenomena")
\[UMBREIT\]; "meteor" \[MAURER\], referring to the consultation of these
as signs of weather by the husbandman ([Ecc
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#004)). But Hebrew supports English
Version. The connection is, "Who hath given thee the intelligence to
comprehend in any degree the phenomena just specified?"

heart--not the usual Hebrew word, but one from a root "to view";
perception.

[Job 38:37](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">job 38:37</span></span>

Who appoints by his wisdom the due measure of the clouds?

stay--rather, "empty"; literally, "lay down" or "incline" so as to pour
out.

bottles of heaven--rain-filled clouds.

[Job 38:38](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">job 38:38</span></span>

groweth, &c.--rather, pour itself into a mass by the rain, like molten
metal; then translate [Job 38:38](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#038), "Who
is it that empties," &c., "when," &c.? The English Version, however, is
tenable: "Is caked into a mass" by heat, like molten metal, before the
rain falls; "Who is it that can empty the rain vessels, and bring down
rain at such a time?" ([Job 38:38](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#038)).

[Job 38:39](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">job 38:39</span></span>

At Job 38:39-39:30, the instincts of animals. Is it thou that givest it
the instinct to hunt its prey? ([Psa
104:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#021)).

appetite--literally, "life," which depends on the appetite" ([Job
33:20](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#020)).

[Job 38:40](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">job 38:40</span></span>

lie in wait?--for their prey ([Psa
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#009)).

[Job 38:41](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">job 38:41</span></span>

[Luk 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#024). Transition from the noble
lioness to the croaking raven. Though man dislikes it, as of ill omen,
God cares for it, as for all His creatures.
