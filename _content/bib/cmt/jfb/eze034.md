### [Ezekiel Chapter 34](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#001)

[Ezekiel 34:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 34:2</span></span>

REPROOF OF THE FALSE SHEPHERDS; PROMISE OF THE TRUE AND GOOD SHEPHERD.
(Eze. 34:1-31)

[Jer 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#001) and [Zac
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#017) similarly make the removal of
the false shepherds the preliminary to the interposition of Messiah the
Good Shepherd in behalf of His people Israel. The "shepherds" are not
prophets or priests, but rulers who sought in their government their own
selfish ends, not the good of the people ruled. The term was
appropriate, as David, the first king and the type of the true David
([Eze 34:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#023)), was taken from being
a shepherd ([Sa2 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#002); [Psa
78:70-71](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#070)); and the office, like that
of a shepherd for his flock, is to guard and provide for his people. The
choice of a shepherd for the first king was therefore designed to
suggest this thought, just as Jesus' selection of fishermen for apostles
was designed to remind them of their spiritual office of catching men
(compare [Isa 44:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#028); [Jer
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#008); [Jer
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#015); [Jer
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#021); [Jer
23:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#001)).

[Ezekiel 34:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 34:3</span></span>

fat--or, by differently pointing the Hebrew, "milk" \[Septuagint\]. Thus
the repetition "fat" and "fed" is avoided: also the eating of "fat"
would not probably be put before the "killing" of the sheep. The eating
of sheep's or goats' milk as food ([Deu
32:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#014); [Pro
27:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#027)) was unobjectionable, had not
these shepherds milked them too often, and that without duly "feeding"
them \[BOCHART\], ([Isa 56:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#011)). The
rulers levied exorbitant tributes.

kill . . . fed--kill the rich by false accusation so as to get
possession of their property.

feed not . . . flock--take no care of the people ([Joh
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#012)).

[Ezekiel 34:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 34:4</span></span>

The diseased--rather, those weak from the effects of "disease," as
"strengthened" (that is, with due nourishment) requires \[GROTIUS\].

broken--that is, fractures from wounds inflicted by the wolf.

brought again . . . driven away-- ([Exo
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#004)). Those "driven away" by the
enemy into foreign lands through God's judgments are meant ([Jer
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#003)). A spiritual reformation of the
state by the rulers would have turned away God's wrath, and "brought
again" the exiles. The rulers are censured as chiefly guilty (though the
people, too, were guilty), because they, who ought to have been foremost
in checking the evil, promoted it.

neither . . . sought . . . lost--Contrast the Good Shepherd's love ([Luk
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#004)).

with force . . . ruled-- ([Exo
1:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#013)). With an Egyptian bondage.
The very thing forbidden by the law they did ([Lev
25:43](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#043); compare [Pe1
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#003)).

[Ezekiel 34:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 34:5</span></span>

scattered, because . . . no shepherd--that is, none worthy of the name,
though there were some called shepherds ([Kg1
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#017); [Mat
9:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#036)). Compare [Mat
26:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#031), where the sheep were scattered
when the true Shepherd was smitten. God calls them "My sheep"; for they
were not, as the shepherds treated them, their patrimony whereby to
"feed themselves."

meat to all . . . beasts--They became a prey to the Syrians, Ammon,
Moab, and Assyria.

[Ezekiel 34:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 34:6</span></span>

every high hill--the scene of their idolatries sanctioned by the rulers.

search . . . seek--rather, "seek . . . search." The former is the part
of the superior rulers to inquire after: to search out is the duty of
the subordinate rulers \[JUNIUS\].

[Ezekiel 34:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 34:10</span></span>

I will require my flock-- ([Heb
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#017)), rather, "I require," &c., for
God already had begun to do so, punishing Zedekiah and the other princes
severely ([Jer 52:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#010)).

[Ezekiel 34:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 34:11</span></span>

I . . . will . . . search--doing that which the so-called shepherds had
failed to do, I being the rightful owner of the flock.

[Ezekiel 34:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 34:12</span></span>

in the day that he is among--in the midst of (Hebrew) His sheep that had
been scattered. Referring to Messiah's second advent, when He shall be
"the glory in the midst of Israel" ([Zac
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#005)).

in the cloudy . . . day--the day of the nation's calamity ([Joe
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#002)).

[Ezekiel 34:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 34:13</span></span>

And I will bring them out from the people, &c.-- ([Eze
28:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#025); [Eze
36:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#024); [Eze
37:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#021); [Isa
65:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#009); [Jer
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#003)).

[Ezekiel 34:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 34:14</span></span>

good pasture-- ([Psa 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#002)).

high mountains of Israel--In [Eze
17:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#023); [Eze
20:40](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#040), the phrase is "the mountain of
the height of Israel" in the singular number. The reason for the
difference is: there Ezekiel spoke of the central seat of the kingdom,
Mount Zion, where the people met for the worship of Jehovah; here he
speaks of the kingdom of Israel at large, all the parts of which are
regarded as possessing a moral elevation.

[Ezekiel 34:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 34:16</span></span>

In contrast to the unfaithful shepherds ([Eze
34:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#004)). The several duties neglected by
them I will faithfully discharge.

fat . . . strong--that is, those rendered wanton by prosperity ([Deu
32:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#015); [Jer
5:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#028)), who use their strength to
oppress the weak. Compare [Eze 34:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#020),
"the fat cattle" ([Isa 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#016)). The
image is from fat cattle that wax refractory.

with judgment--that is, justice and equity, as contrasted with the
"force" and "cruelty" with which the unfaithful shepherds ruled the
flock ([Eze 34:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#004)).

[Ezekiel 34:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 34:17</span></span>

you, . . . my flock--passing from the rulers to the people.

cattle and cattle--rather, "sheep and sheep"; Margin, "small cattle," or
"flocks of lambs and kids," that is, I judge between one class of
citizens and another, so as to award what is right to each. He then
defines the class about to be punitively "judged," namely, "the rams and
he-goats," or "great he-goats" (compare [Isa
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#009), Margin; [Zac
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#003); [Mat
25:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#032)). They answer to "the fat and
strong," as opposed to the "sick" ([Eze
34:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#016)). The rich and ungodly of the
people are meant, who imitated the bad rulers in oppressing their poorer
brethren, as if it enhanced their own joys to trample on others' rights
([Eze 34:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#018)).

[Ezekiel 34:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 34:18</span></span>

Not content with appropriating to their own use the goods of others,
they from mere wantonness spoiled what they did not use, so as to be of
no use to the owners.

deep waters--that is, "limpid," as deep waters are generally clear.
GROTIUS explains the image as referring to the usuries with which the
rich ground the poor ([Eze 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#012); [Isa
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#002)).

[Ezekiel 34:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eze 34:19</span></span>

they eat--scantily.

they drink--sorrowfully.

[Ezekiel 34:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 34:20</span></span>

fat . . . lean--the rich oppressors . . . the humble poor.

[Ezekiel 34:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eze 34:21</span></span>

scattered them abroad--down to the time of the carrying away to Babylon
\[GROTIUS\].

[Ezekiel 34:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eze 34:22</span></span>

After the restoration from Babylon, the Jews were delivered in some
degree from the oppression, not only of foreigners, but also of their
own great people (Neh. 5:1-19). The full and final fulfilment of this
prophecy is future.

[Ezekiel 34:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eze 34:23</span></span>

set up--that is, raise up by divine appointment; alluding to the
declaration of God to David, "I will set up thy seed after thee" ([Sa2
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#012)); and, "Yet have I set My king on
My holy hill of Zion" ([Psa 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#006);
compare [Act 2:30](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#030); [Act
13:23](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#023)).

one shepherd--literally, "a Shepherd, one": singularly and pre-eminently
one: the only one of His kind, to whom none is comparable ([Sol
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#010)). The Lord Jesus refers to this
prophecy ([Joh 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#014)), "I am THE Good
Shepherd." Also "one" as uniting in one the heretofore divided kingdoms
of Israel and Judah, and also "gathering together in one all things in
Christ, both which are in heaven and on earth" ([Eph
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#010)); thus healing worse breaches
than that between Israel and Judah ([Col
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#020)). "God by Him reconciling all
things unto Himself, whether things in earth or in heaven."

David--the antitypical David, Messiah, of the seed of David, which no
other king after the captivity was: who was fully, what David was only
in a degree, "the man after God's own heart." Also, David means beloved:
Messiah was truly God's beloved Son ([Isa
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001); [Mat
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#017)). Shepherd means King, rather
than religious instructor; in this pre-eminently He was the true David,
who was the Shepherd King ([Luk
1:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#032)). Messiah is called "David" in
[Isa 55:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#003); [Jer
30:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#009); [Hos
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#005).

[Ezekiel 34:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">eze 34:24</span></span>

my servant--implying fitness for ruling in the name of God, not pursuing
a self-chosen course, as other kings, but acting as the faithful
administrator of the will of God; Messiah realized fully this character
([Psa 40:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#007); [Isa
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001); [Isa
49:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#003), [Isa
49:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#006); [Isa
53:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#011); [Phi
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007)), which David typically and
partially represented ([Act 13:36](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#036)); so
He is the fittest person to wield the world scepter, abused by all the
world kings ([Dan 2:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#034), [Dan
2:44-45](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#044)).

[Ezekiel 34:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">eze 34:25</span></span>

covenant of peace . . . evil beasts . . . to cease . . . dwell
safely--The original promise of the law ([Lev
26:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#006)) shall be realized for the first
time fully under Messiah ([Isa 11:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#006);
[Isa 35:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#009); [Hos
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#018)).

[Ezekiel 34:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">eze 34:26</span></span>

them and the places round about my hill--The Jews, and Zion, God's hill
([Psa 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#006)), are to be sources of
blessing, not merely to themselves, but to the surrounding heathen ([Isa
19:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#024); [Isa
56:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#006); [Isa
60:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#003); [Mic
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#007); [Zac
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#013)). The literal fulfilment is,
however, the primary one, though the spiritual also is designed. In
correspondence with the settled reign of righteousness internally, all
is to be prosperity externally, fertilizing showers (according to the
promise of the ancient covenant, [Lev
26:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#004); [Psa
68:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#009); [Mal
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#010)), and productive trees and lands
([Eze 34:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#027)). Thus shall they realize
the image of [Eze 34:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#014); namely, a
flock richly pastured by God Himself.

[Ezekiel 34:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">eze 34:27</span></span>

served themselves of them--availed themselves of their services, as if
the Jews were their slaves ([Jer
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#013); [Jer
25:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#014); compare [Gen
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#013); [Exo
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#014)).

[Ezekiel 34:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">eze 34:28</span></span>

dwell safely-- ([Jer 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#006)).

[Ezekiel 34:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">eze 34:29</span></span>

plant of renown--Messiah, the "Rod" and "Branch" ([Isa
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001)), the "righteous Branch" ([Jer
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005)), who shall obtain for them
"renown." FAIRBAIRN less probably translates, "A plantation for a name,"
that is, a flourishing condition, represented as a garden (alluding to
Eden, [Gen 2:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#008), with its various
trees, good for food and pleasant to the sight), the planting of the
Lord ([Isa 60:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#021); [Isa
61:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#003)), and an object of "renown" among
the heathen.

[Ezekiel 34:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">eze 34:31</span></span>

ye my flock . . . are men--not merely an explanation of the image, as
JEROME represents. But as God had promised many things which mere "men"
could not expect to realize, He shows that it is not from man's might
their realization is to be looked for, but from GOD, who would perform
them for His covenant-people, "His flock" \[ROSENMULLER\]. When we
realize most our weakness and God's power and faithfulness to His
covenant, we are in the fittest state for receiving His blessings.

Another feature of Israel's prosperity; those who exulted over Israel's
humiliation, shall themselves be a "prey." Already stated in [Eze
25:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#012); properly repeated here in
full detail, as a commentary on [Eze
34:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#028). The Israelites "shall be no
more a prey"; but Edom, the type of their most bitter foes, shall be
destroyed irrecoverably.
