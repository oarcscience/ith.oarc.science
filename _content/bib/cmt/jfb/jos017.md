### [Joshua Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#001)

[Joshua 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 17:1</span></span>

LOT OF MANASSEH. ([Jos 17:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#001))

There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh--Ephraim was mentioned,
as the more numerous and powerful branch of the family of Joseph ([Gen
48:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#019)); but Manasseh still retained
the right of primogeniture and had a separate inheritance assigned.

Machir--his descendants.

the father of Gilead--Though he had a son of that name ([Num
26:29](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#029); [Num
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#001)), yet, as is evident from the use
of the Hebrew article, reference is made, not to the person, but the
province of Gilead. "Father" here means lord or possessor of Gilead.
This view is confirmed by the fact that it was not Machir, but his
descendants, who subdued Gilead and Bashan ([Num
32:41](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#041); [Deu
3:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#013)). These Machirites had their
portion on the east side of Jordan. The western portion of land,
allotted to the tribe of Manasseh, was divided into ten portions because
the male descendants who had sons consisted of five families, to which,
consequently, five shares were given; and the sixth family, namely, the
posterity of Hepher, being all women, the five daughters of Zelophehad
were, on application to the valuators, endowed each with an inheritance
in land (see on [Num 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#004)).

[Joshua 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jos 17:7</span></span>

THIS COAST. ([Jos 17:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#007))

the coast of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah--The southern
boundary is here traced from the east. Asher (now Yasir), the starting
point, was a town fifteen Roman miles east of Shechem, and anciently a
place of importance.

[Joshua 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jos 17:9</span></span>

the coast descended unto the river Kanah, southward of the river--The
line which separated the possessions of the two brothers from each other
ran to the south of the stream. Thus the river was in the territory of
Manasseh; but the cities which were upon the river, though all were
within the limits of Manasseh's possessions, were assigned partly to
Ephraim, and partly to Manasseh; those on the south side being given to
the former; those upon the north to the latter \[KEIL\]. It appears
([Jos 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#010)) that Manasseh was still
further interlaced with other neighboring tribes.

[Joshua 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jos 17:11</span></span>

Beth-shean and her towns--Greek, "Scythopolis" (now Beisan), in the
valley of the Jordan, towards the east end of the plain of Jezreel.
"Beth-shean" means "house of rest," so called from its being the halting
place for caravans travelling between Syria or Midian, and Egypt, and
the great station for the commerce between these countries for many
centuries.

Ibleam and her towns--in the neighborhood of Megiddo ([Kg2
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#027)).

the inhabitants of Dor and her towns--(now Tantoura), anciently a strong
fortress; a wall of wild precipitous rock defended the shore
fortifications against attack from the land side.

En-dor and her towns--situated on a rocky eminence, four Roman miles
south of Tabor.

Taanach and . . . Megiddo--These were near to each other, and they are
generally mentioned in Scripture together. They were both royal and
strongly fortified places (see on [Jdg
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#027)).

three countries--districts or provinces. It is computed that Manasseh
possessed in Asher and Issachar portions of ground to the extent of more
than two hundred square miles.

[Joshua 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jos 17:12</span></span>

CANAANITES NOT DRIVEN OUT. ([Jos
17:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#012))

Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out those cities--probably
due to indolence, a love of ease. Perhaps a mistaken humanity, arising
from a disregard or forgetfulness of the divine command, and a
decreasing principle of faith and zeal in the service of God, were the
causes of their failure.

[Joshua 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jos 17:14</span></span>

THE CHILDREN OF JOSEPH ASK FOR ANOTHER LOT. ([Jos
17:14-18](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#014))

the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua--The two tribes join in laying
a complaint before the leader, as to the narrow boundaries of their
allotment and its insufficiency to be the residence of tribes so vastly
increased. But Joshua's answer was full of wisdom as well as patriotism.
Knowing their character, he treated them accordingly, and sarcastically
turned all their arguments against themselves. Thus he rebuked their
unbelief and cowardice.

[Joshua 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jos 17:15</span></span>

mount Ephraim--called so here by anticipation. The Gilboa range between
Beth-shean and the plain of Jezreel is meant, anciently covered with an
extensive forest.

[Joshua 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jos 17:16</span></span>

chariots of iron--unusually strengthened with that metal, and perhaps
armed with projecting scythes.
