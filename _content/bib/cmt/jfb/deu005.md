### [Deuteronomy Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#001)

[Deuteronomy 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 5:1</span></span>

A COMMEMORATION OF THE COVENANT IN HOREB. (Deu. 5:1-29)

Hear, O Israel, the statutes and judgments--Whether this rehearsal of
the law was made in a solemn assembly, or as some think at a general
meeting of the elders as representatives of the people, is of little
moment; it was addressed either directly or indirectly to the Hebrew
people as principles of their peculiar constitution as a nation; and
hence, as has been well observed, "the Jewish law has no obligation upon
Christians, unless so much of it as given or commanded by Jesus Christ;
for whatever in this law is conformable to the laws of nature, obliges
us, not as given by Moses, but by virtue of an antecedent law common to
all rational beings" \[BISHOP WILSON\].

[Deuteronomy 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 5:3</span></span>

The Lord made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us--The
meaning is, "not with our fathers" only, "but with us" also, assuming it
to be "a covenant" of grace. It may mean "not with our fathers" at all,
if the reference is to the peculiar establishment of the covenant of
Sinai; a law was not given to them as to us, nor was the covenant
ratified in the same public manner and by the same solemn sanctions. Or,
finally, the meaning may be "not with our fathers" who died in the
wilderness, in consequence of their rebellion, and to whom God did not
give the rewards promised only to the faithful; but "with us," who
alone, strictly speaking, shall enjoy the benefits of this covenant by
entering on the possession of the promised land.

[Deuteronomy 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">deu 5:4</span></span>

The Lord talked with you face to face in the mount--not in a visible and
corporeal form, of which there was no trace ([Deu
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#012), [Deu
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#015)), but freely, familiarly, and in
such a manner that no doubt could be entertained of His presence.

[Deuteronomy 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">deu 5:5</span></span>

I stood between the Lord and you at that time--as the messenger and
interpreter of thy heavenly King, bringing near two objects formerly
removed from each other at a vast distance, namely, God and the people
([Gal 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#019)). In this character Moses
was a type of Christ, who is the only mediator between God and men ([Ti1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#005)), the Mediator of a better
covenant ([Heb 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#006); [Heb
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#015); [Heb
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#024)).

to show you the word of the Lord--not the ten commandments--for they
were proclaimed directly by the Divine Speaker Himself, but the statutes
and judgments which are repeated in the subsequent portion of this book.

[Deuteronomy 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">deu 5:6</span></span>

I am the Lord thy God--The word "Lord" is expressive of authority or
dominion; and God, who by natural claim as well as by covenant relation
was entitled to exercise supremacy over His people Israel, had a
sovereign right to establish laws for their government. \[See on [Exo
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#002).\] The commandments which follow
are, with a few slight verbal alterations, the same as formerly recorded
(Exo. 20:1-17), and in some of them there is a distinct reference to
that promulgation.

[Deuteronomy 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">deu 5:12</span></span>

Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the Lord thy God hath commanded
thee--that is, keep it in mind as a sacred institution of former
enactment and perpetual obligation. \[See on [Exo
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#008)\].

[Deuteronomy 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">deu 5:14</span></span>

that thy man-servant and thy maid-servant may rest as well as thou--This
is a different reason for the observance of the Sabbath from what is
assigned in [Exo 20:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#008), where that
day is stated to be an appointed memorial of the creation. But the
addition of another motive for the observance does not imply any
necessary contrariety to the other; and it has been thought probable
that, the commemorative design of the institution being well known, the
other reason was specially mentioned on this repetition of the law, to
secure the privilege of sabbatic rest to servants, of which, in some
Hebrew families, they had been deprived. In this view, the allusion to
the period of Egyptian bondage ([Deu
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#015)), when they themselves were not
permitted to observe the Sabbath either as a day of rest or of public
devotion, was peculiarly seasonable and significant, well fitted to come
home to their business and bosoms.

[Deuteronomy 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">deu 5:16</span></span>

that it may go well with thee--This clause is not in Exodus, but
admitted into [Eph 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#003).

[Deuteronomy 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">deu 5:21</span></span>

Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbour's wife, . . . house, his
field--An alteration is here made in the words (see [Exo
20:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#017)), but it is so slight ("wife"
being put in the first clause and "house" in the second) that it would
not have been worth while noticing it, except that the interchange
proves, contrary to the opinion of some eminent critics, that these two
objects are included in one and the same commandment.

[Deuteronomy 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">deu 5:22</span></span>

he added no more-- ([Exo 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#001)). The
pre-eminence of these ten commandments was shown in God's announcing
them directly: other laws and institutions were communicated to the
people through the instrumentality of Moses.

[Deuteronomy 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">deu 5:23</span></span>

And . . . ye came near unto me--(See on [Exo
20:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#019)).

[Deuteronomy 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">deu 5:29</span></span>

Oh, that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me--God
can bestow such a heart, and has promised to give it, wherever it is
asked ([Jer 32:40](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#040)). But the wish which
is here expressed on the part of God for the piety and steadfast
obedience of the Israelites did not relate to them as individuals, so
much as a nation, whose religious character and progress would have a
mighty influence on the world at large.
