<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#001">Judges 7:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">jdg 7:1</A></FONT></span></p>GIDEON'S ARMY. (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#001">Jdg 7:1-8</A>)
<p>
<p>Jerubbaal--This had now become Gideon's honorable surname, "the enemy of Baal." 
<p>
<p>well--rather "spring of Harod," that is, "fear, trembling"; probably the same as the fountain in Jezreel (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#001">Sa1 29:1</A>). It was situated not far from Gilboa, on the confines of Manasseh, and the name "Harod" was bestowed on it with evident reference to the panic which seized the majority of Gideon's troops. The host of the Midianites were on the northern side of the valley, seemingly deeper down in the descent towards the Jordan, near a little eminence.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#002">Judges 7:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">jdg 7:2</A></FONT></span></p>the Lord said unto Gideon, The people . . . are too many--Although the Israelitish army mustered only thirty-two thousand (or one-sixth of the Midianitish host), the number was too great, for it was the Lord's purpose to teach Israel a memorable lesson of dependence on Him.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#003">Judges 7:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">jdg 7:3</A></FONT></span></p>Now therefore . . ., proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whosoever is fearful . . . let him return--This proclamation was in terms of an established law (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#008">Deu 20:8</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#004">Judges 7:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">jdg 7:4</A></FONT></span></p>too many--Two reductions were ordered, the last by the application of a test which was made known to Gideon alone.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#005">Judges 7:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">jdg 7:5</A></FONT></span></p>bring them down unto the water--When the wandering people in Asia, on a journey or in haste, come to water, they do not stoop down with deliberation on their knees, but only bend forward as much as is necessary to bring their hand in contact with the stream, and throw it up with rapidity, and at the same time such address, that they do not drop a particle. The Israelites, it seems, were acquainted with the practice; and those who adopted it on this occasion were selected as fit for a work that required expedition. The rest were dismissed according to the divine direction.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#007">Judges 7:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">jdg 7:7</A></FONT></span></p>the Lord said, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you--It is scarcely possible to conceive a more severe trial than the command to attack the overwhelming forces of the enemy with such a handful of followers. But Gideon's faith in the divine assurance of victory was steadfast, and it is for this he is so highly commended (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#032">Heb 11:32</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#008">Judges 7:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">jdg 7:8</A></FONT></span></p>the host of Midian was beneath him in the valley--Attention to the relative position of the parties is of the greatest importance to an understanding of what follows.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#009">Judges 7:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">jdg 7:9</A></FONT></span></p>HE IS ENCOURAGED BY THE DREAM AND THE INTERPRETATION OF THE BARLEY CAKE. (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#009">Jdg 7:9-15</A>)
<p>
<p>Arise, get thee down unto the host . . . But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant--In ancient times it was reckoned no degradation for persons of the highest rank and character to act as spies on an enemy's camp; and so Gideon did on this occasion. But the secret errand was directed by God, who intended that he should hear something which might animate his own valor and that of his troops.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#011">Judges 7:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">jdg 7:11</A></FONT></span></p>the outside of the armed men that were in the host--"Armed," means embodied under the five officers established by the ordinary laws and usages of encampments. The camp seems to have been unprotected by any rampart, since Gideon had no difficulty in reaching and overhearing a conversation, so important to him.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#012">Judges 7:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">jdg 7:12</A></FONT></span></p>the Midianites and the Amalekites . . . lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels were without number--a most graphic description of an Arab encampment. They lay wrapt in sleep, or resting from their day's plunder, while their innumerable camels were stretched round about them.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#013">Judges 7:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">jdg 7:13</A></FONT></span></p>I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian--This was a characteristic and very expressive dream for an Arab in the circumstances. The rolling down the hill, striking against the tents, and overturning them, naturally enough connected it in his mind with the position and meditated attack of the Israelitish leader. The circumstance of the cake, too, was very significant. Barley was usually the food of the poor, and of beasts; but most probably, from the widespread destruction of the crops by the invaders, multitudes must have been reduced to poor and scanty fare.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#015">Judges 7:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">jdg 7:15</A></FONT></span></p>when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation . . . he worshipped--The incident originated in the secret overruling providence of God, and Gideon, from his expression of pious gratitude, regarded it as such. On his mind, as well as that of his followers, it produced the intended effect--that of imparting new animation and impulse to their patriotism.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#016">Judges 7:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">jdg 7:16</A></FONT></span></p>HIS STRATAGEM AGAINST MIDIAN. (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#016">Jdg 7:16-24</A>)
<p>
<p>he divided the three hundred men into three companies--The object of dividing his forces was, that they might seem to be surrounding the enemy. The pitchers were empty to conceal the torches, and made of earthenware, so as to be easily broken; and the sudden blaze of the held-up lights--the loud echo of the trumpets, and the shouts of Israel, always terrifying (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#021">Num 23:21</A>), and now more terrible than ever by the use of such striking words, broke through the stillness of the midnight air. The sleepers started from their rest; not a blow was dealt by the Israelites; but the enemy ran tumultuously, uttering the wild, discordant cries peculiar to the Arab race. They fought indiscriminately, not knowing friend from foe. The panic being universal, they soon precipitately fled, directing their flight down to the Jordan, by the foot of the mountains of Ephraim, to places known as the "house of the acacia" [Beth-shittah], and "the meadow of the dance" [Abel-meholah].
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#023">Judges 7:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">jdg 7:23</A></FONT></span></p>the men of Israel gathered themselves together--These were evidently the parties dismissed, who having lingered at a little distance from the scene of contest, now eagerly joined in the pursuit southwestward through the valley.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#024">Judges 7:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">jdg 7:24</A></FONT></span></p>Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim--The Ephraimites lay on the south and could render seasonable aid. 
<p>
<p>Come . . . take before them the waters unto Beth-barah--(See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#028">Jdg 3:28</A>). These were the northern fords of the Jordan, to the east-northeast of wady Maleh. 
<p>
<p>the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together . . . unto Beth-barah--A new conflict ensued, in which two secondary chiefs were seized and slain on the spots where they were respectively taken. The spots were named after these chiefs, Oreb, "the Raven," and Zeeb, "the Wolf"--appropriate designations of Arab leaders.
