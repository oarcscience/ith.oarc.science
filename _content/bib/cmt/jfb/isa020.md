### [Isaiah Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#001)

[Isaiah 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 20:1</span></span>

CONTINUATION OF THE SUBJECT OF THE NINETEENTH CHAPTER, BUT AT A LATER
DATE. CAPTIVITY OF EGYPT AND ETHIOPIA. ([Isa
20:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#001))

Tartan--probably the same general as was sent by Sennacherib against
Hezekiah ([Kg2 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#017)). GESENIUS takes
"Tartan" as a title.

Ashdod--called by the Greeks Azotus ([Act
8:40](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#040)); on the Mediterranean, one of
the "five" cities of the Philistines. The taking of it was a necessary
preliminary to the invasion of Egypt, to which it was the key in that
quarter, the Philistines being allies of Egypt. So strongly did the
Assyrians fortify it that it stood a twenty-nine years' siege, when it
was retaken by the Egyptian Psammetichus.

sent--Sargon himself remained behind engaged with the PhÅ“nician cities,
or else led the main force more directly into Egypt out of Judah \[G. V.
SMITH\].

[Isaiah 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 20:2</span></span>

by--literally, "by the hand of" (compare [Eze
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#014)).

sackcloth--the loose outer garment of coarse dark hair-cloth worn by
mourners ([Sa2 3:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#031)) and by prophets,
fastened at the waist by a girdle ([Mat
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#004); [Kg2
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#008); [Zac
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#004)).

naked--rather, "uncovered"; he merely put off the outer sackcloth,
retaining still the tunic or inner vest ([Sa1
19:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#024); [Amo
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#016); [Joh
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#007)); an emblem to show that Egypt
should be stripped of its possessions; the very dress of Isaiah was a
silent exhortation to repentance.

[Isaiah 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 20:3</span></span>

three years--Isaiah's symbolical action did not continue all this time,
but at intervals, to keep it before the people's mind during that period
\[ROSENMULLER\]. Rather, join "three years" with "sign," a three years'
sign, that is, a sign that a three years' calamity would come on Egypt
and Ethiopia \[BARNES\], ([Isa 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#018)).
This is the only instance of a strictly symbolical act performed by
Isaiah. With later prophets, as Jeremiah and Ezekiel, such acts were
common. In some cases they were performed, not literally, but only in
prophetic vision.

wonder--rather, "omen"; conveying a threat as to the future \[G. V.
SMITH\].

upon--in reference to, against.

[Isaiah 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 20:4</span></span>

buttocks uncovered--BELZONI says that captives are found represented
thus on Egyptian monuments ([Isa
47:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#002); [Nah
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#005), [Nah
3:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#008)), where as here, Egypt and
Ethiopia are mentioned as in alliance.

[Isaiah 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 20:5</span></span>

they--the Philistine allies of Egypt who trusted in it for help against
Assyria. A warning to the party among the Jews, who, though Judah was
then the subordinate ally of Assyria, were looking to Egypt as a
preferable ally ([Isa 30:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#007)). Ethiopia
was their "expectation"; for Palestine had not yet obtained, but hoped
for alliance with it. Egypt was their "glory," that is, boast ([Isa
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#019)); for the alliance with it was
completed.

[Isaiah 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 20:6</span></span>

isle--that is, coast on the Mediterranean--Philistia, perhaps PhÅ“nicia
(compare [Isa 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#002); [Isa
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#011); [Isa
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#022); [Psa
72:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#010)).

we--emphatical; if Egypt, in which we trusted, was overcome, how shall
we, a small weak state, escape?

He does not narrate the event, but graphically supposes himself a
watchman in Babylon, beholding the events as they pass.
