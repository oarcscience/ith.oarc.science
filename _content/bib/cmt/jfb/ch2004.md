### [2 Chronicles Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 4:1</span></span>

ALTAR OF BRASS. ([Ch2 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#001))

he made an altar of brass--Steps must have been necessary for ascending
so elevated an altar, but the use of these could be no longer forbidden
([Exo 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#026)) after the introduction of
an official costume for the priests ([Exo
28:42](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#042)). It measured thirty-five feet
by thirty-five, and in height seventeen and a half feet. The thickness
of the metal used for this altar is nowhere given; but supposing it to
have been three inches, the whole weight of the metal would not be under
two hundred tons \[NAPIER\].

[2 Chronicles 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 4:2</span></span>

MOLTEN SEA. ([Ch2 4:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#002))

he made a molten sea--(See on [Kg1
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#023)), as in that passage "knops"
occur instead of "oxen." It is generally supposed that the rows of
ornamental knops were in the form of ox heads.

[2 Chronicles 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 4:3</span></span>

Two rows of oxen were cast, when it was cast--The meaning is, that the
circular basin and the brazen oxen which supported it were all of one
piece, being cast in one and the same mould. There is a difference in
the accounts given of the capacity of this basin, for while in [Kg1
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#026) it is said that two thousand
baths of water could be contained in it, in this passage no less than
three thousand are stated. It has been suggested that there is here a
statement not merely of the quantity of water which the basin held, but
that also which was necessary to work it, to keep it flowing as a
fountain; that which was required to fill both it and its
accompaniments. In support of this view, it may be remarked that
different words are employed: the one in [Kg1
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#026) rendered contained; the two here
rendered, received and held. There was a difference between receiving
and holding. When the basin played as a fountain, and all its parts were
filled for that purpose, the latter, together with the sea itself,
received three thousand baths; but the sea exclusively held only two
thousand baths, when its contents were restricted to those of the
circular basin. It received and held three thousand baths \[CALMET,
Fragments\].

[2 Chronicles 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 4:6</span></span>

THE TEN LAVERS, CANDLESTICKS, AND TABLES. ([Ch2
4:6-18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#006))

ten lavers--(See on [Kg1 7:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#027)). The
laver of the tabernacle had probably been destroyed. The ten new ones
were placed between the porch and the altar, and while the molten sea
was for the priests to cleanse their hands and feet, these were intended
for washing the sacrifices.

[2 Chronicles 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 4:7</span></span>

ten candlesticks--(See on [Kg1 7:49](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#049)).
The increased number was not only in conformity with the characteristic
splendor of the edifice, but also a standing emblem to the Hebrews, that
the growing light of the word was necessary to counteract the growing
darkness in the world \[LIGHTFOOT\].

[2 Chronicles 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 4:11</span></span>

Huram made--(See on [Kg1 7:40](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#040)).
