### [Ezekiel Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#001)

[Ezekiel 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 15:2</span></span>

THE WORTHLESSNESS OF THE VINE AS WOOD ESPECIALLY WHEN BURNT, IS THE
IMAGE OF THE WORTHLESSNESS AND GUILT OF THE JEWS, WHO SHALL PASS FROM
ONE FIRE TO ANOTHER. ([Eze 15:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#001))

What has the vine-wood to make it pre-eminent above other forest-wood?
Nothing. Nay, the reverse. Other trees yield useful timber, but
vine-wood is soft, brittle, crooked, and seldom large; not so much as a
"pin" (the large wooden peg used inside houses in the East to hang
household articles on, [Isa 22:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#023))
can be made of it. Its sole excellency is that it should bear fruit;
when it does not bear fruit, it is not only not better, but inferior to
other trees: so if God's people lose their distinctive excellency by not
bearing fruits of righteousness, they are more unprofitable than the
worldly ([Deu 32:32](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#032)), for they are the
vine; the sole end of their being is to bear fruit to His glory ([Psa
80:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#008); [Isa
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#001), &c.; [Jer
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#021); [Hos
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#001); [Mat
21:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#033)). In all respects, except in
their being planted by God, the Jews were inferior to other nations, as
Egypt, Babylon, &c., for example, in antiquity, extent of territory,
resources, military power, attainments in arts and sciences.

or than a branch--rather, in apposition with "the vine tree." Omit "or
than." What superiority has the vine if it be but a branch among the
trees of the forest, that is, if, as having no fruit, it lies cut down
among other woods of trees?

[Ezekiel 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 15:4</span></span>

cast into . . . fire-- ([Joh 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#006)).

both the ends--the north kingdom having been already overturned by
Assyria under Tiglath-pileser; the south being pressed on by Egypt ([Kg2
23:29-35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#029)).

midst of it is burned--rather, "is on flame"; namely, Jerusalem, which
had now caught the flame by the attack of Nebuchadnezzar.

Is it meet for any work--"it," that is, the scorched part still
remaining.

[Ezekiel 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 15:5</span></span>

If useless before, much more so when almost wholly burnt.

[Ezekiel 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 15:6</span></span>

So will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem, as being utterly
unprofitable ([Mat 21:33-41](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#033); [Mat
25:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#030); [Mar
11:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#012); [Luk
13:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#006)) in answering God's design that
they should be witnesses for Jehovah before the heathen ([Mat
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#010); [Mat
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#013)).

[Ezekiel 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 15:7</span></span>

And I will set my face against them--(See on [Lev
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#010)).

from one fire . . . another--(Compare [Isa
24:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#018)). "Fire" means here every kind
of calamity ([Psa 66:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#012)). The Jewish
fugitives shall escape from the ruin of Jerusalem, only to fall into
some other calamity.

[Ezekiel 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 15:8</span></span>

trespass--rather, "they have perversely fallen into perverse rebellion."
The Jews were not merely sinners as the other nations, but revolters and
apostates. It is one thing to neglect what we know not, but quite
another thing to despise what we profess to worship \[JEROME\], as the
Jews did towards God and the law.

\(1\) Taken up by God's gratuitous favor from infancy ([Eze
16:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#001)); (2) and, when grown up,
joined to Him in spiritual marriage ([Eze
16:8-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#008)); (3) her unfaithfulness, her
sin (Eze. 16:15-34); (4) the judgment (Eze. 16:35-52); (5) her
unlooked-for restoration ([Eze 16:53](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#053)
to the close).
