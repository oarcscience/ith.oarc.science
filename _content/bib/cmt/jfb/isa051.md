### [Isaiah Chapter 51](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#001)

[Isaiah 51:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 51:1</span></span>

ENCOURAGEMENT TO THE FAITHFUL REMNANT OF ISRAEL TO TRUST IN GOD FOR
DELIVERANCE, BOTH FROM THEIR LONG BABYLONIAN EXILE, AND FROM THEIR
PRESENT DISPERSION. (Isa. 51:1-23)

me--the God of your fathers.

ye . . . follow after righteousness--the godly portion of the nation;
[Isa 51:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#007) shows this ([Pro
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#009); [Ti1
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#011)). "Ye follow righteousness," seek
it therefore from Me, who "bring it near," and that a righteousness "not
about to be abolished" ([Isa 51:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#006));
look to Abraham, your father ([Isa
51:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#002)), as a sample of how
righteousness before Me is to be obtained; I, the same God who blessed
him, will bless you at last ([Isa
51:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#003)); therefore trust in Me, and fear
not man's opposition ([Isa 51:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#007),
[Isa 51:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#012)). The mistake of the
Jews, heretofore, has been, not in that they "followed after
righteousness," but in that they followed it "by the works of the law,"
instead of "by faith," as Abraham did ([Rom
9:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#031); [Rom
10:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#003); [Rom
4:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#002)).

hole of . . . pit--The idea is not, as it is often quoted, the
inculcation of humility, by reminding men of the fallen state from which
they have been taken, but that as Abraham, the quarry, as it were
(compare [Isa 48:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#001)), whence their
nation was hewn, had been called out of a strange land to the
inheritance of Canaan, and blessed by God, the same God is able to
deliver and restore them also (compare [Mat
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#009)).

[Isaiah 51:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 51:2</span></span>

alone--translate, "I called him when he was but one" ([Eze
33:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#024)). The argument is: the same God
who had so blessed "one" individual, as to become a mighty nation ([Gen
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#001); [Gen
22:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#007)), can also increase and bless the
small remnant of Israel, both that left in the Babylonish captivity, and
that left in the present and latter days ([Zac
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#002)); "the residue" ([Isa
13:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#008)).

[Isaiah 51:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 51:3</span></span>

For--See for the argument, see on [Isa
51:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#002).

the garden of the Lord--restoration of the primeval paradise ([Gen
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#008); [Eze
28:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#013); [Rev
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#007)).

melody--Hebrew, "psalm." God's praises shall again be heard.

[Isaiah 51:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 51:4</span></span>

my people--the Jews. This reading is better than that of GESENIUS: "O
peoples . . . nations," namely, the Gentiles. The Jews are called on to
hear and rejoice in the extension of the true religion to the nations;
for, at the first preaching of the Gospel, as in the final age to come,
it was from Jerusalem that the gospel law was, and is, to go forth ([Isa
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#003)).

law . . . judgment--the gospel dispensation and institutions ([Isa
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001), "judgment").

make . . . to rest--establish firmly; found.

light, &c.-- ([Isa 42:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#006)).

[Isaiah 51:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 51:5</span></span>

righteousness . . . near--that is, faithful fulfilment of the promised
deliverance, answering to "salvation" in the parallel clause ([Isa
46:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#013); [Isa
56:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#001); [Rom
10:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#008)). Ye follow after
"righteousness"; seek it therefore, from Me, and you will not have far
to go for it ([Isa 51:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#001)).

arms--put for Himself; I by My might.

judge-- ([Isa 2:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#003); [Psa
98:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#009)).

isles, &c.-- ([Isa 60:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#009)).

arm-- ([Rom 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#016)), "the power of God
unto (the Gentiles as well as the Jews) salvation."

[Isaiah 51:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 51:6</span></span>

([Isa 40:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#006), [Isa
40:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#008); [Psa
102:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#026); [Heb
1:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#011)).

vanish away--literally, "shall be torn asunder," as a garment
\[MAURER\]; which accords with the context.

in like manner--But GESENIUS, "Like a gnat"; like the smallest and
vilest insect. JEROME translates, as English Version, and infers that
"in like manner" as man, the heavens (that is, the sky) and earth are
not to be annihilated, but changed for the better ([Isa
65:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#017)).

righteousness--My faithfully fulfilled promise (see on [Isa
51:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#005)).

[Isaiah 51:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 51:7</span></span>

know righteousness--(See on [Isa
51:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#001)).

[Isaiah 51:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 51:8</span></span>

(See on [Isa 50:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#009); [Job
4:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#018)). Not that the moth eats men
up, but they shall be destroyed by as insignificant instrumentality as
the moth that eats a garment.

[Isaiah 51:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 51:9</span></span>

Impassioned prayer of the exiled Jews.

ancient days-- ([Psa 44:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#001)).

Rahab--poetical name for Egypt (see on [Isa
30:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#007)).

dragon--Hebrew, tannin. The crocodile, an emblem of Egypt, as
represented on coins struck after the conquest of Egypt by Augustus; or
rather here, "its king," Pharaoh (see on [Isa
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#001); [Psa
74:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#013); [Eze
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#002), Margin; [Eze
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#003)).

[Isaiah 51:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 51:10</span></span>

it--the arm.

Art not Thou the same Almighty power that . . . ? dried the sea--the Red
Sea ([Isa 43:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#016); [Exo
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#021)).

[Isaiah 51:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 51:11</span></span>

([Isa 35:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#010)).

Therefore--assurance of faith; or else the answer of Jehovah
corresponding to their prayer. As surely as God redeemed Israel out of
Egypt, He shall redeem them from Babylon, both the literal in the age
following, and mystical in the last ages ([Rev
18:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#020)). There shall be a second
exodus ([Isa 11:11-16](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#011); [Isa
27:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#012)).

singing--image from the custom of singing on a journey when a caravan is
passing along the extended plains in the East.

everlasting joy-- ([Jde 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#024)).

sorrow . . . flee away-- ([Rev 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#004)).

[Isaiah 51:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 51:12</span></span>

comforteth-- ([Isa 51:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#003); [Isa
40:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#001)).

thou--Zion.

son of man--frail and dying as his parent Adam.

be made as grass--wither as grass ([Isa
40:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#006)).

[Isaiah 51:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 51:13</span></span>

([Isa 40:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#012), [Isa
40:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#026), [Isa
40:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#028)), the same argument of comfort
drawn from the omnipotence of the Creator.

as if . . . ready, &c.--literally, "when he directs," namely, his arrow,
to destroy ([Psa 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#012); [Psa
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#013); [Psa
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#002)) \[MAURER\].

[Isaiah 51:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 51:14</span></span>

captive exile--literally, one bowed down as a captive ([Isa
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#004)) \[MAURER\]. The scene is
primarily Babylon, and the time near the close of the captivity.
Secondarily, and antitypically, the mystical Babylon, the last enemy of
Israel and the Church, in which they have long suffered, but from which
they are to be gloriously delivered.

pit--such as were many of the ancient dungeons (compare [Jer
38:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#006), [Jer
38:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#011), [Jer
38:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#013); [Gen
37:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#020)).

nor . . . bread . . . fail-- ([Isa
33:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#016); [Jer
37:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#021)).

[Isaiah 51:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 51:15</span></span>

divided . . . sea--the Red Sea. The same Hebrew word as "make to rest"
([Isa 51:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#004)). Rather, "that terrify the
sea," that is, restrain it by My rebuke, "when its waves roar"
\[GESENIUS\]. The Hebrew favors MAURER, "that terrify the sea so that
the waves roar." The sense favors GESENIUS ([Jer
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#022); [Jer
31:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#035)), or English Version ([Isa
51:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#009), which favors the special
reference to the exodus from Egypt).

[Isaiah 51:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 51:16</span></span>

Addressed to Israel, embodied in "the servant of Jehovah" ([Isa
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001)), Messiah, its ideal and
representative Head, through whom the elect remnant is to be restored.

put my words in thy mouth--true of Israel, the depository of true
religion, but fully realized only in Israel's Head and antitype, Messiah
([Isa 49:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#002); [Isa
50:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#004); [Isa
59:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#021); [Deu
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#018); [Joh
3:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#034)).

covered . . . in . . . shadow of . . . hand--protected thee (see on [Isa
49:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#002)).

plant--rather, "fix" as a tabernacle; so it ought to be rendered ([Dan
11:45](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#045)). The "new creation," now going
on in the spiritual world by the Gospel ([Eph
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#010)), and hereafter to be extended to
the visible world, is meant ([Isa
65:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#017); [Isa
66:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#022); compare [Isa
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#013); [Pe2
3:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#010)).

Zion--Its restoration is a leading part in the new creation to come
([Isa 65:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#017), [Isa
65:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#019)).

[Isaiah 51:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 51:17</span></span>

Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, &c.-- ([Isa
52:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#001)).

drunk--Jehovah's wrath is compared to an intoxicating draught because it
confounds the sufferer under it, and makes him fall ([Job
21:20](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#020); [Psa
60:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#003); [Psa
75:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#008); [Jer
25:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#015); [Jer
49:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#012); [Zac
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#002); [Rev
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#010)); ("poured out without mixture";
rather, "the pure wine juice mixed with intoxicating drugs").

of trembling--which produced trembling or intoxication.

wrung . . . out--drained the last drop out; the dregs were the sediments
from various substances, as honey, dates, and drugs, put into the wine
to increase the strength and sweetness.

[Isaiah 51:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 51:18</span></span>

Following up the image in [Isa 51:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#017),
intoxicated and confused by the cup of God's anger, she has none to
guide her in her helpless state; she has not yet awakened out of the
sleep caused by that draught. This cannot apply to the Babylonish
captivity; for in it they had Ezekiel and Daniel, Ezra and Nehemiah, as
"guides," and soon awoke out of that sleep; but it applies to the Jews
now, and will be still more applicable in their coming oppression by
Antichrist.

[Isaiah 51:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 51:19</span></span>

two--classes of evils, for he enumerates four, namely, desolation and
destruction to the land and state; famine and the sword to the people.

who shall be sorry for thee--so as to give thee effectual relief: as the
parallel clause, "By whom shall I comfort thee?" shows ([Lam
2:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#011)).

[Isaiah 51:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 51:20</span></span>

head of all . . . streets-- ([Lam
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#019); [Lam
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#001)).

wild bull--rather, "oryx" \[JEROME\], or gazelle \[GESENIUS\], or wild
goat \[BOCHART\]; commonly in the East taken in a net, of a wide sweep,
into which the beasts were hunted together. The streets of cities in the
East often have gates, which are closed at night; a person wishing to
escape would be stopped by them and caught, as a wild animal in a net.

[Isaiah 51:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 51:21</span></span>

drunken . . . not with wine-- ([Isa
29:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#009); compare [Isa
51:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#017), [Isa
51:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#020), here; [Lam
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#015)).

[Isaiah 51:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 51:22</span></span>

pleadeth . . . cause-- ([Psa 35:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#001);
[Jer 50:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#034); [Mic
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#009)).

no more drink it-- ([Isa 54:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#007)). This
cannot apply to Israel after the return from Babylon, but only to them
after their final restoration.

[Isaiah 51:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">isa 51:23</span></span>

([Isa 49:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#026); [Jer
25:15-29](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#015); [Zac
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#002)).

Bow down that . . . go over--Conquerors often literally trod on the
necks of conquered kings, as Sapor of Persia did to the Roman emperor
Valerian ([Jos 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#024); [Psa
18:40](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#040); [Psa
66:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#011)).

Zion long in bondage ([Isa 51:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#017))
is called to put on beautiful garments appropriate to its future
prosperity.
