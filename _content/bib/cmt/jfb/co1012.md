### [1 Corinthians Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#001)

[1 Corinthians 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co1 12:1</span></span>

THE USE AND THE ABUSE OF SPIRITUAL GIFTS, ESPECIALLY PROPHESYING AND
TONGUES. (1Co. 12:1-31)

spiritual gifts--the signs of the Spirit's continued efficacious
presence in the Church, which is Christ's body, the complement of His
incarnation, as the body is the complement of the head. By the love
which pervades the whole, the gifts of the several members, forming
reciprocal complements to each other, tend to the one object of
perfecting the body of Christ. The ordinary and permanent gifts are
comprehended together with the extraordinary, without distinction
specified, as both alike flow from the divine indwelling Spirit of life.
The extraordinary gifts, so far from making professors more peculiarly
saints than in our day, did not always even prove that such persons were
in a safe state at all ([Mat 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#022)).
They were needed at first in the Church: (1) as a pledge to Christians
themselves who had just passed over from Judaism or heathendom, that God
was in the Church; (2) for the propagation of Christianity in the world;
(3) for the edification of the Church. Now that we have the whole
written New Testament (which they had not) and Christianity established
as the result of the miracles, we need no further miracle to attest the
truth. So the pillar of cloud which guided the Israelites was withdrawn
when they were sufficiently assured of the Divine Presence, the
manifestation of God's glory being thenceforward enclosed in the Most
Holy Place \[ARCHBISHOP WHATELY\]. Paul sets forth in order: (1). The
unity of the body (1Co. 12:1-27). (2). The variety of its members and
functions ([Co1 12:27-30](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#027)). (3). The
grand principle for the right exercise of the gifts, namely, love ([Co1
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#031); [Co1
13:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#001)). (4) The comparison of the
gifts with one another (1Co. 14:1-40).

I would not have you ignorant--with all your boasts of "knowledge" at
Corinth. If ignorant now, it will be your own fault, not mine ([Co1
14:38](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#038)).

[1 Corinthians 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co1 12:2</span></span>

([Eph 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#011)).

that ye were--The best manuscripts read, "That WHEN ye were"; thus "ye
were" must be supplied before "carried away"--Ye were blindly
transported hither and thither at the will of your false guides.

these dumb idols--Greek, "the idols which are dumb"; contrasted with the
living God who "speaks" in the believer by His Spirit ([Co1
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#003), &c.). This gives the reason why
the Corinthians needed instruction as to spiritual gifts, namely, their
past heathen state, wherein they had no experience of intelligent
spiritual powers. When blind, ye went to the dumb.

as ye were led--The Greek is, rather, "as ye might (happen to) be led,"
namely, on different occasions. The heathen oracles led their votaries
at random, without any definite principle.

[1 Corinthians 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co1 12:3</span></span>

The negative and positive criteria of inspiration by the Spirit--the
rejection or confession of Jesus as Lord \[ALFORD\] ([Jo1
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#002); [Jo1
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#001)). Paul gives a test of truth
against the Gentiles; John, against the false prophets.

by the Spirit--rather, as Greek, "IN the Spirit"; that being the power
pervading him, and the element in which he speaks \[ALFORD\], ([Mat
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#017); [Joh
15:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#026)).

of God . . . Holy--The same Spirit is called at one time "the Spirit of
GOD"; at another, "the HOLY Ghost," or "Holy Spirit." Infinite Holiness
is almost synonymous with Godhead.

speaking . . . say--"Speak" implies the act of utterance; "say" refers
to that which is uttered. Here, "say" means a spiritual and believing
confession of Him.

Jesus--not an abstract doctrine, but the historical, living God-man
([Rom 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#009)).

accursed--as the Jews and Gentiles treated Him ([Gal
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#013)). Compare "to curse Christ" in
the heathen PLINY'S letter \[Epistles, 10.97\]. The spiritual man feels
Him to be the Source of all blessings ([Eph
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#003)) and to be severed from Him is to
be accursed ([Rom 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#003)).

Lord--acknowledging himself as His servant ([Isa
26:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#013)). "Lord" is the Septuagint
translation for the incommunicable Hebrew name JEHOVAH.

[1 Corinthians 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co1 12:4</span></span>

diversities of gifts--that is, varieties of spiritual endowments
peculiar to the several members of the Church: compare "dividing to
every man severally" ([Co1 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#011)).

same Spirit--The Holy Trinity appears here: the Holy Spirit in this
verse; Christ in [Co1 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#005); and the
Father in [Co1 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#006). The terms
"gifts," "administrations," and "operations," respectively correspond to
the Divine Three. The Spirit is treated of in [Co1
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#007), &c.; the Lord, in [Co1
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#012), &c.; God, in [Co1
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#028). (Compare [Eph
4:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#004)).

[1 Corinthians 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co1 12:5</span></span>

"Gifts" ([Co1 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#004)), "administrations"
(the various functions and services performed by those having the gifts,
compare [Co1 12:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#028)), and "operations"
(the actual effects resulting from both the former, through the
universally operative power of the one Father who is "above all, through
all, and in us all"), form an ascending climax \[HENDERSON,
Inspiration\].

same Lord--whom the Spirit glorifies by these ministrations \[BENGEL\].

[1 Corinthians 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co1 12:6</span></span>

operations--(Compare [Co1 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#010)).

same God . . . worketh--by His Spirit working ([Co1
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#011)).

all in all--all of them (the "gifts") in all the persons (who possess
them).

[1 Corinthians 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co1 12:7</span></span>

But--Though all the gifts flow from the one God, Lord, and Spirit, the
"manifestation" by which the Spirit acts (as He is hidden in Himself),
varies in each individual.

to every man--to each of the members of the Church severally.

to profit withal--with a view to the profit of the whole body.

[1 Corinthians 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co1 12:8</span></span>

Three classes of gifts are distinguished by a distinct Greek word for
"another" (a distinct class), marking the three several genera: allo
marks the species, hetero the genera (compare Greek, [Co1
15:39-41](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#039)). I. Gifts of intellect,
namely, (1) wisdom; (2) knowledge. II. Gifts dependent on a special
faith, namely, that of miracles ([Mat
17:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#020)): (1) healings; (2) workings of
miracles; (3) prophecy of future events; (4) discerning of spirits, or
the divinely given faculty of distinguishing between those really
inspired, and those who pretended to inspiration. III. Gifts referring
to the tongues: (1) diverse kinds of tongues; (2) interpretation of
tongues. The catalogue in [Co1 12:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#028)
is not meant strictly to harmonize with the one here, though there are
some particulars in which they correspond. The three genera are
summarily referred to by single instances of each in [Co1
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#008). The first genus refers more to
believers; the second, to unbelievers.

by . . . by . . . by--The first in Greek is, "By means of," or "through
the operation of"; the second is, "according to" the disposing of
(compare [Co1 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#011)); the third is,
"in," that is, under the influence of (so the Greek, [Mat
22:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#043); [Luk
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#027)).

word of wisdom--the ready utterance of (for imparting to others, [Eph
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#019)) wisdom, namely, new revelations
of the divine wisdom in redemption, as contrasted with human philosophy
([Co1 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#024); [Co1
2:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#006); [Eph
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#008); [Eph
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#010); [Col
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#003)).

word of knowledge--ready utterance supernaturally imparted of truths
ALREADY REVEALED (in this it is distinguished from "the word of wisdom,"
which related to NEW revelations). Compare [Co1
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#006), where "revelation" (answering to
"wisdom" here) is distinguished from "knowledge" \[HENDERSON\]. Wisdom
or revelation belonged to the "prophets"; knowledge, to the "teachers."
Wisdom penetrates deeper than knowledge. Knowledge relates to things
that are to be done. Wisdom, to things eternal: hence, wisdom is not,
like knowledge, said to "pass away" ([Co1
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#008)), \[BENGEL\].

[1 Corinthians 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co1 12:9</span></span>

faith--not of doctrines, but of miracles: confidence in God, by the
impulse of His Spirit, that He would enable them to perform any required
miracle (compare [Co1 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#002); [Mar
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#023); [Jam
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#015)). Its nature, or principle, is
the same as that of saving faith, namely, reliance on God; the producing
cause, also, in the same,' namely, a power altogether supernatural ([Eph
1:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#019)). But the objects of faith
differ respectively. Hence, we see, saving faith does not save by its
instrinsic merit, but by the merits of Him who is the object of it.

healing--Greek plural, "healings"; referring to different kinds of
disease which need different kinds of healing ([Mat
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#001)).

[1 Corinthians 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co1 12:10</span></span>

working of miracles--As "healings" are miracles, those here meant must
refer to miracles of special and extraordinary POWER (so the Greek for
"miracles" means); for example, healings might be effected by human
skill in course of time; but the raising of the dead, the infliction of
death by a word, the innocuous use of poisons, &c., are miracles of
special power. Compare [Mar 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#005); [Act
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#011).

prophecy--Here, probably, not in the wider sense of public teaching by
the Spirit ([Co1 11:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#004); [Co1
14:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#001), 1Co. 14:22-39); but, as its
position between "miracles" and a "discerning of spirits" implies, the
inspired disclosure of the future ([Act
11:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#027); [Act
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#011); [Ti1
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#018)), \[HENDERSON\]. It depends on
"faith" ([Co1 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#009); [Rom
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#006)). The prophets ranked next to the
apostles ([Co1 12:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#028); [Eph
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#005); [Eph
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#011)). As prophecy is part of the
whole scheme of redemption, an inspired insight into the obscurer parts
of the existing Scriptures, was the necessary preparation for the
miraculous foresight of the future.

discerning of spirits--discerning between the operation of God's Spirit,
and the evil spirit, or unaided human spirit ([Co1
14:29](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#029); compare [Ti1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#001); [Jo1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#001)).

kinds of tongues--the power of speaking various languages: also a
spiritual language unknown to man, uttered in ecstasy ([Co1
14:2-12](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#002)). This is marked as a distinct
genus in the Greek, "To another and a different class."

interpretation of tongues-- ([Co1
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#013), [Co1
14:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#026)).

[1 Corinthians 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co1 12:11</span></span>

as he will-- ([Co1 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#018); [Heb
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#004)).

[1 Corinthians 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co1 12:12</span></span>

Unity, not unvarying uniformity, is the law of God in the world of
grace, as in that of nature. As the many members of the body compose an
organic whole and none can be dispensed with as needless, so those
variously gifted by the Spirit, compose a spiritual organic whole, the
body of Christ, into which all are baptized by the one Spirit.

of that one body--Most of the oldest manuscripts omit "one."

so also is Christ--that is, the whole Christ, the head and body. So [Psa
18:50](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#050), "His anointed (Messiah or
Christ), David (the antitypical David) and His seed."

[1 Corinthians 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co1 12:13</span></span>

by . . . Spirit . . . baptized--literally, "in"; in virtue of; through.
The designed effect of baptism, which is realized when not frustrated by
the unfaithfulness of man.

Gentiles--literally, "Greeks."

all made to drink into one Spirit--The oldest manuscripts read, "Made to
drink of one Spirit," omitting "into" ([Joh
7:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#037)). There is an indirect allusion
to the Lord's Supper, as there is a direct allusion to baptism in the
beginning of the verse. So the "Spirit, the water, and the blood" ([Jo1
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#008)), similarly combine the two
outward signs with the inward things signified, the Spirit's grace.

are . . . have been--rather as Greek, "were . . . were" (the past
tense).

[1 Corinthians 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co1 12:14</span></span>

Translate, "For the body also." The analogy of the body, not consisting
exclusively of one, but of many members, illustrates the mutual
dependence of the various members in the one body, the Church. The
well-known fable of the belly and the other members, spoken by Menenius
Agrippa, to the seceding commons \[LIVY, 2.32\], was probably before
Paul's mind, stored as it was with classical literature.

[1 Corinthians 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co1 12:15</span></span>

The humbler members ought not to disparage themselves, or to be
disparaged by others more noble ([Co1
12:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#021)).

foot . . . hand--The humble speaks of the more honorable member which
most nearly resembles itself: so the "ear" of the "eye" (the nobler and
more commanding member, [Num 10:31](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#031)),
([Co1 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#016)). As in life each compares
himself with those whom he approaches nearest in gifts, not those far
superior. The foot and hand represent men of active life; the ear and
eye, those of contemplative life.

[1 Corinthians 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">co1 12:17</span></span>

Superior as the eye is, it would not do if it were the sole member to
the exclusion of the rest.

every one--each severally.

where were the body--which, by its very idea, "hath many members" ([Co1
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#012), [Co1
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#014)), \[ALFORD\].

[1 Corinthians 12:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">co1 12:20</span></span>

now--as the case really is: in contrast to the supposition ([Co1
12:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#019); compare [Co1
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#018)).

many members--mutually dependent.

[1 Corinthians 12:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">co1 12:21</span></span>

The higher cannot dispense with the lower members.

[1 Corinthians 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">co1 12:22</span></span>

more feeble--more susceptible of injury: for example, the brain, the
belly, the eye. Their very feebleness, so far from doing away with the
need for them, calls forth our greater care for their preservation, as
being felt "necessary."

[1 Corinthians 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">co1 12:23</span></span>

less honourable--"We think" the feet and the belly "less honorable,"
though not really so in the nature of things.

bestow . . . honour--putting shoes on (Margin) the feet, and clothes to
cover the belly.

uncomely parts--the secret parts: the poorest, though unclad in the rest
of the body, cover these.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">co1 12:24</span></span>

tempered . . . together--on the principle of mutual compensation.

to that part which lacked--to the deficient part \[ALFORD\], ([Co1

no schism--(compare [Co1 12:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#021)) --no
disunion; referring to the "divisions" noticed ([Co1

[1 Corinthians 12:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#026)

And--Accordingly.

all . . . suffer with it--"When a thorn enters the heel, the whole body
feels it, and is concerned: the back bends, the belly and thighs
contract themselves, the hands come forward and draw out the thorn, the
head stoops, and the eyes regard the affected member with intense gaze"
\[CHRYSOSTOM\].

rejoice with it--"When the head is crowned, the whole man feels honored,
the mouth expresses, and the eyes look, gladness" \[CHRYSOSTOM\].

[1 Corinthians 12:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">co1 12:27</span></span>

members in particular--that is, severally members of it. Each church is
in miniature what the whole aggregate of churches is collectively, "the
body of Christ" (compare [Co1 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#016)):
and its individual components are members, every one in his assigned
place.

[1 Corinthians 12:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">co1 12:28</span></span>

set . . . in the church--as He has "set the members . . . in the body"
([Co1 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#018)).

first apostles--above even the prophets. Not merely the Twelve, but
others are so called, for example, Barnabas, &c. ([Rom
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#007)).

teachers--who taught, for the most part, truths already revealed;
whereas the prophets made new revelations and spoke all their
prophesyings under the Spirit's influence. As the teachers had the "word
of knowledge," so the prophets "the word of wisdom" ([Co1
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#008)). Under "teachers" are included
"evangelists and pastors."

miracles--literally, "powers" ([Co1
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#010)): ranked below "teachers," as
the function of teaching is more edifying, though less dazzling than
working miracles.

helps, governments--lower and higher departments of "ministrations"
([Co1 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#005)); as instances of the
former, deacons whose office it was to help in the relief of the poor,
and in baptizing and preaching, subordinate to higher ministers ([Act
6:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#001); [Act
8:5-17](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#005)); also, others who helped with
their time and means, in the Lord's cause (compare [Co1
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#013); [Num
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#017)). The Americans similarly use
"helps" for "helpers." And, as instances of the latter, presbyters, or
bishops, whose office it was to govern the Church ([Ti1
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#017); [Heb
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#017), [Heb
13:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#024)). These officers, though now
ordinary and permanent, were originally specially endowed with the
Spirit for their office, whence they are here classified with other
functions of an inspired character. Government (literally, "guiding the
helm" of affairs), as being occupied with external things,
notwithstanding the outward status it gives, is ranked by the Spirit
with the lower functions. Compare "He that giveth" (answering to
"helps")--"he that ruleth" (answering to "governments") ([Rom
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#008)). Translate, literally,
"Helpings, governings" \[ALFORD\].

diversities of tongues-- ([Co1 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#010)).
"Divers kinds of tongues."

covet earnestly--Greek, "emulously desire." Not in the spirit of
discontented "coveting." The Spirit "divides to every man severally as
He will" ([Co1 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#001)); but this does
not prevent men earnestly seeking, by prayer and watchfulness, and
cultivation of their faculties, the greatest gifts. BEZA explains, "Hold
in the highest estimation"; which accords with the distinction in his
view ([Co1 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#001)) between "follow after
charity--zealously esteem spiritual gifts"; also with ([Co1
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#011), [Co1
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#018)) the sovereign will with which
the Spirit distributes the gifts, precluding individuals from desiring
gifts not vouchsafed to them. But see on [Co1
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#001).

the best gifts--Most of the oldest manuscripts read, "the greatest
gifts."

and yet--Greek, "and moreover." Besides recommending your zealous desire
for the greatest gifts, I am about to show you a something still more
excellent (literally, "a way most way-like") to desire, "the way of
love" (compare [Co1 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#001)). This love,
or "charity," includes both "faith" and "hope" ([Co1
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#007)), and bears the same fruits ([Co1
13:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#001)) as the ordinary and permanent
fruits of the Spirit ([Gal 5:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#022)).
Thus "long-suffering," compare [Co1
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#004); "faith," [Co1
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#007); "joy," [Co1
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#006); "meekness," [Co1
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#005); "goodness," [Co1
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#005); "gentleness," [Co1
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#004) (the Greek is the same for "is
kind"). It is the work of the Holy Spirit, and consists in love to God,
on account of God's love in Christ to us, and as a consequence, love to
man, especially to the brethren in Christ ([Rom
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#005); [Rom
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#030)). This is more to be desired
than gifts ([Luk 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#020)).
