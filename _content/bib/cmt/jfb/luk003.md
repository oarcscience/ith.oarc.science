### [Luke Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#001)

[Luke 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 3:1</span></span>

PREACHING, BAPTISM, AND IMPRISONMENT OF JOHN. (Luke 3:1-20)

Here the curtain of the New Testament is, as it were, drawn up, and the
greatest of all epochs of the Church commences. Even our Lord's own age
([Luk 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#023)) is determined by it
\[BENGEL\]. No such elaborate chronological precision is to be found
elsewhere in the New Testament, and it comes fitly from him who claims
it as the peculiar recommendation of his Gospel, that he had "accurately
traced down all things from the first" ([Luk
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#003)). Here, evidently, commences his
proper narrative. Also see on [Mat
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#001).

the fifteenth year of Tiberius--reckoning from the period when he was
admitted, three years before Augustus' death, to a share of the empire
\[WEBSTER and WILKINSON\], about the end of the year of Rome 779, or
about four years before the usual reckoning.

Pilate . . . governor of Judea--His proper title was Procurator, but
with more than the usual powers of that office. After holding it about
ten years he was ordered to Rome, to answer to charges brought against
him, but ere he arrived Tiberius died (A.D. 35), and soon after Pilate
committed suicide.

Herod--(See on [Mar 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#014)).

Philip--a different and very superior Philip to the one whose wife
Herodias went to live with Herod Antipas. (See [Mar
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#017)).

Iturea--to the northeast of Palestine; so called from Ishmael's son Itur
or Jetur ([Ch1 1:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#031)), and anciently
belonging to the half tribe of Manasseh.

Trachonitis--farther to the northeast, between Iturea and Damascus; a
rocky district, infested by robbers, and committed by Augustus to Herod
the Great to keep in order.

Abilene--still more to the northeast, so called from Abila, eighteen
miles from Damascus \[ROBINSON\].

[Luke 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">luk 3:2</span></span>

Annas and Caiaphas . . . high priests--the former, though deposed,
retained much of his influence, and, probably, as sagan or deputy,
exercised much of the power of the high priesthood along with Caiaphas
([Joh 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#013); [Act
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#006)). Both Zadok and Abiathar acted as
high priests in David's time ([Sa2
15:35](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#035)), and it seems to have become
the fixed practice to have two ([Kg2
25:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#018)). (Also see on [Mat
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#001).)

word of God came unto John--Such formulas, of course, are never used
when speaking of Jesus, because the divine nature manifested itself in
Him not at certain isolated moments of His life. He was the one
everlasting manifestation of the Godhead--THE WORD \[OLSHAUSEN\].

[Luke 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">luk 3:5</span></span>

Every valley, &c.--levelling and smoothing, obvious figures, the sense
of which is in the first words of the proclamation, "Prepare ye the way
of the Lord."

[Luke 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">luk 3:6</span></span>

all flesh, &c.--(quoted literally from the Septuagint of [Isa
40:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#005)). The idea is that every
obstruction shall be so removed as to reveal to the whole world the
Salvation of God in Him whose name is the "Saviour" (compare [Psa
98:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#003); [Isa
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#010); [Isa
49:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#006); [Isa
52:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#010); [Luk
2:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#031); [Act
13:47](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#047)).

[Luke 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">luk 3:10</span></span>

What shall we do then?--to show the sincerity of our repentance. (Also
see on [Mat 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#010).)

Exact no more, &c.--directed against that extortion which made the
publicans a byword. (See on [Luk 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#002);
[Luk 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#008)). (Also see on [Mat
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#010).)

soldiers . . . Do violence to none--The word signifies to "shake
thoroughly," and so to "intimidate," probably in order to extort money
or other property. (Also see on [Mat
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#010).)

accuse . . . falsely--acting as informers vexatiously, on frivolous or
false grounds.

content with your wages--"rations." We may take this as a warning
against mutiny, which the officers attempted to suppress by largesses
and donations \[WEBSTER and WILKINSON\]. And thus the "fruits" which
would evidence their repentance were just resistance to the reigning
sins, particularly of the class to which the penitent belonged, and the
manifestation of an opposite spirit.

[Luke 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#015)

whether he were the Christ--showing both how successful he had been in
awakening the expectation of Messiah's immediate appearing, and the high
estimation, and even reverence, which his own character commanded. (Also
see on [Mat 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#010).)

[Luke 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">luk 3:16</span></span>

John answered--either to the deputation from Jerusalem (see [Joh
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#019), &c.), or on some other occasion,
simply to remove impressions derogatory to his blessed Master which he
knew to be taking hold of the popular mind. (Also see on [Mat
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#010).)

saying unto them all--in solemn protestation. So far from entertaining
such a thought as laying claim to the honors of Messiahship, the meanest
services I can render to that "Mightier than I that is coming after me,"
are too high an honor for me. Beautiful spirit, distinguishing this
servant of Christ throughout!

one mightier than I--"the Mighter than I."

many other things, &c.--such as we read in [Joh
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#029), [Joh
1:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#033); [Joh
3:27-36](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#027). (Also see on [Mat
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#012).)

[Luke 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">luk 3:19</span></span>

But Herod, &c.--See on [Mar 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#014), &c.
(Also see on [Mat 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#012).)

and for all the evils which Herod had done--important fact here only
mentioned, showing how thoroughgoing was the fidelity of the Baptist to
his royal hearer, and how strong must have been the workings of
conscience in that slave of passion when, notwithstanding such
plainness, he "did many things and heard John gladly" ([Mar
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#020), [Mar
6:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#026)).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">luk 3:21</span></span>

BAPTISM OF AND DESCENT OF THE SPIRIT UPON JESUS. ([Luk
3:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#021))

when all the people were baptized--that He might not seem to be merely
one of the crowd. Thus, as He rode into Jerusalem upon an ass, "whereon
yet never man sat" ([Luk 19:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#030)), and
lay in a sepulchre "wherein was never man yet laid" ([Joh
19:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#041)), so in His baptism He would be
"separate from sinners."

[Luke 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">luk 3:23</span></span>

GENEALOGY OF JESUS. (Luke 3:23-38)

he began to be about thirty--that is, "was about entering on His
thirtieth year." So our translators have taken the word (and so CALVIN,
BEZA, BLOOMFIELD, WEBSTER and WILKINSON, &c.): but "was about thirty
years of age when He began \[His ministry\]," makes better Greek, and is
probably the true sense \[BENGEL, OLSHAUSEN, DE WETTE, MEYER, ALFORD,
&c.\]. At this age the priests entered on their office ([Num
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#003)).

being, as was supposed, the son of Joseph, &c.--Have we in this
genealogy, as well as in Matthew's, the line of Joseph? or is this the
line of Mary?--a point on which there has been great difference of
opinion and much acute discussion. Those who take the former opinion
contend that it is the natural sense of this verse, and that no other
would have been thought of but for its supposed improbability and the
uncertainty which it seems to throw over our Lord's real descent. But it
is liable to another difficulty; namely, that in this case Matthew makes
Jacob, while Luke makes "Heli," to be Joseph's father; and though the
same man had often more than one name, we ought not to resort to that
supposition, in such a case as this, without necessity. And then, though
the descent of Mary from David would be liable to no real doubt, even
though we had no table of her line preserved to us (see, for example,
Luke 1:2-32, and see on [Luk 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#005)),
still it does seem unlikely--we say not incredible--that two genealogies
of our Lord should be preserved to us, neither of which gives his real
descent. Those who take the latter opinion, that we have here the line
of Mary, as in Matthew that of Joseph--here His real, there His reputed
line--explain the statement about Joseph, that he was "the son of Hell,"
to mean that he was his son-in-law, as the husband of his daughter Mary
(as in [Rut 1:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#011)), and believe that
Joseph's name is only introduced instead of Mary's, in conformity with
the Jewish custom in such tables. Perhaps this view is attended with
fewest difficulties, as it certainly is the best supported. However we
decide, it is a satisfaction to know that not a doubt was thrown out by
the bitterest of the early enemies of Christianity as to our Lord's real
descent from David. On comparing the two genealogies, it will be found
that Matthew, writing more immediately for Jews, deemed it enough to
show that the Saviour was sprung from Abraham and David; whereas Luke,
writing more immediately for Gentiles, traces the descent back to Adam,
the parent stock of the whole human family, thus showing Him to be the
promised "Seed of the woman." "The possibility of constructing such a
table, comprising a period of thousands of years, in an uninterrupted
line from father to son, of a family that dwelt for a long time in the
utmost retirement, would be inexplicable, had not the members of this
line been endowed with a thread by which they could extricate themselves
from the many families into which every tribe and branch was again
subdivided, and thus hold fast and know the member that was destined to
continue the lineage. This thread was the hope that Messiah would be
born of the race of Abraham and David. The ardent desire to behold Him
and be partakers of His mercy and glory suffered not the attention to be
exhausted through a period embracing thousands of years. Thus the member
destined to continue the lineage, whenever doubtful, became easily
distinguishable, awakening the hope of a final fulfilment, and keeping
it alive until it was consummated" \[OLSHAUSEN\].

[Luke 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#024)

son of Matthat, &c.--(See on [Mat
1:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#013)). In [Luk
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#027), Salathiel is called the son,
while in [Mat 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#012), he is called the
father of Zerubbabel. But they are probably different persons.
