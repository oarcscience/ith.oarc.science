<p>
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#001">Jer 23:1</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#017">Zac 11:17</A> similarly make the removal of the false shepherds the preliminary to the interposition of Messiah the Good Shepherd in behalf of His people Israel. The "shepherds" are not prophets or priests, but rulers who sought in their government their own selfish ends, not the good of the people ruled. The term was appropriate, as David, the first king and the type of the true David (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#023">Eze 34:23-24</A>), was taken from being a shepherd (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#002">Sa2 5:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#070">Psa 78:70-71</A>); and the office, like that of a shepherd for his flock, is to guard and provide for his people. The choice of a shepherd for the first king was therefore designed to suggest this thought, just as Jesus' selection of fishermen for apostles was designed to remind them of their spiritual office of catching men (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#028">Isa 44:28</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#008">Jer 2:8</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#015">Jer 3:15</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#021">Jer 10:21</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#001">Jer 23:1-2</A>).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">eze 34:3</A></FONT></span></p>fat--or, by differently pointing the Hebrew, "milk" [Septuagint]. Thus the repetition "fat" and "fed" is avoided: also the eating of "fat" would not probably be put before the "killing" of the sheep. The eating of sheep's or goats' milk as food (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#014">Deu 32:14</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#027">Pro 27:27</A>) was unobjectionable, had not these shepherds milked them too often, and that without duly "feeding" them [BOCHART], (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#011">Isa 56:11</A>). The rulers levied exorbitant tributes. 
<p>
<p>kill . . . fed--kill the rich by false accusation so as to get possession of their property. 
<p>
<p>feed not . . . flock--take no care of the people (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#012">Joh 10:12</A>).

<p>broken--that is, fractures from wounds inflicted by the wolf. 
<p>
<p>brought again . . . driven away-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#004">Exo 23:4</A>). Those "driven away" by the enemy into foreign lands through God's judgments are meant (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#003">Jer 23:3</A>). A spiritual reformation of the state by the rulers would have turned away God's wrath, and "brought again" the exiles. The rulers are censured as chiefly guilty (though the people, too, were guilty), because they, who ought to have been foremost in checking the evil, promoted it. 
<p>
<p>neither . . . sought . . . lost--Contrast the Good Shepherd's love (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#004">Luk 15:4</A>). 
<p>

Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#031">Mat 26:31</A>, where the sheep were scattered when the true Shepherd was smitten. God calls them "My sheep"; for they were not, as the shepherds treated them, their patrimony whereby to "feed themselves." 
<p>

<p>
<p>search . . . seek--rather, "seek . . . search." The former is the part of the superior rulers to inquire after: to search out is the duty of the subordinate rulers [JUNIUS].

The reason for the difference is: there Ezekiel spoke of the central seat of the kingdom, Mount Zion, where the people met for the worship of Jehovah; here he speaks of the kingdom of Israel at large, all the parts of which are regarded as possessing a moral elevation.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#016">Ezekiel 34:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">eze 34:16</A></FONT></span></p>In contrast to the unfaithful shepherds (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#004">Eze 34:4</A>). The several duties neglected by them I will faithfully discharge. 
<p>

Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#020">Eze 34:20</A>, "the fat cattle" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#016">Isa 10:16</A>). The image is from fat cattle that wax refractory. 
<p>
<p>with judgment--that is, justice and equity, as contrasted with the "force" and "cruelty" with which the unfaithful shepherds ruled the flock (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#004">Eze 34:4</A>).
<p>

<p>
<p>cattle and cattle--rather, "sheep and sheep"; Margin, "small cattle," or "flocks of lambs and kids," that is, I judge between one class of citizens and another, so as to award what is right to each. He then defines the class about to be punitively "judged," namely, "the rams and he-goats," or "great he-goats" (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#009">Isa 14:9</A>, Margin; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#003">Zac 10:3</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#032">Mat 25:32-33</A>). They answer to "the fat and strong," as opposed to the "sick" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#016">Eze 34:16</A>). The rich and ungodly of the people are meant, who imitated the bad rulers in oppressing their poorer brethren, as if it enhanced their own joys to trample on others' rights (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#018">Eze 34:18</A>).

<p>
<p>deep waters--that is, "limpid," as deep waters are generally clear. GROTIUS explains the image as referring to the usuries with which the rich ground the poor (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#012">Eze 22:12</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#002">Isa 24:2</A>).

<p>
<p>one shepherd--literally, "a Shepherd, one": singularly and pre-eminently one: the only one of His kind, to whom none is comparable (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#010">Sol 5:10</A>). The Lord Jesus refers to this prophecy (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#014">Joh 10:14</A>), "I am THE Good Shepherd." Also "one" as uniting in one the heretofore divided kingdoms of Israel and Judah, and also "gathering together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and on earth" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#010">Eph 1:10</A>); thus healing worse breaches than that between Israel and Judah (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#020">Col 1:20</A>). "God by Him reconciling all things unto Himself, whether things in earth or in heaven." 
<p>
<p>David--the antitypical David, Messiah, of the seed of David, which no other king after the captivity was: who was fully, what David was only in a degree, "the man after God's own heart." Also, David means beloved: Messiah was truly God's beloved Son (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001">Isa 42:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#017">Mat 3:17</A>). Shepherd means King, rather than religious instructor; in this pre-eminently He was the true David, who was the Shepherd King (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#032">Luk 1:32-33</A>). Messiah is called "David" in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#003">Isa 55:3-4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#009">Jer 30:9</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#005">Hos 3:5</A>.

The literal fulfilment is, however, the primary one, though the spiritual also is designed. In correspondence with the settled reign of righteousness internally, all is to be prosperity externally, fertilizing showers (according to the promise of the ancient covenant, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#004">Lev 26:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#009">Psa 68:9</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#010">Mal 3:10</A>), and productive trees and lands (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#027">Eze 34:27</A>).

When we realize most our weakness and God's power and faithfulness to His covenant, we are in the fittest state for receiving His blessings.

The Israelites "shall be no more a prey"; but Edom, the type of their most bitter foes, shall be destroyed irrecoverably.
