### [Ezekiel Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#001)

[Ezekiel 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 25:3</span></span>

APPROPRIATELY IN THE INTERVAL OF SILENCE AS TO THE JEWS IN THE EIGHT
CHAPTERS, (TWENTY-FIFTH THROUGH THIRTY-SECOND) EZEKIEL DENOUNCES
JUDGMENTS ON THE HEATHEN WORLD KINGDOMS. (Eze. 25:1-17)

([Jer 49:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#001)).

when . . . profaned; . . . when . . . desolate; . . . when . . .
captivity--rather, "for . . . for . . . for": the cause of the insolent
exultation of Ammon over Jerusalem. They triumphed especially over the
fall of the "sanctuary," as the triumph of heathenism over the rival
claims of Jehovah. In Jehoshaphat's time, when the eighty-third Psalm
was written ([Psa 83:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#004), [Psa
83:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#007), [Psa
83:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#012), "Ammon . . . holpen the
children of Lot," who were, therefore, the leaders of the unholy
conspiracy, "Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession"),
we see the same profane spirit. Now at last their wicked wish seems
accomplished in the fall of Jerusalem. Ammon, descended from Lot, held
the region east of Jordan, separated from the Amorites on the north by
the river Jabbok, and from Moab on the south by the Arnon. They were
auxiliaries to Babylon in the destruction of Jerusalem ([Kg2
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#002)).

[Ezekiel 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 25:4</span></span>

men of . . . east--literally, "children of the East," the nomad tribes
of Arabia-Deserta, east of the Jordan and the Dead Sea.

palaces--their nomadic encampments or folds, surrounded with mud walls,
are so called in irony. Where thy "palaces" once stood, there shall
their very different "palaces" stand. Fulfilled after the ravaging of
their region by Nebuchadnezzar, shortly after the destruction of
Jerusalem (compare [Eze 21:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#022); Jer.
49:1-28).

[Ezekiel 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 25:5</span></span>

Rabbah--meaning "the Great," Ammon's metropolis. Under the Ptolemies it
was rebuilt under the name Philadelphia; the ruins are called Amman now,
but there is no dwelling inhabited.

Ammonites--that is the Ammonite region is to be a "couching place for
flocks," namely of the Arabs. The "camels," being the chief beast of
burden of the Chaldeans, are put first, as their invasion was to prepare
the Ammonite land for the Arab "flocks." Instead of busy men, there
shall be "still and couching flocks."

[Ezekiel 25:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 25:6</span></span>

"Because thou hast clapped thine hands," exulting over the downfall of
Jerusalem, "I also will stretch out Mine hand upon thee" (to which [Eze
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#017) also may refer, "I will smite
Mine hands together").

hands . . . feet . . . heart--with the whole inward feeling, and with
every outward indication. Stamping with the foot means dancing for joy.

[Ezekiel 25:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 25:7</span></span>

a spoil--so the Hebrew Margin, or Keri, for the text or Chetib, "meat"
(so [Eze 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#005); [Eze
34:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#028)). Their goods were to be a
"spoil to the foe"; their state was to be "cut off," so as to be no more
a "people"; and they were as individuals, for the most part, to be
"destroyed."

[Ezekiel 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 25:8</span></span>

Moab, Seir, and Ammon were contiguous countries, stretching in one line
from Gilead on the north to the Red Sea. They therefore naturally acted
in concert, and in joint hostility to Judea.

Judah is like . . . all . . . heathen--The Jews fare no better than
others: it is of no use to them to serve Jehovah, who, they say, is the
only true God.

[Ezekiel 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 25:9</span></span>

open . . . from the cities--I will open up the side, or border of Moab
(metaphor from a man whose side is open to blows), from the (direction
of) the cities on his northwest border beyond the Arnon, once assigned
to Reuben ([Jos 13:15-21](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#015)), but now in
the hands of their original owners; and the "men of the east," the
wandering Bedouin hordes, shall enter through these cities into Moab and
waste it. Moab accordingly was so wasted by them, that long before the
time of Christ it had melted away among the hordes of the desert. For
"cities," GROTIUS translates the Hebrew as proper names, the Ar and
Aroer, on the Arnon. Hence the Hebrew for "cities," "Ar" is repeated
twice ([Num 21:28](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#028); [Deu
2:36](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#036); [Isa
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#001)).

glory of the country--The region of Moab was richer than that of Ammon;
it answers to the modern Belka, the richest district in South Syria, and
the scene in consequence of many a contest among the Bedouins. Hence it
is called here a "glorious land" (literally, "a glory," or "ornament of
a land") \[FAIRBAIRN\]. Rather, "the glory of the country" is in
apposition with "cities" which immediately precedes, and the names of
which presently follow.

Beth-jeshimoth--meaning "the city of desolations"; perhaps so named from
some siege it sustained; it was towards the west.

Baal-meon--called also "Beth-meon" ([Jer
48:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#023)), and "Beth-baal-meon" ([Jos
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#017), called so from the worship of
Baal), and "Bajith," simply ([Isa
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#002)).

Kiriathaim--"the double city." The strength of these cities engendered
"the pride" of Moab ([Isa 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#006)).

[Ezekiel 25:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 25:10</span></span>

with the Ammonites--FAIRBAIRN explains and translates, "upon the
children of Ammon" (elliptically for, "I will open Moab to the men of
the east, who, having overrun the children of Ammon, shall then fall on
Moab"). MAURER, as English Version, "with the Ammonites," that is, Moab,
"together with the land of Ammon," is to be thrown "open to the men of
the east," to enter and take possession (Jer. 49:1-39).

[Ezekiel 25:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 25:12</span></span>

taking vengeance--literally, "revenging with revengement," that is, the
most unrelenting vengeance. It was not simple hatred, but deep-brooding,
implacable revenge. The grudge of Edom or Esau was originally for
Jacob's robbing him of Isaac's blessing ([Gen
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#023); [Gen
27:27-41](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#027)). This purpose of revenge
yielded to the extraordinary kindness of Jacob, through the blessing of
Him with whom Jacob wrestled in prayer; but it was revived as an
hereditary grudge in the posterity of Esau when they saw the younger
branch rising to the pre-eminence which they thought of right belonged
to themselves. More recently, for David's subjugation of Edom to Israel
([Sa2 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#014)). They therefore gave vent
to their spite by joining the Chaldeans in destroying Jerusalem ([Psa
137:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#007); [Lam
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#022); [Oba
1:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#010)), and then intercepting and
killing the fugitive Jews ([Amo 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#011))
and occupying part of the Jewish land as far as Hebron.

[Ezekiel 25:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 25:13</span></span>

Teman . . . they of Dedan--rather, "I will make it desolate from Teman
(in the south) even to Dedan (in the northwest)" \[GROTIUS\], ([Jer
49:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#008)), that is, the whole country from
north to south, stretching from the south of the Dead Sea to the
Elanitic gulf of the Red Sea.

[Ezekiel 25:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 25:14</span></span>

by . . . my people Israel--namely, by Judas Maccabeus. The Idumeans were
finally, by compulsory circumcision, incorporated with the Jewish state
by John Hyrcanus (see [Isa 34:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#005); [Isa
63:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#001), &c.; 1 Maccabees 5:3). So
complete was the amalgamation in Christ's time, that the Herods of
Idumean origin, as Jews, ruled over the two races as one people. Thus
the ancient prophecy was fulfilled ([Gen
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#023)), "The elder shall serve the
younger."

[Ezekiel 25:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 25:15</span></span>

(1Sa. 13:1-14:52; [Ch2 28:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#018)). The
"old hatred" refers to their continual enmity to the covenant-people.
They lay along Judea on the seacoast at the opposite side from Ammon and
Moab. They were overthrown by Uzziah ([Ch2
26:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#006)), and by Hezekiah ([Kg2
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#008)). Nebuchadnezzar overran the
cities on the seacoast on his way to Egypt after besieging Tyre ([Jer
47:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#001)). God will take vengeance on
those who take the avenging of themselves out of His hands into their
own ([Rom 12:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#019); [Jam
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#013)).

[Ezekiel 25:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 25:16</span></span>

cut off the Cherethims--There is a play on similar sounds in the Hebrew,
hichratti cherethim, "I will slay the slayers." The name may have been
given to a section of the Philistines from their warlike disposition
([Sa1 30:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#014); [Sa1
31:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#003)). They excelled in archery,
whence David enrolled a bodyguard from them ([Sa2
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#018); [Sa2
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#018); [Sa2
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#007)). They sprang from Caphtor,
identified by many with Crete, which was famed for archery, and to which
the name Cherethim seems akin. Though in emigration, which mostly tended
westwards, Crete seems more likely to be colonized from Philistia than
Philistia from Crete, a section of Cretans may have settled at Chere
thim in South Philistia, while the Philistines, as a nation, may have
come originally from the east (compare [Deu
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#023); [Jer
47:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#004); [Amo
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#007); [Zep
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#005)). In [Gen
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#014) the Philistines are made
distinct from the Caphtorim, and are said to come from the Casluhim; so
that the Cherethim were but a part of the Philistines, which [Sa1
30:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#014) confirms.

remnant of--that is, "on the seacoast" of the Mediterranean: those left
remaining after the former overthrows inflicted by Samuel, David,
Hezekiah, and Psammetichus of Egypt, father of Pharaoh-necho ([Jer
25:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#020)).

[Ezekiel 25:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 25:17</span></span>

know . . . vengeance--They shall know Me, not in mercy, but by My
vengeance on them ([Psa 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#016)).

In the twenty-sixth chapter, Ezekiel sets forth:--(1) Tyre's sin; (2)
its doom; (3) the instruments executing it; (4) the effects produced on
other nations by her downfall. In the twenty-seventh chapter, a
lamentation over the fall of such earthly splendor. In the twenty-eighth
chapter, an elegy addressed to the king, on the humiliation of his
sacrilegious pride. Ezekiel, in his prophecies as to the heathen,
exhibits the dark side only; because he views them simply in their
hostility to the people of God, who shall outlive them all. Isaiah (Isa.
23:1-18), on the other hand, at the close of judgments, holds out the
prospect of blessing, when Tyre should turn to the Lord.
