### [Psalms Chapter 104](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#001)

[Psalms 104:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 104:1</span></span>

The Psalmist celebrates God's glory in His works of creation and
providence, teaching the dependence of all living creatures; and
contrasting the happiness of those who praise Him with the awful end of
the wicked. (Psa. 104:1-35)

God's essential glory, and also that displayed by His mighty works,
afford ground for praise.

[Psalms 104:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 104:2</span></span>

light--is a figurative representation of the glory of the invisible God
([Mat 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#002); [Ti1
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#016)). Its use in this connection may
refer to the first work of creation ([Gen
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#003)).

stretchest out the heavens--the visible heavens or sky which cover the
earth as a curtain ([Isa 40:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#012)).

[Psalms 104:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 104:3</span></span>

in the waters--or, it may be "with"; using this fluid for the beams, or
frames, of His residence accords with the figure of clouds for chariots,
and wind as a means of conveyance.

walketh--or, "moveth" (compare [Psa
18:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#010); [Amo
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#006)).

[Psalms 104:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 104:4</span></span>

This is quoted by Paul ([Heb 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#007)) to
denote the subordinate position of angels; that is, they are only
messengers as other and material agencies.

spirits--literally, "winds."

flaming fire-- ([Psa 105:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#032)) being
here so called.

[Psalms 104:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 104:5</span></span>

The earth is firmly fixed by His power.

[Psalms 104:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 104:6</span></span>

These verses rather describe the wonders of the flood than the creation
([Gen 7:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#019); [Pe2
3:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#005)). God's method of arresting the
flood and making its waters subside is poetically called a "rebuke"
([Psa 76:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#006); [Isa
50:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#002)), and the process of the flood's
subsiding by undulations among the hills and valleys is vividly
described.

[Psalms 104:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 104:10</span></span>

Once destructive, these waters are subjected to the service of God's
creatures. In rain and dew from His chambers (compare [Psa
104:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#003)), and fountains and streams,
they give drink to thirsting animals and fertilize the soil. Trees thus
nourished supply homes to singing birds, and the earth teems with the
productions of God's wise agencies,

[Psalms 104:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 104:14</span></span>

so that men and beasts are abundantly provided with food.

for the service--literally, "for the culture," &c., by which he secures
the results.

oil . . . shine--literally, "makes his face to shine more than oil,"
that is, so cheers and invigorates him, that outwardly he appears better
than if anointed.

strengtheneth . . . heart--gives vigor to man (compare [Jdg
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#005)).

[Psalms 104:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 104:16</span></span>

God's care of even wild animals and uncultivated parts of the earth.

[Psalms 104:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 104:20</span></span>

He provides and adapts to man's wants the appointed times and seasons.

[Psalms 104:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">psa 104:24</span></span>

From a view of the earth thus full of God's blessings, the writer passes
to the sea, which, in its immensity, and as a scene and means of man's
activity in commerce, and the home of countless multitudes of creatures,
also displays divine power and beneficence. The mention of

[Psalms 104:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">psa 104:26</span></span>

leviathan-- ([Job 40:20](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#020)) heightens the
estimate of the sea's greatness, and of His power who gives such a place
for sport to one of His creatures.

[Psalms 104:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">psa 104:27</span></span>

The entire dependence of this immense family on God is set forth. With
Him, to kill or make alive is equally easy. To hide His face is to
withdraw favor ([Psa 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#001)). By His
spirit, or breath, or mere word, He gives life. It is His constant
providence which repairs the wastes of time and disease.

[Psalms 104:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">psa 104:31</span></span>

While God could equally glorify His power in destruction, that He does
it in preservation is of His rich goodness and mercy, so that we may
well spend our lives in grateful praise, honoring to Him, and delightful
to pious hearts ([Psa 147:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#001)).

[Psalms 104:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">psa 104:35</span></span>

Those who refuse such a protector and withhold such a service mar the
beauty of His works, and must perish from His presence.

Praise ye the Lord--The Psalm closes with an invocation of praise, the
translation of a Hebrew phrase, which is used as an English word,
"Hallelujah," and may have served the purpose of a chorus, as often in
our psalmody, or to give fuller expression to the writer's emotions. It
is peculiar to Psalms composed after the captivity, as "Selah" is to
those of an earlier date.
