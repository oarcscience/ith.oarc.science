### [Psalms Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#001)

[Psalms 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 7:1</span></span>

Shiggaion--a plaintive song or elegy. Though obscure in details, this
title seems to intimate that the occasion of this Psalm was some event
in David's persecution by Saul. He prays for relief because he is
innocent, and God will be glorified in his vindication. He thus passes
to the celebration of God's righteous government, in defending the
upright and punishing the wicked, whose malignant devices will result in
their own ruin; and, confident of God's aid, he closes with rejoicing.
(Psa. 7:1-17)

Though many enemies set upon him, one is singled out as prominent, and
compared to a wild beast tearing his prey to pieces (compare [Sa1
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#001); [Sa1
23:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#023); [Sa1
26:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#019)).

[Psalms 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 7:3</span></span>

if I have done this--that is, the crime charged in the "words of Cush"
(compare [Sa1 24:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#009)).

[Psalms 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 7:4</span></span>

If I have injured my friend.

yea, I have delivered, &c.--This makes a good sense, but interrupts the
course of thought, and hence it is proposed to render, "if I have
spoiled my enemy"--in either case (compare [Sa1
24:4-17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#004); [Sa1
31:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#008), [Sa1
31:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#011)).

[Psalms 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 7:5</span></span>

This is the consequence, if such has been his conduct.

mine honour--(compare [Psa 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#003); [Psa
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#002)) --my personal and official
dignity.

[Psalms 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 7:6</span></span>

God is involved as if hitherto careless of him ([Psa
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#007); [Psa
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#018)).

rage--the most violent, like a flood rising over a river's banks.

the judgment . . . commanded--or, "ordained"; a just decision.

[Psalms 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 7:7</span></span>

compass thee--as those seeking justice.

return thou on high--assume the judgment seat, to be honored as a just
Ruler by them.

[Psalms 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 7:8</span></span>

Though not claiming innocence in general, he can confidently do so in
this case, and in demanding from the Judge of all the earth a judgment,
he virtually asks acquittal.

[Psalms 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 7:9</span></span>

the hearts and reins--the affections and motives of men, or the seat of
them (compare [Psa 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#007); [Psa
26:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#002)); as we use heart and bosom or
breast.

[Psalms 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 7:10</span></span>

defence--literally, "shield" ([Psa
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#012)).

[Psalms 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 7:11</span></span>

judgeth--as in [Psa 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#008).

the wicked--Though not expressed, they are implied, for they alone are
left as objects of anger.

[Psalms 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 7:12</span></span>

They are here distinctly pointed out, though by changing the person, a
very common mode of speech, one is selected as a representative of
wicked men generally. The military figures are of obvious meaning.

[Psalms 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 7:13</span></span>

against the persecutors--Some render "for burning," but the former is
the best sense. Arrows for burning would be appropriate in besieging a
town, not in warring against one man or a company in open fight.

[Psalms 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 7:14</span></span>

The first clause expresses the general idea that wicked men labor to do
evil, the others carry out the figure fully.

[Psalms 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 7:15</span></span>

[Sa1 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#017); [Sa1
31:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#002) illustrate the statement whether
alluded to or not. These verses are expository of [Psa
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#014), showing how the devices of the
wicked end in disappointment, falsifying their expectations.

[Psalms 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 7:17</span></span>

his righteousness-- ([Psa 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#008)). Thus
illustrated in the defense of His servant and punishment of the wicked.
