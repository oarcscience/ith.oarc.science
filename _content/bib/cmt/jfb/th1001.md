### [1 Thessalonians Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#001)

[1 Thessalonians 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">th1 1:1</span></span>

ADDRESS: SALUTATION: HIS PRAYERFUL THANKSGIVING FOR THEIR FAITH, HOPE,
AND LOVE. THEIR FIRST RECEPTION OF THE GOSPEL, AND THEIR GOOD INFLUENCE
ON ALL AROUND. ([Th1 1:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#001))

Paul--He does not add "an apostle," because in their case, as in that of
the Philippians (see on [Phi 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#001)), his
apostolic authority needs not any substantiation. He writes familiarly
as to faithful friends, not but that his apostleship was recognized
among them ([Th1 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#006)). On the other
hand, in writing to the Galatians, among whom some had called in
question his apostleship, he strongly asserts it in the superscription.
An undesigned propriety in the Epistles, evincing genuineness.

Silvanus--a "chief man among the brethren" ([Act
15:22](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#022)), and a "prophet" ([Act
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#032)), and one of the deputies who
carried the decree of the Jerusalem council to Antioch. His age and
position cause him to be placed before "Timothy," then a youth ([Act
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#001); [Ti1
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#012)). Silvanus (the Gentile expanded
form of "Silas") is called in [Pe1
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#012), "a faithful brother" (compare
[Co2 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#019)). They both aided in
planting the Thessalonian Church, and are therefore included in the
address. This, the first of Paul's Epistles, as being written before
various evils crept into the churches, is without the censures found in
other Epistles. So realizing was their Christian faith, that they were
able hourly to look for the Lord Jesus.

unto the church--not merely as in the Epistles to Romans, Ephesians,
Colossians, Philippians, "to the saints," or "the faithful at
Thessalonica." Though as yet they do not seem to have had the final
Church organization under permanent "bishops" and deacons, which appears
in the later Epistles (See on [Phi
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#001); 1 and 2 Timothy). Yet he
designates them by the honorable term "Church," implying their status as
not merely isolated believers, but a corporate body with spiritual
rulers ([Th1 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#012); [Co2
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#001); [Gal
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#002)).

in--implying vital union.

God the Father--This marks that they were no longer heathen.

the Lord Jesus Christ--This marks that they were not Jews, but
Christians.

Grace be unto you, and peace--that ye may have in God that favor and
peace which men withhold \[ANSELM\]. This is the salutation in all the
Epistles of Paul, except the three pastoral ones, which have "grace,
mercy, and peace." Some of the oldest manuscripts support, others omit
the clause following, "from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
It may have crept in from [Co1 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#003);
[Co2 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#002).

[1 Thessalonians 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">th1 1:2</span></span>

([Rom 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#009); [Ti2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#003).) The structure of the sentences
in this and the following verses, each successive sentence repeating
with greater fulness the preceding, characteristically marks Paul's
abounding love and thankfulness in respect to his converts, as if he
were seeking by words heaped on words to convey some idea of his
exuberant feelings towards them.

We--I, Silvanus, and Timotheus. [Rom
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#009) supports ALFORD in translating,
"making mention of you in our prayers without ceasing" ([Th1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#003)). Thus, "without ceasing," in the
second clause, answers in parallelism to "always," in the first.

[1 Thessalonians 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">th1 1:3</span></span>

work of faith--the working reality of your faith; its alacrity in
receiving the truth, and in evincing itself by its fruits. Not an otiose
assent; but a realizing, working faith; not "in word only," but in one
continuous chain of "work" (singular, not plural, works), [Th1
1:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#005); [Jam
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#022). So "the work of faith" in [Th2
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#011) implies its perfect development
(compare [Jam 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#004)). The other
governing substantives similarly mark respectively the characteristic
manifestation of the grace which follows each in the genitive. Faith,
love, and hope, are the three great Christian graces ([Th1
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#008); [Co1
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#013)).

labour of love--The Greek implies toil, or troublesome labor, which we
are stimulated by love to bear ([Th1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#009); [Rev
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#002)). For instances of self-denying
labors of love, see [Act 20:35](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#035); [Rom
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#012). Not here ministerial labors.
Those who shun trouble for others, love little (compare [Heb
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#010)).

patience--Translate, "endurance of hope"; the persevering endurance of
trials which flows from "hope." [Rom
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#004) shows that "patience" also
nourishes "hope."

hope in our Lord Jesus--literally, "hope of our Lord Jesus," namely, of
His coming ([Th1 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#010)): a hope that
looked forward beyond all present things for the manifestation of
Christ.

in the sight of God and our Father--Your "faith, hope, and love" were
not merely such as would pass for genuine before men, but "in the sight
of God," the Searcher of hearts \[GOMARUS\]. Things are really what they
are before God. BENGEL takes this clause with "remembering." Whenever we
pray, we remember before God your faith, hope, and love. But its
separation from "remembering" in the order, and its connection with
"your . . . faith," &c., make me to prefer the former view.

and, &c.--The Greek implies, "in the sight of Him who is \[at once\] God
and our Father."

[1 Thessalonians 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">th1 1:4</span></span>

Knowing--Forasmuch as we know.

your election of God--The Greek is rather, "beloved by God"; so [Rom
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#007); [Th2
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#013). "Your election" means that God
has elected you as individual believers to eternal life ([Rom
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#005), [Rom
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#007); [Col
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#012); [Th2
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#013)).

[1 Thessalonians 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">th1 1:5</span></span>

our gospel--namely, the Gospel which we preached.

came--Greek, "was made," namely, by God, its Author and Sender. God's
having made our preaching among you to be attended with such "power," is
the proof that you are "elect of God" ([Th1
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#004)).

in power--in the efficacy of the Holy Spirit clothing us with power (see
end of verse; [Act 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#008); [Act
4:33](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#033); [Act
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#005), [Act
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#008)) in preaching the Gospel, and
making it in you the power of God unto salvation ([Rom
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#016)). As "power" produces faith; so
"the Holy Ghost," love; and "much assurance" ([Col
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#002), full persuasion), hope ([Heb
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#011)), resting on faith ([Heb
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#022)). So faith, love, and hope ([Th1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#003)).

as ye know--answering to the "knowing," that is, as WE know ([Th1
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#004)) your character as the elect of
God, so YE know ours as preachers.

for your sake--The purpose herein indicated is not so much that of the
apostles, as that of God. "You know what God enabled us to be . . . how
mighty in preaching the word . . . for your sakes . . . thereby proving
that He had chosen ([Th1 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#004)) you for
His own" \[ALFORD\]. I think, from [Th1
2:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#010), that, in "what manner of men
we were among you," besides the power in preaching, there is included
also Paul's and his fellow missionaries' whole conduct which confirmed
their preaching; and in this sense, the "for your sake" will mean "in
order to win you." This, though not the sole, yet would be a strong,
motive to holy circumspection, namely, so as to win those without ([Col
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#005); compare [Co1
9:19-23](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#019)).

[1 Thessalonians 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">th1 1:6</span></span>

And ye--answering to "For our Gospel," [Th1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#005).

followers--Greek, "imitators." The Thessalonians in their turn became
"ensamples" ([Th1 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#007)) for others to
imitate.

of the Lord--who was the apostle of the Father, and taught the word,
which He brought from heaven, under adversities \[BENGEL\]. This was the
point in which they imitated Him and His apostles, joyful witness for
the word in much affliction: the second proof of their election of God
([Th1 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#004)); [Th1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#005) is the first (see on [Th1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#005)).

received the word in much affliction-- ([Th1
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#014); [Th1
3:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#002); [Act
17:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#005)).

joy of--that is, wrought by "the Holy Ghost." "The oil of gladness"
wherewith the Son of God was "anointed above His fellows" ([Psa
45:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#007)), is the same oil with which He,
by the Spirit, anoints His fellows too ([Isa
61:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001), [Isa
61:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#003); [Rom
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#017); [Jo1
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#020), [Jo1
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#027)).

[1 Thessalonians 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">th1 1:7</span></span>

ensamples--So some of the oldest manuscripts read. Others, "ensample"
(singular), the whole Church being regarded as one. The Macedonian
Church of Philippi was the only one in Europe converted before the
Thessalonians. Therefore he means their past conduct is an ensample to
all believers now; of whom he specifies those "in Macedonia" because he
had been there since the conversion of the Thessalonians, and had left
Silvanus and Timotheus there; and those in "Achaia," because he was now
at Corinth in Achaia.

[1 Thessalonians 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">th1 1:8</span></span>

from you sounded . . . the word of the Lord--not that they actually
became missionaries: but they, by the report which spread abroad of
their "faith" (compare [Rom 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#008)), and
by Christian merchants of Thessalonica who travelled in various
directions, bearing "the word of the Lord" with them, were virtually
missionaries, recommending the Gospel to all within reach of their
influence by word and by example ([Th1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#007)). In "sounded," the image is that
of a trumpet filling with its clear-sounding echo all the surrounding
places.

to God-ward--no longer directed to idols.

so that we need not to speak any thing--to them in praise of your faith;
"for ([Th1 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#009)) they themselves" (the
people in Macedonia, Achaia, and in every place) know it already.

[1 Thessalonians 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">th1 1:9</span></span>

Strictly there should follow, "For they themselves show of you," &c.;
but, instead, he substitutes that which was the instrumental cause of
the Thessalonians' conversion and faith, "for they themselves show of us
what manner of entering in we had unto you"; compare [Th1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#005), which corresponds to this former
clause, as [Th1 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#006) corresponds to the
latter clause. "And how ye turned from idols to serve the living . . .
God," &c. Instead of our having "to speak any thing" to them (in
Macedonia and Achaia) in your praise ([Th1
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#008)), "they themselves (have the start
of us in speaking of you, and) announce concerning (so the Greek of
'show of' means) us, what manner of (how effectual an) entrance we had
unto you" ([Th1 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#005); [Th1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#001)).

the living and true God--as opposed to the dead and false gods from
which they had "turned." In the English Version reading, [Act
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#004), "of the devout Greeks a great
multitude," no mention is made, as here, of the conversion of idolatrous
Gentiles at Thessalonica; but the reading of some of the oldest
manuscripts and Vulgate singularly coincides with the statement here:
"Of the devout AND of Greeks (namely, idolaters) a great multitude"; so
in [Act 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#017), "the devout persons,"
that is, Gentile proselytes to Judaism, form a separate class. PALEY and
LACHMANN, by distinct lines of argument, support the "AND."

[1 Thessalonians 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">th1 1:10</span></span>

This verse distinguishes them from the Jews, as [Th1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#009) from the idolatrous Gentiles. To
wait for the Lord's coming is a sure characteristic of a true believer,
and was prominent amidst the graces of the Thessalonians ([Co1
1:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#007)). His coming is seldom called
his return ([Joh 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#003)); because the
two advents are regarded as different phases of the same coming; and the
second coming shall have features altogether new connected with it, so
that it will not be a mere repetition of the first, or a mere coming
back again.

his Son . . . raised from the dead--the grand proof of His divine
Sonship ([Rom 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#004)).

delivered--rather as Greek, "who delivereth us." Christ has once for all
redeemed us; He is our Deliverer ALWAYS.

wrath to come-- ([Th1 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#009); [Col
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#006)).
