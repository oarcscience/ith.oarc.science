### [Zechariah Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#001)

[Zechariah 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">zac 4:1</span></span>

FIFTH VISION. The golden candlestick and the two olive trees. The temple
shall be completed by the aid of God's Spirit. ([Zac
4:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#001))

waked me--The prophet was lying in a state of ecstatic slumber with
astonishment at the previous vision. "Came again, and waked me," does
not imply that the angel had departed and now returned, but is an idiom
for "waked me again."

[Zechariah 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">zac 4:2</span></span>

candlestick--symbolizing the Jewish theocracy; and ultimately, the
Church of which the Jewish portion is to be the head: the light-bearer
(so the original is of "lights," [Mat
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#014), [Mat
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#016); [Phi
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#015)) to the world.

all . . . gold--all pure in doctrine and practice, precious and
indestructible; such is the true ideal of the Church; such she shall be
([Psa 45:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#013)).

bowl upon the top--In the candlestick of the tabernacle the plural is
used, bowls (Exo. 25:1-31:18). The Hebrew implies that it was the
fountain of supply of oil to the lamps. Christ at the head ("on the
top") of the Church is the true fountain, of whose fulness of the Spirit
all we receive grace ([Joh 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#016)).

his seven lamps--united in one stem; so in [Exo
25:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#032). But in [Rev
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#012) the seven candlesticks are
separate. The Gentile churches will not realize their unity till the
Jewish Church as the stem unites all the lamps in one candlestick ([Rom
11:16-24](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#016)). The "seven lamps," in [Rev
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#005), are the "seven Spirits of God."

seven pipes--feeding tubes, seven apiece from the "bowl" to each lamp
(see Margin) \[MAURER and CALVIN\]; literally, "seven and seven":
forty-nine in all. The greater the number of oil-feeding pipes, the
brighter the light of the lamps. The explanation in [Zac
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#006) is, that man's power by itself can
neither retard nor advance God's work, that the real motive-power is
God's Spirit. The seven times seven imply the manifold modes by which
the Spirit's grace is imparted to the Church in her manifold work of
enlightening the world.

[Zechariah 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">zac 4:3</span></span>

two olive trees--supplying oil to the bowl. The Holy Ghost, who fills
with His fulness Messiah (the anointed: the "bowl"), from whom flow
supplies of grace to the Church.

by it--literally, "upon it," that is, growing so as somewhat to overtop
it. For the explanation of the "two" see [Zac
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#012), [Zac
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#014).

[Zechariah 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">zac 4:4</span></span>

The prophet is instructed in the truths meant, that we may read them
with the greater reverence and attention \[CALVIN\].

[Zechariah 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">zac 4:5</span></span>

Knowest thou not, &c.--Not a reproof of his ignorance, but a stimulus to
reflection on the mystery.

No, my lord--ingenious confession of ignorance; as a little child he
casts himself for instruction at the feet of the Lord.

[Zechariah 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">zac 4:6</span></span>

Not by might . . . but by my Spirit--As the lamps burned continually,
supplied with oil from a source (the living olive trees) which man did
not make, so Zerubbabel need not be disheartened because of his
weakness; for as the work is one to be effected by the living Spirit
(compare [Hag 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#005)) of God, man's
weakness is no obstacle, for God's might will perfect strength out of
weakness ([Hos 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#007); [Co2
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#010); [Heb
11:34](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#034)). "Might and power" express
human strength of every description, physical, mental, moral. Or,
"might" is the strength of many (an "army"); "power," that of one man
\[PEMBELLUS\] God can save, "whether with many, or with them that have
no power" ([Ch2 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#011); compare [Sa1
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#006)). So in the conversion of sinners
([Co1 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#006); [Co2
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#004)). "Zerubbabel" is addressed as
the chief civil authority in directing the work.

[Zechariah 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">zac 4:7</span></span>

All mountain-like obstacles ([Isa
40:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#004); [Isa
49:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#011)) in Zerubbabel's way shall be
removed, so that the crowning top-stone shall be put on, and the
completion of the work be acknowledged as wholly of "grace."
Antitypically, the antichristian last foe of Israel, the obstacle
preventing her establishment in Palestine, about to be crushed before
Messiah, is probably meant ([Jer
51:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#025); [Dan
2:34](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#034), [Dan
2:44](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#044); [Mat
21:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#044)).

bring forth the headstone--Primarily, bring it forth from the place
where it was chiselled and give it to the workmen to put on the top of
the building. It was customary for chief magistrates to lay the
foundation, and also the crowning top-stone (compare [Ezr
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#010)). Antitypically, the reference is
to the time when the full number of the spiritual Church shall be
completed, and also when "all Israel shall be saved" (compare [Rom
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#026); [Heb
11:40](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#040); [Heb
12:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#022); [Rev
7:4-9](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#004)).

Grace, grace--The repetition expresses, Grace from first to last ([Isa
26:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#003), Margin). Thus the Jews are urged
to pray perseveringly and earnestly that the same grace which completed
it may always preserve it. "Shoutings" of acclamation accompanied the
foundation of the literal temple ([Ezr
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#011), [Ezr
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#013)). So shoutings of "Hosanna"
greeted the Saviour in entering Jerusalem ([Mat
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#009)), when about to complete the
purchase of salvation by His death: His Body being the second temple, or
place of God's inhabitation ([Joh
2:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#020)). So when the full number of
the saints and of Israel is complete, and God shall say, "It is done,"
then again shall "a great voice of much people in heaven" attribute all
to the "grace" of God, saying, "Alleluia! Salvation, and glory, and
honor, and power, unto the Lord our God" ([Rev
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#001), [Rev
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#006)). [Psa
118:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#022) regards Him as "the headstone
of the corner," that is, the foundation-stone. Compare the angels
acclamations at His birth, [Luk 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#014).
Here it is the top-stone. Messiah is not only the "Author," but also the
Finisher ([Heb 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#002)). "Grace" is
ascribed "unto it," that is the stone, Messiah. Hence the benediction
begins, "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ" ([Co2
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#014)).

[Zechariah 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">zac 4:9</span></span>

Zerubbabel . . . shall . . . finish it-- ([Ezr
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#015)) in the sixth year of Darius'
reign.

Lord . . . sent me unto you-- ([Zac
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#009)). The Divine Angel announces that
in what He has just spoken, He has been commissioned by God the Father.

[Zechariah 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">zac 4:10</span></span>

who . . . despised . . . small things--He reproves their ungrateful
unbelief, which they felt because of the humble beginning, compared with
the greatness of the undertaking; and encourages them with the assurance
that their progress in the work, though small, was an earnest of great
and final success, because Jehovah's eye is upon Zerubbabel and the
work, to support Him with His favor. Contrast, "great is the day of
Jezreel" ([Hos 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#011)) with "the day of
small things" here.

they shall rejoice . . . with those seven; they are the eyes of the
Lord--rather, "they, even those seven eyes of the Lord (compare [Zac
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#009)), which . . . shall rejoice and
see (that is, rejoicingly see) the plummet (literally, the 'stone of
tin') in the hand of Zerubbabel" \[MOORE\]; the plummet in his hand
indicating that the work is going forward to its completion. The Hebrew
punctuation, however, favors English Version, of which the sense is,
They who incredulously "despised" such "small" beginnings of the work as
are made now, shall rejoicingly see its going on to completion under
Zerubbabel, "with (the aid of) those seven," namely, the "seven eyes
upon one stone" ([Zac 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#009)): which are
explained, "They are the eyes of the Lord which," &c. \[PEMBELLUS\]. So
differently do men and Jehovah regard the "small" beginnings of God's
work ([Ezr 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#012); [Hag
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#003)). Men "despised" the work in its
early stage: God rejoicingly regards it, and shall continue to do so.

run to and fro, &c.--Nothing in the whole earth escapes the eye of
Jehovah, so that He can ward off all danger from His people, come from
what quarter it may, in prosecuting His work ([Pro
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#003); [Co1
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#009)).

[Zechariah 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">zac 4:11</span></span>

Zechariah three times ([Zac 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#004), [Zac
4:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#011)) asks as to the two olives
before he gets an answer; the question becomes more minute each time.
What he at first calls "two olive trees," he afterwards calls
"branches," as on closer looking he observes that the "branches" of the
trees are the channels through which a continual flow of oil dropped
into the bowl of the lamps ([Zac 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#002)),
and that this is the purpose for which the two olive trees stand beside
the candlestick. Primarily, the "two" refer to Joshua and Zerubbabel.
God, says AUBERLEN, at each of the transition periods of the world's
history has sent great men to guide the Church. So the two witnesses
shall appear before the destruction of Antichrist. Antitypically, "the
two anointed ones" ([Zac 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#014)) are the
twofold supports of the Church, the civil power (answering to
Zerubbabel) and the ecclesiastical (answering to Joshua, the high
priest), which in the restored Jewish polity and temple shall "stand
by," that is, minister to "the Lord of the whole earth," as He shall be
called in the day that He sets up His throne in Jerusalem ([Zac
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#009); [Dan
2:44](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#044); [Rev
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#015)). Compare the description of the
offices of the "priests" and the "prince" ([Isa
49:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#023); Eze. 44:1-46:24). As in [Rev
11:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#003), the "two witnesses" are
identified with the two olive trees and the two candlesticks. WORDSWORTH
explains them to mean the Law and the Gospel: the two Testaments that
witness in the Church for the truth of God. But this is at variance with
the sense here, which requires Joshua and Zerubbabel to be primarily
meant. So Moses (the prophet and lawgiver) and Aaron (the high priest)
ministered to the Lord among the covenant-people at the exodus; Ezekiel
(the priest) and Daniel (a ruler) in the Babylonian captivity; so it
shall be in restored Israel. Some think Elijah will appear again
(compare the transfiguration, [Mat
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#003), [Mat
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#011), with [Mal
4:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#004); [Joh
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#021)) with Moses. [Rev
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#006), which mentions the very miracles
performed by Elijah and Moses (shutting heaven so as not to rain, and
turning water into blood), favors this (compare [Exo
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#019); [Kg1
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#001); [Luk
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#025); [Jam
5:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#016)). The period is the same,
"three years and six months"; the scene also is in Israel ([Rev
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#008)), "where our Lord was crucified."
It is supposed that for the first three and a half years of the hebdomad
([Dan 9:20-27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#020)), God will be worshipped
in the temple; in the latter three and a half years, Antichrist will
break the covenant ([Dan 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027)), and
set himself up in the temple to be worshipped as God ([Th2
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#004)). The witnesses prophesy the
former three and a half years, while corruptions prevail and faith is
rare ([Luk 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#008)); then they are slain
and remain dead three and a half years. Probably, besides individual
witnesses and literal years, there is a fulfilment in long periods and
general witnesses, such as the Church and the Word, the civil and
religious powers so far as they have witnessed for God. So "the beast"
in Revelation answers to the civil power of the apostasy; "the false
prophet" to the spiritual power. Man needs the priest to atone for
guilt, and the prophet-king to teach holiness with kingly authority.
These two typically united in Melchisedek were divided between two till
they meet in Messiah, the Antitype. [Zac
6:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#011) accords with this. The Holy
Spirit in this His twofold power of applying to man the grace of the
atonement, and that of sanctification, must in one point of view be
meant by the two olive trees which supply the bowl at the top of the
candlestick (that is, Messiah at the head of the Church); for it is He
who filled Jesus with all the fulness of His unction ([Joh
3:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#034)). But this does not exclude the
primary application to Joshua and Zerubbabel, "anointed" ([Zac
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#014)) with grace to minister to the
Jewish Church: and so applicable to the twofold supports of the Church
which are anointed with the Spirit, the prince and the priest, or
minister.

[Zechariah 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">zac 4:12</span></span>

through--literally, "by the hand of," that is, by the agency of.

branches--literally, "ears"; so the olive branches are called, because
as ears are full of grain, so the olive branches are full of olives.

golden oil--literally, "gold," that is, gold-like liquor.

out of themselves--Ordinances and ministers are channels of grace, not
the grace itself. The supply comes not from a dead reservoir of oil, but
through living olive trees ([Psa 52:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#008);
[Rom 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#001)) fed by God.

[Zechariah 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">zac 4:13</span></span>

Knowest thou not--God would awaken His people to zeal in learning His
truth.

[Zechariah 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">zac 4:14</span></span>

anointed ones--literally, "sons of oil" ([Isa
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#001), Margin). Joshua the high priest,
and Zerubbabel the civil ruler, must first be anointed with grace
themselves, so as to be the instruments of furnishing it to others
(compare [Jo1 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#020), [Jo1
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#027)).
