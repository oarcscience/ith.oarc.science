### [Ezekiel Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#001)

[Ezekiel 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 20:1</span></span>

REJECTION OF THE ELDERS' APPLICATION TO THE PROPHET: EXPOSURE OF
ISRAEL'S PROTRACTED REBELLIONS, NOTWITHSTANDING GOD'S LONG-SUFFERING
GOODNESS: YET WILL GOD RESTORE HIS PEOPLE AT LAST. (Eze. 20:1-49)

seventh year, &c.--namely, from the carrying away of Jeconiah ([Eze
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#002); [Eze
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#001)). This computation was calculated
to make them cherish the more ardently the hope of the restoration
promised them in seventy years; for, when prospects are hopeless, years
are not computed \[CALVIN\].

elders . . . came to inquire--The object of their inquiry, as in [Eze
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#001), is not stated; probably it was
to ascertain the cause of the national calamities and the time of their
termination, as their false prophets assured them of a speedy
restoration.

[Ezekiel 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 20:3</span></span>

The chapter falls into two great parts: Eze. 20:1-32, the recital of the
people's rebellions during five distinct periods: in Egypt, the
wilderness, on the borders of Canaan when a new generation arose, in
Canaan, and in the time of the prophet.

I will not be inquired of by you--because their moral state precluded
them from capability of knowing the will of God ([Psa
66:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#018); [Pro
28:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#009); [Joh
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#017)).

[Ezekiel 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 20:4</span></span>

Wilt thou judge? . . . judge--The emphatical repetition expresses, "Wilt
thou not judge? yes, judge them. There is a loud call for immediate
judgment." The Hebrew interrogative here is a command, not a prohibition
\[MAURER\]. Instead of spending time in teaching them, tell them of the
abomination of their fathers, of which their own are the complement and
counterpart, and which call for judgment.

[Ezekiel 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 20:5</span></span>

The thrice lifting up of God's hand (the sign of His oath, [Rev
10:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#005); [Exo
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#008), Margin; [Num
14:30](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#030); to which passages the form of
words here alludes) implies the solemn earnestness of God's purpose of
grace to them.

made myself known unto them--proving Myself faithful and true by the
actual fulfilment of My promises ([Exo
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#031); [Exo
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#003)); revealing Myself as "Jehovah,"
that is, not that the name was unknown before, but that then first the
force of that name was manifested in the promises of God then being
realized in performances.

[Ezekiel 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 20:6</span></span>

espied for them--as though God had spied out all other lands, and chose
Canaan as the best of all lands ([Deu
8:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#007)). See [Dan
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#009); [Dan
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#016), [Dan
11:41](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#041), "the glorious land"; see
Margin, "land of delight," or, ornament"; "the pleasant land," or "land
of desire," [Zac 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#014), Margin.

glory of all lands--that is, Canaan was "the beauty of all lands"; the
most lovely and delightful land; "milk and honey" are not the
antecedents to "which."

[Ezekiel 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 20:7</span></span>

Moses gives no formal statement of idolatries practised by Israel in
Egypt. But it is implied in their readiness to worship the golden calf
(resembling the Egyptian ox, Apis) ([Exo
32:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#004)), which makes it likely they had
worshipped such idols in Egypt. Also, in [Lev
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#007), "They shall no more offer their
sacrifices unto devils (literally, seirim, 'he-goats,' the symbol of the
false god, Pan), after whom they have gone awhoring." The call of God by
Moses was as much to them to separate from idols and follow Jehovah, as
it was to Pharaoh to let them go forth. [Exo
6:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#006) and [Jos
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#014), expressly mention their
idolatry "in Egypt." Hence the need of their being removed out of the
contagion of Egyptian idolatries by the exodus.

every man--so universal was the evil.

of his eyes--It was not fear of their Egyptian masters, but their own
lust of the eye that drew them to idols ([Eze
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#009); [Eze
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#006)).

[Ezekiel 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 20:8</span></span>

then I said, I will . . . But, &c.--that is, (God speaking in
condescension to human modes of conception) their spiritual degradation
deserved I should destroy them, "but I wrought (namely, the deliverance
'out of . . . Egypt') for My name's sake"; not for their merits (a
rebuke to their national pride). God's "name" means the sum-total of His
perfections. To manifest these, His gratuitous mercy abounding above
their sins, yet without wrong to His justice, and so to set forth His
glory, was and is the ultimate end of His dealings ([Eze
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#014), [Eze
20:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#022); [Sa2
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#023); [Isa
63:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#012); [Rom
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#017)).

[Ezekiel 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 20:11</span></span>

which if a man do, he shall . . . five in them--not "by them," as though
they could justify a man, seeing that man cannot render the faultless
obedience required ([Lev 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#005); [Gal
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#012)). "By them" is the expression
indeed in [Rom 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#005); but there the
design is to show that, if man could obey all God's laws, he would be
justified "by them" ([Gal 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#021)); but
he cannot; he therefore needs to have justification by "the Lord our
righteousness" ([Jer 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#006)); then,
having thus received life, he "lives," that is, maintains, enjoys, and
exercises this life only in so far as he walks "in" the laws of God. So
[Deu 30:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#015). The Israelites, as a
nation, had life already freely given to them by God's covenant of
promise; the laws of God were designed to be the means of the outward
expression of their spiritual life. As the natural life has its healthy
manifestation in the full exercise of its powers, so their spiritual
being as a nation was to be developed in vigor, or else decay, according
as they did, or did not, walk in God's laws.

[Ezekiel 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 20:12</span></span>

sabbaths, . . . a sign between me and them--a kind of sacramental pledge
of the covenant of adoption between God and His people. The Sabbath is
specified as a sample of the whole law, to show that the law is not
merely precepts, but privileges, of which the Sabbath is one of the
highest. Not that the Sabbath was first instituted at Sinai, as if it
were an exclusively Jewish ordinance ([Gen
2:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#002)), but it was then more formally
enacted, when, owing to the apostasy of the world from the original
revelation, one people was called out ([Deu
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#015)) to be the covenant-people of
God.

sanctify them--The observance of the Sabbath contemplated by God was not
a mere outward rest, but a spiritual dedication of the day to the glory
of God and the good of man. Otherwise it would not be, as it is made,
the pledge of universal sanctification ([Exo
31:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#013); [Isa
58:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#013)). Virtually it is said, all
sanctity will flourish or decay, according as this ordinance is observed
in its full spirituality or not.

[Ezekiel 20:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 20:13</span></span>

in the wilderness--They "rebelled" in the very place where death and
terror were on every side and where they depended on My miraculous
bounty every moment!

[Ezekiel 20:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 20:15</span></span>

I swore against them ([Psa 95:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#011); [Psa
106:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#026)) that I would not permit the
generation that came out of Egypt to enter Canaan.

[Ezekiel 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 20:16</span></span>

The special reason is stated by Moses ([Num
13:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#032); [Num
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#004)) to be that they, through fear
arising from the false report of the spies, wished to return to Egypt;
the general reasons are stated here which lay at the root of their
rejection of God's grace; namely, contempt of God and His laws, and love
of idols.

their heart--The fault lay in it ([Psa
78:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#037)).

[Ezekiel 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 20:17</span></span>

Nevertheless--How marvellous that God should spare such sinners! His
everlasting covenant explains it, His long-suffering standing out in
striking contrast to their rebellions ([Psa
78:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#038); [Jer
30:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#011)).

[Ezekiel 20:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 20:18</span></span>

I said unto their children--being unwilling to speak any more to the
fathers as being incorrigible.

Walk ye not in . . . statutes of . . . fathers--The traditions of the
fathers are to be carefully weighed, not indiscriminately followed. He
forbids the imitation of not only their gross sins, but even their
plausible statutes \[CALVIN\].

[Ezekiel 20:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eze 20:19</span></span>

It is an indirect denial of God, and a robbing Him of His due, to add
man's inventions to His precepts.

[Ezekiel 20:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 20:20</span></span>

([Jer 17:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#022)).

[Ezekiel 20:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eze 20:21</span></span>

Though warned by the judgment on their fathers, the next generation also
rebelled against God. The "kindness of Israel's youth and love of her
espousals in the wilderness" ([Jer
2:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#002)) were only comparative (the
corruption in later times being more general), and confined to the
minority; as a whole, Israel at no time fully served God. The "children"
it was that fell into the fearful apostasy on the plains of Moab at the
close of the wilderness sojourn ([Num
25:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#001); [Deu
31:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#027)).

[Ezekiel 20:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eze 20:23</span></span>

It was to that generation the threat of dispersion was proclaimed ([Deu
28:64](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#064); compare [Eze
29:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#004)).

[Ezekiel 20:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">eze 20:25</span></span>

I gave them . . . statutes . . . not good--Since they would not follow
My statutes that were good, "I gave them" their own ([Eze
20:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#018)) and their fathers' "which were
not good"; statutes spiritually corrupting, and, finally, as the
consequence, destroying them. Righteous retribution ([Psa
81:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#012); [Hos
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#011); [Rom
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#024); [Th2
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#011)). [Eze
20:39](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#039) proves this view to be correct
(compare [Isa 63:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#017)). Thus on the
plains of Moab (Num. 25:1-18), in chastisement for the secret
unfaithfulness to God in their hearts, He permitted Baal's worshippers
to tempt them to idolatry (the ready success of the tempters, moreover,
proving the inward unsoundness of the tempted); and this again ended
necessarily in punitive judgments.

[Ezekiel 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">eze 20:26</span></span>

I polluted them--not directly; "but I judicially gave them up to pollute
themselves." A just retribution for their "polluting My sabbaths" ([Eze
20:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#024)). This [Eze
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#026) is explanatory of [Eze
20:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#025). Their own sin I made their
punishment.

caused to pass through the fire--FAIRBAIRN translates, "In their
presenting (literally, 'the causing to pass over') all their
first-born," namely, to the Lord; referring to the command ([Exo
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#012), Margin, where the very same
expression is used). The lustration of children by passing through the
fire was a later abomination ([Eze
20:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#031)). The evil here spoken of was
the admixture of heathenish practices with Jehovah's worship, which made
Him regard all as "polluted." Here, "to the Lord" is omitted purposely,
to imply, "They kept up the outward service indeed, but I did not own it
as done unto Me, since it was mingled with such pollutions." But English
Version is supported by the similar phraseology in [Eze
20:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#031), see on [Eze
20:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#031). They made all their children
pass through the fire; but he names the first-born, in aggravation of
their guilt; that is, "I had willed that the first-born should be
redeemed as being Mine, but they imposed on themselves the cruel rites
of offering them to Molech" ([Deu
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#010)).

might know . . . the Lord--that they may be compelled to know Me as a
powerful Judge, since they were unwilling to know Me as a gracious
Father.

[Ezekiel 20:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">eze 20:27</span></span>

The next period, namely, that which followed the settlement in Canaan:
the fathers of the generation existing in Ezekiel's time walked in the
same steps of apostasy as the generation in the wilderness.

Yet in this--Not content with past rebellions, and not moved with
gratitude for God's goodness, "yet in this," still further they
rebelled.

blasphemed--"have insulted me" \[CALVIN\]. Even those who did not
sacrifice to heathen gods have offered "their sacrifices" ([Eze
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#028)) in forbidden places.

[Ezekiel 20:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">eze 20:28</span></span>

provocation of their offering--an offering as it were purposely made to
provoke God.

sweet savour--What ought to have been sweet became offensive by their
corruptions. He specifies the various kinds of offerings, to show that
in all alike they violated the law.

[Ezekiel 20:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">eze 20:29</span></span>

What is the high place whereunto ye go?--What is the meaning of this
name? For My altar is not so called. What excellence do ye see in it,
that ye go there, rather than to My temple, the only lawful place of
sacrificing? The very name, "high place," convicts you of sinning, not
from ignorance but perverse rebellion.

is called . . . unto this day--whereas this name ought to have been long
since laid aside, along with the custom of sacrificing on high places
which it represents, being borrowed from the heathen, who so called
their places of sacrifice (the Greeks, for instance, called them by a
cognate term, Bomoi), whereas I call mine Mizbeaach, "altar." The very
name implies the place is not that sanctioned by Me, and therefore your
sacrifices even to ME there (much more those you offer to idols) are
only a "provocation" to Me ([Eze
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#028); [Deu
12:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#001)). David and others, it is true,
sacrificed to God on high places, but it was under exceptional
circumstances, and before the altar was set up on Mount Moriah.

[Ezekiel 20:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">eze 20:30</span></span>

The interrogation implies a strong affirmation, as in [Eze
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#004), "Are ye not polluted . . . ? Do
ye not commit?" &c. Or, connecting this verse with [Eze
20:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#031), "Are ye thus polluted . . . and
yet (do ye expect that) I shall be inquired of by you?"

[Ezekiel 20:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">eze 20:31</span></span>

through the fire--As "the fire" is omitted in [Eze
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#026), FAIRBAIRN represents the
generation here referred to (namely, that of Ezekiel's day) as attaining
the climax of guilt (see on [Eze
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#026)), in making their children pass
through the fire, which that former generation did not. The reason,
however, for the omission of "the fire" in [Eze
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#026) is, perhaps, that there it is
implied the children only "passed through the fire" for purification,
whereas here they are actually burnt to death before the idol; and
therefore "the fire" is specified in the latter, not in the former case
(compare [Kg2 3:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#027)).

[Ezekiel 20:32](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">eze 20:32</span></span>

We will be as the heathen--and so escape the odium to which we are
exposed, of having a peculiar God and law of our own. "We shall live on
better terms with them by having a similar worship. Besides, we get from
God nothing but threats and calamities, whereas the heathen, Chaldeans,
&c., get riches and power from their idols." How literally God's words
here ("that . . . shall not be at all") are fulfilled in the modern
Jews! Though the Jews seemed so likely (had Ezekiel spoken as an
uninspired man) to have blended with the rest of mankind and laid aside
their distinctive peculiarities, as was their wish at that time, yet
they have remained for eighteen centuries dispersed among all nations
and without a home, but still distinct: a standing witness for the truth
of the prophecy given so long ago.

[Ezekiel 20:33](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">eze 20:33</span></span>

Here begins the second division of the prophecy. Lest the covenant
people should abandon their distinctive hopes and amalgamate with the
surrounding heathen, He tells them that, as the wilderness journey from
Egypt was made subservient to discipline and also to the taking from
among them the rebellious, so a severe discipline (such as the Jews are
now for long actually undergoing) should be administered to them during
the next exodus for the same purpose ([Eze
20:38](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#038)), and so to prepare them for the
restored possession of their land ([Hos
2:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#014)). This was only partially
fulfilled before, and at the return from Babylon: its full and final
accomplishment is future.

with a mighty hand, . . . will I rule over you--I will assert My right
over you in spite of your resistance ([Eze
20:32](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#032)), as a master would in the case
of his slave, and I will not let you be wrested from Me, because of My
regard to My covenant.

[Ezekiel 20:34](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">eze 20:34</span></span>

The Jews in exile might think themselves set free from the "rule" of God
([Eze 20:33](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#033)); therefore, He intimates,
He will reassert His right over them by chastening judgments, and these,
with an ultimate view, not to destroy, but to restore them.

people--rather, "peoples."

[Ezekiel 20:35](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">eze 20:35</span></span>

wilderness of the people--rather, "peoples," the various peoples among
whom they were to be scattered, and about whom God saith ([Eze
20:34](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#034)), "I will bring you out." In
contrast to the literal "wilderness of Egypt" ([Eze
20:36](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#036)), "the wilderness of the
peoples" is their spiritual wilderness period of trial, discipline, and
purification while exiled among the nations. As the state when they are
"brought into the wilderness of the peoples" and that when they were
among the peoples "from" which God was to "bring them out" ([Eze
20:34](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#034)) are distinguished, the
wilderness state probably answers partially to the transition period of
discipline from the first decree for their restoration by Cyrus to the
time of their complete settlement in their land, and the rebuilding of
Jerusalem and the temple. But the full and final fulfilment is future;
the wilderness state will comprise not only the transition period of
their restoration, but the beginning of their occupancy of Palestine, a
time in which they shall endure the sorest of all their chastisements,
to "purge out the rebels" ([Eze 20:38](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#038);
[Dan 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001)); and then the remnant ([Zac
13:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#008); [Zac
14:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#002)) shall "all serve God in the
land" ([Eze 20:40](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#040)). Thus the
wilderness period does not denote locality, but their state intervening
between their rejection and future restoration.

plead--bring the matter in debate between us to an issue. Image is from
a plaintiff in a law court meeting the defendant "face to face."
Appropriate, as God in His dealings acts not arbitrarily, but in most
righteous justice ([Jer 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#009); [Mic

[Ezekiel 20:36](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">eze 20:36</span></span>

([Num 14:21-29](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#021)). Though God saved them
out of Egypt, He afterwards destroyed in the wilderness them that
believed not ([Jde 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#005)); so, though He
brought the exiles out of Babylon, yet their wilderness state of
chastening discipline continued even after they were again in Canaan.

[Ezekiel 20:37](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">eze 20:37</span></span>

pass under the rod--metaphor from a shepherd who makes his sheep pass
under his rod in counting them ([Lev
27:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#032); [Jer
33:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#013)). Whether you will or not, ye
shall be counted as Mine, and so shall be subjected to My chastening
discipline ([Mic 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#014)), with a view to
My ultimate saving of the chosen remnant (compare [Joh
10:27-29](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#027)).

bond of . . . covenant--I will constrain you by sore chastisements to
submit yourselves to the covenant to which ye are lastingly bound,
though now you have cast away God's bond from you. Fulfilled in part,
[Neh 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#008), [Neh
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#026), [Neh
9:32-38](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#032); Neh. 10:1-39; fully hereafter
([Isa 54:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#010); [Isa
52:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#001)).

[Ezekiel 20:38](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">eze 20:38</span></span>

([Zac 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#009); [Zac
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#002)).

purge out--or, "separate." Hebrew, barothi, forming a designed
alliteration with "berith," the covenant; not a promise of grace, but a
threat against those Jews who thought they could in exile escape the
observation and "rule" of God.

land of Israel--Though brought out of the country of their sojourn or
exile (Babylon formerly, and the various lands of their exile hereafter)
into the literal land of Palestine, even it shall be to them an exile
state, "they shall not enter into the land of Israel," that is, the
spiritual state of restored favor of God to His covenant people, ,which
shall only be given to the remnant to be saved ([Zac
13:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#008)).

[Ezekiel 20:39](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">eze 20:39</span></span>

Equivalent to, "I would rather have you open idolaters than hypocrites,
fancying you can worship Me and yet at the same time serve idols" ([Amo
5:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#021), [Amo
5:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#025); compare [Kg1
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#021); [Kg2
17:41](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#041); [Mat
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#024); [Rev
3:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#015)).

Go ye, serve--This is not a command to serve idols, but a judicial
declaration of God's giving up of the half-idol, half-Jehovah
worshippers to utter idolatry, if they will not serve Jehovah alone
([Psa 81:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#012); [Rev
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#011)).

hereafter also--God anticipates the same apostasy afterwards, as now.

[Ezekiel 20:40](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">eze 20:40</span></span>

For--Though ye, the rebellious portion, withdraw from My worship,
others, even the believing remnant, will succeed after you perish, and
will serve Me purely.

in mine holy mountain-- ([Isa 2:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002)).
Zion, or Moriah, "the height of Israel" (pre-eminent above all mountains
because of the manifested presence of God there with Israel), as opposed
to their "high places," the worship on which was an abomination to God.

all--not merely individuals, such as constitute the elect Church now;
but the whole nation, to be followed by the conversion of the Gentile
nations ([Isa 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002), "all nations;" [Rom
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#026); [Rev
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#015)).

with--rather, "in all your holy things" \[MAURER\].

[Ezekiel 20:41](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">eze 20:41</span></span>

with--that is, in respect to your sweet savor (literally, "savor of
rest," see on [Eze 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#019)). Or, I will
accept you (your worship) "as a sweet savor" \[MAURER\], ([Eph
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#002); [Phi
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#018)). God first accepts the person in
Messiah, then the offering ([Eze
20:40](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#040); [Gen
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#004)).

bring . . . out from . . . people, &c.--the same words as in [Eze
20:34](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#034); but there applied to the
bringing forth of the hypocrites, as well as the elect; here restricted
to the saved remnant, who alone shall be at last restored literally and
spiritually in the fullest sense.

sanctified in you before . . . heathen-- ([Jer
33:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#009)). All the nations will
acknowledge My power displayed in restoring you, and so shall be led to
seek Me ([Isa 66:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#018); [Zac
14:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#016)).

[Ezekiel 20:43](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">eze 20:43</span></span>

there--not merely in exile when suffering punishment which makes even
reprobates sorry for sin, but when received into favor in your own land.

remember-- ([Eze 16:61](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#061), [Eze
16:63](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#063)). The humiliation of Judah (Neh.
9:1-38) is a type of the future penitence of the whole nation ([Hos
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#015); [Hos
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#001); [Zac
12:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010)). God's goodness realized by
the sinner is the only thing that leads to true repentance ([Hos
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#005); [Luk
7:37-38](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#037)).

[Ezekiel 20:44](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">eze 20:44</span></span>

The English Version chapter ought to have ended here, and the
twenty-first chapter begun with "Moreover," &c., as in the Hebrew Bible.

for my name's sake-- ([Eze 36:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#022)).
Gratuitously; according to My compassion, not your merits. After having
commented on this verse, CALVIN was laid on his death bed, and his
commentary ended.

[Ezekiel 20:45](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#045)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">eze 20:45</span></span>

An introductory brief description in enigma of the destruction by fire
and sword, detailed more explicitly in Eze. 21:1-32.

[Ezekiel 20:46](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#046)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">eze 20:46</span></span>

south . . . south . . . south--three different Hebrew words, to express
the certainty of the divine displeasure resting on the region specified.
The third term is from a root meaning "dry," referring to the sun's heat
in the south; representing the burning judgments of God on the southern
parts of Judea, of which Jerusalem was the capital.

set thy face--determinately. The prophets used to turn themselves
towards those who were to be the subjects of their prophecies.

drop--as the rain, which flows in a continuous stream, sometimes gently
([Deu 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#002)), sometimes violently ([Amo
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#016); [Mic
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#006), Margin), as here.

forest--the densely populated country of Judea; trees representing
people.

[Ezekiel 20:47](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#047)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">eze 20:47</span></span>

fire--every kind of judgment ([Eze
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#012); [Eze
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#003), "my sword"; [Jer
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#014)).

green tree . . . dry--fit and unfit materials for fuel alike; "the
righteous and the wicked," as explained in [Eze
21:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#003); [Luk
23:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#031). Unsparing universality of the
judgment!

flaming flame--one continued and unextinguished flame. "The glowing
flame" \[FAIRBAIRN\].

faces--persons; here the metaphor is merged in the reality.

[Ezekiel 20:49](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#049)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">eze 20:49</span></span>

Ezekiel complains that by this parabolic form of prophecy he only makes
himself and it a jest to his countrymen. God therefore in Eze. 21:1-32
permits him to express the same prophecy more plainly.
