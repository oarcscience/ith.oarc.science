### [Job Chapter 40](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#001)

[Job 40:1](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 40:1</span></span>

GOD'S SECOND ADDRESS. (Job 40:1-24)

the Lord--Hebrew, "JEHOVAH."

[Job 40:2](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 40:2</span></span>

he that contendeth--as Job had so often expressed a wish to do. Or,
rebuketh. Does Job now still (after seeing and hearing of God's majesty
and wisdom) wish to set God right?

answer it--namely, the questions I have asked.

[Job 40:3](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 40:3</span></span>

Lord--JEHOVAH.

[Job 40:4](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 40:4</span></span>

I am (too) vile (to reply). It is a very different thing to vindicate
ourselves before God, from what it is before men. Job could do the
latter, not the former.

lay . . . hand . . . upon . . . mouth--I have no plea to offer ([Job
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#005); [Jdg
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#019)).

[Job 40:5](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 40:5</span></span>

Once . . . twice--oftentimes, more than once ([Job
33:14](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#014), compare with [Job
33:29](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#029); [Psa
62:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#011)):

I have spoken--namely, against God.

not answer--not plead against Thee.

[Job 40:6](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 40:6</span></span>

the Lord--JEHOVAH.

[Job 40:7](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 40:7</span></span>

(See on [Job 38:3](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#003)). Since Job has not
only spoken against God, but accused Him of injustice, God challenges
him to try, could he govern the world, as God by His power doth, and
punish the proud and wicked ([Job
40:7-14](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#007)).

[Job 40:8](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 40:8</span></span>

Wilt thou not only contend with, but set aside My judgment or justice in
the government of the world?

condemn--declare Me unrighteous, in order that thou mayest be accounted
righteous (innocent; undeservingly afflicted).

[Job 40:9](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 40:9</span></span>

arm--God's omnipotence ([Isa 53:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001)).

thunder--God's voice ([Job 37:4](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#004)).

[Job 40:10](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 40:10</span></span>

See, hast thou power and majesty like God's, to enable thee to judge and
govern the world?

[Job 40:11](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 40:11</span></span>

rage--rather, pour out the redundant floods of, &c.

behold--Try, canst thou, as God, by a mere glance abase the proud ([Isa
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#012), &c.)?

[Job 40:12](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 40:12</span></span>

proud--high ([Dan 4:37](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#037)).

in their place--on the spot; suddenly, before they can move from their
place. (See on [Job 34:26](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#026); [Job
36:20](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#020)).

[Job 40:13](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 40:13</span></span>

([Isa 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#010)). Abase and remove them out
of the sight of men.

bind . . . faces--that is, shut up their persons \[MAURER\]. But it
refers rather to the custom of binding a cloth over the faces of persons
about to be executed ([Job 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#024); [Est
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/est007.htm#008)).

in secret--consign them to darkness.

[Job 40:14](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 40:14</span></span>

confess--rather, "extol"; "I also," who now censure thee. But since thou
canst not do these works, thou must, instead of censuring, extol My
government.

thine own . . . hand . . . save-- ([Psa
44:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#003)). So as to eternal salvation by
Jesus Christ ([Isa 59:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#016); [Isa
63:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#005)).

[Job 40:15](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 40:15</span></span>

God shows that if Job cannot bring under control the lower animals (of
which he selects the two most striking, behemoth on land, leviathan in
the water), much less is he capable of governing the world.

behemoth--The description in part agrees with the hippopotamus, in part
with the elephant, but exactly in all details with neither. It is rather
a poetical personification of the great Pachydermata, or Herbivora (so
"he eateth grass"), the idea of the hippopotamus being predominant. In
[Job 40:17](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#017), "the tail like a cedar,"
hardly applies to the latter (so also [Job
40:20](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#020), [Job
40:23](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#023), "Jordan," a river which
elephants alone could reach, but see on [Job
40:23](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#023)). On the other hand, [Job
40:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#021) are characteristic of the
amphibious river horse. So leviathan (the twisting animal), [Job
41:1](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#001), is a generalized term for
cetacea, pythons, saurians of the neighboring seas and rivers, including
the crocodile, which is the most prominent, and is often associated with
the river horse by old writers. "Behemoth" seems to be the Egyptian
Pehemout, "water-ox," Hebraized, so-called as being like an ox, whence
the Italian bombarino.

with thee--as I made thyself. Yet how great the difference! The manifold
wisdom and power of God!

he eateth grass--marvellous in an animal living so much in the water;
also strange, that such a monster should not be carnivorous.

[Job 40:16](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 40:16</span></span>

navel--rather, "muscles" of his belly; the weakest point of the
elephant, therefore it is not meant.

[Job 40:17](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 40:17</span></span>

like a cedar--As the tempest bends the cedar, so it can move its smooth
thick tail \[UMBREIT\]. But the cedar implies straightness and length,
such as do not apply to the river horse's short tail, but perhaps to an
extinct species of animal (see on [Job
40:15](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#015)).

stones--rather, "thighs."

wrapped--firmly twisted together, like a thick rope.

[Job 40:18](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 40:18</span></span>

strong--rather, "tubes" of copper \[UMBREIT\].

[Job 40:19](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 40:19</span></span>

Chief of the works of God; so "ways" ([Job
26:14](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#014); [Pro
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#022)).

can make his sword to approach--rather, "has furnished him with his
sword" (harpe), namely, the sickle-like teeth with which he cuts down
grain. English Version, however, is literally right.

[Job 40:20](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 40:20</span></span>

The mountain is not his usual haunt. BOCHART says it is sometimes found
there (?).

beasts . . . play--a graphic trait: though armed with such teeth, he
lets the beasts play near him unhurt, for his food is grass.

[Job 40:21](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 40:21</span></span>

lieth--He leads an inactive life.

shady trees--rather, "lotus bushes"; as [Job
40:22](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#022) requires.

[Job 40:22](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 40:22</span></span>

shady trees--Translate: "lotus bushes."

[Job 40:23](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">job 40:23</span></span>

Rather, "(Though) a river be violent (overflow), he trembleth not"; (for
though living on land, he can live in the water, too); he is secure,
though a Jordan swell up to his mouth. "Jordan" is used for any great
river (consonant with the "behemoth"), being a poetical generalization
(see on [Job 40:15](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#015)). The author cannot
have been a Hebrew as UMBREIT asserts, or he would not adduce the
Jordan, where there were no river horses. He alludes to it as a name for
any river, but not as one known to him, except by hearsay.

[Job 40:24](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">job 40:24</span></span>

Rather, "Will any take him by open force" (literally, "before his
eyes"), "or pierce his nose with cords?" No; he can only be taken by
guile, and in a pitfall ([Job 41:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#001)).
