But from His mountain-top He kept watching the ship (see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#018">Joh 6:18</A>), and doubtless prayed both for them, and with a view to the new manifestation which He was to give them of His glory.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#016">John 6:16</A></p>

The word "constrained" implies reluctance on their part, perhaps from unwillingness to part with their Master and embark at night, leaving Him alone on the mountain. 
<p>
<p>went--rather, "were proceeding." 
<p>
<p>toward Capernaum--Mark says (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#045">Mar 6:45</A>), "unto Bethsaida," meaning "Bethsaida of Galilee" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#021">Joh 12:21</A>), on the west side of the lake. The place they left was of the same name (see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#032">Mar 6:32</A>). 
<p>
<p>Jesus was not come to them--They probably lingered in hopes of His still joining them, and so let the darkness come on.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#018">John 6:18</A></p>

Mark adds the graphic and touching particular, "He saw them toiling in rowing" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#048">Mar 6:48</A>), putting forth all their strength to buffet the waves and bear on against a head wind, but to little effect. He saw this from His mountain-top, and through the darkness of the night, for His heart was all with them; yet would He not go to their relief till His own time came.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#019">John 6:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">joh 6:19</A></FONT></span></p>they see Jesus--"about the fourth watch of the night" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#025">Mat 14:25</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#048">Mar 6:48</A>), or between three and six in the morning. 
<p>
<p>walking on the sea--What Job (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#008">Job 9:8</A>) celebrates as the distinguishing prerogative of GOD, "WHO ALONE spreadeth out the heavens, and TREADETH UPON THE WAVES OF THE SEA"--What AGUR challenges as GOD'S unapproachable prerogative, to "GATHER THE WIND IN HIS FISTS, and BIND THE WATERS IN A GARMENT" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#004">Pro 30:4</A>) --lo! this is here done in flesh, by "THE SON OF MAN." 
<p>
<p>drawing nigh to the ship--yet as though He "would have passed by them," <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#048">Mar 6:48</A> (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#028">Luk 24:28</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#003">Gen 18:3</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#005">Gen 18:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#024">Gen 32:24-26</A>). 
<p>
<p>they were afraid--"cried out for fear" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#026">Mat 14:26</A>), "supposing it had been a spirit" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#049">Mar 6:49</A>). He would appear to them at first like a dark moving speck upon the waters; then as a human figure, but--in the dark tempestuous sky, and not dreaming that it could be their Lord--they take it for a spirit. (How often thus we miscall our chiefest mercies--not only thinking them distant when they are near, but thinking the best the worst!)
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#020">John 6:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">joh 6:20</A></FONT></span></p>It is I; be not afraid--Matthew (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#027">Mat 14:27</A>) and Mark (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#050">Mar 6:50</A>) give before these exhilarating words, that to them well-known one, "Be of good cheer!"
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#021">John 6:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">joh 6:21</A></FONT></span></p>willingly received him into the ship--their first fears being now converted into wonder and delight. 
<p>
<p>and immediately the ship was at the land--This additional miracle, for as such it is manifestly related, is recorded here alone. Yet all that is meant seems to be that as the storm was suddenly calmed, so the little bark--propelled by the secret power of the Lord of Nature now sailing in it--glided through the now unruffled waters, and while they were wrapt in wonder at what had happened, not heeding their rapid motion, was found at port, to their still further surprise.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#022">John 6:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">joh 6:22</A></FONT></span></p>JESUS FOLLOWED BY THE MULTITUDES TO CAPERNAUM, DISCOURSES TO THEM IN THE SYNAGOGUE OF THE BREAD OF LIFE--EFFECT OF THIS ON TWO CLASSES OF THE DISCIPLES. (John 6:22-71)
<p>
<p>These verses are a little involved, from the Evangelist's desire to mention every circumstance, however minute, that might call up the scene as vividly to the reader as it stood before his own view. 
<p>
<p>The day following--the miracle of the loaves, and the stormy night; the day on which they landed at Capernaum. 
<p>
<p>the people which stood on the other side of the sea--not the whole multitude that had been fed, but only such of them as remained over night about the shore, that is, on the east side of the lake; for we are supposed to have come, with Jesus and His disciples in the ship, to the west side, to Capernaum. 
<p>
<p>saw that there was none other boat there, &amp;c.--The meaning is, the people had observed that there had been only one boat on the east side where they were; namely, the one in which the disciples had crossed at night to the other, the west side, and they had also observed that Jesus had not gone on board that boat, but His disciples had put off without Him:
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#023">John 6:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">joh 6:23</A></FONT></span></p>Howbeit, &amp;c.--"Howbeit," adds the Evangelist, in a lively parenthesis, "there came other boats from Tiberias" (which lay near the southwest coast of the lake), whose passengers were part of the multitude that had followed Jesus to the east side, and been miraculously fed; these boats were fastened somewhere (says the Evangelist) 
<p>
<p>nigh unto the place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks--thus he refers to the glorious "miracle of the loaves"--and now they were put in requisition to convey the people back again to the west side. For when "the people saw that Jesus was not there, neither His disciples, they also took shipping [in these boats] and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus."
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#025">John 6:25</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_025">joh 6:25</A></FONT></span></p>when they had found him on the other side--at Capernaum. 
<p>
<p>they said, &amp;c.--astonished at His being there, and wondering how He could have accomplished it, whether by land or water, and when He came; for being quite unaware of His having walked upon the sea and landed with the disciples in the ship, they could not see how, unless He had travelled all night round the head of the lake alone, He could have reached Capernaum, and even then, how He could have arrived before themselves.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#026">John 6:26</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_026">joh 6:26</A></FONT></span></p>Ye seek me, &amp;c.--Jesus does not put them through their difficulty, says nothing of His treading on the waves of the sea, nor even notices their question, but takes advantage of the favorable moment for pointing out to them how forward, flippant, and superficial were their views, and how low their desires. "Ye seek Me not because ye saw the miracles"--literally, "the signs," that is, supernatural tokens of a higher presence, and a divine commission, "but because ye did eat of the loaves and were filled." From this He proceeds at once to that other Bread, just as, with the woman of Samaria, to that other Water (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#009">Joh 4:9-15</A>). We should have supposed all that follows to have been delivered by the wayside, or wherever they happened first to meet. But from <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#059">Joh 6:59</A> we gather that they had probably met about the door of the synagogue--"for that was the day in which they assembled in their synagogues" [LIGHTFOOT]--and that on being asked, at the close of the service, if He had any word of exhortation to the people, He had taken the two breads, the perishing and the living bread, for the subject of His profound and extraordinary discourse.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_027">joh 6:27</A></FONT></span></p>which the Son of man--taking that title of Himself which denoted His incarnate life. 
<p>
<p>shall give unto you--in the sense of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#051">Joh 6:51</A>. 
<p>
<p>him hath God the Father sealed--marked out and authenticated for that transcendent office, to impart to the world the bread of an everlasting life, and this in the character of "the Son of man."
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#028">John 6:28</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_028">joh 6:28</A></FONT></span></p>What shall we do . . . the works of God--such works as God will approve. Different answers may be given to such a question, according to the spirit which prompts the inquiry. (See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#006">Hos 6:6-8</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#012">Luk 3:12-14</A>). Here our Lord, knowing whom He had to deal with, shapes His reply accordingly.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#029">John 6:29</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_029">joh 6:29</A></FONT></span></p>This is the work of God--That lies at the threshold of all acceptable obedience, being not only the prerequisite to it, but the proper spring of it--in that sense, the work of works, emphatically "the work of God."
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#030">John 6:30</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_030">joh 6:30</A></FONT></span></p>What sign showest thou, &amp;c.--But how could they ask "a sign," when many of them scarce a day before had witnessed such a "sign" as had never till then been vouchsafed to men; when after witnessing it, they could hardly be restrained from making Him a king; when they followed Him from the one side of the lake to the other; and when, in the opening words of this very discourse, He had chided them for seeking Him, "not because they saw the signs," but for the loaves? The truth seems to be that they were confounded by the novel claims which our Lord had just advanced. In proposing to make Him a king, it was for far other purposes than dispensing to the world the bread of an everlasting life; and when He seemed to raise His claims even higher still, by representing it as the grand "work of God," that they should believe on Himself as His Sent One, they saw very clearly that He was making a demand upon them beyond anything they were prepared to accord to Him, and beyond all that man had ever before made. Hence their question, "What dost Thou work?"
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#031">John 6:31</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_031">joh 6:31</A></FONT></span></p>Our fathers did eat manna, &amp;c.--insinuating the inferiority of Christ's miracle of the loaves to those of Moses: "When Moses claimed the confidence of the fathers, 'he gave them bread from heaven to eat'--not for a few thousands, but for millions, and not once only, but daily throughout their wilderness journey."
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#032">John 6:32</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_032">joh 6:32</A></FONT></span></p>Moses gave you not, &amp;c.--"It was not Moses that gave you the manna, and even it was but from the lower heavens; 'but My Father giveth you the true bread,' and that 'from heaven.'"
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#033">John 6:33</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_033">joh 6:33</A></FONT></span></p>For the bread of God is he, &amp;c.--This verse is perhaps best left in its own transparent grandeur--holding up the Bread Itself as divine, spiritual, and eternal; its ordained Fountain and essential Substance, "Him who came down from heaven to give it" (that Eternal Life which was with the Father and was manifested unto us, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#002">Jo1 1:2</A>); and its designed objects, "the world."
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#034">John 6:34</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_034">joh 6:34</A></FONT></span></p>Lord, evermore give us this bread--speaking now with a certain reverence (as at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#025">Joh 6:25</A>), the perpetuity of the manna floating perhaps in their minds, and much like the Samaritan woman, when her eyes were but half opened, "Sir, give Me this water," &amp;c. (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#015">Joh 4:15</A>).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_035">joh 6:35</A></FONT></span></p>I am the bread of life--Henceforth the discourse is all in the first person, "I," "Me," which occur in one form or other, as STIER reckons, thirty-five times. 
<p>
<p>he that cometh to me--to obtain what the soul craves, and as the only all-sufficient and ordained source of supply. 
<p>
<p>hunger . . . thirst--shall have conscious and abiding satisfaction.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_036">joh 6:36</A></FONT></span></p>But . . . ye have seen me, and believe not--seen Him not in His mere bodily presence, but in all the majesty of His life, His teaching, His works.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#037">John 6:37</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_037">joh 6:37</A></FONT></span></p>All that, &amp;c.--This comprehensive and very grand passage is expressed with a peculiar artistic precision. The opening general statement (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#037">Joh 6:37</A>) consists of two members: (1) "ALL THAT THE FATHER GIVETH ME SHALL COME TO ME"--that is, "Though ye, as I told you, have no faith in Me, My errand into the world shall in no wise be defeated; for all that the Father giveth Me shall infallibly come to Me." Observe, what is given Him by the Father is expressed in the singular number and neuter gender--literally, "everything"; while those who come to Him are put in the masculine gender and singular number--"every one." The whole mass, so to speak, is gifted by the Father to the Son as a unity, which the Son evolves, one by one, in the execution of His trust. So <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#002">Joh 17:2</A>, "that He should give eternal life to all that which Thou hast given Him" [BENGEL]. This "shall" expresses the glorious certainty of it, the Father being pledged to see to it that the gift be no empty mockery. (2) "AND HIM THAT COMETH TO MEI WILL IN NO WISE CAST OUT." As the former was the divine, this is just the human side of the same thing. True, the "coming" ones of the second clause are just the "given" ones of the first. But had our Lord merely said, "When those that have been given Me of My Father shall come to Me, I will receive them"--besides being very flat, the impression conveyed would have been quite different, sounding as if there were no other laws in operation, in the movement of sinners to Christ, but such as are wholly divine and inscrutable to us; whereas, though He does speak of it as a sublime certainty which men's refusals cannot frustrate, He speaks of that certainty as taking effect only by men's voluntary advances to Him and acceptance of Him--"Him that cometh to Me," "whosoever will," throwing the door wide open. Only it is not the simply willing, but the actually coming, whom He will not cast out; for the word here employed usually denotes arrival, as distinguished from the ordinary word, which rather expresses the act of coming (see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#042">Joh 8:42</A>, Greek), [WEBSTER and WILKINSON]. "In no wise" is an emphatic negative, to meet the fears of the timid (as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#027">Rev 21:27</A>, to meet the presumption of the hardened). These, then, being the two members of the general opening statement, what follows is meant to take in both,
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#038">John 6:38</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_038">joh 6:38</A></FONT></span></p>For I came down from heaven not to do Mine own will--to play an independent part. 
<p>
<p>but--in respect to both the foregoing things, the divine and the human side of salvation. 
<p>
<p>the will of Him that sent Me--What this twofold will of Him that sent Him is, we are next sublimely told (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#039">Joh 6:39-40</A>):
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#039">John 6:39</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_039">joh 6:39</A></FONT></span></p>And this--in the first place. 
<p>
<p>is the will of Him that sent me, that of all--everything. 
<p>
<p>which He hath given Me--(taking up the identical words of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#037">Joh 6:37</A>). 
<p>
<p>I should lose nothing, but should raise it up at the last day--The meaning is not, of course, that He is charged to keep the objects entrusted to Him as He received them, so as they should merely suffer nothing in His hands. For as they were just "perishing" sinners of Adam's family, to let "nothing" of such "be lost," but "raise them up at the last day," must involve, first, giving His flesh for them (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#051">Joh 6:51</A>), that they "might not perish, but have everlasting life"; and then, after "keeping them from falling," raising their sleeping dust in incorruption and glory, and presenting them, body and soul, perfect and entire, wanting nothing, to Him who gave them to Him, saying, "Behold I and the children which God hath given Me." So much for the first will of Him that sent Him, the divine side of man's salvation, whose every stage and movement is inscrutable to us, but infallibly certain.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#040">John 6:40</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_040">joh 6:40</A></FONT></span></p>And this--in the second place. 
<p>
<p>is the will of Him that sent Me, that every one which seeth the Son and believeth on Him--seeing the Son believeth on Him. 
<p>
<p>may have everlasting life, and I will raise him up at the last day--This is the human side of the same thing as in the foregoing verse, and answering to "Him that cometh unto Me I will in no wise cast out"; that is, I have it expressly in charge that everyone that so "beholdeth" (so vieweth) the Son as to believe on Him shall have everlasting life; and, that none of Him be lost, "I will raise him up at the last day." (See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#054">Joh 6:54</A>).

Here, for the first time in this high discourse, our Lord explicitly introduces His sacrificial death--for only rationalists can doubt this not only as that which constitutes Him the Bread of life to men, but as THAT very element IN HIM WHICH POSSESSES THE LIFE-GIVING VIRTUE.--"From this time we hear no more (in this discourse) of "Bread"; this figure is dropped, and the reality takes its place" [STIER]. The words "I will give" may be compared with the words of institution at the Supper, "This is My body which is given for you" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#019">Luk 22:19</A>), or in Paul's report of it, "broken for you" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#024">Co1 11:24</A>).

They asked how it was possible to eat His flesh. He answers, with great solemnity, "It is indispensable." Yet even here a thoughtful hearer might find something to temper the harshness. He says they must not only "eat His flesh" but "drink His blood," which could not but suggest the idea of His death--implied in the separation of one's flesh from his blood. And as He had already hinted that it was to be something very different from a natural death, saying, "My flesh I will give for the life of the world" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#051">Joh 6:51</A>), it must have been pretty plain to candid hearers that He meant something above the gross idea which the bare terms expressed. And farther, when He added that they "had no life in them unless they thus ate and drank," it was impossible they should think He meant that the temporal life they were then living was dependent on their eating and drinking, in this gross sense, His flesh and blood. Yet the whole statement was certainly confounding, and beyond doubt was meant to be so. Our Lord had told them that in spite of all they had "seen" in Him, they "did not believe" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#036">Joh 6:36</A>). For their conviction therefore he does not here lay Himself out; but having the ear not only of them but of the more candid and thoughtful in the crowded synagogue, and the miracle of the loaves having led up to the most exalted of all views of His Person and Office, He takes advantage of their very difficulties and objections to announce, for all time, those most profound truths which are here expressed, regardless of the disgust of the unteachable, and the prejudices even of the most sincere, which His language would seem only designed to deepen. The truth really conveyed here is no other than that expressed in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#051">Joh 6:51</A>, though in more emphatic terms--that He Himself, in the virtue of His sacrificial death, is the spiritual and eternal life of men; and that unless men voluntarily appropriate to themselves this death, in its sacrificial virtue, so as to become the very life and nourishment of their inner man, they have no spiritual and eternal life at all. Not as if His death were the only thing of value, but it is what gives all else in Christ's Incarnate Person, Life, and Office, their whole value to us sinners.

<p>and I will raise him up at the last day--For the fourth time this is repeated (see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#039">Joh 6:39-40</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#044">Joh 6:44</A>) --showing most clearly that the "eternal life" which such a man "hath" cannot be the same with the future resurrection life from which it is carefully distinguished each time, but a life communicated here below immediately on believing (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#036">Joh 3:36</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#024">Joh 5:24-25</A>); and giving to the resurrection of the body as that which consummates the redemption of the entire man, a prominence which in the current theology, it is to be feared, it has seldom had.

(It should be added that although this discourse has nothing to do with the Sacrament of the Supper, the Sacrament has everything to do with it, as the visible embodiment of these figures, and, to the believing partaker, a real, yea, and the most lively and affecting participation of His flesh and blood, and nourishment thereby of the spiritual and eternal life, here below).

<p>
<p>Lord, to whom, &amp;c.--that is, "We cannot deny that we have been staggered as well as they, and seeing so many go away who, as we thought, might have been retained by teaching a little less hard to take in, our own endurance has been severely tried, nor have we been able to stop short of the question, Shall we follow the rest, and give it up? But when it came to this, our light returned, and our hearts were reassured. For as soon as we thought of going away, there arose upon us that awful question, 'TO WHOM shall we go?' To the lifeless formalism and wretched traditions of the elders? to the gods many and lords many of the heathen around us? or to blank unbelief? Nay, Lord, we are shut up. They have none of that 'ETERNAL LIFE' to offer us whereof Thou hast been discoursing, in words rich and ravishing as well as in words staggering to human wisdom. That life we cannot want; that life we have learnt to crave as a necessity of the deeper nature which Thou hast awakened: 'the words of that eternal life' (the authority to reveal it and the power to confer it). Thou hast: Therefore will we stay with Thee--we must."

Peter seems to have added this not merely--probably not so much--as an assurance to his Lord of his heart's belief in Him, as for the purpose of fortifying himself and his faithful brethren against that recoil from his Lord's harsh statements which he was probably struggling against with difficulty at that moment. Note.--There are seasons when one's faith is tried to the utmost, particularly by speculative difficulties; the spiritual eye then swims, and all truth seems ready to depart from us. At such seasons, a clear perception that to abandon the faith of Christ is to face black desolation, ruin and death; and on recoiling from this, to be able to fall back, not merely on first principles and immovable foundations, but on personal experience of a Living Lord in whom all truth is wrapt up and made flesh for our very benefit--this is a relief unspeakable. Under that blessed Wing taking shelter, until we are again fit to grapple with the questions that have staggered us, we at length either find our way through them, or attain to a calm satisfaction in the discovery that they lie beyond the limits of present apprehension.
