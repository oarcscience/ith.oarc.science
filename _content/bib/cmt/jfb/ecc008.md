### [Ecclesiastes Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#001)

[Ecclesiastes 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ecc 8:1</span></span>

(Ecc. 8:1-17)

Praise of true wisdom continued ([Ecc
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#011), &c.). "Who" is to be accounted
"equal to the wise man? . . . Who (like him) knoweth the interpretation"
of God's providences (for example, [Ecc
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#008), [Ecc
7:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#013)), and God's word (for example,
see on [Ecc 7:29](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#029); [Pro
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#006))?

face to shine-- ([Ecc 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#014); [Act
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#015)). A sunny countenance, the
reflection of a tranquil conscience and serene mind. Communion with God
gives it ([Exo 34:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#029)).

boldness--austerity.

changed--into a benign expression by true wisdom (religion) ([Jam
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#017)). MAURER translates, "The shining
(brightness) of his face is doubled," arguing that the Hebrew noun for
"boldness" is never used in a bad sense ([Pro
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#018)). Or as Margin, "strength" ([Ecc
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#019); [Isa
40:31](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#031); [Co2
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#018)). But the adjective is used in a
bad sense ([Deu 28:50](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#050)).

[Ecclesiastes 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ecc 8:2</span></span>

the king's--Jehovah, peculiarly the king of Israel in the theocracy;
[Ecc 8:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#003), prove it is not the
earthly king who is meant.

the oath of God--the covenant which God made with Abraham and renewed
with David; Solomon remembered [Psa
89:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#035), "I have sworn," &c. ([Psa
89:36](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#036)), and the penalties if David's
children should forsake it ([Psa
89:30-32](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#030)); inflicted on Solomon
himself; yet God not "utterly" forsaking him ([Psa
89:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#033)).

[Ecclesiastes 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ecc 8:3</span></span>

hasty--rather, "Be not terror-struck so as to go out of His sight."
Slavishly "terror-struck" is characteristic of the sinner's feeling
toward God; he vainly tries to flee out of His sight ([Psa
139:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#007)); opposed to the "shining face"
of filial confidence ([Ecc 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#001); [Joh
8:33-36](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#033); [Rom
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#002); [Jo1
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#018)).

stand not--persist not.

for he doeth--God inflicts what punishment He pleases on persisting
sinners ([Job 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#013); [Psa
115:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#003)). True of none save God.

[Ecclesiastes 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ecc 8:4</span></span>

God's very "word" is "power." So the gospel word ([Rom
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#016); [Heb
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#012)).

who may say, &c.-- ([Job 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#012); [Job
33:13](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#013); [Isa
45:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#009); [Dan
4:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#035)). Scripture does not ascribe such
arbitrary power to earthly kings.

[Ecclesiastes 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ecc 8:5</span></span>

feel--experience.

time--the neglect of the right "times" causes much of the sinful folly
of the spiritually unwise ([Ecc
3:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#001)).

judgment--the right manner \[HOLDEN\]. But as God's future "judgment" is
connected with the "time for every purpose" in [Ecc
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#017), so it is here. The punishment of
persisting sinners ([Ecc 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#003)) suggests
it. The wise man realizes the fact, that as there is a fit "time" for
every purpose, so for the "judgment." This thought cheers him in
adversity ([Ecc 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#014); [Ecc
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#001)).

[Ecclesiastes 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ecc 8:6</span></span>

therefore the misery, &c.--because the foolish sinner does not think of
the right "times" and the "judgment."

[Ecclesiastes 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ecc 8:7</span></span>

he--the sinner, by neglecting times (for example, "the accepted time,
and the day of salvation, [Co2 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#002)),
is taken by surprise by the judgment ([Ecc
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#022); [Ecc
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#012); [Ecc
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#012)). The godly wise observe the due
times of things ([Ecc 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#001)), and so,
looking for the judgment, are not taken by surprise, though not knowing
the precise "when" ([Th1 5:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#002)); they
"know the time" to all saving purposes ([Rom
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#011)).

[Ecclesiastes 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ecc 8:8</span></span>

spirit--"breath of life" ([Ecc 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#019)),
as the words following require. Not "wind," as WEISS thinks ([Pro
30:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#004)). This verse naturally follows
the subject of "times" and "judgment" ([Ecc
8:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#006)).

discharge--alluding to the liability to military service of all above
twenty years old ([Num 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#003)), yet many
were exempted ([Deu 20:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#005)). But in
that war (death) there is no exemption.

those . . . given to--literally, the master of it. Wickedness can get
money for the sinner, but cannot deliver him from the death, temporal
and eternal, which is its penalty ([Isa
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#015), [Isa
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#018)).

[Ecclesiastes 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ecc 8:9</span></span>

his own hurt--The tyrannical ruler "hurts" not merely his subjects, but
himself; so Rehoboam (1Ki. 12:1-33); but the "time" of "hurt" chiefly
refers to eternal ruin, incurred by "wickedness," at "the day of death"
([Ecc 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#008)), and the "time" of
"judgment" ([Ecc 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#006); [Pro
8:36](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#036)).

[Ecclesiastes 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ecc 8:10</span></span>

the wicked--namely, rulers ([Ecc 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#009)).

buried--with funeral pomp by man, though little meriting it ([Jer
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#019)); but this only formed the more
awful contrast to their death, temporal and eternal, inflicted by God
([Luk 16:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#022)).

come and gone from the place of the holy--went to and came from the
place of judicature, where they sat as God's representatives ([Psa
82:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#001)), with pomp \[HOLDEN\]. WEISS
translates, "Buried and gone (utterly), even from the holy place they
departed." As Joab, by Solomon's command, was sent to the grave from the
"holy place" in the temple, which was not a sanctuary to murderers ([Exo
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#014); [Kg1
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#028), [Kg1
2:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#031)). The use of the very word "bury"
there makes this view likely; still "who had come and gone" may be
retained. Joab came to the altar, but had to go from it; so the "wicked
rulers" ([Ecc 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#009)) (including high
priests) came to, and went from, the temple, on occasions of solemn
worship, but did not thereby escape their doom.

forgotten-- ([Pro 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#007)).

[Ecclesiastes 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ecc 8:11</span></span>

The reason why the wicked persevere in sin: God's delay in judgment
([Mat 24:48-51](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#048); [Pe2
3:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#008)). "They see not the smoke of the
pit, therefore they dread not the fire" \[SOUTH\], ([Psa
55:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#019)). Joab's escape from the
punishment of his murder of Abner, so far from "leading him to
repentance," as it ought ([Rom 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#004)),
led him to the additional murder of Amasa.

[Ecclesiastes 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ecc 8:12</span></span>

He says this, lest the sinner should abuse the statement ([Ecc
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#015)), "A wicked man prolongeth his
life."

before him--literally, "at His presence"; reverently serve Him,
realizing His continual presence.

[Ecclesiastes 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ecc 8:13</span></span>

neither shall he prolong--not a contradiction to [Ecc
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#012). The "prolonging" of his days
there is only seeming, not real. Taking into account his eternal
existence, his present days, however seemingly long, are really short.
God's delay ([Ecc 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#011)) exists only in
man's short-sighted view. It gives scope to the sinner to repent, or
else to fill up his full measure of guilt; and so, in either case, tends
to the final vindication of God's ways. It gives exercise to the faith,
patience, and perseverance of saints.

shadow-- ([Ecc 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#012); [Job
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#009)).

[Ecclesiastes 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ecc 8:14</span></span>

An objection is here started (entertained by Solomon in his apostasy),
as in [Ecc 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#016); [Ecc
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#015), to the truth of retributive
justice, from the fact of the just and the wicked not now receiving
always according to their respective deserts; a cavil, which would seem
the more weighty to men living under the Mosaic covenant of temporal
sanctions. The objector adds, as Solomon had said, that the worldling's
pursuits are "vanity" ([Ecc 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#010)), "I
say (not 'said') this also is vanity. Then I commend mirth," &c.
\[HOLDEN\]. [Ecc 8:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#014) may, however,
be explained as teaching a cheerful, thankful use of God's gifts "under
the sun," that is, not making them the chief good, as sensualists do,
which [Ecc 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#002); [Ecc
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#002), forbid; but in "the fear of God,"
as [Ecc 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#012); [Ecc
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#018); [Ecc
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#018); [Ecc
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#007), opposed to the abstinence of the
self-righteous ascetic ([Ecc 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#016)),
and of the miser ([Ecc 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#017)).

[Ecclesiastes 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ecc 8:15</span></span>

no better thing, &c.--namely, for the "just" man, whose chief good is
religion, not for the worldly.

abide--Hebrew, "adhere"; not for ever, but it is the only sure good to
be enjoyed from earthly labors (equivalent to "of his labor the days of
his life"). Still, the language resembles the skeptical precept ([Co1
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#032)), introduced only to be refuted;
and "abide" is too strong language, perhaps, for a religious man to
apply to "eating" and "mirth."

[Ecclesiastes 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ecc 8:16</span></span>

Reply to [Ecc 8:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#014). When I applied
myself to observe man's toils after happiness (some of them so incessant
as not to allow sufficient time for "sleep"), then ([Ecc
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#017), the apodosis) I saw that man
cannot find out (the reason of) God's inscrutable dealings with the
"just" and with the "wicked" here ([Ecc
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#014); [Ecc
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#011); [Job
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#009); [Rom
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#033)); his duty is to acquiesce in
them as good, because they are God's, though he sees not all the reasons
for them ([Psa 73:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#016)). It is enough to
know "the righteous are in God's hand" ([Ecc
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#001)). "Over wise" ([Ecc
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#016)); that is, Speculations above
what is written are vain.
