### [Psalms Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#001)

[Psalms 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 10:1</span></span>

The Psalmist mourns God's apparent indifference to his troubles, which
are aggravated by the successful malice, blasphemy, pride, deceit, and
profanity of the wicked. On the just and discriminating providence of
God he relies for the destruction of their false security, and the
defense of the needy. (Psa. 10:1-18)

These are, of course, figurative terms (compare [Psa
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#006); [Psa
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#001), &c.).

hidest--Supply "thine eyes" or "face."

[Psalms 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 10:2</span></span>

Literally, "In pride of the wicked they (the poor or humble, [Psa
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#017); [Psa
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#005)) shall be taken in the devices
they (the proud) have imagined."

[Psalms 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 10:3</span></span>

heart's--or, "soul's."

desire--that is, his success in evil.

and blesseth, &c.--he (the wicked) blesseth the covetous, he despiseth
the Lord.

[Psalms 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 10:4</span></span>

The face expresses the self-conceit, whose fruit is practical atheism
([Psa 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001)).

[Psalms 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 10:5</span></span>

Such is his confidence in the permanence of his way or course of life,
that he disregards God's providential government (out of sight, because
he will not look, [Isa 26:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#011)), sneers
at his enemies, and boasts perpetual freedom from evil.

[Psalms 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 10:7</span></span>

The malignity and deceit ([Psa 140:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#003))
of such are followed by acts combining cunning, fraud, and violence
(compare [Pro 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#011), [Pro
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#018)), aptly illustrated by the habits
of the lion, and of hunters taking their prey. "Poor," in [Psa
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#008), [Psa
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#010), [Psa
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#014), represents a word peculiar to
this Psalm, meaning the sad or sorrowful; in [Psa
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#009), as usual, it means the pious or
meek sufferer.

[Psalms 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 10:8</span></span>

eyes . . . privily--He watches with half-closed eyes, appearing not to
see.

[Psalms 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 10:10</span></span>

croucheth--as a lion gathers himself into as small compass as possible
to make the greater spring.

fall by his strong ones--The figure of the lion is dropped, and this
phrase means the accomplices of the chief or leading wicked man.

[Psalms 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 10:11</span></span>

As before, such conduct implies disbelief or disregard of God's
government.

[Psalms 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 10:12</span></span>

(Compare [Psa 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#019); [Psa
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#007)).

the humble--(Compare [Psa 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#017), and
Margin.)

lift up thine hand--exert thy power.

[Psalms 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 10:13</span></span>

It is in vain to suppose God will overlook sin, however forbearing; for
He carefully examines or beholds all wickedness, and will mark it by His
providential (Thine hand) punishment.

[Psalms 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 10:14</span></span>

mischief and spite--provocation and trouble of the sufferer (compare
[Psa 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#007); [Psa
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#014)).

committeth--or, "leaves (his burden) on Thee."

[Psalms 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 10:15</span></span>

arm--power.

till thou find none--So far from not requiting ([Psa
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#011), [Psa
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#013)), God will utterly destroy the
wicked and his deeds ([Psa 9:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#005); [Psa
34:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#016); [Psa
37:36](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#036)).

[Psalms 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 10:16</span></span>

God reigns. The wicked, if for a time successful, shall be cut off. He
hears and confirms the hearts of His suffering people ([Psa
112:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#007)), executes justice for the
feeble, and represses the pride and violence of conceited, though frail,
men (compare [Psa 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#016)).
