### [Mark Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#001)

[Mark 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 16:1</span></span>

ANGELIC ANNOUNCEMENT TO THE WOMEN ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE WEEK, THAT
CHRIST IS RISEN--HIS APPEARANCES AFTER HIS RESURRECTION--HIS
ASCENSION--TRIUMPHANT PROCLAMATION OF HIS GOSPEL. ( = [Mat
28:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#001), [Mat
28:16-20](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#016); Luke 24:1-51; [Joh
20:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#001), John 20:11-29). (Mark 16:1-20)

when the sabbath was past--that is, at sunset of our Saturday.

Mary Magdalene--(See on [Luk 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#002)).

Mary the mother of James--James the Less (see [Mar
15:40](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#040)).

and Salome--the mother of Zebedee's sons (compare [Mar
15:40](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#040) with [Mat
27:56](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#056)).

had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him--The word
is simply "bought." But our translators are perhaps right in rendering
it here "had bought," since it would appear, from [Luk
23:56](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#056), that they had purchased them
immediately after the Crucifixion, on the Friday evening, during the
short interval that remained to them before sunset, when the sabbath
rest began; and that they had only deferred using them to anoint the
body till the sabbath rest should be over. On this "anointing," see on
[Joh 19:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#040).

[Mark 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mar 16:2</span></span>

very early in the morning--(See on [Mat
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#001)).

the first day of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of
the sun--not quite literally, but "at earliest dawn"; according to a way
of speaking not uncommon, and occurring sometimes in the Old Testament.
Thus our Lord rose on the third day; having lain in the grave part of
Friday, the whole of Saturday, and part of the following First day.

[Mark 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mar 16:3</span></span>

they said among themselves--as they were approaching the sacred spot.

Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre? . . .
for it was very great--On reaching it they find their difficulty
gone--the stone already rolled away by an unseen hand. And are there no
others who, when advancing to duty in the face of appalling
difficulties, find their stone also rolled away?

[Mark 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mar 16:5</span></span>

entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man--In [Mat
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#002) he is called "the angel of the
Lord"; but here he is described as he appeared to the eye, in the bloom
of a life that knows no decay. In Matthew he is represented as sitting
on the stone outside the sepulchre; but since even there he says, "Come,
see the place where the Lord lay" ([Mat
28:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#006)), he seems, as ALFORD says, to
have gone in with them from without; only awaiting their arrival to
accompany them into the hallowed spot, and instruct them about it.

sitting on the right side--having respect to the position in which His
Lord had lain there. This trait is peculiar to Mark; but compare [Luk
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#011).

clothed in a long white garment--On its length, see [Isa
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#001); and on its whiteness, see on [Mat
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#003).

and they were affrighted.

[Mark 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mar 16:6</span></span>

he saith unto them, Be not affrighted--a stronger word than "Fear not"
in Matthew ([Mat 28:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#005)).

Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified!--"the Nazarene, the
Crucified,"

he is risen; he is not here--(See on [Luk
24:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#005)).

behold the place where they laid him--(See on [Mat
28:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#006)).

[Mark 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mar 16:7</span></span>

But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter--This Second Gospel, being
drawn up--as all the earliest tradition states--under the eye of Peter,
or from materials chiefly furnished by him, there is something deeply
affecting in the preservation of this little phrase by Mark alone.

that he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him, as he
said unto you--(See on [Mat 28:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#007)).

[Mark 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mar 16:8</span></span>

And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre: for they
trembled and were amazed--"for tremor and amazement seized them."

neither said they anything to any man; for they were afraid--How
intensely natural and simple is this!

Appearances of Jesus after His Resurrection ([Mar
16:9-18](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#009)).

[Mark 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mar 16:9</span></span>

Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he appeared
first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils--There is
some difficulty here, and different ways of removing it have been
adopted. She had gone with the other women to the sepulchre ([Mar
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#001)), parting from them, perhaps,
before their interview with the angel, and on finding Peter and John she
had come with them back to the spot; and it was at this second visit, it
would seem, that Jesus appeared to this Mary, as detailed in [Joh
20:11-18](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#011). To a woman was this honor
given to be the first that saw the risen Redeemer, and that woman was
NOT his virgin-mother.

[Mark 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mar 16:11</span></span>

they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her,
believed not--This, which is once and again repeated of them all, is
most important in its bearing on their subsequent testimony to His
resurrection at the risk of life itself.

[Mark 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mar 16:12</span></span>

After that he appeared in another form--(compare [Luk
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#016)).

unto two of them as they walked, and went into the country--The
reference here, of course, is to His manifestation to the two disciples
going to Emmaus, so exquisitely told by the Third Evangelist (see on
[Luk 24:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#013), &c.).

[Mark 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mar 16:13</span></span>

they went and told it unto the residue: neither believed they them, &c.

[Mark 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mar 16:15</span></span>

he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the Gospel to
every creature--See on [Joh 20:19-23](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#019)
and [Luk 24:36-49](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#036).

[Mark 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mar 16:16</span></span>

He that believeth and is baptized--Baptism is here put for the external
signature of the inner faith of the heart, just as "confessing with the
mouth" is in [Rom 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#010); and there
also as here this outward manifestation, once mentioned as the proper
fruit of faith, is not repeated in what follows ([Rom
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#011)).

shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned--These awful
issues of the reception or rejection of the Gospel, though often
recorded in other connections, are given in this connection only by
Mark.

[Mark 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mar 16:17</span></span>

these signs shall follow them that believe . . . They shall take up
serpents--These two verses also are peculiar to Mark.

The Ascension and Triumphant Proclamation of the Gospel Thereafter ([Mar
16:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#019)).

[Mark 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mar 16:19</span></span>

So then after the Lord--an epithet applied to Jesus by this Evangelist
only in [Mar 16:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#019), when He comes
to His glorious Ascension and its subsequent fruits. It is most frequent
in Luke.

had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven--See on [Luk
24:50-51](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#050).

and sat on the right hand of God--This great truth is here only related
as a fact in the Gospel history. In that exalted attitude He appeared to
Stephen ([Act 7:55-56](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#055)); and it is
thereafter perpetually referred to as His proper condition in glory.

[Mark 16:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mar 16:20</span></span>

they went forth, and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them,
and confirming the word with signs following. Amen--We have in this
closing verse a most important link of connection with the Acts of the
Apostles, where He who directed all the movements of the infant Church
is perpetually styled "THE LORD"; thus illustrating His own promise for
the rounding and building up of the Church, "LO, I AM WITH YOU alway!"
