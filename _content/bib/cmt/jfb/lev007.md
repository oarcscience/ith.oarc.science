### [Leviticus Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#001)

[Leviticus 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 7:1</span></span>

THE LAW OF THE TRESPASS OFFERING. (Lev. 7:1-27)

Likewise this is the law of the trespass offering--This chapter is a
continuation of the laws that were to regulate the duty of the priests
respecting the trespass offerings. The same regulations obtained in this
case as in the burnt offerings--part was to be consumed on the altar,
while the other part was a perquisite of the priests--some fell
exclusively to the officiating minister, and was the fee for his
services; others were the common share of all the priestly order, who
lived upon them as their provision, and whose meetings at a common table
would tend to promote brotherly harmony and friendship.

[Leviticus 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">lev 7:8</span></span>

the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he
hath offered--All the flesh and the fat of the burnt offerings being
consumed, nothing remained to the priest but the skin. It has been
thought that this was a patriarchal usage, incorporated with the Mosaic
law, and that the right of the sacrificer to the skin of the victim was
transmitted from the example of Adam (see on [Gen
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#021)).

[Leviticus 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">lev 7:11</span></span>

this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings--Besides the usual
accompaniments of other sacrifices, leavened bread was offered with the
peace offerings, as a thanksgiving, such bread being common at feasts.

[Leviticus 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">lev 7:15</span></span>

the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings . . . shall be eaten
the same day that it is offered--The flesh of the sacrifices was eaten
on the day of the offering or on the day following. But if any part of
it remained till the third day, it was, instead of being made use of, to
be burned with fire. In the East, butcher-meat is generally eaten the
day it is killed, and it is rarely kept a second day, so that as a
prohibition was issued against any of the flesh in the peace offerings
being used on the third day, it has been thought, not without reason,
that this injunction must have been given to prevent a superstitious
notion arising that there was some virtue or holiness belonging to it.

[Leviticus 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">lev 7:18</span></span>

if any of the flesh of the sacrifice . . . be eaten at all on the third
day, it shall not be accepted, neither . . . imputed--The sacrifice will
not be acceptable to God nor profitable to him that offers it.

[Leviticus 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">lev 7:20</span></span>

cut off from his people--that is, excluded from the privileges of an
Israelite--lie under a sentence of excommunication.

[Leviticus 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">lev 7:21</span></span>

abominable unclean thing--Some copies of the Bible read, "any reptile."

[Leviticus 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">lev 7:22</span></span>

Ye shall eat no manner of fat--(See on [Lev
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#017)).

[Leviticus 7:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">lev 7:29</span></span>

THE PRIESTS' PORTION. ([Lev 7:28-38](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#028))

He that offereth the sacrifice of his peace offerings unto the Lord--In
order to show that the sacrifice was voluntary, the offerer was required
to bring it with his own hands to the priest. The breast having been
waved to and fro in a solemn manner as devoted to God, was given to the
priests; it was assigned to the use of their order generally, but the
right shoulder was the perquisite of the officiating priest.

[Leviticus 7:35](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">lev 7:35</span></span>

This is the portion of the anointing of Aaron--These verses contain a
general summing up of the laws which regulate the privileges and duties
of the priests. The word "anointing" is often used as synonymous with
"office" or "dignity." So that the "portion of the anointing of Aaron"
probably means the provision made for the maintenance of the high priest
and the numerous body of functionaries which composed the sacerdotal
order.

in the day when he presented them to minister unto the Lord, &c.--that
is, from the day they approached the Lord in the duties of their
ministry.
