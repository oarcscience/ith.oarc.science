### [Ezekiel Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#001)

[Ezekiel 29:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 29:2</span></span>

THE JUDGMENT ON EGYPT BY NEBUCHADNEZZAR; THOUGH ABOUT TO BE RESTORED
AFTER FORTY YEARS, IT WAS STILL TO BE IN A STATE OF DEGRADATION. (Eze.
29:1-21)

Pharaoh--a common name of all the kings of Egypt, meaning "the sun"; or,
as others say, a "crocodile," which was worshipped in parts of Egypt
(compare [Eze 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#003)). Hophra or Apries
was on the throne at this time. His reign began prosperously. He took
Gaza ([Jer 47:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#001)) and Zidon and made
himself master of PhÅ“nicia and Palestine, recovering much that was lost
to Egypt by the victory of Nebuchadnezzar at Carchemish ([Kg2
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#007); [Jer
46:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#002)), in the fourth year of Jehoiakim
\[WILKINSON, Ancient Egypt, 1.169\]. So proudly secure because of his
successes for twenty-five years did he feel, that he said not even a god
could deprive him of his kingdom \[HERODOTUS, 2.169\]. Hence the
appropriateness of the description of him in [Eze
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#003). No mere human sagacity could
have enabled Ezekiel to foresee Egypt's downfall in the height of its
prosperity. There are four divisions of these prophecies; the first in
the tenth year of Ezekiel's captivity; the last in the twelfth. Between
the first and second comes one of much later date, not having been given
till the twenty-seventh year ([Eze
29:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#017); [Eze
30:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#019)), but placed there as
appropriate to the subject matter. Pharaoh-hophra, or Apries, was
dethroned and strangled, and Amasis substituted as king, by
Nebuchadnezzar (compare [Jer 44:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#030)).
The Egyptian priests, from national vanity, made no mention to HERODOTUS
of the Egyptian loss of territory in Syria through Nebuchadnezzar, of
which JOSEPHUS tells us, but attributed the change in the succession
from Apries to Amasis solely to the Egyptian soldiery. The civil war
between the two rivals no doubt lasted several years, affording an
opportunity to Nebuchadnezzar of interfering and of elevating the
usurper Amasis, on condition of his becoming tributary to Babylon
\[WILKINSON\]. Compare [Jer 43:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#010),
and see on [Jer 43:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#013), for another
view of the grounds of interference of Nebuchadnezzar.

[Ezekiel 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 29:3</span></span>

dragon--Hebrew, tanim, any large aquatic animal, here the crocodile,
which on Roman coins is the emblem of Egypt.

lieth--restest proudly secure.

his rivers--the mouths, branches, and canals of the Nile, to which Egypt
owed its fertility.

[Ezekiel 29:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 29:4</span></span>

hooks in thy jaws-- ([Isa 37:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#029);
compare [Job 41:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#001)). Amasis was the
"hook." In the Assyrian sculptures prisoners are represented with a hook
in the underlip, and a cord from it held by the king.

cause . . . fish . . . stick unto . . . scales--Pharaoh, presuming on
his power as if he were God ([Eze
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#003), "I have made it"), wished to
stand in the stead of God as defender of the covenant-people, his motive
being, not love to them, but rivalry with Babylon. He raised the siege
of Jerusalem, but it was only for a time (compare [Eze
29:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#006); [Jer
37:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#005), [Jer
37:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#007)); ruin overtook not only them,
but himself. As the fish that clung to the horny scales of the
crocodile, the lord of the Nile, when he was caught, shared his fate, so
the adherents of Pharaoh, lord of Egypt, when he was overthrown by
Amasis, should share his fate.

[Ezekiel 29:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 29:5</span></span>

wilderness--captivity beyond thy kingdom. The expression is used perhaps
to imply retribution in kind. As Egypt pursued after Israel, saying,
"The wilderness hath shut them in" ([Exo
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#003)), so she herself shall be brought
into a wilderness state.

open fields--literally "face of the field."

not be brought together--As the crocodile is not, when caught, restored
to the river, so no remnant of thy routed army shall be brought
together, and rallied, after its defeat in the wilderness. Pharaoh led
an army against Cyrene in Africa, in support of Aricranes, who had been
stripped of his kingdom by the Cyrenians. The army perished and Egypt
rebelled against him \[JUNIUS\]. But the reference is mainly to the
defeat by Nebuchadnezzar.

beasts . . . fowls--hostile and savage men.

[Ezekiel 29:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 29:6</span></span>

staff of reed to . . . Israel--alluding to the reeds on the banks of the
Nile, which broke if one leaned upon them (see on [Eze
29:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#004); [Isa
36:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#006)). All Israel's dependence on
Egypt proved hurtful instead of beneficial ([Isa
30:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#001)).

[Ezekiel 29:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 29:7</span></span>

hand--or handle of the reed.

rend . . . shoulder--by the splinters on which the shoulder or arm would
fall, on the support failing the hand.

madest . . . loins . . . at a stand--that is, made them to be disabled.
MAURER somewhat similarly (referring to a kindred Arabic form), "Thou
hast stricken both their loins." FAIRBAIRN, not so well, "Thou lettest
all their loins stand," that is, by themselves, bereft of the support
which they looked for from thee.

[Ezekiel 29:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 29:8</span></span>

a sword--Nebuchadnezzar's army ([Eze
29:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#019)). Also Amasis and the Egyptian
revolters who after Pharaoh-hophra's discomfiture in Cyrene dethroned
and strangled him, having defeated him in a battle fought at Memphis
\[JUNIUS\].

[Ezekiel 29:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 29:9</span></span>

I am the Lord--in antithesis to the blasphemous boast repeated here from
[Eze 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#003), "The river is mine, and I
have made it."

[Ezekiel 29:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 29:10</span></span>

from the tower of Syene--GROTIUS translates, "from Migdol (a fortress
near Pelusium on the north of Suez) to Syene (in the farthest south)";
that is, from one end of Egypt to the other. So "from Migdol to Syene,"
[Eze 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#006), Margin. However, English
Version rightly refers Syene to Seveneh, that is, Sebennytus, in the
eastern delta of the Nile, the capital of the Lower Egyptian kings. The
Sebennyte Pharaohs, with the help of the Canaanites, who, as shepherds
or merchants, ranged the desert of Suez, extended their borders beyond
the narrow province east of the delta, to which they had been confined
by the Pharaohs of Upper Egypt. The defeated party, in derision, named
the Sebennyte or Lower Egyptians foreigners and shepherd-kings (a
shepherd being an abomination in Egypt, [Gen
46:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#034)). They were really a native
dynasty. Thus, in English Version, "Ethiopia" in the extreme south is
rightly contrasted with Sebennytus or Syene in the north.

[Ezekiel 29:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 29:11</span></span>

forty years--answering to the forty years in which the Israelites, their
former bondsmen, wandered in "the wilderness" (compare Note, see on [Eze
29:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#005)). JEROME remarks the number forty
is one often connected with affliction and judgment. The rains of the
flood in forty days brought destruction on the world. Moses, Elias, and
the Saviour fasted forty days. The interval between Egypt's overthrow by
Nebuchadnezzar and the deliverance by Cyrus, was about forty years. The
ideal forty years' wilderness state of social and political degradation,
rather than a literal non-passing of man or beast for that term, is
mainly intended (so [Eze 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#006); [Isa
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#002), [Isa
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#011)).

[Ezekiel 29:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 29:12</span></span>

As Israel passed through a term of wilderness discipline (compare [Eze
20:35](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#035), &c.), which was in its
essential features to be repeated again, so it was to be with Egypt
\[FAIRBAIRN\]. Some Egyptians were to be carried to Babylon, also many
"scattered" in Arabia and Ethiopia through fear; but mainly the
"scattering" was to be the dissipation of their power, even though the
people still remained in their own land.

[Ezekiel 29:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 29:13</span></span>

([Jer 46:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#026)).

[Ezekiel 29:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 29:14</span></span>

Pathros--the Thehaiti, or Upper Egypt, which had been especially
harassed by Nebuchadnezzar ([Nah 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#008),
[Nah 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#010)). The oldest part of Egypt
as to civilization and art. The Thebaid was anciently called "Egypt"
\[ARISTOTLE\]. Therefore it is called the "land of the Egyptians' birth"
(Margin, for "habitation").

base kingdom--Under Amasis it was made dependent on Babylon; humbled
still more under Cambyses; and though somewhat raised under the
Ptolemies, never has it regained its ancient pre-eminence.

[Ezekiel 29:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 29:16</span></span>

Egypt, when restored, shall be so circumscribed in power that it shall
be no longer an object of confidence to Israel, as formerly; for
example, as when, relying on it, Israel broke faith with Nebuchadnezzar
([Eze 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#013), [Eze
17:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#015)).

which bringeth their iniquity to remembrance, when they shall look after
them--rather, "while they (the Israelites) look to (or, turn after)
them" \[HENDERSON\]. Israel's looking to Egypt, rather than to God,
causes their iniquity (unfaithfulness to the covenant) to be remembered
by God.

[Ezekiel 29:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 29:17</span></span>

The departure from the chronological order occurs here only, among the
prophecies as to foreign nations, in order to secure greater unity of
subject.

[Ezekiel 29:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 29:18</span></span>

every head . . . bald, . . . shoulder . . . peeled--with carrying
baskets of earth and stones for the siege works.

no wages . . . for the service--that is, in proportion to it and the
time and labor which he expended on the siege of Tyre. Not that he
actually failed in the siege (JEROME expressly states, from Assyrian
histories, that Nebuchadnezzar succeeded); but, so much of the Tyrian
resources had been exhausted, or transported to her colonies in ships,
that little was left to compensate Nebuchadnezzar for his thirteen
year's siege.

[Ezekiel 29:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eze 29:19</span></span>

multitude--not as FAIRBAIRN, "store"; but, he shall take away a
multitude of captives out of Egypt. The success of Nebuchadnezzar is
implied in Tyre's receiving a king from Babylon, probably one of her
captives there, Merbal.

take her spoil . . . prey--literally, "spoil her spoil, prey her prey,"
that is, as she spoiled other nations, so shall she herself be a spoil
to Babylon.

[Ezekiel 29:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 29:20</span></span>

because they wrought for me--the Chaldeans, fulfilling My will as to
Tyre (compare [Jer 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#009)).

[Ezekiel 29:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eze 29:21</span></span>

In the evil only, not in the good, was Egypt to be parallel to Israel.
The very downfall of Egypt will be the signal for the rise of Israel,
because of God's covenant with the latter.

I cause the horn of . . . Israel to bud-- ([Psa
132:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#017)). I will cause its ancient
glory to revive: an earnest of Israel's full glory under Messiah, the
son of David ([Luk 1:69](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#069)). Even in
Babylon an earnest was given of this in Daniel ([Dan
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#002)) and Jeconiah ([Jer
52:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#031)).

I will give thee . . . opening of . . . mouth--When thy predictions
shall have come to pass, thy words henceforth shall be more heeded
(compare [Eze 24:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#027)).

Two distinct messages: (1) At [Eze
30:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#001), a repetition of Eze. 29:1-16,
with fuller details of lifelike distinctness. The date is probably not
long after that mentioned in [Eze
29:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#017), on the eve of Nebuchadnezzar's
march against Egypt after subjugating Tyre. (2) A vision relating
directly to Pharaoh and the overthrow of his kingdom; communicated at an
earlier date, the seventh of the first month of the eleventh year. Not a
year after the date in [Eze 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#001), and
three months before the taking of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar.
