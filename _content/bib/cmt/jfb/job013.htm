<p>
<p>all this--as to the dealings of Providence (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#003">Job 12:3</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#003">Job 13:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">job 13:3</A></FONT></span></p>Job wishes to plead his cause before God (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#034">Job 9:34-35</A>), as he is more and more convinced of the valueless character of his would-be "physicians" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#002">Job 16:2</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#004">Job 13:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">job 13:4</A></FONT></span></p>forgers of lies--literally, "artful twisters of vain speeches" [UMBREIT].
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#005">Job 13:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">job 13:5</A></FONT></span></p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#028">Pro 17:28</A>). The Arabs say, "The wise are dumb; silence is wisdom."
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#007">Job 13:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">job 13:7</A></FONT></span></p>deceitfully--use fallacies to vindicate God in His dealings; as if the end justified the means. Their "deceitfulness" for God, against Job, was that they asserted he was a sinner, because he was a sufferer.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#008">Job 13:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">job 13:8</A></FONT></span></p>accept his person--God's; that is, be partial for Him, as when a judge favors one party in a trial, because of personal considerations. 
<p>
<p>contend for God--namely, with fallacies and prepossessions against Job before judgment (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#031">Jdg 6:31</A>). Partiality can never please the impartial God, nor the goodness of the cause excuse the unfairness of the arguments.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#009">Job 13:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">job 13:9</A></FONT></span></p>Will the issue to you be good, when He searches out you and your arguments? Will you be regarded by Him as pure and disinterested? 
<p>
<p>mock-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#007">Gal 6:7</A>). Rather, "Can you deceive Him as one man?" &amp;c.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#010">Job 13:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">job 13:10</A></FONT></span></p>If ye do, though secretly, act partially. (See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#008">Job 13:8</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#001">Psa 82:1-2</A>). God can successfully vindicate His acts, and needs no fallacious argument of man.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#011">Job 13:11</A></p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">job 13:12</A></FONT></span></p>remembrances--"proverbial maxims," so called because well remembered. 
<p>
<p>like unto ashes--or, "parables of ashes"; the image of lightness and nothingness (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#020">Isa 44:20</A>). 
<p>
<p>bodies--rather, "entrenchments"; those of clay, as opposed to those of stone, are easy to be destroyed; so the proverbs, behind which they entrench themselves, will not shelter them when God shall appear to reprove them for their injustice to Job.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#013">Job 13:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">job 13:13</A></FONT></span></p>Job would wish to be spared their speeches, so as to speak out all his mind as to his wretchedness (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#014">Job 13:14</A>), happen what will.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#014">Job 13:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">job 13:14</A></FONT></span></p>A proverb for, "Why should I anxiously desire to save my life?" [EICHORN]. The image in the first clause is that of a wild beast, which in order to preserve his prey, carries it in his teeth. That in the second refers to men who hold in the hand what they want to keep secure.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#015">Job 13:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">job 13:15</A></FONT></span></p>in him--So the margin or keri, reads. But the textual reading or chetib is "not," which agrees best with the context, and other passages wherein he says he has no hope (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#011">Job 6:11</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#021">Job 7:21</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#020">Job 10:20</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#010">Job 19:10</A>). "Though He slay me, and I dare no more hope, yet I will maintain," &amp;c., that is, "I desire to vindicate myself before Him," as not a hypocrite [UMBREIT and NOYES].
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#016">Job 13:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">job 13:16</A></FONT></span></p>He--rather, "This also already speaks in my behalf (literally, 'for my saving acquittal') for an hypocrite would not wish to come before Him" (as I do) [UMBREIT]. (See last clause of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#015">Job 13:15</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#017">Job 13:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">job 13:17</A></FONT></span></p>my declaration--namely, that I wish to be permitted to justify myself immediately before God. 
<p>
<p>with your ears--that is, attentively.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#018">Job 13:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">job 13:18</A></FONT></span></p>ordered--implying a constant preparation for defense in his confidence of innocence.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#019">Job 13:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">job 13:19</A></FONT></span></p>if, &amp;c.--Rather, "Then would I hold my tongue and give up the ghost"; that is, if any one can contend with me and prove me false, I have no more to say. "I will be silent and die." Like our "I would stake my life on it" [UMBREIT].
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#020">Job 13:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">job 13:20</A></FONT></span></p>Address to God. 
<p>
<p>not hide--stand forth boldly to maintain my cause.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#021">Job 13:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">job 13:21</A></FONT></span></p>(See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#034">Job 9:34</A> and see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#010">Psa 39:10</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#022">Job 13:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">job 13:22</A></FONT></span></p>call--a challenge to the defendant to answer to the charges. 
<p>
<p>answer--the defense begun. 
<p>
<p>speak--as plaintiff. 
<p>
<p>answer--to the plea of the plaintiff. Expressions from a trial.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#023">Job 13:23</A></p>

Would that He would reckon them up! He then would see how much my calamities outnumber them. 
<p>
<p>sin?--singular, "I am unconscious of a single particular sin, much less many" [UMBREIT].
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#024">Job 13:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">job 13:24</A></FONT></span></p>hidest . . . face--a figure from the gloomy impression caused by the sudden clouding over of the sun. 
<p>
<p>enemy--God treated Job as an enemy who must be robbed of power by ceaseless sufferings (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#017">Job 7:17</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#021">Job 7:21</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#025">Job 13:25</A></p>

Job compares himself to a leaf already fallen, which the storm still chases hither and thither. 
<p>
<p>break--literally, "shake with (Thy) terrors." Jesus Christ does not "break the bruised reed" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#003">Isa 42:3</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#008">Isa 27:8</A>).
<p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_026">job 13:26</A></FONT></span></p>writest--a judicial phrase, to note down the determined punishment. The sentence of the condemned used to be written down (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#001">Isa 10:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#030">Jer 22:30</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#009">Psa 149:9</A>) [UMBREIT]. 
<p>
<p>bitter things--bitter punishments. 
<p>
<p>makest me to possess--or "inherit." In old age he receives possession of the inheritance of sin thoughtlessly acquired in youth. "To inherit sins" is to inherit the punishments inseparably connected with them in Hebrew ideas (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#007">Psa 25:7</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#027">Job 13:27</A></p>

<p>
<p>lookest narrowly--as an overseer would watch a prisoner. 
<p>
<p>print--Either the stocks, or his disease, marked his soles (Hebrew, "roots") as the bastinado would. Better, thou drawest (or diggest) [GESENIUS] a line (or trench) [GESENIUS] round my soles, beyond which I must not move [UMBREIT].
