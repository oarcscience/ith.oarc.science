<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">isa 15:1</A></FONT></span></p>THE FIFTEENTH AND SIXTEENTH CHAPTERS FORM ONE PROPHECY ON MOAB. (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#001">Isa 15:1-9</A>)
<p>
<p>Because--rather, "Surely"; literally, "(I affirm) that" [MAURER]. 
<p>
<p>night--the time best suited for a hostile incursion (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#004">Isa 21:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#004">Jer 39:4</A>). 
<p>
<p>Ar--meaning in Hebrew, "the city"; the metropolis of Moab, on the south of the river Arnon. 
<p>
<p>Kir--literally, "a citadel"; not far from Ar, towards the south. 
<p>
<p>He--Moab personified. 
<p>
<p>Bajith--rather, "to the temple" [MAURER]; answering to the "sanctuary" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#012">Isa 16:12</A>), in a similar context. 
<p>
<p>to Dibon--Rather, as Dibon was in a plain north of the Arnon, "Dibon (is gone up) to the high places," the usual places of sacrifice in the East. Same town as Dimon (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#009">Isa 15:9</A>). 
<p>
<p>to weep--at the sudden calamity. 
<p>
<p>over Nebo--rather "in Nebo"; not "on account of" Nebo (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#003">Isa 15:3</A>) [MAURER]. The town Nebo was adjacent to the mountain, not far from the northern shore of the Dead Sea. There it was that Chemosh, the idol of Moab, was worshipped (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#001">Deu 34:1</A>). 
<p>
<p>Medeba--south of Heshbon, on a hill east of Jordan. 
<p>
<p>baldness . . . beard cut off--The Orientals regarded the beard with peculiar veneration. To cut one's beard off is the greatest mark of sorrow and mortification (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#037">Jer 48:37</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#003">Isaiah 15:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">isa 15:3</A></FONT></span></p>tops of . . . houses--flat; places of resort for prayer, &amp;c., in the East (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#009">Act 10:9</A>). 
<p>
<p>weeping abundantly--"melting away in tears." HORSLEY prefers "descending to weep." Thus there is a "parallelism by alternate construction" [LOWTH], or chiasmus; "howl" refers to "tops of houses." "Descending to weep" to "streets" or squares, whither they descend from the housetops.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#004">Isaiah 15:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">isa 15:4</A></FONT></span></p>Heshbon--an Amorite city, twenty miles east of Jordan; taken by Moab after the carrying away of Israel (compare Jer. 48:1-47). 
<p>
<p>Elealeh--near Heshbon, in Reuben. 
<p>
<p>Jahaz--east of Jordan, in Reuben. Near it Moses defeated Sihon. 
<p>
<p>therefore--because of the sudden overthrow of their cities. Even the armed men, instead of fighting in defense of their land, shall join in the general cry. 
<p>
<p>life, &amp;c.--rather, "his soul is grieved" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#008">Sa1 1:8</A>) [MAURER].
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#005">Isaiah 15:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">isa 15:5</A></FONT></span></p>My--The prophet himself is moved with pity for Moab. Ministers, in denouncing the wrath of God against sinners, should do it with tender sorrow, not with exultation. 
<p>
<p>fugitives--fleeing from Moab, wander as far as to Zoar, on the extreme boundary south of the Dead Sea. HORSLEY translates, "her nobility," or "rulers" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#018">Hos 4:18</A>). 
<p>
<p>heifer, &amp;c.--that is, raising their voices "like a heifer" (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#034">Jer 48:34</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#036">Jer 48:36</A>). The expression "three years old," implies one at its full vigor (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#009">Gen 15:9</A>), as yet not brought under the yoke; as Moab heretofore unsubdued, but now about to be broken. So <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#018">Jer 31:18</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#013">Hos 4:13</A>. MAURER translates, "Eglath" (in English Version, "a heifer") Shelishijah (that is, the third, to distinguish it from two others of the same name). 
<p>
<p>by the mounting up--up the ascent. 
<p>
<p>Luhith--a mountain in Moab. 
<p>
<p>Horonaim--a town of Moab not far from Zoar (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#005">Jer 48:5</A>). It means "the two poles," being near caves. 
<p>
<p>cry of destruction--a cry appropriate to the destruction which visits their country.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#006">Isaiah 15:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">isa 15:6</A></FONT></span></p>For--the cause of their flight southwards (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#019">Kg2 3:19</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#025">Kg2 3:25</A>). "For" the northern regions and even the city Nimrim (the very name of which means "limpid waters," in Gilead near Jordan) are without water or herbage.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#007">Isaiah 15:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">isa 15:7</A></FONT></span></p>Therefore--because of the devastation of the land. 
<p>
<p>abundance--literally, "that which is over and above" the necessaries of life. 
<p>
<p>brook of . . . willows--The fugitives flee from Nimrim, where the waters have failed, to places better watered. Margin has "valley of Arabians"; that is, to the valley on the boundary between them and Arabia-Petr&Atilde;&brvbr;a; now Wady-el Arabah. "Arabia" means a "desert."
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#008">Isaiah 15:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">isa 15:8</A></FONT></span></p>Eglaim-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#010">Eze 47:10</A>), En-eglaim. Not the Agalum of EUSEBIUS, eight miles from Areopolis towards the south; the context requires a town on the very borders of Moab or beyond them. 
<p>
<p>Beer-elim--literally, "the well of the Princes"--(so <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#016">Num 21:16-18</A>). Beyond the east borders of Moab.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#009">Isaiah 15:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">isa 15:9</A></FONT></span></p>Dimon--same as Dibon (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#002">Isa 15:2</A>). Its waters are the Arnon. 
<p>
<p>full of blood--The slain of Moab shall be so many. 
<p>
<p>bring more--fresh calamities, namely, the "lions" afterwards mentioned (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#025">Kg2 17:25</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#006">Jer 5:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#003">Jer 15:3</A>). VITRINGA understands Nebuchadnezzar as meant by "the lion"; but it is plural, "lions." The "more," or in Hebrew, "additions," he explains of the addition made to the waters of Dimon by the streams of blood of the slain.
