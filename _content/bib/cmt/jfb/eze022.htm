<p>
<p>See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#004">Eze 20:4</A>; that is, "Wilt thou not judge?" &amp;c. (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#036">Eze 23:36</A>). 
<p>
<p>the bloody city--literally, "the city of bloods"; so called on account of murders perpetrated in her, and sacrifices of children to Molech (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#003">Eze 22:3-4</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#006">Eze 22:6</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#009">Eze 22:9</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#006">Eze 24:6</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#009">Eze 24:9</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#003">Ezekiel 22:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">eze 22:3</A></FONT></span></p>sheddeth blood . . . that her time may come--Instead of deriving advantage from her bloody sacrifices to idols, she only thereby brought on herself "the time" of her punishment. 
<p>
<p>against herself-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#036">Pro 8:36</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#004">Ezekiel 22:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">eze 22:4</A></FONT></span></p>thy days--the shorter period, namely, that of the siege. 
<p>
<p>thy years--the longer period of the captivity. The "days" and "years" express that she is ripe for punishment.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#005">Ezekiel 22:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">eze 22:5</A></FONT></span></p>infamous--They mockingly call thee, "Thou polluted one in name (Margin), and full of confusion" [FAIRBAIRN], (referring to the tumultuous violence prevalent in it). Thus the nations "far and near" mocked her as at once sullied in character and in actual fact lawless. What a sad contrast to the Jerusalem once designated "'the holy city!"
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#006">Ezekiel 22:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">eze 22:6</A></FONT></span></p>Rather, "The princes . . . each according to his power, were in thee, to shed blood" (as if this was the only object of their existence). "Power," literally, "arm"; they, who ought to have been patterns of justice, made their own arm of might their only law.
<p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">eze 22:7</A></FONT></span></p>set light by--Children have made light of, disrespected, father . . . (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#016">Deu 27:16</A>). At <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#007">Eze 22:7-12</A> are enumerated the sins committed in violation of Moses' law.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#009">Ezekiel 22:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">eze 22:9</A></FONT></span></p>men that carry tales--informers, who by misrepresentations cause innocent blood to be shed (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#016">Lev 19:16</A>). Literally, "one who goes to and fro as a merchant."
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#010">Ezekiel 22:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">eze 22:10</A></FONT></span></p>set apart for pollution--that is, set apart as unclean (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#019">Lev 18:19</A>).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">eze 22:16</A></FONT></span></p>take thine inheritance in thyself--Formerly thou wast Mine inheritance; but now, full of guilt, thou art no longer Mine, but thine own inheritance to thyself; "in the sight of the heathen," that is, even they shall see that, now that thou hast become a captive, thou art no longer owned as Mine [VATABLUS]. FAIRBAIRN and others needlessly take the Hebrew from a different root, "thou shalt be polluted by ('in,' [HENDERSON]) thyself," &amp;c.; the heathen shall regard thee as a polluted thing, who hast brought thine own reproach on thyself.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#018">Ezekiel 22:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">eze 22:18</A></FONT></span></p>dross . . . brass--Israel has become a worthless compound of the dross of silver (implying not merely corruption, but degeneracy from good to bad, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#022">Isa 1:22</A>, especially offensive) and of the baser metals. Hence the people must be thrown into the furnace of judgment, that the bad may be consumed, and the good separated (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#029">Jer 6:29-30</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#023">Ezekiel 22:23</A></p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">eze 22:24</A></FONT></span></p>land . . . not cleansed--not cleared or cultivated; all a scene of desolation; a fit emblem of the moral wilderness state of the people. 
<p>
<p>nor rained upon--a mark of divine "indignation"; as the early and latter rain, on which the productiveness of the land depended, was one of the great covenant blessings. Joel (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#023">Joe 2:23</A>) promises the return of the former and latter rain, with the restoration of God's favor.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#025">Ezekiel 22:25</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_025">eze 22:25</A></FONT></span></p>conspiracy--The false prophets have conspired both to propagate error and to oppose the messages of God's servants. They are mentioned first, as their bad influence extended the widest. 
<p>
<p>prey--Their aim was greed of gain, "treasure, and precious things" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#009">Hos 6:9</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#003">Zep 3:3-4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#014">Mat 23:14</A>).

<p>made . . . many widows--by occasioning, through false prophecies, the war with the Chaldeans in which the husbands fell.
<p>

<p>
<p>put no difference between the holy and profane, &amp;c.--made no distinction between the clean and unclean (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#010">Lev 10:10</A>), the Sabbath and other days, sanctioning violations of that holy day. "Holy" means, what is dedicated to God; "profane," what is in common use; "unclean," what is forbidden to be eaten; "clean," what is lawful to be eaten. 
<p>
<p>I am profaned among them--They abuse My name to false or unjust purposes.

<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#028">Ezekiel 22:28</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_028">eze 22:28</A></FONT></span></p>Referring to the false assurances of peace with which the prophets flattered the people, that they should not submit to the king of Babylon (see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#010">Eze 13:10</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#029">Eze 21:29</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#014">Jer 6:14</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#016">Jer 23:16-17</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#009">Jer 27:9-10</A>).

<p>
<p>wrongfully--that is, "without cause," gratuitously, without the stranger proselyte giving any just provocation; nay, he of all others being one who ought to have been won to the worship of Jehovah by kindness, instead of being alienated by oppression; especially as the Israelites were commanded to remember that they themselves had been "strangers in Egypt" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#021">Exo 22:21</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#009">Exo 23:9</A>).

<p>
<p>the gap--the breach (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#023">Psa 106:23</A>); image for interceding between the people and God (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#007">Gen 20:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#011">Exo 32:11</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#048">Num 16:48</A>). 
<p>
<p>I found none-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#001">Jer 5:1</A>) --not that literally there was not a righteous man in the city. For Jeremiah, Baruch, &amp;c., were still there; but Jeremiah had been forbidden to pray for the people (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#014">Jer 11:14</A>), as being doomed to wrath. None now, of the godly, knowing the desperate state of the people, and God's purpose as to them, was willing longer to interpose between God's wrath and them. And none "among them," that is, among those just enumerated as guilty of such sins (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#025">Eze 22:25-29</A>), was morally able for such an office.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#031">Ezekiel 22:31</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_031">eze 22:31</A></FONT></span></p>their own way . . . recompensed upon their heads-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#010">Eze 9:10</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#021">Eze 11:21</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#043">Eze 16:43</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#031">Pro 1:31</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#011">Isa 3:11</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#019">Jer 6:19</A>).
<p>
<p>The imagery is similar to that in the sixteenth chapter; but here the reference is not as there so much to the breach of the spiritual marriage covenant with God by the people's idolatries, as by their worldly spirit, and their trusting to alliances with the heathen for safety, rather than to God.
