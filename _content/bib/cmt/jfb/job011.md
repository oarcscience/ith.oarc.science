### [Job Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#001)

[Job 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 11:2</span></span>

FIRST SPEECH OF ZOPHAR. (Job 11:1-20)

Zophar assails Job for his empty words, and indirectly, the two friends,
for their weak reply. Taciturnity is highly prized among Orientals ([Pro
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#008), [Pro
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#019)).

[Job 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 11:3</span></span>

lies--rather, "vain boasting" ([Isa
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#006); [Jer
48:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#030)). The "men" is emphatic; men of
sense; in antithesis to "vain boasting."

mockest--upbraidest God by complaints, "shall no man make thee ashamed?"

[Job 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 11:4</span></span>

doctrine--purposely used of Job's speeches, which sounded like lessons
of doctrine ([Deu 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#002); [Pro
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#002)).

thine--addressed to God. Job had maintained his sincerity against his
friends suspicions, not faultlessness.

[Job 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 11:6</span></span>

to that which is!--Rather, "they are double to \[man's\] wisdom"
\[MICHAELIS\]. So the Hebrew is rendered ([Pro
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#007)). God's ways, which you arraign,
if you were shown their secret wisdom, would be seen vastly to exceed
that of men, including yours ([Co1
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#025)).

exacteth--Rather, "God consigns to oblivion in thy favor much of thy
guilt."

[Job 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 11:7</span></span>

Rather, "Penetrate to the perfections of the Almighty" ([Job
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#010); [Psa
139:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#006)).

[Job 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 11:8</span></span>

It--the "wisdom" of God ([Job 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#006)).
The abruptness of the Hebrew is forcible: "The heights of heaven! What
canst thou do" (as to attaining to them with thy gaze, [Psa
139:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#008))?

know--namely, of His perfections.

[Job 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 11:10</span></span>

cut off--Rather, as in [Job 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#011),
"pass over," as a storm; namely, rush upon in anger.

shut up--in prison, with a view to trial.

gather together--the parties for judgment: hold a judicial assembly; to
pass sentence on the prisoners.

[Job 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 11:11</span></span>

([Psa 94:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#011)).

consider--so as to punish it. Rather, from the connection, [Job
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#006), "He seeth wickedness also, which
man does not perceive"; literally, "But no (other, save He) perceiveth
it" \[UMBREIT\]. God's "wisdom" ([Job
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#006)), detects sin where Job's human
eye cannot reach ([Job 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#008)), so as to
see any.

[Job 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 11:12</span></span>

vain--hollow.

would be--"wants to consider himself wise"; opposed to God's "wisdom"
(see on [Job 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#011)); refuses to see
sin, where God sees it ([Rom 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#022)).

wild ass's colt--a proverb for untamed wildness ([Job
39:5](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#005), [Job
39:8](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#008); [Jer
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#024); [Gen
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#012); Hebrew, "a wild-ass man"). Man
wishes to appear wisely obedient to his Lord, whereas he is, from his
birth, unsubdued in spirit.

[Job 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 11:13</span></span>

The apodosis to the "If" is at [Job
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#015). The preparation of the heart is
to be obtained ([Pro 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#001)) by
stretching out the hands in prayer for it ([Psa
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#017); [Ch1
29:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#018)).

[Job 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 11:14</span></span>

Rather, "if thou wilt put far away the iniquity in thine hand" (as
Zaccheus did, [Luk 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#008)). The apodosis
or conclusion is at [Job 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#015), "then
shalt thou," &c.

[Job 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 11:15</span></span>

Zophar refers to Job's own words ([Job
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#015)), "yet will I not lift up my
head," even though righteous. Zophar declares, if Job will follow his
advice, he may "lift up his face."

spot-- ([Deu 32:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#005)).

steadfast--literally, "run fast together," like metals which become firm
and hard by fusion. The sinner on the contrary is wavering.

[Job 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 11:16</span></span>

Just as when the stream runs dry ([Job
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#017)), the danger threatened by its
wild waves is forgotten ([Isa 65:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#016))
\[UMBREIT\].

[Job 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 11:17</span></span>

age--days of life.

the noon-day--namely, of thy former prosperity; which, in the poet's
image, had gone on increasing, until it reached its height, as the sun
rises higher and higher until it reaches the meridian ([Pro
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#018)).

shine forth--rather, "though now in darkness, thou shall be as the
morning"; or, "thy darkness (if any dark shade should arise on thee, it)
shall be as the morning" (only the dullness of morning twilight, not
nocturnal darkness) \[UMBREIT\].

[Job 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 11:18</span></span>

The experience of thy life will teach thee there is hope for man in
every trial.

dig--namely, wells; the chief necessity in the East. Better, "though now
ashamed ([Rom 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#005), opposed to the
previous 'hope'), thou shalt then rest safely" \[GESENIUS\];

[Job 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 11:19</span></span>

([Psa 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#008); [Pro
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#024); [Isa
14:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#030)); oriental images of prosperity.

make suit--literally, "stroke thy face," "caress thee" ([Pro
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#006)).

[Job 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 11:20</span></span>

A warning to Job, if he would not turn to God.

The wicked--that is, obdurate sinners.

eyes . . . fail--that is, in vain look for relief ([Deu
28:65](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#065)). Zophar implies Job's only hope
of relief is in a change of heart.

they shall not escape--literally, "every refuge shall vanish from them."

giving up of the ghost--Their hope shall leave them as the breath does
the body ([Pro 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#007)).
