### [Ecclesiastes Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#001)

[Ecclesiastes 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ecc 1:1</span></span>

INTRODUCTION. (Ecc. 1:1-18)

the Preacher--and Convener of assemblies for the purpose. See my
Preface. Koheleth in Hebrew, a symbolical name for Solomon, and of
Heavenly Wisdom speaking through and identified with him. [Ecc
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#012) shows that "king of Jerusalem" is
in apposition, not with "David," but "Preacher."

of Jerusalem--rather, "in Jerusalem," for it was merely his metropolis,
not his whole kingdom.

[Ecclesiastes 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ecc 1:2</span></span>

The theme proposed of the first part of his discourse.

Vanity of vanities--Hebraism for the most utter vanity. So "holy of
holies" ([Exo 26:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#033)); "servant of
servants" ([Gen 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#025)). The repetition
increases the force.

all--Hebrew, "the all"; all without exception, namely, earthly things.

vanity--not in themselves, for God maketh nothing in vain ([Ti1
4:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#004)), but vain when put in the place
of God and made the end, instead of the means ([Psa
39:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#005); [Psa
62:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#009); [Mat
6:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#033)); vain, also, because of the
"vanity" to which they are "subjected" by the fall ([Rom
8:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#020)).

[Ecclesiastes 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ecc 1:3</span></span>

What profit . . . labour--that is, "What profit" as to the chief good
([Mat 16:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#026)). Labor is profitable in
its proper place ([Gen 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#015); [Gen
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#019); [Pro
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#023)).

under the sun--that is, in this life, as opposed to the future world.
The phrase often recurs, but only in Ecclesiastes.

[Ecclesiastes 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ecc 1:4</span></span>

earth . . . for ever-- ([Psa 104:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#005)).
While the earth remains the same, the generations of men are ever
changing; what lasting profit, then, can there be from the toils of one
whose sojourn on earth, as an individual, is so brief? The "for ever" is
comparative, not absolute ([Psa
102:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#026)).

[Ecclesiastes 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ecc 1:5</span></span>

([Psa 19:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#005)). "Panting" as the Hebrew
for "hasteth"; metaphor, from a runner ([Psa
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#005), "a strong man") in a "race." It
applies rather to the rising sun, which seems laboriously to mount up to
the meridian, than to the setting sun; the accents too favor MAURER,
"And (that too, returning) to his place, where panting he riseth."

[Ecclesiastes 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ecc 1:6</span></span>

according to his circuits--that is, it returns afresh to its former
circuits, however many be its previous veerings about. The north and
south winds are the two prevailing winds in Palestine and Egypt.

[Ecclesiastes 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ecc 1:7</span></span>

By subterraneous cavities, and by evaporation forming rain clouds, the
fountains and rivers are supplied from the sea, into which they then
flow back. The connection is: Individual men are continually changing,
while the succession of the race continues; just as the sun, wind, and
rivers are ever shifting about, while the cycle in which they move is
invariable; they return to the point whence they set out. Hence is man,
as in these objects of nature which are his analogue, with all the
seeming changes "there is no new thing" ([Ecc
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#009)).

[Ecclesiastes 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ecc 1:8</span></span>

MAURER translates, "All words are wearied out," that is, are inadequate,
as also, "man cannot express" all the things in the world which undergo
this ceaseless, changeless cycle of vicissitudes: "The eye is not
satisfied with seeing them," &c. But it is plainly a return to the idea
([Ecc 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#003)) as to man's "labor," which
is only wearisome and profitless; "no new" good can accrue from it ([Ecc
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#009)); for as the sun, &c., so man's
laborious works move in a changeless cycle. The eye and ear are two of
the taskmasters for which man toils. But these are never "satisfied"
([Ecc 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#007); [Pro
27:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#020)). Nor can they be so hereafter,
for there will be nothing "new." Not so the chief good, Jesus Christ
([Joh 4:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#013); [Rev
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#005)).

[Ecclesiastes 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ecc 1:9</span></span>

Rather, "no new thing at all"; as in [Num
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#006). This is not meant in a general
sense; but there is no new source of happiness (the subject in question)
which can be devised; the same round of petty pleasures, cares,
business, study, wars, &c., being repeated over and over again
\[HOLDEN\].

[Ecclesiastes 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ecc 1:10</span></span>

old time--Hebrew, "ages."

which was--The Hebrew plural cannot be joined to the verb singular.
Therefore translate: "It hath been in the ages before; certainly it hath
been before us" \[HOLDEN\]. Or, as MAURER: "That which has been (done)
before us (in our presence, [Ch1
16:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#033)), has been (done) already in the
old times."

[Ecclesiastes 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ecc 1:11</span></span>

The reason why some things are thought "new," which are not really so,
is the imperfect record that exists of preceding ages among their
successors.

those that . . . come after--that is, those that live still later than
the "things, rather the persons or generations, [Ecc
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#004), with which this verse is
connected, the six intermediate verses being merely illustrations of
[Ecc 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#004) \[WEISS\], that are to come"
([Ecc 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#016); [Ecc
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#005)).

[Ecclesiastes 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ecc 1:12</span></span>

Resumption of [Ecc 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#001), the
intermediate verses being the introductory statement of his thesis.
Therefore, "the Preacher" (Koheleth) is repeated.

was king--instead of "am," because he is about to give the results of
his past experience during his long reign.

in Jerusalem--specified, as opposed to David, who reigned both in Hebron
and Jerusalem; whereas Solomon reigned only in Jerusalem. "King of
Israel in Jerusalem," implies that he reigned over Israel and Judah
combined; whereas David, at Hebron, reigned only over Judah, and not,
until he was settled in Jerusalem, over both Israel and Judah.

[Ecclesiastes 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ecc 1:13</span></span>

this sore travail--namely, that of "searching out all things done under
heaven." Not human wisdom in general, which comes afterwards ([Ecc
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#012), &c.), but laborious enquiries
into, and speculations about, the works of men; for example, political
science. As man is doomed to get his bread, so his knowledge, by the
sweat of his brow ([Gen 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#019))
\[GILL\].

exercised--that is, disciplined; literally, "that they may thereby
chastise, or humble themselves."

[Ecclesiastes 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ecc 1:14</span></span>

The reason is here given why investigation into man's "works" is only
"sore travail" ([Ecc 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#013)); namely,
because all man's ways are vain ([Ecc
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#018)) and cannot be mended ([Ecc
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#015)).

vexation of--"a preying upon"

the Spirit--MAURER translates; "the pursuit of wind," as in [Ecc
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#016); [Hos
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#001), "Ephraim feedeth on wind." But
old versions support the English Version.

[Ecclesiastes 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ecc 1:15</span></span>

Investigation ([Ecc 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#013)) into human
ways is vain labor, for they are hopelessly "crooked" and "cannot be
made straight" by it ([Ecc 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#013)). God,
the chief good, alone can do this ([Isa
40:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#004); [Isa
45:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#002)).

wanting-- ([Dan 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#027)).

numbered--so as to make a complete number; so equivalent to "supplied"
\[MAURER\]. Or, rather, man's state is utterly wanting; and that which
is wholly defective cannot be numbered or calculated. The investigator
thinks he can draw up, in accurate numbers, statistics of man's wants;
but these, including the defects in the investigator's labor, are not
partial, but total.

[Ecclesiastes 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ecc 1:16</span></span>

communed with . . . heart-- ([Gen
24:45](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#045)).

come to great estate--Rather, "I have magnified and gotten" (literally,
"added," increased), &c.

all . . . before me in Jerusalem--namely, the priests, judges, and two
kings that preceded Solomon. His wisdom exceeded that of all before
Jesus Christ, the antitypical Koheleth, or "Gatherer of men," ([Luk
13:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#034)), and "Wisdom" incarnate ([Mat
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#019); [Mat
12:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#042)).

had . . . experience--literally, "had seen" ([Jer
2:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#031)). Contrast with this glorying in
worldly wisdom ([Jer 9:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#023)).

[Ecclesiastes 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ecc 1:17</span></span>

wisdom . . . madness--that is, their effects, the works of human wisdom
and folly respectively. "Madness," literally, "vaunting extravagance";
[Ecc 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#012); [Ecc
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#025), &c., support English Version
rather than DATHE, "splendid matters." "Folly" is read by English
Version with some manuscripts, instead of the present Hebrew text,
"prudence." If Hebrew be retained, understand "prudence," falsely so
called ([Ti1 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#020)), "craft" ([Dan
8:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#025)).

[Ecclesiastes 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ecc 1:18</span></span>

wisdom . . . knowledge--not in general, for wisdom, &c., are most
excellent in their place; but speculative knowledge of man's ways ([Ecc
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#013), [Ecc
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#017)), which, the farther it goes,
gives one the more pain to find how "crooked" and "wanting" they are
([Ecc 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#015); [Ecc
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#012)).

He next tries pleasure and luxury, retaining however, his worldly
"wisdom" ([Ecc 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#009)), but all proves
"vanity" in respect to the chief good.
