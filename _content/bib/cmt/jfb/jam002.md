Testaments*, by Robert Jamieson, A.R. Fausset and David Brown \[1882\]

### [James Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#001)

[James 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jam 2:1</span></span>

THE SIN OF RESPECT OF PERSONS: DEAD, UNWORKING FAITH SAVES NO MAN. (Jam.
2:1-26)

brethren--The equality of all Christians as "brethren," forms the
groundwork of the admonition.

the faith of . . . Christ--that is, the Christian faith. James grounds
Christian practice on Christian faith.

the Lord of glory--So [Co1 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#008). As all
believers, alike rich and poor, derive all their glory from their union
with Him, "the Lord of glory," not from external advantages of worldly
fortune, the sin in question is peculiarly inconsistent with His
"faith." BENGEL, making no ellipsis of "the Lord," explains "glory" as
in apposition with Christ who is THE GLORY ([Luk
2:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#032)); the true Shekinah glory of the
temple ([Rom 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#004)). English Version is
simpler. The glory of Christ resting on the poor believer should make
him be regarded as highly by "brethren" as his richer brother; nay, more
so, if the poor believer has more of Christ's spirit than the rich
brother.

with respect of persons--literally, "in respectings of persons"; "in"
the practice of partial preferences of persons in various ways and on
various occasions.

[James 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jam 2:2</span></span>

"If there chance to have come" \[ALFORD\].

assembly--literally, "synagogue"; this, the latest honorable use, and
the only Christian use of the term in the New Testament, occurs in
James's Epistle, the apostle who maintained to the latest possible
moment the bonds between the Jewish synagogue and the Christian Church.
Soon the continued resistance of the truth by the Jews led Christians to
leave the term to them exclusively ([Rev
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#009)). The "synagogue" implies a mere
assembly or congregation not necessarily united by any common tie.
"Church," a people bound together by mutual ties and laws, though often
it may happen that the members are not assembled \[TRENCH and
VITRINGA\]. Partly from James' Hebrew tendencies, partly from the Jewish
Christian churches retaining most of the Jewish forms, this term
"synagogue" is used here instead of the Christian term "Church"
(ecclesia, derived from a root, "called out," implying the union of its
members in spiritual bonds, independent of space, and called out into
separation from the world); an undesigned coincidence and mark of truth.
The people in the Jewish synagogue sat according to their rank, those of
the same trade together. The introduction of this custom into Jewish
Christian places of worship is here reprobated by James. Christian
churches were built like the synagogues, the holy table in the east end
of the former, as the ark was in the latter; the desk and pulpit were
the chief articles of furniture in both alike. This shows the error of
comparing the Church to the temple, and the ministry to the priesthood;
the temple is represented by the whole body of worshippers; the church
building was formed on the model of the synagogue. See VITRINGA
\[Synagogue and Temple\].

goodly apparel . . . gay clothing--As the Greek, is the same in both,
translate both alike, "gay," or "splendid clothing."

[James 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jam 2:3</span></span>

have respect to him, &c.--though ye know not who he is, when perhaps he
may be a heathen. It was the office of the deacons to direct to a seat
the members of the congregation \[CLEMENT OF ROME, Apostolical
Constitutions, 2.57, 58\].

unto him--not in the best manuscripts. Thus "thou" becomes more
demonstratively emphatic.

there--at a distance from where the good seats are.

here--near the speaker.

under my footstool--not literally so; but on the ground, down by my
footstool. The poor man must either stand, or if he sits, sit in a
degrading position. The speaker has a footstool as well as a good seat.

[James 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jam 2:4</span></span>

Are ye not . . . partial--literally, "Have ye not made distinctions" or
"differences" (so as to prefer one to another)? So in [Jde
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#022).

in yourselves--in your minds, that is, according to your carnal
inclination \[GROTIUS\].

are become judges of evil thoughts--The Greek words for "judges" and for
"partial," are akin in sound and meaning. A similar translation ought
therefore to be given to both. Thus, either for "judges," &c. translate,
"distinguishers of (that is, according to your) evil thoughts"; or, do
ye not partially judge between men, and are become evilly-thinking
judges ([Mar 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#021))? The "evil
thoughts" are in the judges themselves; as in [Luk
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#006), the Greek, "judge of injustice,"
is translated, "unjust judge." ALFORD and WAHL translate, "Did ye not
doubt" (respecting your faith, which is inconsistent with the
distinctions made by you between rich and poor)? For the Greek
constantly means "doubt" in all the New Testament. So in [Jam
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#006), "wavering." [Mat
21:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#021); [Act
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#020); [Rom
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#020), "staggered not." The same play
on the same kindred words occurs in the Greek of [Rom
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#010), [Rom
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#023), "judge . . . doubteth." The
same blame of being a judge, when one ought to be an obeyer, of the law
is found in [Jam 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#011).

[James 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jam 2:5</span></span>

Hearken--James brings to trial the self-constituted "judges" ([Jam
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#004)).

poor of this world--The best manuscripts read, "those poor in respect to
the world." In contrast to "the rich in this world" ([Ti1
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#017)). Not of course all the poor; but
the poor, as a class, furnish more believers than the rich as a class.
The rich, if a believer, renounces riches as his portion; the poor, if
an unbeliever, neglects that which is the peculiar advantage of poverty
([Mat 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#003); [Co1
1:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#026)).

rich in faith--Their riches consist in faith. [Luk
12:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#021), "rich toward God." [Ti1
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#018), "rich in good works" ([Rev
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#009); compare [Co2
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#009)). Christ's poverty is the source
of the believer's riches.

kingdom . . . promised-- ([Luk 12:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#032);
[Co1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#009); [Ti2
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#008)).

[James 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jam 2:6</span></span>

The world's judgment of the poor contrasted with God's.

ye--Christians, from whom better things might have been expected; there
is no marvel that men of the world do so.

despised--literally, "dishonored." To dishonor the poor is to dishonor
those whom God honors, and so to invert the order of God \[CALVIN\].

rich--as a class.

oppress--literally, "abuse their power against" you.

draw you--Translate, "is it not they (those very persons whom ye
partially prefer, [Jam 2:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#001)) that
drag you (namely, with violence)" \[ALFORD\].

before . . . judgment seats--instituting persecutions for religion, as
well as oppressive lawsuits, against you.

[James 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jam 2:7</span></span>

"Is it not they that blaspheme?" &c. as in [Jam
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#006) \[ALFORD\]. Rich heathen must here
chiefly be meant; for none others would directly blaspheme the name of
Christ. Only indirectly rich Christians can be meant, who, by their
inconsistency, caused His name to be blasphemed; so [Eze
36:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#021); [Rom
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#024). Besides, there were few rich
Jewish Christians at Jerusalem ([Rom
15:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#026)). They who dishonor God's name
by wilful and habitual sin, "take (or bear) the Lord's name in vain"
(compare [Pro 30:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#009), with [Exo
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#007)).

that worthy name--which is "good before the Lord's saints" ([Psa
52:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#009); [Psa
54:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#006)); which ye pray may be "hallowed"
([Mat 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#009)), and "by which ye are
called," literally, "which was invoked" or, "called upon by you"
(compare [Gen 48:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#016); [Isa
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#001), Margin; [Act
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#017)), so that at your baptism "into
the name" (so the Greek, [Mat 28:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#019))
of Christ, ye became Christ's people ([Co1
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#023)).

[James 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jam 2:8</span></span>

The Greek may be translated, "If, however, ye fulfil," &c., that is, as
ALFORD, after ESTIUS, explains, "Still I do not say, hate the rich (for
their oppressions) and drive them from your assemblies; if you choose to
observe the royal law . . . well and good; but respect of persons is a
breach of that law." I think the translation is, "If in very deed (or
'indeed on the one hand') ye fulfil the royal law . . . ye do well, but
if (on the other hand) ye respect persons, ye practice sin." The Jewish
Christians boasted of, and rested in, the "law" ([Act
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#001); [Act
21:18-24](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#018); [Rom
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#017); [Gal
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#012)). To this the "indeed" alludes.
"(Ye rest in the law): If indeed (then) ye fulfil it, ye do well; but
if," &c.

royal--the law that is king of all laws, being the sum and essence of
the ten commandments. The great King, God, is love; His law is the royal
law of love, and that law, like Himself, reigns supreme. He "is no
respecter of persons"; therefore to respect persons is at variance with
Him and His royal law, which is at once a law of love and of liberty
([Jam 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#012)). The law is the "whole";
"the (particular) Scripture" ([Lev
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#018)) quoted is a part. To break a
part is to break the whole ([Jam
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#010)).

ye do well--being "blessed in your deed" ("doing," Margin) as a doer,
not a forgetful hearer of the law ([Jam
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#025)).

[James 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jam 2:9</span></span>

Respect of persons violates the command to love all alike "as thyself."

ye commit sin--literally, "ye work sin," [Mat
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#023), to which the reference here is
probably, as in [Jam 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#022). Your works
are sin, whatever boast of the law ye make in words (see on [Jam
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#008)).

convinced--Old English for "convicted."

as transgressors--not merely of this or that particular command, but of
the whole absolutely.

[James 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jam 2:10</span></span>

The best manuscripts read, "Whosoever shall have kept the whole law, and
yet shall have offended (literally, 'stumbled'; not so strong as 'fall,'
[Rom 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#011)) in one (point; here, the
respecting of persons), is (hereby) become guilty of all." The law is
one seamless garment which is rent if you but rend a part; or a musical
harmony which is spoiled if there be one discordant note \[TIRINUS\]; or
a golden chain whose completeness is broken if you break one link
\[GATAKER\]. You thus break the whole law, though not the whole of the
law, because you offend against love, which is the fulfilling of the
law. If any part of a man be leprous, the whole man is judged to be a
leper. God requires perfect, not partial, obedience. We are not to
choose out parts of the law to keep, which suit our whim, while we
neglect others.

[James 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jam 2:11</span></span>

He is One who gave the whole law; therefore, they who violate His will
in one point, violate it all \[BENGEL\]. The law and its Author alike
have a complete unity.

adultery . . . kill--selected as being the most glaring cases of
violation of duty towards one's neighbor.

[James 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jam 2:12</span></span>

Summing up of the previous reasonings.

speak--referring back to [Jam 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#019),
[Jam 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#026); the fuller discussion of
the topic is given [Jam 3:5-12](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#005).

judged by the law of liberty-- ([Jam
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#025)); that is, the Gospel law of
love, which is not a law of external constraint, but of internal, free,
instinctive inclination. The law of liberty, through God's mercy, frees
us from the curse of the law, that henceforth we should be free to love
and obey willingly. If we will not in turn practice the law of love to
our neighbor, that law of grace condemns us still more heavily than the
old law, which spake nothing but wrath to him who offended in the least
particular ([Jam 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#013)). Compare [Mat
18:32-35](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#032); [Joh
12:48](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#048); [Rev
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#016), "Wrath of the (merciful) Lamb."

[James 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jam 2:13</span></span>

The converse of, "Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy"
([Mat 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#007)). Translate, "The judgment
(which is coming on all of us) shall be without mercy to him who hath
showed no mercy." It shall be such toward every one as every one shall
have been \[BENGEL\]. "Mercy" here corresponds to "love," [Jam
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#008).

mercy rejoiceth against judgment--Mercy, so far from fearing judgment in
the case of its followers, actually glorifieth against it, knowing that
it cannot condemn them. Not that their mercy is the ground of their
acquittal, but the mercy of God in Christ towards them, producing mercy
on their part towards their fellow men, makes them to triumph over
judgment, which all in themselves otherwise deserve.

[James 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jam 2:14</span></span>

James here, passing from the particular case of "mercy" or "love"
violated by "respect of persons," notwithstanding profession of the
"faith of our Lord Jesus" ([Jam 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#001)),
combats the Jewish tendency (transplanted into their Christianity) to
substitute a lifeless, inoperative acquaintance with the letter of the
law, for change of heart to practical holiness, as if justification
could be thereby attained ([Rom 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#003),
[Rom 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#013), [Rom
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#023)). It seems hardly likely but that
James had seen Paul's Epistles, considering that he uses the same
phrases and examples (compare [Jam
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#021), [Jam
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#023), [Jam
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#025), with [Rom
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#003); [Heb
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#017), [Heb
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#031); and [Jam
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#014), [Jam
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#024), with [Rom
3:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#028); [Gal
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#016)). Whether James individually
designed it or not, the Holy Spirit by him combats not Paul, but those
who abuse Paul's doctrine. The teaching of both alike is inspired, and
is therefore to be received without wresting of words; but each has a
different class to deal with; Paul, self-justiciaries; James, Antinomian
advocates of a mere notional faith. Paul urged as strongly as James the
need of works as evidences of faith, especially in the later Epistles,
when many were abusing the doctrine of faith ([Tit
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#014); [Tit
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#008)). "Believing and doing are blood
relatives" \[RUTHERFORD\].

What doth it profit--literally, "What is the profit?"

though a man say--James' expression is not, "If a man have faith," but
"if a man say he hath faith"; referring to a mere profession of faith,
such as was usually made at baptism. Simon Magus so "believed and was
baptized," and yet had "neither part nor lot in this matter," for his
"heart," as his words and works evinced, was not right in the sight of
God. ALFORD wrongly denies that "say" is emphatic. The illustration,
[Jam 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#016), proves it is: "If one of
you say" to a naked brother, "Be ye warmed, notwithstanding ye give not
those things needful." The inoperative profession of sympathy answering
to the inoperative profession of faith.

can faith save him--rather, "can such a faith (literally, 'the faith')
save him?"--the faith you pretend to: the empty name of boasted faith,
contrasted with true fruit-producing faith. So that which self-deceivers
claim is called "wisdom," though not true wisdom, [Jam
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#015). The "him" also in the Greek is
emphatic; the particular man who professes faith without having the
works which evidence its vitality.

[James 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jam 2:15</span></span>

The Greek is, "But if," &c.: the "But" taking up the argument against
such a one as "said he had faith, and yet had not works," which are its
fruits.

a brother, &c.--a fellow Christian, to whom we are specially bound to
give help, independent of our general obligation to help all our fellow
creatures.

be--The Greek implies, "be found, on your access to them."

[James 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jam 2:16</span></span>

The habit of receiving passively sentimental impressions from sights of
woe without carrying them out into active habits only hardens the heart.

one of you--James brings home the case to his hearers individually.

Depart in peace--as if all their wants were satisfied by the mere words
addressed to them. The same words in the mouth of Christ, whose faith
they said they had, were accompanied by efficient deeds of love.

be . . . warmed--with clothing, instead of being as heretofore "naked"
([Jam 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#015); [Job
31:20](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#020)).

filled--instead of being "destitute of food" ([Mat
15:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#037)).

what doth it profit--concluding with the same question as at the
beginning, [Jam 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#014). Just
retribution: kind professions unaccompanied with corresponding acts, as
they are of no "profit" to the needy object of them, so are of no profit
to the professor himself. So faith consisting in mere profession is
unacceptable to God, the object of faith, and profitless to the
possessor.

[James 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jam 2:17</span></span>

faith . . . being alone--ALFORD joins "is dead in itself." So BENGEL,
"If the works which living faith produces have no existence, it is a
proof that faith itself (literally, 'in respect to itself') has no
existence; that is, that what one boasts of as faith, is dead." "Faith"
is said to be "dead in itself," because when it has works it is alive,
and it is discerned to be so, not in respect to its works, but in
respect to itself. English Version, if retained, must not be understood
to mean that faith can exist "alone" (that is, severed from works), but
thus: Even so presumed faith, if it have not works, is dead, being by
itself "alone," that is, severed from works of charity; just as the body
would be "dead" if alone, that is, severed from the spirit ([Jam
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#026)). So ESTIUS.

[James 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jam 2:18</span></span>

"But some one will say": so the Greek. This verse continues the argument
from [Jam 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#014), [Jam
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#016). One may say he has faith though
he have not works. Suppose one were to say to a naked brother, "Be
warmed," without giving him needful clothing. "But someone (entertaining
views of the need of faith having works joined to it) will say (in
opposition to the 'say' of the professor)."

show me thy faith without thy works--if thou canst; but thou canst not
SHOW, that is, manifest or evidence thy alleged ([Jam
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#014), "say") faith without works.
"Show" does not mean here to prove to me, but exhibit to me. Faith is
unseen save by God. To show faith to man, works in some form or other
are needed: we are justified judicially by God ([Rom
8:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#033)); meritoriously, by Christ ([Isa
53:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#011)); mediately, by faith ([Rom
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#001)); evidentially, by works. The
question here is not as to the ground on which believers are justified,
but about the demonstration of their faith: so in the case of Abraham.
In [Gen 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#001) it is written, God did
tempt Abraham, that is, put to the test of demonstration the reality of
his faith, not for the satisfaction of God, who already knew it well,
but to demonstrate it before men. The offering of Isaac at that time,
quoted here, [Jam 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#021), formed no part
of the ground of his justification, for he was justified previously on
his simply believing in the promise of spiritual heirs, that is,
believers, numerous as the stars. He was then justified: that
justification was showed or manifested by his offering Isaac forty years
after. That work of faith demonstrated, but did not contribute to his
justification. The tree shows its life by its fruits, but it was alive
before either fruits or even leaves appeared.

[James 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jam 2:19</span></span>

Thou--emphatic. Thou self-deceiving claimant to faith without works.

that there is one God--rather, "that God is one": God's existence,
however, is also asserted. The fundamental article of the creed of Jews
and Christians alike, and the point of faith on which especially the
former boasted themselves, as distinguishing them from the Gentiles, and
hence adduced by James here.

thou doest well--so far good. But unless thy faith goes farther than an
assent to this truth, "the evil spirits (literally, 'demons': 'devil' is
the term restricted to Satan, their head) believe" so far in common with
thee, "and (so far from being saved by such a faith) shudder (so the
Greek)," [Mat 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#029); [Luk
4:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#034); [Pe2
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#004); [Jde
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#006); [Rev
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#010). Their faith only adds to their
torment at the thought of having to meet Him who is to consign them to
their just doom: so thine ([Heb
10:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#026), it is not the faith of love,
but of fear, that hath torment, [Jo1
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#018)).

wilt thou know--"Vain" men are not willing to know, since they have no
wish to "do" the will of God. James beseeches such a one to lay aside
his perverse unwillingness to know what is palpable to all who are
willing to do.

faith.

unavailing to effect what you hope, namely, to save you.

Abraham . . . justified by works--evidentially, and before men (see on
[Jam 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#018)). In [Jam
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#023), James, like Paul, recognizes the
Scripture truth, that it was his faith that was counted to Abraham for
righteousness in his justification before God.

when he had offered--rather, "when he offered" \[ALFORD\], that is,
brought as an offering at the altar; not implying that he actually
offered him.

Or, "thou seest."

how--rather, "that." In the two clauses which follow, emphasize "faith"
in the former, and "works" in the latter, to see the sense \[BENGEL\].

faith wrought with his works--for it was by faith he offered his son.
Literally, "was working (at the time) with his works."

by works was faith made perfect--not was vivified, but attained its
fully consummated development, and is shown to be real. So "my strength
is made perfect in weakness," that is, exerts itself most perfectly,
shows how great it is \[CAMERON\]: so [Jo1
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#017); [Heb
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#010); [Heb
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#009). The germ really, from the first,
contains in it the full-grown tree, but its perfection is not attained
till it is matured fully. So [Jam 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#004),
"Let patience have her perfect work," that is, have its full effect by
showing the most perfect degree of endurance, "that ye may be perfect,"
that is, fully developed in the exhibition of the Christian character.
ALFORD explains, "Received its realization, was entirely exemplified and
filled up." So Paul, [Phi 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#012), "Work
out your own salvation": the salvation was already in germ theirs in
their free justification through faith. It needed to be worked out still
to fully developed perfection in their life.

[James 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jam 2:23</span></span>

scripture was fulfilled-- [Gen 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#006),
quoted by Paul, as realized in Abraham's justification by faith; but by
James, as realized subsequently in Abraham's work of offering Isaac,
which, he says, justified him. Plainly, then, James must mean by works
the same thing as Paul means by faith, only that he speaks of faith at
its manifested development, whereas Paul speaks of it in its germ.
Abraham's offering of Isaac was not a mere act of obedience, but an act
of faith. Isaac was the subject of the promises of God, that in him
Abraham's seed should be called. The same God calls on Abraham to slay
the subject of His own promise, when as yet there was no seed in whom
those predictions could be realized. Hence James' saying that Abraham
was justified by such a work, is equivalent to saying, as Paul does,
that he was justified by faith itself; for it was in fact faith
expressed in action, as in other cases saving faith is expressed in
words. So Paul states as the mean of salvation faith expressed. The
"Scripture" would not be "fulfilled," as James says it was, but
contradicted by any interpretation which makes man's works justify him
before God: for that Scripture makes no mention of works at all, but
says that Abraham's belief was counted to him for righteousness. God, in
the first instance, "justifies the ungodly" through faith; subsequently
the believer is justified before the world as righteous through faith
manifested in words and works (compare [Mat
25:35-37](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#035), "the righteous," [Mat
25:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#040)). The best authorities read,
"But Abraham believed," &c.

and he was called the Friend of God--He was not so called in his
lifetime, though he was so even then from the time of his justification;
but he was called so, being recognized as such by all on the ground of
his works of faith. "He was the friend (in an active sense), the lover
of God, in reference to his works; and (in a passive sense) loved by God
in reference to his justification by works. Both senses are united in
[Joh 15:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#014)" \[BENGEL\].

[James 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jam 2:24</span></span>

justified and, not by faith only--that is, by "faith without (separated
from: severed from) works," its proper fruits (see on [Jam
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#020)). Faith to justify must, from the
first, include obedience in germ (to be developed subsequently), though
the former alone is the ground of justification. The scion must be
grafted on the stock that it may live; it must bring forth fruit to
prove that it does live.

[James 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jam 2:25</span></span>

It is clear from the nature of Rahab's act, that it is not quoted to
prove justification by works as such. She believed assuredly what her
other countrymen disbelieved, and this in the face of every
improbability that an unwarlike few would conquer well-armed numbers. In
this belief she hid the spies at the risk of her life. Hence [Heb
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#031) names this as an example of
faith, rather than of obedience. "By faith the harlot Rahab perished not
with them that believed not." If an instance of obedience were wanting.
Paul and James would hardly have quoted a woman of previously bad
character, rather than the many moral and pious patriarchs. But as an
example of free grace justifying men through an operative, as opposed to
a mere verbal faith, none could be more suitable than a saved "harlot."
As Abraham was an instance of an illustrious man and the father of the
Jews, so Rahab is quoted as a woman, and one of abandoned character, and
a Gentile, showing that justifying faith has been manifested in those of
every class. The nature of the works alleged is such as to prove that
James uses them only as evidences of faith, as contrasted with a mere
verbal profession: not works of charity and piety, but works the value
of which consisted solely in their being proofs of faith: they were
faith expressed in act, synonymous with faith itself.

messengers--spies.

had received . . . had sent--rather, "received . . . thrust them forth"
(in haste and fear) \[ALFORD\].

another way--from that whereby they entered her house, namely, through
the window of her house on the wall, and thence to the mountain.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jam 2:26</span></span>

Faith is a spiritual thing: works are material. Hence we might expect
faith to answer to the spirit, works to the body. But James reverses
this. He therefore does not mean that faith in all cases answers to the
body; but the FORM of faith without the working reality answers to the
body without the animating spirit. It does not follow that living faith
derives its life from works, as the body derives its life from the
animating spirit.
