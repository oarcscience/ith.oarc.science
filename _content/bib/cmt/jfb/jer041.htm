<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">jer 41:1</A></FONT></span></p>ISHMAEL MURDERS GEDALIAH AND OTHERS, THEN FLEES TO THE AMMONITES. JOHANAN PURSUES HIM, RECOVERS THE CAPTIVES, AND PURPOSES TO FLEE TO EGYPT FOR FEAR OF THE CHALDEANS. (Jer. 41:1-18)
<p>
<p>seventh month--the second month after the burning of the city (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#012">Jer 52:12-13</A>). 
<p>
<p>and the princes--not the nominative. And the princes came, for the "princes" are not mentioned either in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#002">Jer 41:2</A> or in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#025">Kg2 25:25</A> : but, "Ishmael being of the seed royal and of the princes of the king" [MAURER]. But the ten men were the "princes of the king"; thus MAURER'S objection has no weight: so English Version. 
<p>
<p>eat bread together--Ishmael murdered Gedaliah, by whom he was hospitably received, in violation of the sacred right of hospitality (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#009">Psa 41:9</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#002">Jeremiah 41:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">jer 41:2</A></FONT></span></p>slew him whom the king of Babylon had made governor--This assigns a reason for their slaying him, as well as showing the magnitude of their crime (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#021">Dan 2:21</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#001">Rom 13:1</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#003">Jeremiah 41:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">jer 41:3</A></FONT></span></p>slew all the Jews--namely, the attendants and ministers of Gedaliah; or, the military alone, about his person; translate, "even (not 'and,' as English Version) the men of war." The main portion of the people with Gedaliah, including Jeremiah, Ishmael carried away captive (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#010">Jer 41:10</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#016">Jer 41:16</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#004">Jeremiah 41:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">jer 41:4</A></FONT></span></p>no man knew it--that is, outside Mizpah. Before tidings of the murder had gone abroad.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#005">Jeremiah 41:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">jer 41:5</A></FONT></span></p>beards shaven, &amp;c.--indicating their deep sorrow at the destruction of the temple and city. 
<p>
<p>cut themselves--a heathen custom, forbidden (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#027">Lev 19:27-28</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#001">Deu 14:1</A>). These men were mostly from Samaria, where the ten tribes, previous to their deportation, had fallen into heathen practices. 
<p>
<p>offerings--unbloody. They do not bring sacrificial victims, but "incense," &amp;c., to testify their piety. 
<p>
<p>house of . . . Lord--that is, the place where the house of the Lord had stood (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#009">Kg2 25:9</A>). The place in which a temple had stood, even when it had been destroyed, was held sacred [PAPINIAN]. Those "from Shiloh" would naturally seek the house of the Lord, since it was at Shiloh it originally was set up (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#001">Jos 18:1</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#006">Jeremiah 41:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">jer 41:6</A></FONT></span></p>weeping--pretending to weep, as they did, for the ruin of the temple. 
<p>
<p>Come to Gedaliah--as if he was one of Gedaliah's retinue.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#007">Jeremiah 41:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">jer 41:7</A></FONT></span></p>and cast them into . . . pit--He had not killed them in the pit (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#009">Jer 41:9</A>); these words are therefore rightly supplied in English Version. "The pit" or cistern made by Asa to guard against a want of water when Baasha was about to besiege the city (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#022">Kg1 15:22</A>). The trench or fosse round the city [GROTIUS]. Ishmael's motive for the murder seems to have been a suspicion that they were coming to live under Gedaliah.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#008">Jeremiah 41:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">jer 41:8</A></FONT></span></p>treasures--It was customary to hide grain in cavities underground in troubled times. "We have treasures," which we will give, if our lives be spared. 
<p>
<p>slew . . . not-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#008">Pro 13:8</A>). Ishmael's avarice and needs overcame his cruelty.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#009">Jeremiah 41:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">jer 41:9</A></FONT></span></p>because of Gedaliah--rather, "near Gedaliah," namely, those intercepted by Ishmael on their way from Samaria to Jerusalem and killed at Mizpah, where Gedaliah had lived. So <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#015">Ch2 17:15</A>, "next"; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#002">Neh 3:2</A>, Margin, literally, as here, "at his hand." "In the reign of Gedaliah" [CALVIN]. However, English Version gives a good sense: Ishmael's reason for killing them was because of his supposing them to be connected with Gedaliah.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#010">Jeremiah 41:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">jer 41:10</A></FONT></span></p>the king's daughters-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#006">Jer 43:6</A>). Zedekiah's. Ishmael must have got additional followers (whom the hope of gain attracted), besides those who originally set out with him (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#001">Jer 41:1</A>), so as to have been able to carry off all the residue of the people. He probably meant to sell them as slaves to the Ammonites (see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#014">Jer 40:14</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#011">Jeremiah 41:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">jer 41:11</A></FONT></span></p>Johanan--the friend of Gedaliah who had warned him of Ishmael's treachery, but in vain (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#008">Jer 40:8</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#013">Jer 40:13</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#012">Jeremiah 41:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">jer 41:12</A></FONT></span></p>the . . . waters-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#013">Sa2 2:13</A>); a large reservoir or lake. 
<p>
<p>in Gibeon--on the road from Mizpah to Ammon: one of the sacerdotal cities of Benjamin, four miles northwest of Jerusalem, now Eljib.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#013">Jeremiah 41:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">jer 41:13</A></FONT></span></p>glad--at the prospect of having a deliverer from their captivity.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#014">Jeremiah 41:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">jer 41:14</A></FONT></span></p>cast about--came round.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#016">Jeremiah 41:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">jer 41:16</A></FONT></span></p>men of war--"The men of war," stated in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#003">Jer 41:3</A> to have been slain by Ishmael, must refer to the military about Gedaliah's person; "the men of war" here to those not so. 
<p>
<p>eunuchs--The kings of Judah had adopted the bad practice of having harems and eunuchs from the surrounding heathen kingdoms.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#017">Jeremiah 41:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">jer 41:17</A></FONT></span></p>dwelt--for a time, until they were ready for their journey to Egypt (Jer. 42:1-22). 
<p>
<p>habitation to Chimham--his "caravanserai" close by Beth-lehem. David, in reward for Barzillai's loyalty, took Chimham his son under his patronage, and made over to him his own patrimony in the land of Beth-lehem. It was thence called the habitation of Chimham (Geruth-Chimham), though it reverted to David's heirs in the year of jubilee. "Caravanserais" (a compound Persian word, meaning "the house of a company of travellers") differ from our inns, in that there is no host to supply food, but each traveller must carry with him his own.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#018">Jeremiah 41:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">jer 41:18</A></FONT></span></p>afraid--lest the Chaldeans should suspect all the Jews of being implicated in Ishmael's treason, as though the Jews sought to have a prince of the house of David (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#001">Jer 41:1</A>). Their better way towards gaining God's favor would have been to have laid the blame on the real culprit, and to have cleared themselves. A tortuous policy is the parent of fear. Righteousness inspires with boldness (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#005">Psa 53:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#001">Pro 28:1</A>).
