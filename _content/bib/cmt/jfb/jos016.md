### [Joshua Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#001)

[Joshua 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 16:1</span></span>

THE GENERAL BORDERS OF THE SONS OF JOSEPH. ([Jos
16:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#001))

the lot of the children of Joseph fell--Hebrew, "went forth," referring
either to the lot as drawn out of the urn, or to the tract of land
thereby assigned. The first four verses describe the territory allotted
to the family of Joseph in the rich domains of central Palestine. It was
drawn in one lot, that the brethren might be contiguously situated; but
it was afterwards divided. The southern boundary only is described here;
that on the north being irregular and less defined ([Jos
17:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#010)), is not mentioned.

water of Jericho-- ([Kg2 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#019)), at the
joint of its junction with the Jordan.

mount Beth-el--the ridge south of Beth-el. Having described the position
of Joseph's family generally the historian proceeds to define the
territory; first, that of Ephraim.

[Joshua 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jos 16:5</span></span>

THE BORDERS OF THE INHERITANCE OF EPHRAIM. ([Jos
16:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#005))

the border of their inheritance . . . was Ataroth-addar--Ataroth-addar
(now Atara), four miles south of Jetta \[ROBINSON\], is fixed on as a
center, through which a line is drawn from Upper Beth-horon to
Michmethah, showing the western limit of their actual possessions. The
tract beyond that to the sea was still unconquered.

[Joshua 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jos 16:6</span></span>

Michmethah on the north side--The northern boundary is traced from this
point eastward to the Jordan.

[Joshua 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jos 16:8</span></span>

from Tappuah westward unto the river Kanah--It is retraced from east to
west, to describe the prospective and intended boundary, which was to
reach to the sea. Kanah ("reedy") flows into the Mediterranean.

[Joshua 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jos 16:9</span></span>

separate cities for the children of Ephraim were among the inheritance
of Manasseh-- ([Jos 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#009)), because it
was found that the tract allotted to Ephraim was too small in proportion
to its population and power.

[Joshua 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jos 16:10</span></span>

they drave not out the Canaanites . . . but the Canaanites dwell among
the Ephraimites unto this day, and serve under tribute--This is the
first mention of the fatal policy of the Israelites, in neglecting the
divine command ([Deu 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#016)) to
exterminate the idolaters.
