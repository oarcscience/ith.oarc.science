<p>
<p>cry--proclaim. 
<p>
<p>Jerusalem--the headquarters and center of their idolatry; therefore addressed first. 
<p>
<p>thee--rather, "I remember in regard to thee" [HENDERSON]; "for thee" [MAURER]. 
<p>
<p>kindness of thy youth--not so much Israel's kindness towards God, as the kindness which Israel experienced from God in their early history (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#008">Eze 16:8</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#022">Eze 16:22</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#060">Eze 16:60</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#003">Eze 23:3</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#008">Eze 23:8</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#019">Eze 23:19</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#015">Hos 2:15</A>). For Israel from the first showed perversity rather than kindness towards God (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#011">Exo 14:11-12</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#024">Exo 15:24</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#001">Exo 32:1-7</A>, &amp;c.). The greater were God's favors to them from the first, the fouler was their ingratitude in forsaking Him (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#003">Jer 2:3</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#005">Jer 2:5</A>, &amp;c.). 
<p>
<p>espousals--the intervals between Israel's betrothal to God at the exodus from Egypt, and the formal execution of the marriage contract at Sinai. EWALD takes the "kindness" and "love" to be Israel's towards God at first (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#008">Exo 19:8</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#003">Exo 24:3</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#020">Exo 35:20-29</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#005">Exo 36:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#016">Jos 24:16-17</A>). But compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#016">Deu 32:16-17</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#005">Eze 16:5-6</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#015">Eze 16:15</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#022">Eze 16:22</A> ("days of thy youth") implies that the love here meant was on God's side, not Israel's. 
<p>
<p>thou wentest after me in . . . wilderness--the next act of God's love, His leading them in the desert without needing any strange god, such as they since worshipped, to help Him (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#007">Deu 2:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#012">Deu 32:12</A>). <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#006">Jer 2:6</A> shows it is God's "leading" of them, not their following after God in the wilderness, which is implied.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">jer 2:3</A></FONT></span></p>holiness unto the Lord--that is, was consecrated to the service of Jehovah (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005">Exo 19:5-6</A>). They thus answered to the motto on their high priest's breastplate, "Holiness to the Lord" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#006">Deu 7:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#002">Deu 14:2</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#021">Deu 14:21</A>). 
<p>
<p>first-fruits of his increase--that is, of Jehovah's produce. As the first-fruits of the whole produce of the land were devoted to God (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#019">Exo 23:19</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#012">Num 18:12-13</A>), so Israel was devoted to Him as the first-fruit and representative nation among all nations. So the spiritual Israel (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#018">Jam 1:18</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#004">Rev 14:4</A>). 
<p>
<p>devour--carrying on the image of first-fruits which were eaten before the Lord by the priests as the Lord's representatives; all who ate (injured) Jehovah's first-fruits (Israel), contracted guilt: for example, Amalek, the Amorites, &amp;c., were extirpated for their guilt towards Israel. 
<p>
<p>shall come--rather, "came."
<p>

<p>
<p>families--(See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#015">Jer 1:15</A>). Hear God's word not only collectively, but individually (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#012">Zac 12:12-14</A>).

<p>
<p>walked after vanity--contrasted with "walkest after me in the wilderness" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#002">Jer 2:2</A>): then I was their guide in the barren desert; now they take idols as their guides. 
<p>
<p>vanity . . . vain--An idol is not only vain (impotent and empty), but vanity itself. Its worshippers acquire its character, becoming vain as it is (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#026">Deu 7:26</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#008">Psa 115:8</A>). A people's character never rises above that of its gods, which are its "better nature" [BACON] (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#015">Kg2 17:15</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jon002.htm#008">Jon 2:8</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#006">Jeremiah 2:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">jer 2:6</A></FONT></span></p>Neither said they, Where, &amp;c.--The very words which God uses (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#009">Isa 63:9</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#011">Isa 63:11</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#013">Isa 63:13</A>), when, as it were, reminding Himself of His former acts of love to Israel as a ground for interposing in their behalf again. When they would not say, Where is Jehovah, &amp;c., God Himself at last said it for them (compare see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#002">Jer 2:2</A>). 
<p>
<p>deserts . . . pits--The desert between Mount Sinai and Palestine abounds in chasms and pits, in which beasts of burden often sink down to the knees. "Shadow of death" refers to the darkness of the caverns amidst the rocky precipices (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#015">Deu 8:15</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#010">Deu 32:10</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#007">Jeremiah 2:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">jer 2:7</A></FONT></span></p>plentiful--literally, "a land of Carmel," or "well-cultivated land": a garden land, in contrast to the "land of deserts" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#006">Jer 2:6</A>). 
<p>
<p>defiled--by idolatries (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#010">Jdg 2:10-17</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#058">Psa 78:58-59</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#038">Psa 106:38</A>). 
<p>
<p>you . . . ye--change to the second person from the third, "they" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#006">Jer 2:6</A>), in order to bring home the guilt to the living generation.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#008">Jeremiah 2:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">jer 2:8</A></FONT></span></p>The three leading classes, whose very office under the theocracy was to lead the people to God, disowned Him in the same language as the nation at large, "Where is the Lord?" (See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#006">Jer 2:6</A>). 
<p>
<p>priests--whose office it was to expound the law (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#006">Mal 2:6-7</A>). 
<p>
<p>handle--are occupied with the law as the subject of their profession. 
<p>
<p>pastors--civil, not religious: princes (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#015">Jer 3:15</A>), whose duty it was to tend their people. 
<p>
<p>prophets--who should have reclaimed the people from their apostasy, encouraged them in it by pretended oracles from Baal, the Ph&Aring;&#147;nician false god. 
<p>
<p>by Baal--in his name and by his authority (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#021">Jer 11:21</A>). 
<p>
<p>walked after things . . . not profit--answering to, "walked after vanity," that is, idols (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#005">Jer 2:5</A>; compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#011">Jer 2:11</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#018">Hab 2:18</A>).

<p>
<p>children's children--Three manuscripts and JEROME omit "children's"; they seem to have thought it unsuitable to read "children's children," when "children" had not preceded. But it is designedly so written, to intimate that the final judgment on the nation would be suspended for many generations [HORSLEY]. (Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#035">Eze 20:35-36</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#002">Mic 6:2</A>).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">jer 2:10</A></FONT></span></p>pass over the isles--rather, "cross over to the isles." 
<p>
<p>Chittim . . . Kedar--that is, the heathen nations, west and east. Go where you will, you cannot find an instance of any heathen nation forsaking their own for other gods. Israel alone does this. Yet the heathen gods are false gods; whereas Israel, in forsaking Me for other gods, forsake their "glory" for unprofitable idols. 
<p>
<p>Chittim--Cyprus, colonized by Ph&Aring;&#147;nicians, who built in it the city of Citium, the modern Chitti. Then the term came to be applied to all maritime coasts of the Mediterranean, especially Greece (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#024">Num 24:24</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#001">Isa 23:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#030">Dan 11:30</A>). 
<p>
<p>Kedar--descended from Ishmael; the Bedouins and Arabs, east of Palestine.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#011">Jeremiah 2:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">jer 2:11</A></FONT></span></p>glory--Jehovah, the glory of Israel (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#020">Psa 106:20</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#023">Rom 1:23</A>). The Shekinah, or cloud resting on the sanctuary, was the symbol of "the glory of the Lord" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#011">Kg1 8:11</A>; compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#004">Rom 9:4</A>). The golden calf was intended as an image of the true God (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#004">Exo 32:4-5</A>), yet it is called an "idol" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#041">Act 7:41</A>). It (like Roman Catholic images) was a violation of the second commandment, as the heathen multiplying of gods is a violation of the first. 
<p>
<p>not profit-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#008">Jer 2:8</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#012">Jeremiah 2:12</A></p>

<p>
<p>horribly afraid--rather, be horrified." 
<p>
<p>be . . . very desolate--rather, "be exceedingly aghast" at the monstrous spectacle. Literally, "to be dried up," or "devastated," (places devastated have such an unsightly look) [MAURER].
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#013">Jeremiah 2:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">jer 2:13</A></FONT></span></p>two evils--not merely one evil, like the idolaters who know no better; besides simple idolatry, My people add the sin of forsaking the true God whom they have known; the heathen, though having the sin of idolatry, are free from the further sin of changing the true God for idols (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#011">Jer 2:11</A>). 
<p>
<p>forsaken me--The Hebrew collocation brings out the only living God into more prominent contrast with idol nonentities. "Me they have forsaken, the Fountain," &amp;c. (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#013">Jer 17:13</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#009">Psa 36:9</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#014">Joh 4:14</A>). 
<p>
<p>broken cisterns--tanks for rain water, common in the East, where wells are scarce. The tanks not only cannot give forth an ever-flowing fresh supply as fountains can, but cannot even retain the water poured into them; the stonework within being broken, the earth drinks up the collected water. So, in general, all earthly, compared with heavenly, means of satisfying man's highest wants (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#001">Isa 55:1-2</A>; compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#033">Luk 12:33</A>).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">jer 2:14</A></FONT></span></p>is he a homeborn slave--No. "Israel is Jehovah's son, even His first-born" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#022">Exo 4:22</A>). <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#016">Jer 2:16</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#018">Jer 2:18</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#036">Jer 2:36</A>, and the absence of any express contrast of the two parts of the nation are against EICHORN'S view, that the prophet proposes to Judah, as yet spared, the case of Israel (the ten tribes) which had been carried away by Assyria as a warning of what they might expect if they should still put their trust in Egypt. "Were Israel's ten tribes of meaner birth than Judah? Certainly not. If, then, the former fell before Assyria, what can Judah hope from Egypt against Assyria? . . . Israel" is rather here the whole of the remnant still left in their own land, that is, Judah. "How comes it to pass that the nation which once was under God's special protection (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#003">Jer 2:3</A>) is now left at the mercy of the foe as a worthless slave?" The prophet sees this event as if present, though it was still future to Judah (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#019">Jer 2:19</A>).

The disaster from the Babylonians in the fourth year of Jehoiakim's reign, and again three years later when, relying on Egypt, he revolted from Nebuchadnezzar, is here referred to (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#002">Jer 46:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#001">Kg2 24:1-2</A>).

Tahapanes--Memphis, capital of Lower Egypt, on the west bank of the Nile, near the pyramids of Gizeh, opposite the site of modern Cairo. Daphne, on the Tanitic branch of the Nile, near Pelusium, on the frontier of Egypt towards Palestine. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#004">Isa 30:4</A> contracts it, Hanes. These two cities, one the capital, the other that with which the Jews came most in contact, stand for the whole of Egypt. Tahapanes takes its name from a goddess, Tphnet [CHAMPOLLION]. Memphis is from Man-nofri, "the abode of good men"; written in Hebrew, Moph (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#006">Hos 9:6</A>), or Noph. The reference is to the coming invasion of Judah by Pharaoh-necho of Egypt, on his return from the Euphrates, when he deposed Jehoahaz and levied a heavy tribute on the land (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#033">Kg2 23:33-35</A>). Josiah's death in battle with the same Pharaoh is probably included (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#029">Kg2 23:29-30</A>). 
<p>
<p>have broken--rather, shall feed down the crown, &amp;c., that is, affect with the greatest ignominy, such as baldness was regarded in the East (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#037">Jer 48:37</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#023">Kg2 2:23</A>). Instead of "also," translate, "even" the Egyptians, in whom thou dost trust, shall miserably disappoint thy expectation [MAURER]. Jehoiakim was twice leagued with them (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#034">Kg2 23:34-35</A>): when he received the crown from them, and when he revolted from Nebuchadnezzar (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#001">Kg2 24:1-2</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#007">Kg2 24:7</A>). The Chaldeans, having become masters of Asia, threatened Egypt. Judea, situated between the contending powers, was thus exposed to the inroads of the one or other of the hostile armies; and unfortunately, except in Josiah's reign, took side with Egypt, contrary to God's warnings.

<p>Sihor--that is, the black river, in Greek, Melas ("black"), the Nile: so called from the black deposit or soil it leaves after the inundation (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#003">Isa 23:3</A>). The Septuagint identifies it with Gihon, one of the rivers of Paradise. 
<p>
<p>the river--Euphrates, called by pre-eminence, the river; figurative for the Assyrian power. In 625 B.C., the seventeenth year of Josiah, and the fourth of Jeremiah's office, the kingdom of Assyria fell before Babylon, therefore Assyria is here put for Babylon its successor: so in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#029">Kg2 23:29</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#006">Lam 5:6</A>.

<p>backslidings--"apostasies"; plural, to express the number and variety of their defections.

<p>thy yoke . . . bands--the yoke and bands which I laid on thee, My laws (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#005">Jer 5:5</A>). 
<p>
<p>transgress--so the Keri, and many manuscripts read. But the Septuagint and most authorities read, "I will not serve," that is, obey. The sense of English Version is, "I broke thy yoke (in Egypt)," &amp;c., "and (at that time) thou saidst, I will not transgress; whereas thou hast (since then) wandered (from Me)" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#008">Exo 19:8</A>).

<p>
<p>soap--potash, the carbonate of which is obtained impure from burning different plants, especially the kali of Egypt and Arabia. Mixed with oil it was used for washing. 
<p>
<p>marked--deeply ingrained, indelibly marked; the Hebrew, catham, being equivalent to cathab. Others translate, "is treasured up," from the Arabic. MAURER from a Syriac root, "is polluted."

<p>Baalim--plural, to express manifold excellency: compare Elohim.

<p>see--consider. 
<p>
<p>the valley--namely, of Hinnom, or Tophet, south and east of Jerusalem: rendered infamous by the human sacrifices to Moloch in it (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#002">Jer 19:2</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#006">Jer 19:6</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#013">Jer 19:13-14</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#035">Jer 32:35</A>; see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#033">Isa 30:33</A>).

<p>thou art--omit. The substantive that follows in this verse (and also that in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#024">Jer 2:24</A>) is in apposition with the preceding "thou." 
<p>
<p>dromedary--rather, a "young she-camel." 
<p>
<p>traversing--literally, "enfolding"; making its ways complicated by wandering hither and thither, lusting after the male. Compare as to the Jews' spiritual lust, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#006">Hos 2:6-7</A>.

"A wild ass," agreeing with "thou" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#023">Jer 2:23</A>).

<p>at her pleasure--rather, "in her ardor," namely, in pursuit of a male, sniffing the wind to ascertain where one is to be found [MAURER]. 
<p>
<p>occasion--either from a Hebrew root, "to meet"; "her meeting (with the male for sexual intercourse), who can avert it?" Or better from an Arabic root: "her heat (sexual impulse), who can allay it?" [MAURER]. 
<p>
<p>all they--whichever of the males desire her company [HORSLEY]. 
<p>
<p>will not weary themselves--have no need to weary themselves in searching for her.

<p>
<p>unshod, &amp;c.--do not run so violently in pursuing lovers, as to wear out thy shoes: do not "thirst" so incontinently after sexual intercourse. HITZIG thinks the reference is to penances performed barefoot to idols, and the thirst occasioned by loud and continued invocations to them. 
<p>
<p>no hope-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#012">Jer 18:12</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#010">Isa 57:10</A>). "It is hopeless," that is, I am desperately resolved to go on in my own course.
