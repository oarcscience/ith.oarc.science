<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#001">Jeremiah 12:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">jer 12:1</A></FONT></span></p>CONTINUATION OF THE SUBJECT AT THE CLOSE OF THE ELEVENTH CHAPTER. (Jer. 12:1-17)
<p>
<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#004">Psa 51:4</A>). 
<p>
<p>let me talk, &amp;c.--only let me reason the case with Thee: inquire of Thee the causes why such wicked men as these plotters against my life prosper (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#006">Job 12:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#007">Job 21:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#001">Psa 37:1</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#035">Psa 37:35</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#003">Psa 73:3</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#015">Mal 3:15</A>). It is right, when hard thoughts of God's providence suggest themselves, to fortify our minds by justifying God beforehand (as did Jeremiah), even before we hear the reasons of His dealings.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#002">Jeremiah 12:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">jer 12:2</A></FONT></span></p>grow--literally "go on," "progress." Thou givest them sure dwellings and increasing prosperity. 
<p>
<p>near in . . . mouth . . . far from . . . reins-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#013">Isa 29:13</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#008">Mat 15:8</A>). Hypocrites.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#003">Jeremiah 12:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">jer 12:3</A></FONT></span></p>knowest me-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#001">Psa 139:1</A>). 
<p>
<p>tried . . . heart-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#020">Jer 11:20</A>). 
<p>
<p>toward thee--rather, "with Thee," that is, entirely devoted to Thee; contrasted with the hypocrites (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#002">Jer 12:2</A>), "near in . . . mouth, and far from . . . reins." This being so, how is it that I fare so ill, they so well? 
<p>
<p>pull . . . out--containing the metaphor, from a "rooted tree" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#002">Jer 12:2</A>). 
<p>
<p>prepare--literally, "separate," or "set apart as devoted." 
<p>
<p>day of slaughter-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#005">Jam 5:5</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#004">Jeremiah 12:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">jer 12:4</A></FONT></span></p>land mourn--personification (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#002">Jer 14:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#010">Jer 23:10</A>). 
<p>
<p>for the wickedness-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#034">Psa 107:34</A>). 
<p>
<p>beasts-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#003">Hos 4:3</A>). 
<p>
<p>He shall not see our last end--Jehovah knows not what is about to happen to us (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#012">Jer 5:12</A>) [ROSENMULLER]. So the Septuagint. (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#011">Psa 10:11</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#012">Eze 8:12</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#009">Eze 9:9</A>). Rather, "The prophet (Jeremiah, to whom the whole context refers) shall not see our last end." We need not trouble ourselves about his boding predictions. We shall not be destroyed as he says (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#012">Jer 5:12-13</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#005">Jeremiah 12:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">jer 12:5</A></FONT></span></p>Jehovah's reply to Jeremiah's complaint. 
<p>
<p>horses--that is, horsemen: the argument a fortiori. A proverbial phrase. The injuries done thee by the men of Anathoth ("the footmen") are small compared with those which the men of Jerusalem ("the horsemen") are about to inflict on thee. If the former weary thee out, how wilt thou contend with the king, the court, and the priests at Jerusalem? 
<p>
<p>wherein thou trustedst, they wearied thee--English Version thus fills up the sentence with the italicized words, to answer to the parallel clause in the first sentence of the verse. The parallelism is, however, sufficiently retained with a less ellipsis: "If (it is only) in a land of peace thou art confident" [MAURER]. 
<p>
<p>swelling of Jordan--In harvest-time and earlier (April and May) it overflows its banks (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#015">Jos 3:15</A>), and fills the valley called the Ghor. Or, "the pride of Jordan," namely, its wooded banks abounding in lions and other wild beasts (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#019">Jer 49:19</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#044">Jer 50:44</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#003">Zac 11:3</A>; compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#002">Kg2 6:2</A>). MAUNDRELL says that between the Sea of Tiberias and Lake Merom the banks are so wooded that the traveller cannot see the river at all without first passing through the woods. If in the campaign country (alone) thou art secure, how wilt thou do when thou fallest into the wooded haunts of wild beasts?
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#006">Jeremiah 12:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">jer 12:6</A></FONT></span></p>even thy brethren--as in Christ's case (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#008">Psa 69:8</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#011">Joh 1:11</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#005">Joh 7:5</A>; compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#004">Jer 9:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#019">Jer 11:19</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#021">Jer 11:21</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#036">Mat 10:36</A>). Godly faithfulness is sure to provoke the ungodly, even of one's own family. 
<p>
<p>called a multitude after thee-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#004">Isa 31:4</A>). JEROME translates, "cry after thee with a loud (literally, 'full') voice." 
<p>
<p>believe . . . not . . . though . . . speak fair-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#025">Pro 26:25</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#007">Jeremiah 12:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">jer 12:7</A></FONT></span></p>I have forsaken--Jehovah will forsake His temple and the people peculiarly His. The mention of God's close tie to them, as heretofore His, aggravates their ingratitude, and shows that their past spiritual privileges will not prevent God from punishing them. 
<p>
<p>beloved of my soul--image from a wife (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#015">Jer 11:15</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#005">Isa 54:5</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#008">Jeremiah 12:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">jer 12:8</A></FONT></span></p>is unto me--is become unto Me: behaves towards Me as a lion which roars against a man, so that he withdraws from the place where he hears it: so I withdrew from My people, once beloved, but now an object of abhorrence because of their rebellious cries against Me.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#009">Jeremiah 12:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">jer 12:9</A></FONT></span></p>speckled bird--Many translate, "a ravenous beast, the hyena"; the corresponding Arabic word means hyena; so the Septuagint. But the Hebrew always elsewhere means "a bird of prey." The Hebrew for "speckled" is from a root "to color"; answering to the Jewish blending together with paganism the altogether diverse Mosaic ritual. The neighboring nations, birds of prey like herself (for she had sinfully assimilated herself to them), were ready to pounce upon her. 
<p>
<p>assemble . . . beasts of . . . field--The Chaldeans are told to gather the surrounding heathen peoples as allies against Judah (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#009">Isa 56:9</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#005">Eze 34:5</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#010">Jeremiah 12:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">jer 12:10</A></FONT></span></p>pastors--the Babylonian leaders (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#012">Jer 12:12</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#003">Jer 6:3</A>). 
<p>
<p>my vineyard-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#001">Isa 5:1</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#005">Isa 5:5</A>). 
<p>
<p>trodden my portion-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#018">Isa 63:18</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#011">Jeremiah 12:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">jer 12:11</A></FONT></span></p>mourneth unto me--that is, before Me. EICHORN translates, "by reason of Me," because I have given it to desolation (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#007">Jer 12:7</A>). 
<p>
<p>because no man layeth it to heart--because none by repentance and prayer seek to deprecate God's wrath. Or, "yet none lays it to heart"; as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#003">Jer 5:3</A> [CALVIN].
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#012">Jeremiah 12:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">jer 12:12</A></FONT></span></p>high places--Before, He had threatened the plains; now, the hills. 
<p>
<p>wilderness--not an uninhabited desert, but high lands of pasturage, lying between Judea and Chaldea (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#011">Jer 4:11</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#013">Jeremiah 12:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">jer 12:13</A></FONT></span></p>Description in detail of the devastation of the land (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#015">Mic 6:15</A>). 
<p>
<p>they shall be ashamed of your--The change of persons, in passing from indirect to direct address, is frequent in the prophets. Equivalent to, "Ye shall be put to the shame of disappointment at the smallness of your produce."
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#014">Jeremiah 12:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">jer 12:14</A></FONT></span></p>Prophecy as to the surrounding nations, the Syrians, Ammonites, &amp;c., who helped forward Judah's calamity: they shall share her fall; and, on their conversion, they shall share with her in the future restoration. This is a brief anticipation of the predictions in the forty-seventh, forty-eighth, and forty-ninth chapters. 
<p>
<p>touch-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#008">Zac 2:8</A>). 
<p>
<p>pluck them out . . . pluck out . . . Judah--(Compare end of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#016">Jer 12:16</A>). During the thirteen years that the Babylonians besieged Tyre, Nebuchadnezzar, after subduing C&Aring;&#147;lo-Syria, brought Ammon, Moab, &amp;c., and finally Egypt, into subjection [JOSEPHUS, Antiquities, 10:9.7]. On the restoration of these nations, they were to exchange places with the Jews. The latter were now in the midst of them, but on their restoration they were to be "in the midst of the Jews," that is, as proselytes to the true God (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#007">Mic 5:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#016">Zac 14:16</A>). "Pluck them," namely, the Gentile nations: in a bad sense. "Pluck Judah": in a good sense; used to express the force which was needed to snatch Judah from the tyranny of those nations by whom they had been made captives, or to whom they had fled; otherwise they never would have let Judah go. Previously he had been forbidden to pray for the mass of the Jewish people. But here he speaks consolation to the elect remnant among them. Whatever the Jews might be, God keeps His covenant.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#015">Jeremiah 12:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">jer 12:15</A></FONT></span></p>A promise, applying to Judah, as well as to the nations specified (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#014">Amo 9:14</A>). As to Moab, compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#047">Jer 48:47</A>; as to Ammon, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#006">Jer 49:6</A>.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#016">Jeremiah 12:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">jer 12:16</A></FONT></span></p>swear by my name-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#002">Jer 4:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#018">Isa 19:18</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#016">Isa 65:16</A>); that is, confess solemnly the true God. 
<p>
<p>built--be made spiritually and temporally prosperous: fixed in sure habitations (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#006">Jer 24:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#010">Jer 42:10</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer045.htm#004">Jer 45:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#004">Psa 87:4-5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#020">Eph 2:20-21</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005">Pe1 2:5</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#017">Jeremiah 12:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">jer 12:17</A></FONT></span></p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#012">Isa 60:12</A>).
<p>
<p>Many of these figurative acts being either not possible, or not probable, or decorous, seem to have existed only in the mind of the prophet as part of his inward vision. [So CALVIN]. The world he moved in was not the sensible, but the spiritual, world. Inward acts were, however, when it was possible and proper, materialized by outward performance but not always, and necessarily so. The internal act made a naked statement more impressive and presented the subject when extending over long portions of space and time more concentrated. The interruption of Jeremiah's official duty by a journey of more than two hundred miles twice is not likely to have literally taken place.
