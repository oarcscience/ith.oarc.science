Gittith--(See on [Psa 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#001), title). A
festal Psalm, probably for the passover (compare [Mat
26:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#030)), in which, after an exhortation
to praise God, He is introduced, reminding Israel of their obligations,
chiding their neglect, and depicting the happy results of obedience.

a testimony--The feasts, especially the passover, attested God's
relation to His people.

Joseph--for Israel ([Psa 80:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#001)).

went out through--or, "over," that is, Israel in the exodus.

I heard--change of person. The writer speaks for the nation.

language--literally, "lip" ([Psa
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001)). An aggravation or element of
their distress that their oppressors were foreigners ([Deu
28:49](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#049)).

[Psalms 81:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 81:6</span></span>

God's language alludes to the burdensome slavery of the Israelites.

[Psalms 81:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 81:7</span></span>

14:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#024)).

proved thee-- ([Psa 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#010); [Psa
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#003)) --tested their faith by the
miracle.

[Psalms 81:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 81:8</span></span>

(Compare [Psa 50:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#007)). The reproof
follows to [Psa 81:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#012).

if thou wilt hearken--He then propounds the terms of His covenant: they
should worship Him alone, who ([Psa
81:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#010)) had delivered them, and would
still confer all needed blessings.

[Psalms 81:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 81:11</span></span>

They failed, and He gave them up to their own desires and hardness of
heart ([Deu 29:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#018); [Pro
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#030); [Rom
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#025)).

[Psalms 81:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 81:13</span></span>

Obedience would have secured all promised blessings and the subjection
of foes. In this passage, "should have," "would have," &c., are better,
"should" and "would" expressing God's intention at the time, that is,
when they left Egypt.
