### [Jeremiah Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 26:2</span></span>

JEREMIAH DECLARED WORTHY OF DEATH, BUT BY THE INTERPOSITION OF AHIKAM
SAVED; THE SIMILAR CASES OF MICAH AND URIJAH BEING ADDUCED IN THE
PROPHET'S FAVOR. (Jer. 26:1-24)

in the court--the largest court, from which he could be heard by the
whole people.

come to worship--Worship is vain without obedience ([Sa1
15:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#021)).

all the words-- ([Eze 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#010)).

diminish not a word-- ([Deu 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#002); [Deu
12:32](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#032); [Pro
30:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#006); [Act
20:27](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#027); [Co2
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#017); [Co2
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#002); [Rev
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#019)). Not suppressing or softening
aught for fear of giving offense; nor setting forth coldly and
indirectly what can only by forcible statement do good.

[Jeremiah 26:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 26:3</span></span>

if so be--expressed according to human conceptions; not as if God did
not foreknow all contingencies, but to mark the obstinacy of the people
and the difficulty of healing them; and to show His own goodness in
making the offer which left them without excuse \[CALVIN\].

[Jeremiah 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 26:5</span></span>

prophets--the inspired interpreters of the law ([Jer
26:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#004)), who adapted it to the use of
the people.

[Jeremiah 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 26:6</span></span>

like Shiloh--(see on [Jer 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#012); [Jer
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#014); [Sa1
4:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#010); [Psa
78:60](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#060)).

curse-- ([Jer 24:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#009); [Isa
65:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#015)).

[Jeremiah 26:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 26:8</span></span>

priests--The captain (or prefect) of the temple had the power of
apprehending offenders in the temple with the sanction of the priests.

prophets--the false prophets. The charge against Jeremiah was that of
uttering falsehood in Jehovah's name, an act punishable with death ([Deu
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#020)). His prophecy against the
temple and city ([Jer 26:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#011)) might
speciously be represented as contradicting God's own words ([Psa
132:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#014)). Compare the similar charge
against Stephen ([Act 6:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#013)).

[Jeremiah 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 26:10</span></span>

princes--members of the Council of State or Great Council, which took
cognizance of such offenses.

heard--the clamor of the popular tumult.

came up--from the king's house to the temple, which stood higher than
the palace.

sat--as judges, in the gate, the usual place of trying such cases.

new gate--originally built by Jotham ("the higher gate," [Kg2
15:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#035)) and now recently restored.

[Jeremiah 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 26:12</span></span>

Lord sent me--a valid justification against any laws alleged against
him.

against . . . against--rather, "concerning." Jeremiah purposely avoids
saying, "against," which would needlessly irritate. They had used the
same Hebrew word ([Jer 26:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#011)), which
ought to be translated "concerning," though they meant it in the
unfavorable sense. Jeremiah takes up their word in a better sense,
implying that there is still room for repentance: that his prophecies
aim at the real good of the city; for or concerning this house . . .
city \[GROTIUS\].

[Jeremiah 26:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 26:13</span></span>

([Jer 26:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#003), [Jer
26:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#019)).

[Jeremiah 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 26:14</span></span>

Jeremiah's humility is herein shown, and submission to the powers that
be ([Rom 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#001)).

[Jeremiah 26:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 26:15</span></span>

bring . . . upon yourselves--So far will you be from escaping the
predicted evils by shedding my blood, that you will, by that very act,
only incur heavier penalties ([Mat
23:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#035)).

[Jeremiah 26:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 26:16</span></span>

princes . . . all the people--The fickle people, as they were previously
influenced by the priests to clamor for his death ([Jer
26:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#008)), so now under the princes'
influence require that he shall not be put to death. Compare as to
Jesus, Jeremiah's antitype, the hosannas of the multitude a few days
before the same people, persuaded by the priests as in this case, cried,
Away with Him, crucify Him ([Mat
21:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#001); [Mat
27:20-25](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#020)). The priests, through envy
of his holy zeal, were more his enemies than the princes, whose office
was more secular than religious. A prophet could not legally be put to
death unless he prophesied in the name of other gods (therefore, they
say, "in the name of the Lord"), or after his prophecy had failed in its
accomplishment. Meanwhile, if he foretold calamity, he might be
imprisoned. Compare Micaiah's case (1Ki. 22:1-28).

[Jeremiah 26:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 26:17</span></span>

Compare Gamaliel's interposition ([Act
5:34](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#034), &c.).

elders--some of the "princes" mentioned ([Jer
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#016)) those whose age, as well as
dignity, would give weight to the precedents of past times which they
adduce.

[Jeremiah 26:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 26:18</span></span>

([Mic 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#012)).

Morasthite--called so from a village of the tribe Judah.

Hezekiah--The precedent in the reign of such a good king proved that
Jeremiah was not the only prophet, or the first, who threatened the city
and the temple without incurring death.

mountain of the house--Moriah, on which stood the temple (peculiarly
called "the house") shall be covered with woods instead of buildings.
Jeremiah, in quoting previous prophecies, never does so without
alteration; he adapts the language to his own style, showing thereby his
authority in his treatment of Scripture, as being himself inspired.

[Jeremiah 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 26:19</span></span>

Hezekiah, so far from killing him, was led "to fear the Lord," and pray
for remission of the sentence against Judah ([Ch2
32:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#026)).

Lord repented-- ([Exo 32:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#014); [Sa2
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#016)).

Thus--if we kill Jeremiah.

[Jeremiah 26:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 26:20</span></span>

As the flight and capture of Urijah must have occupied some time, "the
beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim" ([Jer
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#001)) must not mean the very
beginning, but the second or third year of his eleven years' reign.

And . . . also--perhaps connected with [Jer
26:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#024), as the comment of the writer,
not the continuation of the speech of the elders: "And although also a
man that prophesied . . . Urijah . . . (proving how great was the danger
in which Jeremiah stood, and how wonderful the providence of God in
preserving him), nevertheless the hand of Ahikam," &c. \[GLASSIUS\]. The
context, however, implies rather that the words are the continuation of
the previous speech of the elders. They adduce another instance besides
that of Micah, though of a different kind, namely, that of Urijah: he
suffered for his prophecies, but they imply, though they do not venture
to express it, that thereby sin has been added to sin, and that it has
done no good to Jehoiakim, for that the notorious condition of the state
at this time shows that a heavier vengeance is impending if they
persevere in such acts of violence \[CALVIN\].

[Jeremiah 26:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 26:22</span></span>

Jehoiakim sent . . . into Egypt--He had been put on the throne by
Pharaoh of Egypt ([Kg2 23:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#034)). This
explains the readiness with which he got the Egyptians to give up Urijah
to him, when that prophet had sought an asylum in Egypt. Urijah was
faithful in delivering his message, but faulty in leaving his work, so
God permitted him to lose his life, while Jeremiah was protected in
danger. The path of duty is often the path of safety.

[Jeremiah 26:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 26:23</span></span>

graves of the common people--literally, "sons of the people" (compare
[Kg2 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#006)). The prophets seem to have
had a separate cemetery ([Mat 23:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#029)).
Urijah's corpse was denied this honor, in order that he should not be
regarded as a true prophet.

[Jeremiah 26:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jer 26:24</span></span>

Ahikam--son of Shaphan the scribe, or royal secretary. He was one of
those whom King Josiah, when struck by the words of the book of the law,
sent to inquire of the Lord ([Kg2
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#012), [Kg2
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#014)). Hence his interference here in
behalf of Jeremiah is what we should expect from his past association
with that good king. His son, Gedaliah, followed in his father's steps,
so that he was chosen by the Babylonians as the one to whom they
committed Jeremiah for safety after taking Jerusalem, and on whose
loyalty they could depend in setting him over the remnant of the people
in Judea ([Jer 39:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#014); [Kg2
25:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#022)).

people to put him to death--Princes often, when they want to destroy a
good man, prefer it to be done by a popular tumult rather than by their
own order, so as to reap the fruit of the crime without odium to
themselves ([Mat 27:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#020)).
