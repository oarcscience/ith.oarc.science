### [Song of Solomon (Canticles) Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#001)

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sol 3:1</span></span>

By night--literally, "By nights." Continuation of the longing for the
dawn of the Messiah ([Sol 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#017); [Psa
130:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#006); [Mal
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#002)). The spiritual desertion here
([Sol 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#017); [Sol
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#005)) is not due to indifference, as in
[Sol 5:2-8](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#002). "As nights and dews are
better for flowers than a continual sun, so Christ's absence (at times)
giveth sap to humility, and putteth an edge on hunger, and furnisheth a
fair field to faith to put forth itself" \[RUTHERFORD\]. Contrast [Sol
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#013); [Psa
30:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#006).

on . . . bed--the secret of her failure ([Isa
64:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#007); [Jer
29:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#013); [Amo
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#001), [Amo
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#004); [Hos
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#014)).

loveth--no want of sincerity, but of diligence, which she now makes up
for by leaving her bed to seek Him ([Psa
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#002); [Psa
63:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#008); [Isa
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#009); [Joh
20:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#017)). Four times ([Sol
3:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#001)) she calls Jesus Christ, "Him
whom my soul loveth," designating Him as absent; language of desire: "He
loved me," would be language of present fruition ([Rev
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#005)). In questioning the watchmen
([Sol 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#003)), she does not even name
Him, so full is her heart of Him. Having found Him at dawn (for
throughout He is the morning), she charges the daughters not to abridge
by intrusion the period of His stay. Compare as to the thoughtful
seeking for Jesus Christ in the time of John the Baptist, in vain at
first, but presently after successful ([Luk
3:15-22](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#015); John 1:19-34).

found him not--Oh, for such honest dealings with ourselves ([Pro
25:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#014); [Jde
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#012))!

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sol 3:2</span></span>

Wholly awake for God ([Luk 14:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#018);
[Eph 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#014)). "An honest resolution is
often to (the doing of) duty, like a needle that draws the thread after
it" \[DURHAM\]. Not a mere wish, that counts not the cost--to leave her
easy bed, and wander in the dark night seeking Him ([Pro
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#004); [Mat
21:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#030); [Luk
14:27-33](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#027)).

the city--Jerusalem, literally ([Mat
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#005); [Joh
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#019)), and spiritually the Church here
([Heb 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#022)), in glory ([Rev
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#002)).

broad ways--open spaces at the gates of Eastern cities, where the public
assembled for business. So, the assemblies of worshippers ([Sol
8:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#002); [Pro
1:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#020); [Heb
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#025)). She had in her first awakening
shrunk from them, seeking Jesus Christ alone; but she was desired to
seek the footsteps of the flock ([Sol
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#008)), so now in her second trial she
goes forth to them of herself. "The more the soul grows in grace, and
the less it leans on ordinances, the more it prizes and profits by them"
\[MOODY STUART\] ([Psa 73:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#016)).

found him not--Nothing short of Jesus Christ can satisfy her ([Job
23:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#008); [Psa
63:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#001)).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sol 3:3</span></span>

watchmen--ministers ([Isa 62:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#006); [Jer
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#017); [Eze
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#017); [Heb
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#017)), fit persons to consult ([Isa
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#011); [Mal
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#007)).

found me--the general ministry of the Word "finds" individually souls in
quest of Jesus Christ ([Gen 24:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#027), end
of verse [Act 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#014)); whereas
formalists remain unaffected.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sol 3:4</span></span>

Jesus Christ is generally "found" near the watchmen and means of grace;
but they are not Himself; the star that points to Beth-lehem is not the
Sun that has risen there; she hastens past the guideposts to the goal
\[MOODY STUART\]. Not even angels could satisfy Mary, instead of Jesus
Christ ([Joh 20:11-16](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#011)).

found him-- ([Isa 45:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#019); [Hos
6:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#001); [Mat
13:44-46](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#044)).

held him, &c.--willing to be held; not willing, if not held ([Gen
32:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#026); [Mat
28:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#009); [Luk
24:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#028); [Rev
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#011)). "As a little weeping child will
hold its mother fast, not because it is stronger than she, but because
her bowels constrain her not to leave it; so Jesus Christ yearning over
the believer cannot go, because He will not" \[DURHAM\]. In [Sol
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#004) it is He who leads the bride into
His chambers; here it is she who leads Him into her mother's. There are
times when the grace of Jesus Christ seems to draw us to Him; and
others, when we with strong cries draw Him to us and ours. In the East
one large apartment often serves for the whole family; so the bride here
speaks of her mother's apartment and her own together. The mention of
the "mother" excludes impropriety, and imparts the idea of heavenly
love, pure as a sister's, while ardent as a bride's; hence the frequent
title, "my sister--spouse." Our mother after the Spirit, is the Church,
the new Jerusalem ([Joh 3:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#005); [Gal
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#019), [Gal
4:26](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#026)); for her we ought to pray
continually ([Eph 3:14-19](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#014)), also for
the national Jerusalem ([Isa 62:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#006);
[Rom 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#001)), also for the human family,
which is our mother and kindred after the flesh; these our mother's
children have evilly treated us ([Sol
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#006)); but, like our Father, we are to
return good for evil ([Mat 5:44-45](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#044)),
and so bring Jesus Christ home to them ([Pe1
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#012)).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sol 3:5</span></span>

So [Sol 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#007); but there it was for the
non-interruption of her own fellowship with Jesus Christ that she was
anxious; here it is for the not grieving of the Holy Ghost, on the part
of the daughters of Jerusalem. Jealously avoid levity, heedlessness, and
offenses which would mar the gracious work begun in others ([Mat
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#007); [Act
2:42-43](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#042); [Eph
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#030)).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sol 3:6</span></span>

(CANTICLE III)--THE BRIDEGROOM WITH THE BRIDE.

Historically, the ministry of Jesus Christ on earth. (Son. 3:6-5:1)

New scene ([Sol 3:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#006)). The friends
of the Bridegroom see a cortege approach. His palanquin and guard.

cometh out--rather, "up from"; the wilderness was lower than Jerusalem
\[MAURER\].

pillars of smoke--from the perfumes burned around Him and His bride.
Image from Israel and the tabernacle (answering to "bed," [Sol
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#007)) marching through the desert with
the pillar of smoke by day and fire by night ([Exo
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#020)), and the pillars of smoke
ascending from the altars of incense and of atonement; so Jesus Christ's
righteousness, atonement, and ever-living intercession. Balaam, the last
representative of patriarchism, was required to curse the Jewish Church,
just as it afterwards would not succumb to Christianity without a
struggle ([Num 22:41](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#041)), but he had to
bless in language like that here ([Num
24:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#005)). Angels too joyfully ask the
same question, when Jesus Christ with the tabernacle of His body
(answering to "His bed," [Sol 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#007);
[Joh 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014), "dwelt," Greek
"tabernacled," [Joh 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#021)) ascends into
heaven ([Psa 24:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#008)); also when they
see His glorious bride with Him ([Psa
68:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#018); [Rev
7:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#013)). Encouragement to her; amid
the darkest trials ([Sol 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#001)), she is
still on the road to glory ([Sol 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#011))
in a palanquin "paved with love" ([Sol
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#010)); she is now in soul spiritually
"coming," exhaling the sweet graces, faith, love, joy, peace, prayer,
and praise; (the fire is lighted within, the "smoke" is seen without,
[Act 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#013)); it is in the desert of
trial ([Sol 3:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#001)) she gets them; she
is the "merchant" buying from Jesus Christ without money or price ([Isa
55:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#001); [Rev
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#018)); just as myrrh and frankincense
are got, not in Egypt, but in the Arabian sands and the mountains of
Palestine. Hereafter she shall "come" ([Sol
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#006), [Sol
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#011)) in a glorified body, too ([Phi
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#021)). Historically, Jesus Christ
returning from the wilderness, full of the Holy Ghost ([Luk
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#001), [Luk
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#014)). The same, "Who is this," &c.
([Isa 63:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#001), [Isa
63:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#005)).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sol 3:7</span></span>

In [Sol 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#006) the wilderness character
of the Church is portrayed; in [Sol
3:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#007), its militant aspect. In [Sol
3:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#009), Jesus Christ is seen dwelling
in believers, who are His "chariot" and "body." In [Sol
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#011), the consummation in glory.

bed--palanquin. His body, literally, guarded by a definite number of
angels, threescore, or sixty ([Mat
26:53](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#053)), from the wilderness ([Mat
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#001), [Mat
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#011)), and continually ([Luk
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#013); [Luk
22:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#043); [Act
1:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#010)); just as six hundred thousand
of Israel guarded the Lord's tabernacle (Num. 2:17-32), one for every
ten thousand. In contrast to the "bed of sloth" ([Sol
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#001)).

valiant-- ([Jos 5:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#013)). Angels
guarding His tomb used like words ([Mar
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#006)).

of Israel--true subjects, not mercenaries.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sol 3:8</span></span>

hold--not actually grasping them, but having them girt on the thigh
ready for use, like their Lord ([Psa
45:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#003)). So believers too are guarded by
angels ([Psa 91:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#011); [Heb
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#014)), and they themselves need "every
man" ([Neh 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#018)) to be armed ([Psa
144:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#001); [Co2
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#004); [Eph
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#012), [Eph
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#017); [Ti1
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#012)), and "expert" ([Co2
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#011)).

because of fear in the night--Arab marauders often turn a wedding into
mourning by a night attack. So the bridal procession of saints in the
night of this wilderness is the chief object of Satan's assault.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sol 3:9</span></span>

chariot--more elaborately made than the "bed" or travelling litter ([Sol
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#007)), from a Hebrew root, "to
elaborate" \[EWALD\]. So the temple of "cedar of Lebanon," as compared
with the temporary tabernacle of shittim wood ([Sa2
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#002), [Sa2
7:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#006); [Kg1
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#014); [Kg1
6:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#015)), Jesus Christ's body is the
antitype, "made" by the Father for Him ([Co1
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#030); [Heb
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005)), the wood answering to His human
nature, the gold, His divine; the two being but one Christ.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sol 3:10</span></span>

pillars--supporting the canopy at the four corners; curtains at the side
protect the person within from the sun. Pillars with silver sockets
supported the veil that enclosed the holy of holies; emblem of Jesus
Christ's strength ([Kg1 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#021)), Margin,
"silver," emblem of His purity ([Psa
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#006)); so the saints hereafter ([Rev
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#012)).

bottom--rather, "the back for resting or reclining on" (Vulgate and
Septuagint) \[MAURER\]. So the floor and mercy seat, the resting-place
of God ([Psa 132:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#014)) in the temple,
was gold ([Kg1 6:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#030)).

covering--rather, "seat," as in [Lev
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#009). Hereafter the saints shall share
His seat ([Rev 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#021)).

purple--the veil of the holiest, partly purple, and the purple robe put
on Jesus Christ, accord with English Version, "covering." "Purple"
(including scarlet and crimson) is the emblem of royalty, and of His
blood; typified by the passover lamb's blood, and the wine when the
twelve sat or reclined at the Lord's table.

paved--translated, like mosaic pavement, with the various acts and
promises of love of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost ([Zep
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#017); [Jo1
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#008), [Jo1
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#016)), in contrast with the tables of
stone in the "midst" of the ark, covered with writings of stern command
(compare [Joh 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#013)); this is all
grace and love to believers, who answer to "the daughters of Jerusalem"
([Joh 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#017)). The exterior silver and
gold, cedar, purple, and guards, may deter, but when the bride enters
within, she rests on a pavement of love.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sol 3:11</span></span>

Go forth-- ([Mat 25:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#006)).

daughters of Zion--spirits of saints, and angels ([Isa
61:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#010); [Zac
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#009)).

crown--nuptial ([Eze 16:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#008)), (the
Hebrews wore costly crowns or chaplets at weddings), and kingly ([Psa
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#006); [Rev
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#012)). The crown of thorns was once
His nuptial chaplet, His blood the wedding wine cup ([Joh
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#005)). "His mother," that so crowned
Him, is the human race, for He is "the Son of man," not merely the son
of Mary. The same mother reconciled to Him ([Mat
12:50](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#050)), as the Church, travails in
birth for souls, which she presents to Him as a crown ([Phi
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#001); [Rev
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#010)). Not being ashamed to call the
children brethren ([Heb 2:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#011)), He
calls their mother His mother ([Psa
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#009); [Rom
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#029); [Rev
12:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#001)).

behold-- ([Th2 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#010)).

day of his espousals--chiefly the final marriage, when the number of the
elect is complete ([Rev 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#011)).

gladness-- ([Psa 45:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#015); [Isa
62:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#005); [Rev
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#007)). MOODY STUART observes as to
this Canticle (Son. 3:6-5:1), the center of the Book, these
characteristics: (1) The bridegroom takes the chief part, whereas
elsewhere the bride is the chief speaker. (2) Elsewhere He is either
"King" or "Solomon"; here He is twice called "King Solomon." The bride
is six times here called the "spouse"; never so before or after; also
"sister" four times, and, except in the first verse of the next Canticle
\[[Sol 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#002)\], nowhere else. (3) He and
she are never separate; no absence, no complaint, which abound
elsewhere, are in this Canticle.
