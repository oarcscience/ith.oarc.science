Testaments*, by Robert Jamieson, A.R. Fausset and David Brown \[1882\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Proverbs Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#001)

[Proverbs 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 19:1</span></span>

(Pro. 19:1-29)

(Compare [Pro 28:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#006)). "Rich" for fool
here. Integrity is better than riches ([Pro
15:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#016); [Pro
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#008)).

[Proverbs 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 19:2</span></span>

The last illustrates the first clause. Rashness, the result of
ignorance, brings trouble.

[Proverbs 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 19:3</span></span>

perverteth . . . way--turns him back from right ([Pro
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#006); [Jam
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#013)); and he blames God for his
failures.

[Proverbs 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 19:4</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#020)). Such facts are
often adduced with implied disapprobation.

[Proverbs 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 19:5</span></span>

Compare [Pro 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#009), where perish
explains not escape here (compare [Psa
88:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#009)).

[Proverbs 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 19:8</span></span>

(Compare Margin; [Pro 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#032)).

loveth . . . soul--or, "himself," which he evinces by regarding his best
interests.

keepeth--or, "regards."

[Proverbs 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 19:10</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#007)). The fool is
incapable of properly using pleasure as knowledge, yet for him to have
it is less incongruous than the undue elevation of servants. Let each
abide in his calling ([Co1 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#020)).

[Proverbs 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 19:11</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 14:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#029); [Pro
16:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#032)). This inculcation of a
forgiving spirit shows that true religion is always the same ([Mat
5:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#022)).

[Proverbs 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 19:12</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 16:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#014); [Pro
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#002)). A motive to submission to
lawful authority.

[Proverbs 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 19:13</span></span>

calamity--literally, "calamities," varied and many.

continual dropping--a perpetual annoyance, wearing out patience.

[Proverbs 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 19:14</span></span>

A contrast of men's gifts and God's, who, though author of both
blessings, confers the latter by His more special providence.

and--or, "but," implying that the evils of [Pro
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#013) are only avoided by His care.

[Proverbs 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 19:15</span></span>

a deep sleep--a state of utter indifference.

idle soul--or, "person" (compare [Pro
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#004); [Pro
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#024)).

[Proverbs 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 19:16</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#017); [Pro
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#013)).

despiseth . . . ways--opposed to keeping or observing, neglects ([Pro
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#017)) (as unworthy of regard) his
moral conduct.

[Proverbs 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 19:17</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#021); [Psa
37:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#026)).

hath pity--shown by acts (compare Margin).

[Proverbs 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 19:18</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 13:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#024); [Pro
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#013)).

let not . . . spare--literally, "do not lift up thy soul" ([Psa
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#004); [Psa
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#001)), that is, do not desire to his
death; a caution to passionate parents against angry chastisement.

[Proverbs 19:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 19:19</span></span>

Repeated efforts of kindness are lost on ill-natured persons.

[Proverbs 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pro 19:20</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 13:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#018)).

latter end-- ([Pro 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#011)). In youth
prepare for age.

[Proverbs 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 19:21</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#001), [Pro
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#009); [Psa
33:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#010)). The failure of man's
devices is implied.

[Proverbs 19:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 19:22</span></span>

desire--that is, to do good, indicates a kind disposition ([Pro
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#023)); and the poor thus affected are
better than liars, who say and do not.

[Proverbs 19:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 19:23</span></span>

The fear . . . life--(Compare [Pro
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#002)).

abide--or, "remain contented" ([Ti1
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#008)).

not visited with evil-- ([Pro 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#003);
[Psa 37:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#025)), as a judgment, in which
sense visit is often used ([Psa 89:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#032);
[Jer 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#015)).

[Proverbs 19:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 19:24</span></span>

bosom--literally, a wide dish in which the hand was plunged in eating
([Mat 26:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#023)). Compare [Pro
26:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#015), the sentiment expressed with
equal irony and less exaggeration.

[Proverbs 19:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">pro 19:25</span></span>

Such is the benefit of reproof; even the simple profit, much more the
wise.

[Proverbs 19:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">pro 19:26</span></span>

Unfilial conduct often condemned ([Pro
17:21-25](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#021); [Pro
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#020); [Deu
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#018), [Deu
21:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#021)).

[Proverbs 19:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 19:27</span></span>

Avoid whatever leads from truth.

[Proverbs 19:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">pro 19:28</span></span>

ungodly witness--(Compare Margin), one false by bad principles (compare
[Pro 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#012)).

scorneth judgment--sets at naught the dictates of justice.

devoureth--literally, "swalloweth," as something delightful.

[Proverbs 19:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">pro 19:29</span></span>

Their punishment is sure, fixed, and ready (compare [Pro
3:34](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#034); [Pro
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#013)).
