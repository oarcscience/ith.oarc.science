<p>
<p>in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia--The Persian empire, including Persia, Media, Babylonia, and Chaldea, with many smaller dependencies, was founded by Cyrus, 536 B.C. [HALES]. 
<p>
<p>that the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled--(See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#012">Jer 25:12</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#010">Jer 29:10</A>). This reference is a parenthetic statement of the historian, and did not form part of the proclamation.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#002">Ezra 1:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">ezr 1:2</A></FONT></span></p>The Lord God of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth--Though this is in the Oriental style of hyperbole (see also <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#001">Dan 4:1</A>), it was literally true that the Persian empire was the greatest ruling power in the world at that time. 
<p>
<p>he hath charged me to build him an house at Jerusalem--The phraseology of this proclamation, independently of the express testimony of JOSEPHUS, affords indisputable evidence that Cyrus had seen (probably through means of Daniel, his venerable prime minister and favorite) those prophecies in which, two hundred years before he was born, his name, his victorious career, and the important services he should render to the Jews were distinctly foretold (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#028">Isa 44:28</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#001">Isa 46:1-4</A>). The existence of predictions so remarkable led him to acknowledge that all his kingdoms were gifts bestowed on him by "the Lord God of heaven," and prompted him to fulfil the duty which had been laid upon him long before his birth. This was the source and origin of the great favor he showed to the Jews. The proclamation, though issued "in the first year of Cyrus" [<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001">Ezr 1:1</A>], did not take effect till the year following.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#003">Ezra 1:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">ezr 1:3</A></FONT></span></p>Who is there among you of all his people--The purport of the edict was to grant full permission to those Jewish exiles, in every part of his kingdom, who chose, to return to their own country, as well as to recommend those of their countrymen who remained to aid the poor and feeble on their way, and contribute liberally towards the rebuilding of the temple.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#005">Ezra 1:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">ezr 1:5</A></FONT></span></p>Then rose up the chief of the fathers, &amp;c.--The paternal and ecclesiastical chiefs of the later captivity, those of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, with some also from other tribes (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#003">Ch1 9:3</A>), who retained their attachment to the pure worship of God, naturally took the lead in this movement. Their example was followed by all whose piety and patriotism were strong enough to brave the various discouragements attending the enterprise. They were liberally assisted by multitudes of their captive countrymen, who, born in Babylonia or comfortably established in it by family connections or the possession of property, chose to remain. It seems that their Assyrian friends and neighbors, too, either from a favorable disposition toward the Jewish faith, or from imitation of the court policy, displayed hearty good will and great liberality in aiding and promoting the views of the emigrants.

<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#007">Ezra 1:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">ezr 1:7</A></FONT></span></p>CYRUS RESTORES THE VESSELS. (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#007">Ezr 1:7-11</A>)
<p>
<p>Cyrus . . . brought forth the vessels of the house of the Lord--Though it is said (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#013">Kg2 24:13</A>) that these were cut in pieces, that would not be done to the large and magnificent vases; and, if they had been divided, the parts could be reunited. But it may be doubted whether the Hebrew word rendered cut in pieces, does not signify merely cut off, that is, from further use in the temple.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#008">Ezra 1:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">ezr 1:8</A></FONT></span></p>Shesh-bazzar, the prince of Judah--that is, Zerubbabel, son of Salathiel (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#008">Ezr 3:8</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#016">Ezr 5:16</A>). He was born in Babylon, and called by his family Zerubbabel, that is, stranger or exile in Babylon. Shesh-bazzar, signifying "fire-worshipper," was the name given him at court, as other names were given to Daniel and his friends. He was recognized among the exiles as hereditary prince of Judah.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#011">Ezra 1:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">ezr 1:11</A></FONT></span></p>All the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred--The vessels here specified amount only to the number of 2499. Hence it is probable that the larger vases only are mentioned, while the inventory of the whole, including great and small, came to the gross sum stated in the text. 
<p>
<p>them of the captivity that were brought up from Babylon unto Jerusalem--All the Jewish exiles did not embrace the privilege which the Persian king granted them. The great proportion, born in Babylon, preferred continuing in their comfortable homes to undertaking a distant, expensive, and hazardous journey to a desolate land. Nor did the returning exiles all go at once. The first band went with Zerubbabel, others afterwards with Ezra, and a large number with Nehemiah at a still later period.
