### [Job Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#001)

[Job 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 27:1</span></span>

(Job 27:1-23)

parable--applied in the East to a figurative sententious embodiment of
wisdom in poetic form, a gnome ([Psa
49:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#004)).

continued--proceeded to put forth; implying elevation of discourse.

[Job 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 27:2</span></span>

([Sa1 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#003)).

taken away . . . judgment--words unconsciously foreshadowing Jesus
Christ ([Isa 53:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#008); [Act
8:33](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#033)). God will not give Job his
right, by declaring his innocence.

vexed--Hebrew, "made bitter" ([Rut
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#020)).

[Job 27:3](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 27:3</span></span>

Implying Job's knowledge of the fact that the living soul was breathed
into man by God ([Gen 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#007)). "All the
while." But MAURER, "As yet all my breath is in me" (notwithstanding my
trials): the reason why I can speak so boldly.

[Job 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 27:4</span></span>

([Job 6:28](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#028), [Job
6:30](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#030)). The "deceit" would be if he
were to admit guilt against the witness of his conscience.

[Job 27:5](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 27:5</span></span>

justify you--approve of your views.

mine integrity--which you deny, on account of my misfortunes.

[Job 27:6](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 27:6</span></span>

Rather, my "heart" (conscience) reproaches "not one of my days," that
is, I do not repent of any of my days since I came into existence
\[MAURER\].

[Job 27:7](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 27:7</span></span>

Let . . . be--Let mine enemy be accounted as wicked, that is, He who
opposes my asseveration of innocence must be regarded as actuated by
criminal hostility. Not a curse on his enemies.

[Job 27:8](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 27:8</span></span>

"What hope hath the hypocrite, notwithstanding all his gains, when?" &c.
"Gained" is antithetic to "taketh away." UMBREIT'S translation is an
unmeaning tautology. "When God cuts off, when He taketh away his life."

taketh away--literally, "draws out" the soul from the body, which is, as
it were, its scabbard ([Job 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#021); [Psa
104:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#029); [Dan
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#015)). Job says that he admits what
Bildad said ([Job 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#013)) and Zophar
([Job 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#005)). But he says the very fact
of his still calling upon God ([Job
27:10](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#010)) amid all his trials, which a
hypocrite would not dare to do, shows he is no "hypocrite."

[Job 27:9](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 27:9</span></span>

([Psa 66:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#018)).

[Job 27:10](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 27:10</span></span>

Alluding to [Job 22:26](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#026).

always call--He may do so in times of prosperity in order to be thought
religious. But he will not, as I do, call on God in calamities verging
on death. Therefore I cannot be a "hypocrite" ([Job
19:25](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#025); [Job
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#005); [Psa
62:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#008)).

[Job 27:11](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 27:11</span></span>

These words are contrary to Job's previous sentiments (see on [Job
21:22-33](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#022); [Job
24:22-25](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#022)). [Job
21:22-33](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#022); [Job
24:22-25](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#022)). They therefore seem to be
Job's statement, not so much of his own sentiments, as of what Zophar
would have said had he spoken when his turn came (end of the
twenty-sixth chapter). So Job stated the friends' opinion ([Job
21:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#017); [Job
24:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#018)). The objection is, why, if
so, does not Job answer Zophar's opinion, as stated by himself? The fact
is, it is probable that Job tacitly, by giving, in the twenty-eighth
chapter, only a general answer, implies, that in spite of the wicked
often dying, as he said, in prosperity, he does not mean to deny that
the wicked are in the main dealt with according to right, and that God
herein vindicates His moral government even here. Job therefore states
Zophar's argument more strongly than Zophar would have done. But by
comparing [Job 27:13](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#013) with [Job
20:29](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#029) ("portion," "heritage"), it will
be seen, it is Zophar's argument, rather than his own, that Job states.
Granting it to be true, implies Job, you ought not to use it as an
argument to criminate me. For (Job 28:1-28) the ways of divine wisdom in
afflicting the godly are inscrutable: all that is sure to man is, the
fear of the Lord is wisdom ([Job
28:28](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#028)).

by the hand--rather, concerning the hand of God, namely, what God does
in governing men.

with the Almighty--the counsel or principle which regulates God's
dealings.

[Job 27:12](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 27:12</span></span>

"Ye yourselves see" that the wicked often are afflicted (though often
the reverse, [Job 21:33](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#033)). But do you
"vainly" make this an argument to prove from my afflictions that I am
wicked?

[Job 27:13](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 27:13</span></span>

(See on [Job 27:11](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#011)).

[Job 27:14](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 27:14</span></span>

His family only increases to perish by sword or famine ([Jer
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#021); [Job
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#020), the converse).

[Job 27:15](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 27:15</span></span>

Those that escape war and famine ([Job
27:14](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#014)) shall be buried by the deadly
plague--"death" ([Job 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#013); [Jer
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#002); [Rev
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#008)). The plague of the Middle Ages
was called "the black death." Buried by it implies that they would have
none else but the death plague itself (poetically personified) to
perform their funeral rites, that is, would have no one.

his--rather, "their widows." Transitions from singular to plural are
frequent. Polygamy is not implied.

[Job 27:16](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 27:16</span></span>

dust . . . clay--images of multitudes ([Zac
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#003)). Many changes of raiment are a
chief constituent of wealth in the East.

[Job 27:17](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 27:17</span></span>

Introverted parallelism. (See Introduction). Of the four clauses in the
two verses, one answers to four, two to three (so [Mat
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#006)).

[Job 27:18](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 27:18</span></span>

([Job 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#014); [Job
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#019)). The transition is natural from
"raiment" ([Job 27:16](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#016)) to the "house"
of the "moth" in it, and of it, when in its larva state. The moth worm's
house is broken whenever the "raiment" is shaken out, so frail is it.

booth--a bough-formed hut which the guard of a vineyard raises for
temporary shelter ([Isa 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#008)).

[Job 27:19](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 27:19</span></span>

gathered--buried honorably ([Gen 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#008);
[Kg2 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#020)). But UMBREIT, agreeably to
[Job 27:18](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#018), which describes the short
continuance of the sinner's prosperity, "He layeth himself rich in his
bed, and nothing is robbed from him, he openeth his eyes, and nothing
more is there." If English Version be retained, the first clause
probably means, rich though he be in dying, he shall not be honored with
a funeral; the second, When he opens his eyes in the unseen world, it is
only to see his destruction: the Septuagint reads for "not gathered," He
does not proceed, that is, goes to his bed no more. So MAURER.

[Job 27:20](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 27:20</span></span>

([Job 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#011); [Job
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#011), [Job
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#021)). Like a sudden violent flood
([Isa 8:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#007); [Jer
47:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#002)): conversely ([Psa
32:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#006)).

[Job 27:21](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 27:21</span></span>

([Job 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#018); [Job
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#002); [Psa
58:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#009)).

[Job 27:22](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 27:22</span></span>

cast--namely, thunderbolts ([Job 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#004);
[Job 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#020); [Job
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#013); [Psa
7:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#012)).

[Job 27:23](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">job 27:23</span></span>

clap . . . hands--for joy at his downfall ([Lam
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#015); [Nah
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#019)).

hiss--deride ([Jer 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#009)). Job alludes
to Bildad's words ([Job 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#018)).

In the twenty-seventh chapter Job had tacitly admitted that the
statement of the friends was often true, that God vindicated His justice
by punishing the wicked here; but still the affliction of the godly
remained unexplained. Man has, by skill, brought the precious metals
from their concealment. But the Divine Wisdom, which governs human
affairs, he cannot similarly discover ([Job
28:12](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#012), &c.). However, the image from
the same metals ([Job 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#010)) implies
Job has made some way towards solving the riddle of his life; namely,
that affliction is to him as the refining fire is to gold.
