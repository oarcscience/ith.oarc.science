### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 31](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#001)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 31:1</span></span>

SAUL HAVING LOST HIS ARMY AT GILBOA, AND HIS SONS BEING SLAIN, HE AND
HIS ARMOR-BEARER KILL THEMSELVES. ([Sa1
31:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#001))

Now the Philistines fought against Israel--In a regular engagement, in
which the two armies met ([Sa1
28:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#001)), the Israelites were forced to
give way, being annoyed by the arrows of the enemy, which, destroying
them at a distance before they came to close combat, threw them into
panic and disorder. Taking advantage of the heights of Mount Gilboa,
\[the Israelites\] attempted to rally, but in vain. Saul and his sons
fought like heroes; but the onset of the Philistines being at length
mainly directed against the quarter where they were, Jonathan and two
brothers, Abinadab or Ishui ([Sa1
14:49](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#049)) and Melchishua, overpowered by
numbers, were killed on the spot.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 31:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 31:3</span></span>

the battle went sore against Saul, &c.--He seems to have bravely
maintained his ground for some time longer; but exhausted with fatigue
and loss of blood, and dreading that if he fell alive into the enemy's
hands, they would insolently maltreat him ([Jos
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#029); [Jos
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#024); [Jdg
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#021)), he requested his armor bearer
to despatch him. However, that officer refused to do so. Saul then
falling on the point of his sword killed himself; and the armor bearer,
who, according to Jewish writers, was Doeg, following the example of his
master, put an end to his life also. They died by one and the same
sword--the very weapon with which they had massacred the Lord's servants
at Nob.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 31:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 31:6</span></span>

So Saul died--(see on [Ch1 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1010.htm#013); [Hos
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#011)).

and his three sons--The influence of a directing Providence is evidently
to be traced in permitting the death of Saul's three eldest and most
energetic sons, particularly that of Jonathan, for whom, had he survived
his father, a strong party would undoubtedly have risen and thus
obstructed the path of David to the throne.

and all his men, that same day together--his servants or bodyguard ([Ch1
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1010.htm#006)).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 31:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa1 31:7</span></span>

the men of Israel that were on the other side of the valley--probably
the valley of Jezreel--the largest and southernmost of the valleys that
run between Little Hermon and the ridges of the Gilboa range direct into
the Jordan valley. It was very natural for the people in the towns and
villages there to take fright and flee, for had they waited the arrival
of the victors, they must, according to the war usages of the time, have
been deprived either of their liberty or their lives.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 31:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa1 31:8</span></span>

THE PHILISTINES TRIUMPH OVER THEIR DEAD BODIES. ([Sa1
31:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#008))

on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they
found Saul and his three sons fallen--On discovering the corpses of the
slaughtered princes on the battlefield, the enemy reserved them for
special indignities. They consecrated the armor of the king and his sons
to the temple of Ashtaroth fastened their bodies on the temple of Shen,
while they fixed the royal heads ignominiously in the temple of Dagon
([Ch1 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1010.htm#010)); thus dividing the glory
among their several deities.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 31:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa1 31:10</span></span>

to the wall-- ([Sa2 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#012)) --"the
street" of Beth-shan. The street was called from the temple which stood
in it. And they had to go along it to the wall of the city (see [Jos
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#011)).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 31:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa1 31:11</span></span>

THE MEN OF JABESH-GILEAD RECOVER THE BODIES AND BURY THEM AT JABESH.
([Sa1 31:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#011))

the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard of that which the Philistines had
done--Mindful of the important and timely services Saul had rendered
them, they gratefully and heroically resolved not to suffer such
indignities to be inflicted on the remains of the royal family.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 31:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa1 31:12</span></span>

valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the
bodies of his sons--Considering that Beth-shan is an hour and a half's
distance, and by a narrow upland passage, to the west of the Jordan (the
whole being a journey from Jabesh-gilead of about ten miles), they must
have made all haste to travel thither to carry off the headless bodies
and return to their own side of the Jordan in the course of a single
night.

burnt them--This was not a Hebrew custom. It was probably resorted to on
this occasion to prevent all risk of the Beth-shanites coming to
disinter the royal remains for further insult.
