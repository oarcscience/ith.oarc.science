<p>
<p>Nebuchadnezzar . . . came . . . against Jerusalem--Incensed by the revolt of Zedekiah, the Assyrian despot determined to put an end to the perfidious and inconstant monarchy of Judea. This chapter narrates his third and last invasion, which he conducted in person at the head of an immense army, levied out of all the tributary nations under his sway. Having overrun the northern parts of the country and taken almost all the fenced cities (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#007">Jer 34:7</A>), he marched direct to Jerusalem to invest it. The date of the beginning as well as the end of the siege is here carefully marked (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#001">Eze 24:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#001">Jer 39:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#004">Jer 52:4-6</A>); from which it appears, that, with a brief interruption caused by Nebuchadnezzar's marching to oppose the Egyptians who were coming to its relief but who retreated without fighting, the siege lasted a year and a half. So long a resistance was owing, not to the superior skill and valor of the Jewish soldiers, but to the strength of the city fortifications, on which the king too confidently relied (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#001">Jer 21:1-14</A>; Jer. 37:1-38:28). 
<p>
<p>pitched against it, and . . . built forts--rather, perhaps, drew lines of circumvallation, with a ditch to prevent any going out of the city. On this rampart were erected his military engines for throwing missiles into the city.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">kg2 25:3</A></FONT></span></p>on the ninth day of the fourth month the famine prevailed--In consequence of the close and protracted blockade, the inhabitants were reduced to dreadful extremities; and under the maddening influence of hunger, the most inhuman atrocities were perpetrated (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#020">Lam 2:20</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#022">Lam 2:22</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#009">Lam 4:9-10</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#010">Eze 5:10</A>). This was a fulfilment of the prophetic denunciations threatened on the apostasy of the chosen people (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#029">Lev 26:29</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#053">Deu 28:53-57</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#002">Jer 15:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#013">Jer 27:13</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#016">Eze 4:16</A>).

<p>
<p>the city was broken up--that is, a breach was effected, as we are elsewhere informed, in a part of the wall belonging to the lower city (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#005">Ch2 32:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#014">Ch2 33:14</A>). 
<p>
<p>the men of war fled by night by the way of the gate between two walls, which is by the king's garden--The king's garden was (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#015">Neh 3:15</A>) at the pool of Siloam, that is, at the mouth of the Tyrop&Atilde;&brvbr;on. A trace of the outermost of these walls appears to be still extant in the rude pathway which crosses the mouth of the Tyrop&Atilde;&brvbr;on, on a mound hard by the old mulberry tree, which marks the traditional spot of Isaiah's martyrdom [ROBINSON]. It is probable that the besiegers had overlooked this pass. 
<p>
<p>the king went . . . toward the plain--that is, the Ghor, or valley of Jordan, estimated at five hours' distance from Jerusalem. The plain near Jericho is about eleven or twelve miles broad.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#006">4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">kg2 25:6</A></FONT></span></p>they took the king, and brought him . . . to Riblah--Nebuchadnezzar, having gone from the siege to oppose the auxiliary forces of Pharaoh-hophra, left his generals to carry on the blockade, he himself not returning to the scene of action, but taking up his station at Riblah in the land of Hamath (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#033">Kg2 23:33</A>). 
<p>
<p>they gave judgment upon him--They, that is, the council (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#003">Jer 39:3</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#013">Jer 39:13</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#007">Dan 6:7-8</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#012">Dan 6:12</A>), regarding him as a seditious and rebellious vassal, condemned him for violating his oath and neglecting the announcement of the divine will as made known to him by Jeremiah (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#005">Jer 32:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#002">Jer 34:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#017">Jer 38:17</A>). His sons and the nobles who had joined in his flight were slain before his eyes (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#006">Jer 39:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#010">Jer 52:10</A>). In conformity with Eastern ideas, which consider a blind man incapable of ruling, his eyes were put out, and being put in chains, he was carried to perpetual imprisonment in Babylon (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#011">Jer 52:11</A>), which, though he came to it, as Ezekiel had foretold, he did not see (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#005">Jer 32:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#013">Eze 12:13</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#016">Eze 17:16</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#008">4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">kg2 25:8</A></FONT></span></p>on the seventh day of the month . . . came Nebuzar-adan--(compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#012">Jer 52:12</A>). In attempting to reconcile these two passages, it must be supposed either that, though he had set out on the seventh, he did not arrive in Jerusalem till the tenth, or that he did not put his orders in execution till that day. His office as captain of the guard (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#036">Gen 37:36</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#001">Gen 39:1</A>) called him to execute the awards of justice on criminals; and hence, although not engaged in the siege of Jerusalem (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#013">Jer 39:13</A>), Nebuzar-adan was despatched to rase the city, to plunder the temple, to lay both in ruins, demolish the fortifications, and transport the inhabitants to Babylon. The most eminent of these were taken to the king at Riblah (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#027">Kg2 25:27</A>) and executed, as instigators and abettors of the rebellion, or otherwise obnoxious to the Assyrian government. In their number were Seraiah, the high priest, grandfather of Ezra (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#001">Ezr 7:1</A>), his sagan or deputy, a priest of the second order (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#002">Jer 21:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#025">Jer 29:25</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#029">Jer 29:29</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#003">Jer 37:3</A>).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">kg2 25:18</A></FONT></span></p>the three keepers of the door--not mere porters, but officers of high trust among the Levites (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#004">Kg2 22:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#026">Ch1 9:26</A>).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">kg2 25:19</A></FONT></span></p>five men of them that were in the king's presence--that is, who belonged to the royal retinue. It is probable that there were five at first, and that other two were found afterwards (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#025">Jer 52:25</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#022">4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">kg2 25:22</A></FONT></span></p>Nebuchadnezzar . . . made Gedaliah . . . ruler--The people permitted to remain were, besides the king's daughters, a few court attendants and others (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#007">Jer 40:7</A>) too insignificant to be removed, only the peasantry who could till the land and dress the vineyards. Gedaliah was Jeremiah's friend (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#024">Jer 26:24</A>), and having, by the prophet's counsel, probably fled from the city as abandoned of God, he surrendered himself to the conqueror (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#002">Jer 38:2</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#017">Jer 38:17</A>), and being promoted to the government of Judea, fixed his provincial court at Mizpeh. He was well qualified to surmount the difficulties of ruling at such a crisis. Many of the fugitive Jews, as well as the soldiers of Zedekiah who had accompanied the king in his flight to the plains of Jericho, left their retreats (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#011">Jer 40:11-12</A>) and flocked around the governor; who having counselled them to submit, promised them on complying with this condition, security on oath that they would retain their possessions and enjoy the produce of their land (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#009">Jer 40:9</A>).

The generous governor, though apprised of his intentions, refused to credit the report, much less to sanction the proposal made by an attached friend to cut off Ishmael. The consequence was, that he was murdered by this same Ishmael, when entertaining him in his own house (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#001">Jer 41:1</A>).

<p>
<p>Evil-merodach . . . did lift up the head of Jehoiachin . . . and spake kindly--gave him liberty upon parole. This kindly feeling is said to have originated in a familiar acquaintance formed in prison, in which Evil-merodach had lain till his father's death, on account of some malversation while acting as regent during Nebuchadnezzar's seven years' illness (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#032">Dan 4:32-33</A>). But doubtless the improvement in Zedekiah's condition is to be traced to the overruling providence and grace of Him who still cherished purposes of love to the house of David (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#014">Sa2 7:14-15</A>).
