### [Leviticus Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#001)

[Leviticus 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#002)

WOMAN'S UNCLEANNESS BY CHILDBIRTH. ([Lev
12:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#001))

If a woman, &c.--The mother of a boy was ceremonially unclean for a
week, at the end of which the child was circumcised ([Gen
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#012); [Rom
4:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#011)); the mother of a girl for two
weeks ([Lev 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#005)) --a stigma on the
sex ([Ti1 2:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#014)) for sin, which was
removed by Christ; everyone who came near her during that time
contracted a similar defilement. After these periods, visitors might
approach her though she was still excluded from the public ordinances of
religion \[[Lev 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#004)\].

[Leviticus 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#006)

the days of her purifying--Though the occasion was of a festive
character, yet the sacrifices appointed were not a peace offering, but a
burnt offering and sin offering, in order to impress the mind of the
parent with recollections of the origin of sin, and that the child
inherited a fallen and sinful nature. The offerings were to be presented
the day after the period of her separation had ended--that is,
forty-first for a boy, eighty-first for a girl.

[Leviticus 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#008)

bring two turtles, &c.--(See on [Lev
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#006)). This was the offering made by
Mary, the mother of Jesus, and it affords an incontestable proof of the
poor and humble condition of the family ([Luk
2:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#022)).
