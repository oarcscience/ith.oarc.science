### [Jeremiah Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 22:1</span></span>

EXHORTATION TO REPENTANCE; JUDGMENT ON SHALLUM, JEHOIAKIM, AND CONIAH.
(Jer. 22:1-30)

Go down--The temple (where Jeremiah had been prophesying) was higher
than the king's palace on Mount Zion ([Jer
36:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#010), [Jer
36:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#012); [Ch2
23:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#020)). Hence the phrase, "Go down."

the king of Judah--perhaps including each of the four successive kings,
to whom it was consecutively addressed, here brought together in one
picture: Shallum, [Jer 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#011);
Jehoiakim, [Jer 22:13-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#013); Jeconiah,
[Jer 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#024); Zedekiah, the address to
whom ([Jer 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#001), [Jer
21:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#011)) suggests notice of the rest.

[Jeremiah 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 22:2</span></span>

these gates--of the king's palace.

[Jeremiah 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 22:3</span></span>

Jehoiakim is meant here especially: he, by oppression, levied the
tribute imposed on him by Pharaoh-necho, king of Egypt ([Ch2
36:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#003)), and taxed his people, and took
their labor without pay, to build gorgeous palaces for himself ([Jer
22:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#013)), and shed innocent blood,
for example, that of Urijah the prophet ([Jer
26:20-24](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#020); [Kg2
23:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#035); [Kg2
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#004)).

[Jeremiah 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 22:4</span></span>

upon the throne of David--literally, "or David on his throne" (see on
[Jer 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#013)). This verse is repeated
substantially from [Jer 17:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#025).

his servants--so the Keri. But Chetib, singular, "his servant;" that is,
distributively, "each with his servants;" [Jer
17:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#025), "their princes."

[Jeremiah 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 22:5</span></span>

I swear by myself-- ([Heb 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#013), [Heb
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#017)). God swears because it seemed to
them incredible that the family of David should be cast off.

this house--the king's, where Jeremiah spake ([Jer
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#004)).

[Jeremiah 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 22:6</span></span>

Though thou art as beautiful as Gilead, and as majestic in Mine eyes
(before Me) as the summit of Lebanon, yet surely (the Hebrew is a
formula of swearing to express certainly: "If I do not make thee . . .
believe Me not ever hereafter": so "as truly as I live," [Num
14:28](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#028); "surely," [Num
14:35](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#035)). The mention of Gilead may
allude not only to its past beauty, but covertly also to its desolation
by the judgment on Israel; a warning now to Judah and the house of
"David." "Lebanon" is appropriately mentioned, as the king's house was
built of its noble cedars.

cities--not other cities, but the different parts of the city of
Jerusalem ([Sa2 12:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#027); [Kg2
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#025)) \[MAURER\].

[Jeremiah 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 22:7</span></span>

prepare--literally, "sanctify," or solemnly set apart for a particular
work (compare [Isa 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#003)).

thy choice cedars-- ([Isa 37:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#024)). Thy
palaces built of choice cedars ([Sol
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#017)).

[Jeremiah 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 22:8</span></span>

([Deu 29:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#024)). The Gentile nations,
more intelligent than you, shall understand that which ye do not,
namely, that this city is a spectacle of God's vengeance \[CALVIN\].

[Jeremiah 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 22:9</span></span>

([Kg2 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#017)).

[Jeremiah 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 22:10</span></span>

Weep . . . not for--that is, not so much for Josiah, who was taken away
by death from the evil to come ([Kg2
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#020); [Isa
57:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#001)); as for Shallum or Jehoahaz, his
son ([Kg2 23:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#030)), who, after a three
months' reign, was carried off by Pharaoh-necho into Egypt, never to see
his native land again ([Kg2 23:31-34](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#031)).
Dying saints are justly to be envied, while living sinners are to be
pitied. The allusion is to the great weeping of the people at the death
of Josiah, and on each anniversary of it, in which Jeremiah himself took
a prominent part ([Ch2 35:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#024)). The
name "Shallum" is here given in irony to Jehoahaz, who reigned but three
months; as if he were a second Shallum, son of Jabesh, who reigned only
one month in Samaria ([Kg2 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#013); [Ch2
36:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#001)). Shallum means "retribution,"
a name of no good omen to him \[GROTIUS\]; originally the people called
him Shallom, indicative of peace and prosperity. But Jeremiah applies it
in irony. [Ch1 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#015), calls Shallum the
fourth son of Josiah. The people raised him to the throne before his
brother Eliakim or Jehoiakim, though the latter was the older ([Kg2
23:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#031), [Kg2
23:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#036); [Ch2
36:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#001)); perhaps on account of
Jehoiakim's extravagance ([Jer 22:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#013),
[Jer 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#015)). Jehoiakim was put in
Shallum's (Jehoahaz') stead by Pharaoh-necho. Jeconiah, his son,
succeeded. Zedekiah (Mattaniah), uncle of Jeconiah, and brother of
Jehoiakim and Jehoahaz, was last of all raised to the throne by
Nebuchadnezzar.

He shall not return--The people perhaps entertained hopes of Shallum's
return from Egypt, in which case they would replace him on the throne,
and thereby free themselves from the oppressive taxes imposed by
Jehoiakim.

[Jeremiah 22:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 22:13</span></span>

Not only did Jehoiakim tax the people ([Kg2
23:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#035)) for Pharaoh's tribute, but also
took their forced labor, without pay, for building a splendid palace; in
violation of [Lev 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#013); [Deu
24:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#014). Compare [Mic
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#010); [Hab
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#009); [Jam
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#004). God will repay in justice those
who will not in justice pay those whom they employ.

[Jeremiah 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 22:14</span></span>

wide--literally, "a house of dimensions" ("measures"). Compare [Num
13:32](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#032), Margin, "men of statures."

large--rather, as Margin, "airy" from Hebrew root, "to breathe freely."
Upper rooms in the East are the principal apartments.

cutteth him out windows--The Hebrew, if a noun, is rather, "my windows";
then the translation ought to be, "and let my windows (Jehoiakim
speaking) be cut out for it," that is, in the house; or, "and let (the
workman) cut out my windows for it." But the word is rather an
adjective; "he cutteth it (the house) out for himself, so as to be full
of windows." The following words accord with this construction, "and (he
makes it) ceiled with cedar," &c. \[MAURER\]. Retaining English Version,
there must be understood something remarkable about the windows, since
they are deemed worthy of notice. GESENIUS thinks thinks the word dual,
"double windows," the blinds being two-leaved.

vermilion--Hebrew, shashar, called so from a people of India beyond the
Ganges, by whom it is exported \[PLINY, 6.19\]. The old vermilion was
composed of sulphur and quicksilver; not of red lead, as our vermilion.

[Jeremiah 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 22:15</span></span>

closest thyself--rather, "thou viest," that is, art emulous to surpass
thy forefathers in the magnificence of thy palaces.

eat and drink--Did not Josiah, thy father, enjoy all that man really
needs for his bodily wants? Did he need to build costly palaces to
secure his throne? Nay, he did secure it by "judgment and justice";
whereas thou, with all thy luxurious building, sittest on a tottering
throne.

then--on that account, therefore.

[Jeremiah 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 22:16</span></span>

was not this to know me--namely, to show by deeds that one knows God's
will, as was the case with Josiah (compare [Joh
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#017); contrast [Tit
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#016)).

[Jeremiah 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 22:17</span></span>

thine--as opposed to thy father, Josiah.

[Jeremiah 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 22:18</span></span>

Ah my brother! . . . sister!--addressing him with such titles of
affection as one would address to a deceased friend beloved as a brother
or sister (compare [Kg1 13:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#030)). This
expresses, They shall not lament him with the lamentation of private
individuals \[VATABLUS\], or of blood relatives \[GROTIUS\]: as "Ah!
lord," expresses public lamentation in the case of a king \[VATABLUS\],
or that of subjects \[GROTIUS\]. HENDERSON thinks, "Ah! sister," refers
to Jehoiakim's queen, who, though taken to Babylon and not left unburied
on the way, as Jehoiakim, yet was not honored at her death with royal
lamentations, such as would have been poured forth over her at
Jerusalem. He notices the beauty of Jeremiah's manner in his prophecy
against Jehoiakim. In [Jer 22:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#013) he
describes him in general terms; then, in [Jer
22:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#015), he directly addresses him
without naming him; at last, in [Jer
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#018), he names him, but in the third
person, to imply that God puts him to a distance from Him. The boldness
of the Hebrew prophets proves their divine mission; were it not so,
their reproofs to the Hebrew kings, who held the throne by divine
authority, would have been treason.

Ah his glory!--"Alas! his majesty."

[Jeremiah 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 22:19</span></span>

burial of an ass--that is, he shall have the same burial as an ass would
get, namely, he shall be left a prey for beasts and birds \[JEROME\].
This is not formally narrated. But [Ch2
36:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#006) states that "Nebuchadnezzar bound
him in fetters to carry him to Babylon"; his treatment there is nowhere
mentioned. The prophecy here, and in [Jer
36:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#030), harmonizes these two facts. He
was slain by Nebuchadnezzar, who changed his purpose of taking him to
Babylon, on the way thither, and left him unburied outside Jerusalem.
[Kg2 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#006), "Jehoiakim slept with his
fathers," does not contradict this; it simply expresses his being
gathered to his fathers by death, not his being buried with his fathers
([Psa 49:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#019)). The two phrases are
found together, as expressing two distinct ideas ([Kg2
15:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#038); [Kg2
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#020)).

[Jeremiah 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 22:20</span></span>

Delivered in the reign of Jehoiachin (Jeconiah or Coniah), son of
Jehoiakim; appended to the previous prophecy respecting Jehoiakim, on
account of the similarity of the two prophecies. He calls on Jerusalem,
personified as a mourning female, to go up to the highest points visible
from Jerusalem, and lament there (see on [Jer
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#021)) the calamity of herself, bereft
of allies and of her princes, who are one after the other being cast
down.

Bashan--north of the region beyond Jordan; the mountains of Anti-libanus
are referred to ([Psa 68:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#015)).

from the passages--namely, of the rivers ([Jdg
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#006)); or else the borders of the
country ([Sa1 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#023); [Isa
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#029)). The passes ([Sa1
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#004)). MAURER translates, "Abarim," a
mountainous tract beyond Jordan, opposite Jericho, and south of Bashan;
this accords with the mention of the mountains Lebanon and Bashan ([Num
27:12](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#012); [Num
33:47](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#047)).

lovers--the allies of Judea, especially Egypt, now unable to help the
Jews, being crippled by Babylon ([Kg2
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#007)).

[Jeremiah 22:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 22:21</span></span>

I admonished thee in time. Thy sin has not been a sin of ignorance or
thoughtlessness, but wilful.

prosperity--given thee by Me; yet thou wouldest not hearken to the
gracious Giver. The Hebrew is plural, to express, "In the height of thy
prosperity"; so "droughts" ([Isa
58:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#011)).

thou saidst--not in words, but in thy conduct, virtually.

thy youth--from the time that I brought thee out of Egypt, and formed
thee into a people ([Jer 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#025); [Jer
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#002); [Isa
47:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#012)).

[Jeremiah 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 22:22</span></span>

wind--the Chaldees, as a parching wind that sweeps over rapidly and
withers vegetation ([Jer 4:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#011); [Psa
103:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#016); [Isa
40:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#007)).

eat up . . . pastors--that is, thy kings ([Jer
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#008)). There is a happy play on words.
The pastors, whose office it is to feed the sheep, shall themselves be
fed on. They who should drive the flock from place to place for pasture
shall be driven into exile by the Chaldees.

[Jeremiah 22:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 22:23</span></span>

inhabitant of Lebanon--namely, Jerusalem, whose temple, palaces, and
principal habitations were built of cedars of Lebanon.

how gracious--irony. How graciously thou wilt be treated by the
Chaldees, when they come on thee suddenly, as pangs on a woman in
travail ([Jer 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#024))! Nay, all thy fine
buildings will win no favor for thee from them. MAURER translates, "How
shalt thou be to be pitied!"

[Jeremiah 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jer 22:24</span></span>

As I live--God's most solemn formula of oath ([Jer
46:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#018); [Jer
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#002); [Deu
32:40](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#040); [Sa1
25:34](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#034)).

Coniah--Jeconiah or Jehoiachin. The contraction of the name is meant in
contempt.

signet--Such ring seals were often of the greatest value ([Sol
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#006); [Hag
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#023)). Jehoiachin's popularity is
probably here referred to.

right hand--the hand most valued.

I would pluck thee thence--(Compare [Oba
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#004)); on account of thy father's sins,
as well as thine own ([Ch2 36:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#009)).
There is a change here, as often in Hebrew poetry, from the third to the
second person, to bring the threat more directly home to him. After a
three months' and ten days' reign, the Chaldees deposed him. In Babylon,
however, by God's favor he was ultimately treated more kindly than other
royal captives ([Jer 52:31-34](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#031)). But
none of his direct posterity ever came to the throne.

[Jeremiah 22:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jer 22:25</span></span>

give . . . into . . . hand--"I will pluck thee" from "my right hand,"
and "will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life."

[Jeremiah 22:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jer 22:26</span></span>

thy mother--Nehushta, the queen dowager ([Kg2
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#006), [Kg2
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#008), [Kg2
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#015); see [Jer
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#018)).

[Jeremiah 22:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jer 22:27</span></span>

they--Coniah and his mother. He passes from the second person ([Jer
22:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#026)) to the third person here, to
express alienation. The king is as it were put out of sight, as if
unworthy of being spoken with directly.

desire--literally, "lift up their soul" ([Jer
44:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#014); [Psa
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#004); [Psa
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#001)). Judea was the land which they
in Babylon should pine after in vain.

[Jeremiah 22:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jer 22:28</span></span>

broken idol--Coniah was idolized once by the Jews; Jeremiah, therefore,
in their person, expresses their astonishment at one from whom so much
had been expected being now so utterly cast aside.

vessel . . . no pleasure-- ([Psa
31:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#012); [Hos
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#008)). The answer to this is given
([Rom 9:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#020); contrast [Ti2
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#021)).

his seed--(See on [Jer 22:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#029)).

[Jeremiah 22:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jer 22:29</span></span>

O earth! earth! earth!--Jeconiah was not actually without offspring
(compare [Jer 22:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#028), "his seed"; [Ch1
3:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#017); [Mat
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#012)), but he was to be "written
childless," as a warning to posterity, that is, without a lineal heir to
his throne. It is with a reference to the three kings, Shallum,
Jehoiakim, and Jeconiah, that the earth is thrice invoked \[BENGEL\].
Or, the triple invocation is to give intensity to the call for attention
to the announcement of the end of the royal line, so far as Jehoiachin's
seed is concerned. Though Messiah (Mat. 1:1-17), the heir of David's
throne, was lineally descended from Jeconiah, it was only through
Joseph, who, though His legal, was not His real father. Matthew gives
the legal pedigree through Solomon down to Joseph; Luke the real
pedigree, from Mary, the real parent, through Nathan, brother of
Solomon, upwards ([Luk 3:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#031)).

no man of his seed . . . upon the throne--This explains the sense in
which "childless" is used. Though the succession to the throne failed in
his line, still the promise to David ([Psa
89:30-37](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#030)) was revived in Zerubbabel
and consummated in Christ.

This forms the epilogue to the denunciations of the four kings, in Jer.
21:1-22:30.
