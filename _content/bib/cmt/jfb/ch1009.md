[1 Chronicles 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#001)

ORIGINAL REGISTERS OF ISRAEL AND JUDAH'S GENEALOGIES. (1Ch. 9:1-26)

all Israel were reckoned by genealogies--From the beginning of the
Hebrew nation, public records were kept, containing a registration of
the name of every individual, as well as the tribe and family to which
he belonged. "The book of the kings of Israel and Judah" does not refer
to the two canonical books that are known in Scripture by that name, but
to authenticated copies of those registers, placed under the official
care of the sovereigns; and as a great number of the Israelites ([Ch1
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#003)) took refuge in Judah during the
invasion of Shalmaneser, they carried the public records along with
them. The genealogies given in the preceding chapters were drawn from
the public records in the archives both of Israel and Judah; and those
given in this chapter relate to the period subsequent to the
restoration; whence it appears (compare [Ch1
3:17-24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#017)) that the genealogical
registers were kept during the captivity in Babylon. These genealogical
tables, then, are of the highest authority for truth and correctness,
the earlier portion being extracted from the authenticated records of
the nation; and as to those which belong to the time of the captivity,
they were drawn up by a contemporary writer, who, besides enjoying the
best sources of information, and being of the strictest integrity, was
guided and preserved from all error by divine inspiration.

[1 Chronicles 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch1 9:2</span></span>

the first inhabitants that dwelt in their possessions--This chapter
relates wholly to the first returned exiles. Almost all the names recur
in Nehemiah (Neh. 11:1-36), although there are differences which will be
explained there. The same division of the people into four classes was
continued after, as before the captivity; namely, the priests, Levites,
natives, who now were called by the common name of Israelites, and the
Nethinims ([Jos 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#027); [Ezr
2:43](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#043); [Ezr
8:20](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#020)). When the historian speaks of
"the first inhabitants that dwelt in their possessions," he implies that
there were others who afterwards returned and settled in possessions not
occupied by the first. Accordingly, we read of a great number returning
successively under Ezra, Nehemiah, and at a later period. And some of
those who returned to the ancient inheritance of their fathers, had
lived before the time of the captivity ([Ezr
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#012); [Hag
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#004), [Hag
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#010)).

[1 Chronicles 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch1 9:18</span></span>

the king's gate--The king had a gate from his palace into the temple
([Kg2 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#018)), which doubtless was kept
constantly closed except for the monarch's use; and although there was
no king in Israel on the return from the captivity, yet the old
ceremonial was kept up, probably in the hope that the scepter would, ere
long, be restored to the house of David. It is an honor by which Eastern
kings are distinguished, to have a gate exclusively devoted to their own
special use, and which is kept constantly closed, except when he goes
out or returns ([Eze 44:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#002)). There
being no king then in Israel, this gate would be always shut.
