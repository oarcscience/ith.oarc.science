### [Ephesians Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#001)

[Ephesians 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eph 5:1</span></span>

EXHORTATIONS TO LOVE: AND AGAINST CARNAL LUSTS AND COMMUNICATIONS.
CIRCUMSPECTION IN WALK: REDEEMING THE TIME: BEING FILLED WITH THE
SPIRIT: SINGING TO THE LORD WITH THANKFULNESS: THE WIFE'S DUTY TO THE
HUSBAND RESTS ON THAT OF THE CHURCH TO CHRIST. (Eph. 5:1-33)

therefore--seeing that "God in Christ forgave you" ([Eph
4:32](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#032)).

followers--Greek, "imitators" of God, in respect to "love" ([Eph
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#002)): God's essential character ([Jo1
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#016)).

as dear children--Greek, "as children beloved"; to which [Eph
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#002) refers, "As Christ also loved us"
([Jo1 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#019)). "We are sons of men, when
we do ill; sons of God, when we do well" \[AUGUSTINE, on Psalm 52\];
(compare [Mat 5:44-45](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#044), [Mat
5:48](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#048)). Sonship infers an absolute
necessity of imitation, it being vain to assume the title of son without
any similitude of the Father \[PEARSON\].

[Ephesians 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eph 5:2</span></span>

And--in proof that you are so.

walk in love--resuming [Eph 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#001), "walk
worthy of the vocation."

as Christ . . . loved us--From the love of the Father he passes to the
love of the Son, in whom God most endearingly manifests His love to us.

given himself for us--Greek, "given Himself up (namely, to death, [Gal
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#020)) for us," that is, in our behalf:
not here vicarious substitution, though that is indirectly implied, "in
our stead." The offerer, and the offering that He offered, were one and
the same ([Joh 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#013); [Rom
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#008)).

offering and a sacrifice--"Offering" expresses generally His presenting
Himself to the Father, as the Representative undertaking the cause of
the whole of our lost race ([Psa
40:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006)), including His life of
obedience; though not excluding His offering of His body for us ([Heb
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#010)). It is usually an unbloody
offering, in the more limited sense. "Sacrifice" refers to His death for
us exclusively. Christ is here, in reference to [Psa
40:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006) (quoted again in [Heb
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005)), represented as the antitype of
all the offerings of the law, whether the unbloody or bloody,
eucharistical or propitiatory.

for a sweet-smelling savour--Greek, "for an odor of a sweet smell," that
is, God is well pleased with the offering on the ground of its
sweetness,and so is reconciled to us ([Eph
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#006); [Mat
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#017); [Co2
5:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#018); [Heb
10:6-17](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#006)). The ointment compounded of
principal spices, poured upon Aaron's head, answers to the variety of
the graces by which He was enabled to "offer Himself a sacrifice for a
sweet-smelling savor." Another type, or prophecy by figure, was "the
sweet savor" ("savor of rest," Margin) which God smelled in Noah's
sacrifice ([Gen 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#021)). Again, as what
Christ is, believers also are ([Jo1
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#017)), and ministers are: Paul says
([Co2 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#017)) "we are unto God a sweet
savor of Christ."

[Ephesians 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eph 5:3</span></span>

once named--Greek, "Let it not be even named" ([Eph
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#004), [Eph
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#012)). "Uncleanness" and
"covetousness" are taken up again from [Eph
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#019). The two are so closely allied
that the Greek for "covetousness" (pleonexia) is used sometimes in
Scripture, and often in the Greek Fathers, for sins of impurity. The
common principle is the longing to fill one's desire with material
objects of sense, outside of God. The expression, "not be even named,"
applies better to impurity, than to "covetousness."

[Ephesians 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eph 5:4</span></span>

filthiness--obscenity in act or gesture.

foolish talking--the talk of fools, which is folly and sin together. The
Greek of it, and of "filthiness," occurs nowhere else in the New
Testament.

nor--rather, "or" (compare [Eph 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#003)).

jesting--Greek, "eutrapelia"; found nowhere else in the New Testament:
implying strictly that versatility which turns about and adapts itself,
without regard to principle, to the shifting circumstances of the
moment, and to the varying moods of those with whom it may deal. Not
scurrile buffoonery, but refined "persiflage" and "badinage," for which
Ephesus was famed \[PLAUTUS, A Boastful Soldier, 3.1,42-52\], and which,
so far from being censured, was and is thought by the world a pleasant
accomplishment. In [Col 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#008), "filthy
communication" refers to the foulness; "foolish talking," to the folly;
"jesting," to the false refinement (and trifling witticism \[TITTMANN\])
Of discourse unseasoned with the salt of grace \[TRENCH\].

not convenient--"unseemly"; not such "as become saints" ([Eph
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#003)).

rather giving of thanks--a happy play on sounds in Greek, "eucharistia"
contrasted with "eutrapelia"; refined "jesting" and subtle humor
sometimes offend the tender feelings of grace; "giving of thanks" gives
that real cheerfulness of spirit to believers which the worldly try to
get from "jesting" ([Eph 5:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#019); [Jam
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#013)).

[Ephesians 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eph 5:5</span></span>

this ye know--The oldest manuscripts read, "Of this ye are sure
knowing"; or as ALFORD, "This ye know being aware."

covetous . . . idolater-- ([Col 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#005)).
The best reading may be translated, That is to say, literally, which is
(in other words) an idolater. Paul himself had forsaken all for Christ
([Co2 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#010); [Co2
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#027)). Covetousness is worship of the
creature instead of the Creator, the highest treason against the King of
kings ([Sa1 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#003); [Mat
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#024); [Phi
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#019); [Jo1
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#015)).

hath--The present implies the fixedness of the exclusion, grounded on
the eternal verities of that kingdom \[ALFORD\].

of Christ and of God--rather, as one Greek article is applied to both,
"of Christ and God," implying their perfect oneness, which is consistent
only with the doctrine that Christ is God (compare [Th2
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#012); [Ti1
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#021); [Ti1
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#013)).

[Ephesians 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eph 5:6</span></span>

vain--empty, unreal words, namely, palliations of "uncleanness," [Eph
5:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#003); [Isa
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#020) (that it is natural to indulge in
love), "covetousness" (that it is useful to society that men should
pursue gain), and "jesting" (that it is witty and clever, and that God
will not so severely punish for such things).

because of these things--uncleanness, covetousness, &c. ([Eph
5:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#003)).

cometh--present, not merely "shall come." Is as sure as if already come.

children--rather, "sons of disobedience" ([Eph
2:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#002)). The children of unbelief in
doctrine ([Deu 32:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#020)) are "children of
disobedience" in practice, and these again are "children of wrath."

[Ephesians 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eph 5:7</span></span>

Here fellowship with wicked workers is forbidden; in [Eph
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#011), with their wicked works.

[Ephesians 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eph 5:8</span></span>

sometimes--"once." The emphasis is on "were." Ye ought to have no
fellowship with sin, which is darkness, for your state as darkness is
now PAST. Stronger than "in darkness" ([Rom
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#019)).

light--not merely "enlightened"; but light enlightening others ([Eph
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#013)).

in--in union with the Lord, who is THE LIGHT.

children of light--not merely "of the light"; just as "children of
disobedience" is used on the opposite side; those whose distinguishing
characteristic is light. PLINY, a heathen writing to Trajan, bears
unwilling testimony to the extraordinary purity of Christians' lives,
contrasted with the people around them.

[Ephesians 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eph 5:9</span></span>

fruit of the Spirit--taken by transcribers from [Gal
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#022). The true reading is that of the
oldest manuscripts, "The fruit of THE LIGHT"; in contrast with "the
unfruitful works of darkness" ([Eph
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#011)). This verse is parenthetic. Walk
as children of light, that is, in all good works and words, "FOR the
fruit of the light is \[borne\] in \[ALFORD; but BENGEL, 'consists in'\]
all goodness \[opposed to 'malice,' [Eph
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#031)\], righteousness \[opposed to
'covetousness,' [Eph 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#003)\] and truth
\[opposed to 'lying,' [Eph 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#025)\]."

[Ephesians 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eph 5:10</span></span>

Proving--construed with "walk" ([Eph
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#008); [Rom
12:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#001)). As we prove a coin by the eye
and the ear, and by using it, so by accurate and continued study, and
above all by practice and experimental trial, we may prove or test "what
is acceptable unto the Lord." This is the office of "light," of which
believers are "children," to manifest what each thing is, whether
sightly or unsightly.

[Ephesians 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eph 5:11</span></span>

unfruitful works of darkness--Sins are terminated in themselves, and
therefore are called "works," not "fruits" ([Gal
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#019), [Gal
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#022)). Their only fruit is that which
is not in a true sense fruit ([Deu
32:32](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#032)), namely, "death" ([Rom
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#021); [Gal
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#008)). Plants cannot bear "fruit" in
the absence of light. Sin is "darkness," and its parent is the prince of
darkness ([Eph 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#012)). Graces, on the
other hand, as flourishing in "the light," are reproductive, and abound
in fruits; which, as harmoniously combining in one whole, are termed (in
the singular) "the FRUIT of the Spirit" ([Eph
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#009)).

rather, &c.--Translate as Greek, "rather even reprove them" (compare
[Mat 5:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#014)). Not only "have no
fellowship, but even reprove them," namely, in words, and in your deeds,
which, shining with "the light," virtually reprove all that is contrary
to light ([Eph 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#013); [Joh
3:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#019)). "Have no fellowship," does
not imply that we can avoid all intercourse ([Co1
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#010)), but "avoid such fellowship as
will defile yourselves"; just as light, though it touch filth, is not
soiled by it; nay, as light detects it, so, "even reprove sin."

[Ephesians 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eph 5:12</span></span>

The Greek order is, "For the things done in secret by them, it is a
shame even to speak of." The "for" gives his reason for "not naming"
(compare [Eph 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#003)) in detail the works
of darkness, whereas he describes definitely ([Eph
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#009)) "the fruit of the light"
\[BENGEL\]. "Speak of," I think, is used here as "speaking of without
reproving," in contrast to "even reprove them." Thus the "for" expresses
this, Reprove them, for to speak of them without reproving them, is a
shame ([Eph 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#003)). Thus "works of
darkness" answers to "things done in secret."

[Ephesians 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eph 5:13</span></span>

that are reproved--rather, "when they are reproved," namely, by you
([Eph 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#011)).

whatsoever doth make manifest--rather, "everything that is (that is,
suffers itself to be) made manifest (or 'shone upon,' namely, by your
'reproving,' [Eph 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#011)) is
(thenceforth no longer 'darkness,' [Eph
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#008), but) light." The devil and the
wicked will not suffer themselves to be made manifest by the light, but
love darkness, though outwardly the light shines round them. Therefore,
"light" has no transforming effect on them, so that they do not become
light ([Joh 3:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#019)). But, says the
apostle, you being now light yourselves ([Eph
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#008)), by bringing to light through
reproof those who are in darkness, will convert them to light. Your
consistent lives and faithful reproofs will be your "armor of light"
([Rom 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#012)) in making an inroad on
the kingdom of darkness.

[Ephesians 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eph 5:14</span></span>

Wherefore--referring to the whole foregoing argument ([Eph
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#008), [Eph
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#011), [Eph
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#013)). Seeing that light (spiritual)
dispels the pre-existing darkness, He (God) saith . . . (compare the
same phrase, [Eph 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#008)).

Awake--The reading of all the oldest manuscripts is "Up!" or, "Rouse
thee!" a phrase used in stirring men to activity. The words are a
paraphrase of [Isa 60:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#001), not an
exact quotation. The word "Christ," shows that in quoting the prophecy,
he views it in the light thrown on it by its Gospel fulfilment. As
Israel is called on to "awake" from its previous state of "darkness" and
"death" ([Isa 59:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#010); [Isa
60:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#002)), for that her Light is come; so
the Church, and each individual is similarly called to awake. Believers
are called on to "awake" out of sleep; unbelievers, to "arise" from the
dead (compare [Mat 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#005); [Rom
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#011); [Th1
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#006), with [Eph
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#001)).

Christ--"the true light," "the Sun of righteousness."

give thee light--rather, as Greek, "shall shine upon thee" (so enabling
thee by being "made manifest" to become, and be, by the very fact,
"light," [Eph 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#013); then being so
"enlightened," [Eph 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#018), thou shalt
be able, by "reproving," to enlighten others).

[Ephesians 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eph 5:15</span></span>

that--rather as Greek, "See how ye walk," &c. The double idea is
compressed into one sentence: "See (take heed) how ye walk," and "See
that ye walk circumspectly." The manner, as well as the act itself, is
included. See how ye are walking, with a view to your being circumspect
(literally, accurate, exact) in your walk. Compare [Col
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#005), "Walk in wisdom (answering to 'as
wise' here) toward them that are without" (answering to "circumspectly,"
that is, correctly, in relation to the unbelievers around, not giving
occasion of stumbling to any, but edifying all by a consistent walk).

not as fools--Greek, "not as unwise, but as wise."

[Ephesians 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eph 5:16</span></span>

Redeeming the time-- ([Col 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#005)).
Greek, "Buying up for yourselves the seasonable time" (whenever it
occurs) of good to yourselves and to others. Buying off from the
vanities of "them that are without" ([Col
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#005)), and of the "unwise" (here in
Ephesians), the opportune time afforded to you for the work of God. In a
narrower sense, special favorable seasons for good, occasionally
presenting themselves, are referred to, of which believers ought
diligently to avail themselves. This constitutes true "wisdom" ([Eph
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#015)). In a larger sense, the whole
season from the time that one is spiritually awakened, is to be
"redeemed" from vanity for God (compare [Co2
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#002); [Pe1
4:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#002)). "Redeem" implies the
preciousness of the opportune season, a jewel to be bought at any price.
WAHL explains, "Redeeming for yourselves (that is, availing yourselves
of) the opportunity (offered you of acting aright), and commanding the
time as a master does his servant." TITTMANN, "Watch the time, and make
it your own so as to control it; as merchants look out for
opportunities, and accurately choose out the best goods; serve not the
time, but command it, and it shall do what you approve." So PINDAR
\[Pythia, 4.509\], "The time followed him as his servant, and was not as
a runaway slave."

because the days are evil--The days of life in general are so exposed to
evil, as to make it necessary to make the most of the seasonable
opportunity so long as it lasts ([Eph
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#013); [Gen
47:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#009); [Psa
49:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#005); [Ecc
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#002); [Ecc
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#001); [Joh
12:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#035)). Besides, there are many
special evil days (in persecution, sickness, &c.) when the Christian is
laid by in silence; therefore he needs the more to improve the
seasonable times afforded to him ([Amo
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#013)), which Paul perhaps alludes to.

[Ephesians 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eph 5:17</span></span>

Wherefore--seeing that ye need to walk so circumspectly, choosing and
using the right opportunity of good.

unwise--a different Greek word from that in [Eph
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#015). Translate, "foolish," or
"senseless."

understanding--not merely knowing as a matter of fact ([Luk
12:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#047)), but knowing with
understanding.

the will of the Lord--as to how each opportunity is to be used. The
Lord's will, ultimately, is our "sanctification" ([Th1
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#003)); and that "in every thing,"
meantime, we should "give thanks" ([Th1
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#018); compare above, [Eph
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#010)).

[Ephesians 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eph 5:18</span></span>

excess--worthless, ruinous, reckless prodigality.

wherein--not in the wine itself when used aright ([Ti1
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#023)), but in the "excess" as to it.

but be filled with the Spirit--The effect in inspiration was that the
person was "filled" with an ecstatic exhilaration, like that caused by
wine; hence the two are here connected (compare [Act
2:13-18](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#013)). Hence arose the abstinence
from wine of many of the prophets, for example, John the Baptist,
namely, in order to keep distinct before the world the ecstasy caused by
the Spirit, from that caused by wine. So also in ordinary Christians the
Spirit dwells not in the mind that seeks the disturbing influences of
excitement, but in the well-balanced prayerful mind. Such a one
expresses his joy, not in drunken or worldly songs, but in Christian
hymns of thankfulness.

[Ephesians 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eph 5:19</span></span>

([Col 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#016)).

to yourselves--"to one another." Hence soon arose the antiphonal or
responsive chanting of which PLINY writes to Trajan: "They are wont on a
fixed day to meet before daylight \[to avoid persecution\] and to recite
a hymn among themselves by turns, to Christ, as if being God." The
Spirit gives true eloquence; wine, a spurious eloquence.

psalms--generally accompanied by an instrument.

hymns--in direct praise to God (compare [Act
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#025); [Co1
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#026); [Jam
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#013)).

songs--the general term for lyric pieces; "spiritual" is added to mark
their being here restricted to sacred subjects, though not merely to
direct praises of God, but also containing exhortations, prophecies, &c.
Contrast the drunken "songs," [Amo
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#010).

making melody--Greek, "playing and singing with an instrument."

in your heart--not merely with the tongue; but the serious feeling of
the heart accompanying the singing of the lips (compare [Co1
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#015); [Psa
47:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#007)). The contrast is between the
heathen and the Christian practice, "Let your songs be not the drinking
songs of heathen feasts, but psalms and hymns; and their accompaniment,
not the music of the lyre, but the melody of the heart" \[CONYBEARE and
HOWSON\].

to the Lord--See PLINY'S letter quoted above: "To Christ as God."

[Ephesians 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eph 5:20</span></span>

thanks . . . for all things--even for adversities; also for blessings,
unknown as well as known ([Col 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#017);
[Th1 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#018)).

unto God and the Father--the Fountain of every blessing in Creation,
Providence, Election, and Redemption.

Lord Jesus Christ--by whom all things, even distresses, become ours
([Rom 8:35](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#035), [Rom
8:37](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#037); [Co1
3:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#020)).

[Ephesians 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eph 5:21</span></span>

([Phi 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#003); [Pe1
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#005).) Here he passes from our
relations to God, to those which concern our fellow men.

in the fear of God--All the oldest manuscripts and authorities read, "in
the fear of CHRIST." The believer passes from under the bondage of the
law as a letter, to be "the servant of Christ" ([Co1
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#022)), which, through the instinct of
love to Him, is really to be "the Lord's freeman"; for he is "under the
law to Christ" ([Co1 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#021); compare
[Joh 8:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#036)). Christ, not the Father
([Joh 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#022)), is to be our judge. Thus
reverential fear of displeasing Him is the motive for discharging our
relative duties as Christians ([Co1
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#022); [Co2
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#011); [Pe1
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#013)).

[Ephesians 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eph 5:22</span></span>

([Eph 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#009).) The Church's relation to
Christ in His everlasting purpose, is the foundation and archetype of
the three greatest of earthly relations, that of husband and wife ([Eph
5:22-33](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#022)), parent and child ([Eph
6:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#001)), master and servant ([Eph
6:4-9](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#004)). The oldest manuscripts omit
"submit yourselves"; supplying it from [Eph
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#021), "Ye wives (submitting
yourselves) unto your own husbands." "Your own" is an argument for
submissiveness on the part of the wives; it is not a stranger, but your
own husbands whom you are called on to submit unto (compare [Gen
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#016); [Co1
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#002); [Co1
14:34](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#034); [Col
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#018); [Tit
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#005); [Pe1
3:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#001)). Those subject ought to submit
themselves, of whatever kind their superiors are. "Submit" is the term
used of wives: "obey," of children ([Eph
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#001)), as there is a greater equality
between wives and husbands, than between children and parents.

as unto the Lord--Submissiveness is rendered by the wife to the husband
under the eye of Christ, and so is rendered to Christ Himself. The
husband stands to the wife in the relation that the Lord does to the
Church, and this is to be the ground of her submission: though that
submission is inferior in kind and degree to that which she owes Christ
([Eph 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#024)).

[Ephesians 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eph 5:23</span></span>

([Co1 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#003).)

even as--Greek, "as also."

and he is--The oldest manuscripts read, "Himself (being) Saviour,"
omitting "and," and "is." In Christ's case, the Headship is united with,
nay gained by, His having SAVED the body in the process of redemption;
so that (Paul implies) I am not alleging Christ's Headship as one
entirely identical with that other, for He has a claim to it, and office
in it, peculiar to Himself \[ALFORD\]. The husband is not saviour of the
wife, in which particular Christ excels; hence, "But" ([Eph
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#024)) follows \[BENGEL\].

[Ephesians 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">eph 5:24</span></span>

Therefore--Translate, as Greek, "But," or "Nevertheless," that is,
though there be the difference of headships mentioned in [Eph
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#023), nevertheless, thus far they are
one, namely, in the subjection or submission (the same Greek stands for
"is subject," as for "submit," [Eph
5:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#021)) of the Church to Christ,
being the prototype of that of the wife to the husband.

their own--not in most of the oldest manuscripts, and not needed by the
argument.

in every thing--appertaining to a husband's legitimate authority; "in
the Lord" ([Col 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#018)); everything not
contrary to God.

[Ephesians 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">eph 5:25</span></span>

"Thou hast seen the measure of obedience; now hear also the measure of
love. Do you wish your wife to obey you, as the Church is to obey
Christ? Then have a solicitude for her as Christ had for the Church
([Eph 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#023), "Himself the Saviour of
the body"); and "if it be necessary to give thy life for her, or to be
cut in ten thousand pieces, or to endure any other suffering whatever,
do not refuse it; and if you suffer thus, not even so do you do what
Christ has done; for you indeed do so being already united to her, but
He did so for one that treated Him with aversion and hatred. As,
therefore, He brought to His feet one that so treated Him, and that even
wantonly spurned Him, by much tenderness of regard, not by threats,
insults, and terror: so also do you act towards your wife, and though
you see her disdainful and wantonly wayward, you will be able to bring
her to your feet by much thoughtfulness for her, by love, by kindness.
For no bound is more sovereign in binding than such bonds, especially in
the case of husband and wife. For one may constrain a servant by fear,
though not even he is so to be bound to you; for he may readily run
away. But the companion of your life, the mother of your children, the
basis of all your joy, you ought to bind to you, not by fear and
threats, but by love and attachment" \[CHRYSOSTOM\].

gave himself--Greek, "gave Himself up."

for it--Translate, "for her." The relation of the Church to Christ is
the ground of Christianity's having raised woman to her due place in the
social scale, from which she was, and is, excluded in heathen lands.

[Ephesians 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">eph 5:26</span></span>

sanctify--that is, consecrate her to God. Compare [Joh
17:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#019), meaning, "I devote Myself as a
holy sacrifice, that My disciples also may be devoted or consecrated as
holy in (through) the truth" \[NEANDER\] ([Heb
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#011); [Heb
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#010); [Heb
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#012) see on [Heb
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#010)).

and cleanse--rather, as Greek, "cleansing," without the "and."

with the washing of water--rather as Greek, "with," or "by the laver of
the water," namely, the baptismal water. So it ought to be translated in
[Tit 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#005), the only other passage in
the New Testament where it occurs. As the bride passed through a
purifying bath before marriage, so the Church (compare [Rev
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#002)). He speaks of baptism according
to its high ideal and design, as if the inward grace accompanied the
outward rite; hence he asserts of outward baptism whatever is involved
in a believing appropriation of the divine truths it symbolizes, and
says that Christ, by baptism, has purified the Church \[NEANDER\] ([Pe1
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#021)).

by the word--Greek, "IN the word." To be joined with "cleansing it," or
"her." The "word of faith" ([Rom
10:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#008), [Rom
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#017)), of which confession is made in
baptism, and which carries the real cleansing ([Joh
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#003); [Joh
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#017)) and regenerating power ([Pe1
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#023); [Pe1
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#021)) \[ALFORD\]. So AUGUSTINE \[Tract
80, in John\], "Take away the word, and what is the water save water?
Add the word to the element, and it becomes a sacrament, being itself as
it were the visible word." The regenerating efficacy of baptism is
conveyed in, and by, the divine word alone.

[Ephesians 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">eph 5:27</span></span>

he--The oldest manuscripts and authorities read, "That He might Himself
present unto Himself the Church glorious," namely, as a bride ([Co2
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#002)). Holiness and glory are
inseparable. "Cleansing" is the necessary preliminary to both. Holiness
is glory internal; glory is holiness shining forth outwardly. The laver
of baptism is the vehicle, but the word is the nobler and true
instrument of the cleansing \[BENGEL\]. It is Christ that prepares the
Church with the necessary ornaments of grace, for presentation to
Himself, as the Bridegroom at His coming again ([Mat
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#001), &c.; [Rev
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#007); [Rev
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#002)).

not having spot-- ([Sol 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#007)). The
visible Church now contains clean and unclean together, like Noah's ark;
like the wedding room which contained some that had, and others that had
not, the wedding garment ([Mat
22:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#010); compare [Ti2
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#020)); or as the good and bad fish are
taken in the same net because it cannot discern the bad from the good,
the fishermen being unable to know what kind of fish the nets have taken
under the waves. Still the Church is termed "holy" in the creed, in
reference to her ideal and ultimate destination. When the Bridegroom
comes, the bride shall be presented to Him wholly without spot, the evil
being cut off from the body for ever ([Mat
13:47-50](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#047)). Not that there are two
churches, one with bad and good intermingled, another in which there are
good alone; but one and the same Church in relation to different times,
now with good and evil together, hereafter with good alone \[PEARSON\].

[Ephesians 5:28](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">eph 5:28</span></span>

Translate, "So ought husbands also (thus the oldest manuscripts read) to
love their own (compare Note, see on [Eph
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#022)) wives as their own bodies."

He that loveth his wife loveth himself--So there is the same love and
the same union of body between Christ and the Church ([Eph
5:30](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#030), [Eph
5:32](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#032)).

[Ephesians 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#029)

For--Supply, and we all love ourselves: "For no man," &c.

his own flesh-- ([Eph 5:31](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#031), end).

nourisheth--Greek, "nourisheth it up," namely, to maturity.
"Nourisheth," refers to food and internal sustenance; "cherisheth," to
clothing and external fostering.

even as--Translate, "even as also."

the Lord--The oldest manuscripts read, "Christ." [Exo
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#010) prescribes three duties to the
husband. The two former (food and raiment) are here alluded to in a
spiritual sense, by "nourisheth and cherisheth"; the third "duty of
marriage" is not added in consonance with the holy propriety of
Scripture language: its antitype is, "know the Lord" ([Hos
2:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#019)) \[BENGEL\].

[Ephesians 5:30](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">eph 5:30</span></span>

For--Greek, "Because" ([Co1 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#015)).
Christ nourisheth and cherisheth the Church as being of one flesh with
Him. Translate, "Because we are members of His body (His literal body),
being OF His flesh and of His bones" \[ALFORD\] ([Gen
2:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#023)). The Greek expresses, "Being
formed out of" or "of the substance of His flesh." Adam's deep sleep,
wherein Eve was formed from out of his opened side, is an emblem of
Christ's death, which was the birth of the Spouse, the Church. [Joh
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#024); [Joh
19:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#034), to which [Eph
5:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#025) allude, as implying atonement
by His blood, and sanctification by the "water," answering to that which
flowed from His side (compare also [Joh
7:38-39](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#038); [Co1
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#011)). As Adam gave Eve a new name,
Hebrew, "Isha," "woman," formed from his own rib, Ish, "man," signifying
her formation from him, so Christ, [Rev
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#017); [Rev
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#012). [Gen
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#021), [Gen
2:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#023) puts the bones first because
the reference there is to the natural structure. But Paul is referring
to the flesh of Christ. It is not our bones and flesh, but "we" that are
spiritually propagated (in our soul and spirit now, and in the body
hereafter, regenerated) from the manhood of Christ which has flesh and
bones. We are members of His glorified body ([Joh
6:53](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#053)). The two oldest existing
manuscripts, and Coptic or Memphitic version, omit "of His flesh and of
His bones"; the words may have crept into the text through the Margin
from [Gen 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#023), Septuagint. However,
IRENÃ†US, 294, and the old Latin and Vulgate versions, with some good
old manuscripts, have them.

[Ephesians 5:31](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">eph 5:31</span></span>

For--The propagation of the Church from Christ, as that of Eve from
Adam, is the foundation of the spiritual marriage. The natural marriage,
wherein "a man leaves father and mother (the oldest manuscripts omit
'his') and is joined unto his wife," is not the principal thing meant
here, but the spiritual marriage represented by it, and on which it
rests, whereby Christ left the Father's bosom to woo to Himself the
Church out of a lost world: [Eph 5:32](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#032)
proves this: His earthly mother as such, also, He holds in secondary
account as compared with His spiritual Bride ([Luk
2:48-49](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#048); [Luk
8:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#019); [Luk
11:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#027)). He shall again leave His
Father's abode to consummate the union ([Mat
25:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#001); [Rev
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#007)).

they two shall be one flesh--So the Samaritan Pentateuch, the
Septuagint, &c., read ([Gen 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#024)),
instead of "they shall be one flesh." So [Mat
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#005). In natural marriage, husband and
wife combine the elements of one perfect human being: the one being
incomplete without the other. So Christ, as God-man, is pleased to make
the Church, the body, a necessary adjunct to Himself, the Head. He is
the archetype of the Church, from whom and according to whom, as the
pattern, she is formed. He is her Head, as the husband is of the wife
([Rom 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#005); [Co1
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#003); [Co1
15:45](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#045)). Christ will never allow any
power to sever Himself and His bride, indissolubly joined ([Mat
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#006); [Joh
10:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#028); [Joh
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#001)).

[Ephesians 5:32](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">eph 5:32</span></span>

Rather, "This mystery is a great one." This profound truth, beyond man's
power of discovering, but now revealed, namely, of the spiritual union
of Christ and the Church, represented by the marriage union, is a great
one, of deep import. See on [Eph 5:30](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#030).
So "mystery" is used of a divine truth not to be discovered save by
revelation of God ([Rom 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#025); [Co1
15:51](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#051)). The Vulgate wrongly
translates, "This is a great sacrament," which is made the plea by the
Romish Church (in spite of the blunder having been long ago exposed by
their own commentators, CAJETAN and ESTIUS) for making marriage a
sacrament; it is plain not marriage in general, but that of Christ and
the Church, is what is pronounced to be a "great mystery," as the words
following prove, "I \[emphatic\] say it in regard to Christ and to the
Church" (so the Greek is best translated). "I, while I quote these words
out of Scripture, use them in a higher sense" \[CONYBEARE and HOWSON\].

[Ephesians 5:33](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">eph 5:33</span></span>

Nevertheless--not to pursue further the mystical meaning of marriage.
Translate, as Greek, "Do ye also (as Christ does) severally each one so
love," &c. The words, "severally each one," refer to them in their
individual capacity, contrasted with the previous collective view of the
members of the Church as the bride of Christ.
