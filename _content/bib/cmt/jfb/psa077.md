### [Psalms Chapter 77](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#001)

[Psalms 77:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 77:1</span></span>

To Jeduthun--(See on [Psa 39:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#001),
title). In a time of great affliction, when ready to despair, the
Psalmist derives relief from calling to mind God's former and wonderful
works of delivering power and grace. (Psa. 77:1-20)

expresses the purport of the Psalm.

[Psalms 77:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 77:2</span></span>

his importunacy.

my sore ran . . . night--literally, "my hand was spread," or, "stretched
out" (compare [Psa 44:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#020)).

ceased not--literally, "grew not numb," or, "feeble" ([Gen
45:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#026); [Psa
38:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#008)).

my soul . . . comforted--(compare [Gen
37:35](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#035); [Jer
31:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#015)).

[Psalms 77:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 77:3</span></span>

His sad state contrasted with former joys.

was troubled--literally, "violently agitated," or disquieted ([Psa
39:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#006); [Psa
41:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#005)).

my spirit was overwhelmed--or, "fainted" ([Psa
107:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#005); [Jon
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/jon002.htm#007)).

[Psalms 77:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 77:4</span></span>

holdest . . . waking--or, "fast," that I cannot sleep. Thus he is led to
express his anxious feelings in several earnest questions indicative of
impatient sorrow.

[Psalms 77:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 77:10</span></span>

Omitting the supplied words, we may read, "This is my affliction--the
years of," &c., "years" being taken as parallel to affliction (compare
[Psa 90:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#015)), as of God's ordering.

[Psalms 77:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 77:11</span></span>

He finds relief in contrasting God's former deliverances. Shall we
receive good at His hands, and not evil? Both are orderings of unerring
mercy and unfailing love.

[Psalms 77:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 77:13</span></span>

Thy way . . . in the sanctuary--God's ways of grace and providence ([Psa
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#003); [Psa
67:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#002)), ordered on holy principles, as
developed in His worship; or implied in His perfections, if "holiness"
be used for "sanctuary," as some prefer translating (compare [Exo
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#011)).

[Psalms 77:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 77:14</span></span>

Illustrations of God's power in His special interventions for His people
(Exo. 14:1-31), and, in the more common, but sublime, control of nature
([Psa 22:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#011); [Hab
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#014)) which may have attended those
miraculous events ([Exo 14:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#024)).

[Psalms 77:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 77:15</span></span>

Jacob and Joseph--representing all.

[Psalms 77:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 77:19</span></span>

waters . . . , footsteps--may refer to His actual leading the people
through the sea, though also expressing the mysteries of providence.
