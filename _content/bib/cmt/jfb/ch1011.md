### [1 Chronicles Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#001)

[1 Chronicles 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 11:1</span></span>

DAVID MADE KING. ([Ch1 11:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#001))

Then all Israel gathered themselves to David unto Hebron--This event
happened on the death of Ish-bosheth (see on [Sa2
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#001)). The convention of the estates of
the kingdom, the public and solemn homage of the representatives of the
people, and the repeated anointing of the new king in their presence and
by their direction, seem to have been necessary to the general
acknowledgment of the sovereign on the part of the nation (compare [Sa1
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#015)).

[1 Chronicles 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch1 11:4</span></span>

HE WINS THE CASTLE OF ZION FROM THE JEBUSITES BY JOAB'S VALOR. ([Ch1
11:4-9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#004))

David and all Israel went to . . . Jebus--(See on [Sa2
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#006)).

[1 Chronicles 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch1 11:8</span></span>

Joab repaired the rest of the city--David built a new town to the north
of the old one on Mount Zion; but Joab was charged with a commission to
restore the part that had been occupied by the ancient Jebus, to repair
the breaches made during the siege, to rebuild the houses which had been
demolished or burned in the sacking of the town, and to preserve all
that had escaped the violence of the soldiery. This work of
reconstruction is not noticed elsewhere \[CALMET\].

[1 Chronicles 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch1 11:10</span></span>

A CATALOGUE OF HIS WORTHIES. (1Ch. 11:10-47)

These . . . are the chief of the mighty men--(See on [Sa2
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#008)). They are here described as
those who held strongly with him (Margin) to make him king, &c. In these
words the sacred historian assigns a reason for introducing the list of
their names, immediately after his account of the election of David as
king, and the conquest of Jerusalem; namely, that they assisted in
making David king. In the original form of the list, and the connection
in which it occurs in Samuel, there is no reference to the choice of a
king; and even in this passage it is only in the clause introduced into
the superscription that such a reference occurs \[KEIL\].

[1 Chronicles 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch1 11:11</span></span>

Jashobeam, an Hachmonite--or, "son of Hachmoni." He is called also son
of Zabdiel ([Ch1 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#002)), so that,
strictly speaking, he was the grandson of Hachmoni (compare [Ch1
27:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#032)).

lifted up his spear against three hundred slain by him at one time--The
feat is said ([Sa2 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#008)) to have been
a slaughter of eight hundred in one day. Some endeavor to reconcile the
statements in that passage and in this by supposing that he slew eight
hundred on one occasion and three hundred on another; while others
conjecture that he attacked a body of eight hundred, and, having slain
three hundred of them, the rest fled \[LIGHTFOOT\].

[1 Chronicles 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch1 11:12</span></span>

the three mighties--Only two are mentioned; namely, Jashobeam and
Eleazar--the third, Shammah ([Sa2
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#011)), is not named in this passage.

[1 Chronicles 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch1 11:13</span></span>

He was with David at Pas-dammim--It was at the time when he was a
fugitive in the wilderness, and, parched with thirst under the burning
heat of noonday, he wistfully thought of the cool fountain of his native
village \[[Sa2 23:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#015); [Ch1
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#017)\]. This is a notice of the
achievement, to which Eleazar owed his fame, but the details are found
only in [Sa2 23:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#009), where it is
further said that he was aided by the valor of Shammah, a fact
corroborated in the passage before us ([Ch1
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#014)), where it is recorded of the
heroes, that "they set themselves in the midst of that parcel." As the
singular number is used in speaking of Shammah ([Sa2
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#012)), the true view seems to be that
when Eleazar had given up from exhaustion, Shammah succeeded, and by his
fresh and extraordinary prowess preserved the field.

barley--or lentils ([Sa2 23:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#011)).
Ephes-dammim was situated between Shocoh and Azekah, in the west of the
Judahite territory. These feats were performed when David acted as
Saul's general against the Philistines.

[1 Chronicles 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch1 11:15</span></span>

David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink . . . of the
well of Beth-lehem--(See on [Sa2
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#015)). This chivalrous act evinces
the enthusiastic devotion of David's men, that they were ready to
gratify his smallest wish at the risk of their lives. It is probable
that, when uttering the wish, David had no recollection of the military
posted at Beth-lehem. It is generally taken for granted that those who
fought a way to the well of Beth-lehem were the three champions just
mentioned \[see on [Ch1 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#013)\]. But
this is far from being clear. On the contrary, it would seem that three
different heroes are referred to, for Abishai ([Ch1
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#020)) was one of them. The camp of
the Philistines was in the valley of Rephaim ([Ch1
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#015)), which lay on the west of
Jerusalem, but an outpost was stationed at Beth-lehem ([Ch1
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#016)), and through this garrison they
had to force a passage.

[1 Chronicles 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch1 11:21</span></span>

howbeit he attained not to the first three--(See on [Sa2
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#019)).

[1 Chronicles 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch1 11:22</span></span>

Benaiah . . . of Kabzeel--a town in the south of Judah ([Jos
15:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#021); [Neh
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#025)). It is said that "he had done
many acts," though three only are mentioned as specimens of his daring
energy and fearless courage.

slew two lionlike men of Moab--literally, "lions of God," that is, great
lions or champions. This gallant feat was probably achieved in David's
hostile invasion of Moab ([Sa2 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#002)).

also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day--probably a
cave into which Benaiah had taken refuge from the snowstorm, and in
which he encountered a savage lion which had its lair there. In a
spacious cave the achievement would be far greater than if the monster
had been previously snared or cabined in a pit.

[1 Chronicles 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ch1 11:23</span></span>

he went down--the ordinary phraseology for expressing an engagement in
battle. The encounter of Benaiah with this gigantic Egyptian reminds us,
in some respects, of David's combat with Goliath. At least, the height
of this giant, which was about eight feet, and his armor, resembled his
of Gath.

with a staff--that is, having no other weapon in his hand than his
walking stick.

[1 Chronicles 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">ch1 11:25</span></span>

David set him over his guard--the Cherethites and Pelethites that
composed the small bodyguard in immediate attendance on the king.

[1 Chronicles 11:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">ch1 11:26</span></span>

Also the valiant men of the armies--This was the third degree of
military rank, and Asahel was their chief; the names of few of those
mentioned are historically known.

[1 Chronicles 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">ch1 11:27</span></span>

Shammoth--Between this name and Hebez, that of Elikah has evidently
fallen out, as we may see ([Sa2
23:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#025)) \[BERTHEAU\].

[1 Chronicles 11:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">ch1 11:30</span></span>

Maharai--chief of the detachment of the guards who attended on the king
in the tenth month, January ([Ch1
27:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#013); [Sa2
23:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#028)).

[1 Chronicles 11:39](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">ch1 11:39</span></span>

Naharai--armorbearer to Joab ([Sa2
23:37](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#037)). The non-occurrence of Joab's
name in any of the three catalogues is most probably to be accounted for
by the circumstance that his office as commander-in-chief raised him to
a position superior to all these orders of military knighthood.

[1 Chronicles 11:41](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">ch1 11:41</span></span>

Uriah the Hittite--The enrolment of this name in such a list, attesting,
as it does, his distinguished merits as a brave and devoted officer,
aggravates the criminality of David's outrage on his life and honor. The
number of the names at 1Ch. 11:26-41 (exclusive of Asahel and Uriah, who
were dead) is thirty, and at [Ch1
11:41-47](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#041) is sixteen--making together
forty-eight (see on 1Ch. 27:1-34). Of those mentioned (1Ch. 11:26-41),
the greater part belonged to the tribes of Judah and Benjamin; the
sixteen names ([Ch1 11:41-47](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#041)) are all
associated with places unknown, or with cities and districts on the east
of the Jordan. The northern tribes do not appear to have furnished any
leaders \[BERTHEAU\].
