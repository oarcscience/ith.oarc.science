### [Jeremiah Chapter 45](../../../bib/kjv/jer045.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 45:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer045.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 45:1</span></span>

JEREMIAH COMFORTS BARUCH. ([Jer
45:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/jer045.htm#001))

these words--his prophecies from the thirteenth year of Josiah to the
fourth of Jehoiakim.

[Jeremiah 45:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer045.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 45:3</span></span>

Thou didst say, &c.--Jeremiah does not spare his disciple, but unveils
his fault, namely, fear for his life by reason of the suspicions which
he incurred in the eyes of his countrymen (compare [Jer
36:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#017)), as if he was in sympathy with
the Chaldeans ([Jer 43:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#003)), and
instigator of Jeremiah; also ingratitude in speaking of his "grief,"
&c., whereas he ought to deem himself highly blessed in being employed
by God to record Jeremiah's prophecies.

added--rescued from the peril of my first writing ([Jer
36:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#026)). I am again involved in a
similar peril. He upbraids God as dealing harshly with him.

I fainted--rather, "I am weary."

no rest--no quiet resting-place.

[Jeremiah 45:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer045.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 45:4</span></span>

that which I have built . . . planted I will pluck up-- ([Isa
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#005)). This whole nation (the Jews)
which I founded and planted with such extraordinary care and favor, I
will overthrow.

[Jeremiah 45:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer045.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 45:5</span></span>

seekest thou great things for thyself--Thou art over-fastidious and
self-seeking. When My own peculiar people, a "whole" nation ([Jer
45:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer045.htm#004)), and the temple, are being given
to ruin, dost thou expect to be exempt from all hardship? Baruch had
raised his expectations too high in this world, and this made his
distresses harder to be borne. The frowns of the world would not
disquiet us if we did not so eagerly covet its smiles. What folly to
seek great things for ourselves here, where everything is little, and
nothing certain!

all flesh--the whole Jewish nation and even foreign peoples ([Jer
25:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#026)).

but thy life . . . for a prey--Esteem it enough at such a general crisis
that thy life shall be granted thee. Be content with this boon of life
which I will rescue from imminent death, even as when all things are
given up to plunder, if one escape with aught, he has a something saved
as his "prey" ([Jer 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#009)). It is
striking how Jeremiah, who once used such complaining language himself,
is enabled now to minister the counsel requisite for Baruch when falling
into the same sin ([Jer 12:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#001); [Jer
15:10-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#010)). This is part of God's
design in suffering His servants to be tempted, that their temptations
may adapt them for ministering to their fellow servants when tempted.

He begins with Egypt, being the country to which he had been removed.
The forty-sixth chapter contains two prophecies concerning it: the
discomfiture of Pharaoh-necho at Carchemish by Nebuchadnezzar, and the
long subsequent conquest of Egypt by the same king; also the
preservation of the Jews ([Jer
46:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#027)).
