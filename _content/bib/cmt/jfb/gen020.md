### [Genesis Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#001)

[Genesis 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 20:1</span></span>

ABRAHAM'S DENIAL OF HIS WIFE. (Gen. 20:1-18)

Abraham journeyed from thence . . . and dwelled between Kadesh and
Shur--Leaving the encampment, he migrated to the southern border of
Canaan. In the neighborhood of Gerar was a very rich and well-watered
pasture land.

[Genesis 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 20:2</span></span>

Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister--Fear of the people
among whom he was, tempted him to equivocate. His conduct was highly
culpable. It was deceit, deliberate and premeditated--there was no
sudden pressure upon him--it was the second offense of the kind \[see on
[Gen 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#013)\] --it was a distrust of
God every way surprising, and it was calculated to produce injurious
effects on the heathen around. Its mischievous tendency was not long in
being developed.

Abimelech (father-king) . . . sent and took Sarah--to be one of his
wives, in the exercise of a privilege claimed by Eastern sovereigns,
already explained (see on [Gen 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#015)).

[Genesis 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 20:3</span></span>

But God came to Abimelech in a dream--In early times a dream was often
made the medium of communicating important truths; and this method was
adopted for the preservation of Sarah.

[Genesis 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 20:9</span></span>

Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said . . . What hast thou done?--In
what a humiliating plight does the patriarch now appear--he, a servant
of the true God, rebuked by a heathen prince. Who would not rather be in
the place of Abimelech than of the honored but sadly offending
patriarch! What a dignified attitude is that of the king--calmly and
justly reproving the sin of the patriarch, but respecting his person and
heaping coals of fire on his head by the liberal presents made to him.

[Genesis 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gen 20:11</span></span>

And Abraham said . . . I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this
place--From the horrible vices of Sodom he seems to have taken up the
impression that all other cities of Canaan were equally corrupt. There
might have been few or none who feared God, but what a sad thing when
men of the world show a higher sense of honor and a greater abhorrence
of crimes than a true worshipper!

[Genesis 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gen 20:12</span></span>

yet indeed she is my sister--(See on [Gen
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#031)). What a poor defense Abraham
made. The statement absolved him from the charge of direct and absolute
falsehood, but he had told a moral untruth because there was an
intention to deceive (compare [Gen
12:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#011)). "Honesty is always the best
policy." Abraham's life would have been as well protected without the
fraud as with it: and what shame to himself, what distrust to God, what
dishonor to religion might have been prevented! "Let us speak truth
every man to his neighbor" \[[Zac
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#016); [Eph
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#025)\].
