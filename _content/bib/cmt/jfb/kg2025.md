[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 25:1</span></span>

JERUSALEM AGAIN BESIEGED. ([Kg2
25:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#001))

Nebuchadnezzar . . . came . . . against Jerusalem--Incensed by the
revolt of Zedekiah, the Assyrian despot determined to put an end to the
perfidious and inconstant monarchy of Judea. This chapter narrates his
third and last invasion, which he conducted in person at the head of an
immense army, levied out of all the tributary nations under his sway.
Having overrun the northern parts of the country and taken almost all
the fenced cities ([Jer 34:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#007)), he
marched direct to Jerusalem to invest it. The date of the beginning as
well as the end of the siege is here carefully marked (compare [Eze
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#001); [Jer
39:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#001); [Jer
52:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#004)); from which it appears, that,
with a brief interruption caused by Nebuchadnezzar's marching to oppose
the Egyptians who were coming to its relief but who retreated without
fighting, the siege lasted a year and a half. So long a resistance was
owing, not to the superior skill and valor of the Jewish soldiers, but
to the strength of the city fortifications, on which the king too
confidently relied (compare [Jer
21:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#001); Jer. 37:1-38:28).

pitched against it, and . . . built forts--rather, perhaps, drew lines
of circumvallation, with a ditch to prevent any going out of the city.
On this rampart were erected his military engines for throwing missiles
into the city.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg2 25:3</span></span>

on the ninth day of the fourth month the famine prevailed--In
consequence of the close and protracted blockade, the inhabitants were
reduced to dreadful extremities; and under the maddening influence of
hunger, the most inhuman atrocities were perpetrated ([Lam
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#020), [Lam
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#022); [Lam
4:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#009); [Eze
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#010)). This was a fulfilment of the
prophetic denunciations threatened on the apostasy of the chosen people
([Lev 26:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#029); [Deu
28:53-57](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#053); [Jer
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#002); [Jer
27:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#013); [Eze
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#016)).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg2 25:4</span></span>

ZEDEKIAH TAKEN. (2Ki. 25:4-30)

the city was broken up--that is, a breach was effected, as we are
elsewhere informed, in a part of the wall belonging to the lower city
([Ch2 32:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#005); [Ch2
33:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#014)).

the men of war fled by night by the way of the gate between two walls,
which is by the king's garden--The king's garden was ([Neh
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#015)) at the pool of Siloam, that is,
at the mouth of the TyropÃ&brvbr;on. A trace of the outermost of these
walls appears to be still extant in the rude pathway which crosses the
mouth of the TyropÃ&brvbr;on, on a mound hard by the old mulberry tree,
which marks the traditional spot of Isaiah's martyrdom \[ROBINSON\]. It
is probable that the besiegers had overlooked this pass.

the king went . . . toward the plain--that is, the Ghor, or valley of
Jordan, estimated at five hours' distance from Jerusalem. The plain near
Jericho is about eleven or twelve miles broad.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg2 25:6</span></span>

they took the king, and brought him . . . to Riblah--Nebuchadnezzar,
having gone from the siege to oppose the auxiliary forces of
Pharaoh-hophra, left his generals to carry on the blockade, he himself
not returning to the scene of action, but taking up his station at
Riblah in the land of Hamath ([Kg2
23:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#033)).

they gave judgment upon him--They, that is, the council ([Jer
39:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#003), [Jer
39:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#013); [Dan
6:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#007), [Dan
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#012)), regarding him as a seditious
and rebellious vassal, condemned him for violating his oath and
neglecting the announcement of the divine will as made known to him by
Jeremiah (compare [Jer 32:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#005); [Jer
34:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#002); [Jer
38:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#017)). His sons and the nobles who
had joined in his flight were slain before his eyes ([Jer
39:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#006); [Jer
52:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#010)). In conformity with Eastern
ideas, which consider a blind man incapable of ruling, his eyes were put
out, and being put in chains, he was carried to perpetual imprisonment
in Babylon ([Jer 52:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#011)), which, though
he came to it, as Ezekiel had foretold, he did not see ([Jer
32:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#005); [Eze
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#013); [Eze
17:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#016)).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 25:8</span></span>

on the seventh day of the month . . . came Nebuzar-adan--(compare [Jer
52:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#012)). In attempting to reconcile
these two passages, it must be supposed either that, though he had set
out on the seventh, he did not arrive in Jerusalem till the tenth, or
that he did not put his orders in execution till that day. His office as
captain of the guard ([Gen 37:36](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#036); [Gen
39:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#001)) called him to execute the awards
of justice on criminals; and hence, although not engaged in the siege of
Jerusalem ([Jer 39:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#013)), Nebuzar-adan
was despatched to rase the city, to plunder the temple, to lay both in
ruins, demolish the fortifications, and transport the inhabitants to
Babylon. The most eminent of these were taken to the king at Riblah
([Kg2 25:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#027)) and executed, as
instigators and abettors of the rebellion, or otherwise obnoxious to the
Assyrian government. In their number were Seraiah, the high priest,
grandfather of Ezra ([Ezr 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#001)), his
sagan or deputy, a priest of the second order ([Jer
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#002); [Jer
29:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#025), [Jer
29:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#029); [Jer
37:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#003)).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg2 25:18</span></span>

the three keepers of the door--not mere porters, but officers of high
trust among the Levites ([Kg2 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#004);
[Ch1 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#026)).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg2 25:19</span></span>

five men of them that were in the king's presence--that is, who belonged
to the royal retinue. It is probable that there were five at first, and
that other two were found afterwards ([Jer
52:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#025)).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg2 25:22</span></span>

Nebuchadnezzar . . . made Gedaliah . . . ruler--The people permitted to
remain were, besides the king's daughters, a few court attendants and
others ([Jer 40:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#007)) too insignificant
to be removed, only the peasantry who could till the land and dress the
vineyards. Gedaliah was Jeremiah's friend ([Jer
26:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#024)), and having, by the prophet's
counsel, probably fled from the city as abandoned of God, he surrendered
himself to the conqueror ([Jer 38:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#002),
[Jer 38:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#017)), and being promoted to the
government of Judea, fixed his provincial court at Mizpeh. He was well
qualified to surmount the difficulties of ruling at such a crisis. Many
of the fugitive Jews, as well as the soldiers of Zedekiah who had
accompanied the king in his flight to the plains of Jericho, left their
retreats ([Jer 40:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#011)) and flocked
around the governor; who having counselled them to submit, promised them
on complying with this condition, security on oath that they would
retain their possessions and enjoy the produce of their land ([Jer
40:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#009)).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg2 25:25</span></span>

Ishmael . . . of the seed royal, came, and ten men with him, and smote
Gedaliah--He had found refuge with Baalis, king of the Ammonites, and he
returned with a bad design, being either instigated by envy of a
governor not descended from the house of David, or bribed by Baalis to
murder Gedaliah. The generous governor, though apprised of his
intentions, refused to credit the report, much less to sanction the
proposal made by an attached friend to cut off Ishmael. The consequence
was, that he was murdered by this same Ishmael, when entertaining him in
his own house ([Jer 41:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#001)).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg2 25:26</span></span>

and all the people . . . came to Egypt--In spite of Jeremiah's
dissuasions ([Jer 43:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#007)) they settled
in various cities of that country ([Jer
44:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#001)).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg2 25:27</span></span>

seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin--corresponding
with the year of Nebuchadnezzar's death, and his son Evil-merodach's
ascension to the throne.

Evil-merodach . . . did lift up the head of Jehoiachin . . . and spake
kindly--gave him liberty upon parole. This kindly feeling is said to
have originated in a familiar acquaintance formed in prison, in which
Evil-merodach had lain till his father's death, on account of some
malversation while acting as regent during Nebuchadnezzar's seven years'
illness ([Dan 4:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#032)). But doubtless
the improvement in Zedekiah's condition is to be traced to the
overruling providence and grace of Him who still cherished purposes of
love to the house of David ([Sa2
7:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#014)).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg2 25:29</span></span>

Jehoiachin . . . did eat . . . continually before him--According to an
ancient usage in Eastern courts, had a seat at the royal table on great
days, and had a stated provision granted him for the maintenance of his
exiled court.
