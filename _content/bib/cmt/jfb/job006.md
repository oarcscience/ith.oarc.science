Testaments*, by Robert Jamieson, A.R. Fausset and David Brown \[1882\]

### [Job Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#001)

[Job 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 6:2</span></span>

REPLY OF JOB TO ELIPHAZ. (Job 6:1-30)

throughly weighed--Oh, that instead of censuring my complaints when thou
oughtest rather to have sympathized with me, thou wouldst accurately
compare my sorrow, and my misfortunes; these latter "outweigh in the
balance" the former.

[Job 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 6:3</span></span>

the sand-- ([Pro 27:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#003)).

are swallowed up--See Margin \[that is, "I want words to express my
grief"\]. But Job plainly is apologizing, not for not having had words
enough, but for having spoken too much and too boldly; and the Hebrew
is, "to speak rashly" \[UMBREIT, GESENIUS, ROSENMULLER\]. "Therefore
were my words so rash."

[Job 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 6:4</span></span>

arrows . . . within me--have pierced me. A poetic image representing the
avenging Almighty armed with bow and arrows ([Psa
38:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#002)). Here the arrows are poisoned.
Peculiarly appropriate, in reference to the burning pains which
penetrated, like poison, into the inmost parts--("spirit"; as contrasted
with mere surface flesh wounds) of Job's body.

set themselves in array--a military image ([Jdg
20:33](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#033)). All the terrors which the
divine wrath can muster are set in array against me ([Isa
42:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#013)).

[Job 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 6:5</span></span>

Neither wild animals, as the wild ass, nor tame, as the ox, are
dissatisfied when well-supplied with food. The braying of the one and
the lowing of the other prove distress and want of palatable food. So,
Job argues, if he complains, it is not without cause; namely, his pains,
which are, as it were, disgusting food, which God feeds him with (end of
[Job 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#007)). But he should have
remembered a rational being should evince a better spirit than the
brute.

[Job 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 6:6</span></span>

unsavoury--tasteless, insipid. Salt is a chief necessary of life to an
Easterner, whose food is mostly vegetable.

the white--literally, "spittle" ([Sa1
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#013)), which the white of an egg
resembles.

[Job 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 6:7</span></span>

To "touch" is contrasted with "meat." "My taste refused even to touch
it, and yet am I fed with such meat of sickness." The second clause
literally, is, "Such is like the sickness of my food." The natural taste
abhors even to touch insipid food, and such forms my nourishment. For my
sickness is like such nauseous food \[UMBREIT\]. ([Psa
42:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#003); [Psa
80:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#005); [Psa
102:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#009)). No wonder, then, I complain.

[Job 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 6:8</span></span>

To desire death is no necessary proof of fitness for death. The ungodly
sometimes desire it, so as to escape troubles, without thought of the
hereafter. The godly desire it, in order to be with the Lord; but they
patiently wait God's will.

[Job 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 6:9</span></span>

destroy--literally, "grind" or "crush" ([Isa
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#015)).

let loose his hand--God had put forth His hand only so far as to wound
the surface of Job's flesh ([Job 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#012);
[Job 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#006)); he wishes that hand to be
let loose, so as to wound deeply and vitally.

cut me off--metaphor from a weaver cutting off the web, when finished,
from the thrum fastening it to the loom ([Isa
38:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#012)).

[Job 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 6:10</span></span>

I would harden myself in sorrow--rather, "I would exult in the pain," if
I knew that that pain would hasten my death \[GESENIUS\]. UMBREIT
translates the Hebrew of "Let Him not spare," as "unsparing"; and joins
it with "pain."

concealed--I have not disowned, in word or deed, the commands of the
Holy One ([Psa 119:46](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#046); [Act
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#020)). He says this in answer to
Eliphaz' insinuation that he is a hypocrite. God is here called "the
Holy One," to imply man's reciprocal obligation to be holy, as He is
holy ([Lev 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#002)).

[Job 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 6:11</span></span>

What strength have I, so as to warrant the hope of restoration to
health? a hope which Eliphaz had suggested. "And what" but a miserable
"end" of life is before me, "that I should" desire to "prolong life"?
\[UMBREIT\]. UMBREIT and ROSENMULLER not so well translate the last
words "to be patient."

[Job 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 6:12</span></span>

Disease had so attacked him that his strength would need to be hard as a
stone, and his flesh like brass, not to sink under it. But he has only
flesh, like other men. It must, therefore, give way; so that the hope of
restoration suggested by Eliphaz is vain (see on [Job
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#011)).

[Job 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 6:13</span></span>

Is not my help in me?--The interrogation is better omitted. "There is no
help in me!" For "wisdom," "deliverance" is a better rendering. "And
deliverance is driven quite from me."

[Job 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 6:14</span></span>

pity--a proverb. Charity is the love which judges indulgently of our
fellow men: it is put on a par with truth in [Pro
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#003), for they together form the
essence of moral perfection \[UMBREIT\]. It is the spirit of
Christianity ([Pe1 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#008); [Co1
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#007); [Pro
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#012); [Pro
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#017)). If it ought to be used towards
all men, much more towards friends. But he who does not use it forsaketh
(renounceth) the fear of the Almighty ([Jam
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#013)).

[Job 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 6:15</span></span>

Those whom I regarded as "my brethren," from whom I looked for
faithfulness in my adversity, have disappointed me, as the streams
failing from drought--wadies of Arabia, filled in the winter, but dry in
the summer, which disappoint the caravans expecting to find water there.
The fulness and noise of these temporary streams answer to the past
large and loud professions of my friends; their dryness in summer, to
the failure of the friendship when needed. The Arab proverb says of a
treacherous friend, "I trust not in thy torrent" ([Isa
58:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#011), Margin).

stream of brooks--rather, "the brook in the ravines which passes away."
It has no perpetual spring of water to renew it (unlike "the fountain of
living waters," [Jer 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#013); [Isa
33:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#016), at the end); and thus it passes
away as rapidly as it arose.

[Job 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 6:16</span></span>

blackish--literally, "Go as a mourner in black clothing" ([Psa
34:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#014)). A vivid and poetic image to
picture the stream turbid and black with melted ice and snow, descending
from the mountains into the valley. In the \[second\] clause, the snow
dissolved is, in the poet's view, "hid" in the flood \[UMBREIT\].

[Job 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 6:17</span></span>

wax warm--rather, "At the time when." ("But they soon wax") \[UMBREIT\].
"they become narrower (flow in a narrower bed), they are silent (cease
to flow noisily); in the heat (of the sun) they are consumed or vanish
out of their place. First the stream flows more narrowly--then it
becomes silent and still; at length every trace of water disappears by
evaporation under the hot sun" \[UMBREIT\].

[Job 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 6:18</span></span>

turned aside--rather, "caravans" (Hebrew, "travellers") turn aside from
their way, by circuitous routes, to obtain water. They had seen the
brook in spring full of water: and now in the summer heat, on their
weary journey, they turn off their road by a devious route to reach the
living waters, which they remembered with such pleasure. But, when "they
go," it is "into a desert" \[NOYES and UMBREIT\]. Not as English
Version, "They go to nothing," which would be a tame repetition of the
drying up of the waters in [Job 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#017);
instead of waters, they find an "empty wilderness"; and, not having
strength to regain their road, bitterly disappointed, they "perish." The
terse brevity is most expressive.

[Job 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 6:19</span></span>

the troops--that is, "caravans."

Tema--north of Arabia-Deserta, near the Syrian desert; called from Tema
son of Ishmael ([Gen 25:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#015); [Isa
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#014); [Jer
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#023)), still so called by the Arabs.
[Job 6:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#019) give another picture of
the mortification of disappointed hopes, namely, those of the caravans
on the direct road, anxiously awaiting the return of their companions
from the distant valley. The mention of the locality whence the caravans
came gives living reality to the picture.

Sheba--refers here not to the marauders in North Arabia-Deserta ([Job
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#015)), but to the merchants ([Eze
27:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#022)) in the south, in Arabia-Felix
or Yemen, "afar off" ([Jer 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#020); [Mat
12:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#042); [Gen
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#028)). Caravans are first mentioned
in [Gen 37:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#025); men needed to travel
thus in companies across the desert, for defense against the roving
robbers and for mutual accommodation.

The companies . . . waited for them--cannot refer to the caravans who
had gone in quest of the waters; for [Job
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#018) describes their utter
destruction.

[Job 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 6:20</span></span>

literally, "each had hoped"; namely, that their companions would find
water. The greater had been their hopes the more bitter now their
disappointment;

they came thither--to the place.

and were ashamed--literally, "their countenances burn," an Oriental
phrase for the shame and consternation of deceived expectation; so
"ashamed" as to disappointment ([Rom
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#005)).

[Job 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 6:21</span></span>

As the dried-up brook is to the caravan, so are ye to me, namely, a
nothing; ye might as well not be in existence \[UMBREIT\]. The Margin
"like to them," or "to it" (namely, the waters of the brook), is not so
good a reading.

ye see, and are afraid--Ye are struck aghast at the sight of my misery,
and ye lose presence of mind. Job puts this mild construction on their
failing to relieve him with affectionate consolation.

[Job 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 6:22</span></span>

And yet I did not ask you to "bring me" a gift; or to "pay for me out of
your substance a reward" (to the Judge, to redeem me from my
punishment); all I asked from you was affectionate treatment.

[Job 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">job 6:23</span></span>

the mighty--the oppressor, or creditor, in whose power the debtor was
\[UMBREIT\].

[Job 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">job 6:24</span></span>

Irony. If you can "teach me" the right view, I am willing to be set
right, and "hold my tongue"; and to be made to see my error. But then if
your words be really the right words, how is it that they are so feeble?
"Yet how feeble are the words of what you call the right view." So the
Hebrew is used (in [Mic 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#010); [Mic
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#009)). The English Version, "How
powerful," &c., does not agree so well with the last clause of the
verse.

[Job 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">job 6:25</span></span>

And what will your arguings reprove?--literally, "the reproofs which
proceed from you"; the emphasis is on you; you may find fault, who are
not in my situation \[UMBREIT\].

[Job 6:26](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">job 6:26</span></span>

Do you imagine--or, "mean."

to reprove words and (to reprove) the speeches of one desperate, (which
are) as wind?--mere nothings, not to be so narrowly taken to task?
UMBREIT not so well takes the Hebrew for "as wind," as "sentiments";
making formal "sentiments" antithetical to mere "speeches," and
supplying, not the word "reprove," but "would you regard," from the
first clause.

[Job 6:27](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">job 6:27</span></span>

literally, "ye cause" (supply, "your anger") \[UMBREIT\], a net, namely,
of sophistry \[NOYES and SCHUTTENS\], to fall upon the desolate (one
bereft of help, like the fatherless orphan);

and ye dig (a pit) for your friend--that is, try to ensnare him, to
catch him in the use of unguarded language \[NOYES\]. ([Psa
57:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#006)); metaphor from hunters catching
wild beasts in a pit covered with brushwood to conceal it. UMBREIT from
the Syriac, and answering to his interpretation of the first clause,
has, "Would you be indignant against your friend?" The Hebrew in [Job
41:6](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#006), means to "feast upon." As the
first clause asks, "Would you catch him in a net?" so this follows up
the image, "And would you next feast upon him, and his miseries?" So the
Septuagint.

[Job 6:28](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">job 6:28</span></span>

be content--rather, "be pleased to"--look. Since you have so falsely
judged my words, look upon me, that is, upon my countenance: for (it is
evident before your faces) if I lie; my countenance will betray me, if I
be the hypocrite that you suppose.

[Job 6:29](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">job 6:29</span></span>

Return--rather, "retract" your charges:

let it not be iniquity--that is, (retract) that injustice may not be
done me. Yea retract, "my righteousness is in it"; that is, my right is
involved in this matter.

[Job 6:30](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">job 6:30</span></span>

Will you say that my guilt lies in the organ of speech, and will you
call it to account? or, Is it that my taste (palate) or discernment is
not capable to form a judgment of perverse things? Is it thus you will
explain the fact of my having no consciousness of guilt? \[UMBREIT\].
