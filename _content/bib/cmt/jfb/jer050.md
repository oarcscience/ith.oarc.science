### [Jeremiah Chapter 50](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 50:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 50:1</span></span>

BABYLON'S COMING DOWNFALL; ISRAEL'S REDEMPTION. (Jer. 50:1-46)

Compare Isa. 45:1-47:15. But as the time of fulfilment drew nearer, the
prophecies are now proportionally more distinct than then.

[Jeremiah 50:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 50:2</span></span>

Declare . . . among . . . nations--who would rejoice at the fall of
Babylon their oppressor.

standard--to indicate the place of meeting to the nations where they
were to hear the good news of Babylon's fall \[ROSENMULLER\]; or, the
signal to summon the nations together against Babylon ([Jer
51:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#012), [Jer
51:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#027)), \[MAURER\].

Bel--the tutelary god of Babylon; the same idol as the PhÅ“nician Baal,
that is, lord, the sun ([Isa 46:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#001)).

confounded--because unable to defend the city under their protection.

Merodach--another Babylonian idol; meaning in Syria "little lord"; from
which Merodach-baladan took his name.

[Jeremiah 50:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 50:3</span></span>

a nation--the Medes, north of Babylon ([Jer
51:48](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#048)). The devastation of Babylon
here foretold includes not only that by Cyrus, but also that more utter
one by Darius, who took Babylon by artifice when it had revolted from
Persia, and mercilessly slaughtered the inhabitants, hanging four
thousand of the nobles; also the final desertion of Babylon, owing to
Seleucia having been built close by under Seleucus Nicanor.

[Jeremiah 50:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 50:4</span></span>

Fulfilled only in part when some few of the ten tribes of "Israel"
joined Judah in a "covenant" with God, at the restoration of Judah to
its land ([Neh 9:38](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#038); [Neh
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#029)). The full event is yet to come
([Jer 31:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#009); [Hos
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#011); [Zac
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010)).

weeping--with joy at their restoration beyond all hope; and with sorrow
at the remembrance of their sins and sufferings ([Ezr
3:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#012); [Psa
126:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#005)).

seek . . . Lord-- ([Hos 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#005)).

[Jeremiah 50:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 50:5</span></span>

thitherward--rather, "hitherward," Jeremiah's prophetical standpoint
being at Zion. "Faces hitherward" implies their steadfastness of purpose
not to be turned aside by any difficulties on the way.

perpetual covenant--in contrast to the old covenant "which they brake"
([Jer 31:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#031), &c.; [Jer
32:40](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#040)). They shall return to their God
first, then to their own land.

[Jeremiah 50:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 50:6</span></span>

([Isa 53:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#006)).

on the mountains--whereon they sacrificed to idols ([Jer
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#020); [Jer
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#006), [Jer
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#023)).

resting-place--for the "sheep," continuing the image; Jehovah is the
resting-place of His sheep ([Mat
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#028)). They rest in His "bosom" ([Isa
40:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#011)). Also His temple at Zion, their
"rest," because it is His ([Psa 132:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#008),
[Psa 132:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#014)).

[Jeremiah 50:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 50:7</span></span>

devoured-- ([Psa 79:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#007)). "Found them"
implies that they were exposed to the attacks of those whoever happened
to meet them.

adversaries said--for instance, Nebuzara-dan ([Jer
40:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#002); compare [Zac
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#005)). The Gentiles acknowledged some
supreme divinity. The Jews' guilt was so palpable that they were
condemned even in the judgment of heathens. Some knowledge of God's
peculiar relation to Judea reached its heathen invaders from the
prophets ([Jer 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#003); [Dan
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#016)); hence the strong language they
use of Jehovah here, not as worshippers of Him themselves, but as
believing Him to be the tutelary God of Judah ("the hope of their
fathers," [Psa 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#004); they do not say
our hope), as each country was thought to have its local god, whose
power extended no farther.

habitation-- ([Psa 90:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#001); [Psa
91:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#001)). Alluding to the tabernacle, or,
as in [Eze 34:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#014), "fold," which
carries out the image in [Jer 50:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#006),
"resting-place" of the "sheep." But it can only mean "habitation" ([Jer
31:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#023)), which confirms English Version
here.

hope of their fathers--This especially condemned the Jews that their
apostasy was from that God whose faithfulness their fathers had
experienced. At the same time these "adversaries" unconsciously use
language which corrects their own notions. The covenant with the Jews'
"fathers" is not utterly set aside by their sin, as their adversaries
thought; there is still "a habitation" or refuge for them with the God
of their fathers.

[Jeremiah 50:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 50:8</span></span>

([Jer 51:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#006), [Jer
51:45](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#045); [Isa
48:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#020); [Zac
2:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#006); [Rev
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#004)). Immediately avail yourselves of
the opportunity of escape.

be as . . . he-goats before . . . flocks--Let each try to be foremost in
returning, animating the weak, as he-goats lead the flock; such were the
companions of Ezra ([Ezr 1:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#005)).

[Jeremiah 50:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 50:9</span></span>

from thence--that is, from the north country.

expert--literally, "prosperous." Besides "might," "expertness" is
needed, that an arrow may do execution. The Margin has a different
Hebrew reading; "destroying," literally, "bereaving, childless-making"
([Jer 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#007)). The Septuagint and Syriac
support English Version.

In vain--without killing him at whom it was aimed ([Sa2
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#022)).

[Jeremiah 50:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 50:11</span></span>

([Isa 47:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#006)).

grown fat--and so, skip wantonly.

at grass--fat and frisky. But there is a disagreement of gender in
Hebrew reading thus. The Keri is better: "a heifer threshing"; the
strongest were used for threshing, and as the law did not allow their
mouth to be muzzled in threshing ([Deu
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#004)), they waxed wanton with eating.

bellow as bulls--rather, "neigh as steeds," literally, "strong ones," a
poetical expression for steeds (see on [Jer
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#016)) \[MAURER\].

[Jeremiah 50:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 50:12</span></span>

Your mother--Babylon, the metropolis of the empire.

hindermost--marvellous change, that Babylon, once the queen of the
world, should be now the hindermost of nations, and at last, becoming "a
desert," cease to be a nation!

[Jeremiah 50:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 50:13</span></span>

([Isa 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#020)).

[Jeremiah 50:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 50:14</span></span>

Summons to the Median army to attack Babylon.

against the Lord--By oppressing His people, their cause is His cause.
Also by profaning His sacred vessels ([Dan
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#002)).

[Jeremiah 50:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 50:15</span></span>

Shout--Inspirit one another to the onset with the battle cry.

given . . . hand--an idiom for, "submitted to" the conquerors ([Ch1
29:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#024), Margin; [Lam
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#006)).

as she hath done, do unto her--just retribution in kind. She had
destroyed many, so must she be destroyed ([Psa
137:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#008)). So as to spiritual Babylon
([Rev 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#006)). This is right because "it
is the vengeance of the Lord"; but this will not justify private revenge
in kind ([Mat 5:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#044); [Rom
12:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#019)); even the Old Testament law
forbade this, though breathing a sterner spirit than the New Testament
([Exo 23:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#004); [Pro
25:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#021)).

[Jeremiah 50:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 50:16</span></span>

Babylon had the extent rather of a nation than of a city. Therefore
grain was grown within the city wall sufficient to last for a long siege
\[ARISTOTLE, Politics, 3.2; PLINY, 18.17\]. Conquerors usually spare
agriculturists, but in this case all alike were to be "cut off."

for fear of . . . oppressing sword--because of the sword of the
oppressor.

every one to his people--from which they had been removed to Babylon
from all quarters by the Chaldean conquerors ([Jer
51:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#009); [Isa
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#014)).

[Jeremiah 50:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 50:17</span></span>

lions--hostile kings ([Jer 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#007); [Jer
49:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#019)).

Assyria-- ([Kg2 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#006), Shalmaneser;
[Ezr 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#002), Esar-haddon).

Nebuchadnezzar-- ([Kg2 24:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#010), [Kg2
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#014)).

[Jeremiah 50:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 50:18</span></span>

punish . . . king of Babylon--Nabonidus, or Labynitus.

as . . . punished . . . Assyrian--Sennacherib and other kings
\[GROTIUS\] ([Kg2 19:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#037)).

[Jeremiah 50:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 50:19</span></span>

([Isa 65:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#010); [Eze
34:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#013)).

[Jeremiah 50:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 50:20</span></span>

The specification of "Israel," as well as Judah, shows the reference is
to times yet to come.

iniquity . . . none--not merely idolatry, which ceased among the Jews
ever since the Babylonian captivity, but chiefly their rejection of
Messiah. As in a cancelled debt, it shall be as if it had never been;
God, for Christ's sake, shall treat them as innocent ([Jer
31:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#034)). Without cleansing away of sin,
remission of punishment would be neither to the honor of God nor to the
highest interests of the elect.

whom I reserve--the elect "remnant" ([Isa
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#009)). The "residue" ([Zac
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#002); [Zac
13:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#008)).

[Jeremiah 50:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 50:21</span></span>

Merathaim--a symbolical name for Babylon, the doubly rebellious, namely,
against God. Compare [Jer 50:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#024), "thou
hast striven against the Lord"; and [Jer
50:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#029), "proud against the Lord." The
"doubly" refers to: first, the Assyrian's oppression of Israel; next,
the kindred Chaldean's oppression of Judah (compare [Jer
50:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#017), [Jer
50:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#033); especially [Jer
50:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#018)).

Pekod-- ([Eze 23:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#023)); a chief province
of Assyria, in which Nineveh, now overthrown, once lay. But, as in
Merathaim, the allusion is to the meaning of Pekod, namely,
"visitation"; the inhabitants whose time of deserved visitation in
punishment is come; not, however, without reference to the now
Babylonian province, Pekod. The visitation on Babylon was a following up
of that on Assyria.

after them--even their posterity, and all that is still left of Babylon,
until the very name is extinct \[GROTIUS\]. Devastate the city, after
its inhabitants have deserted it.

all . . . I . . . commanded--by Isaiah ([Isa
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#001), &c.).

[Jeremiah 50:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 50:23</span></span>

hammer--that is, Babylon, so called because of its ponderous destructive
power; just as "Martel," that is, "a little hammer," was the surname of
a king of the Franks ([Isa 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#006)).

[Jeremiah 50:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jer 50:24</span></span>

I--Thou hast to do with God, not merely with men.

taken . . . not aware--HERODOTUS relates that one half of the city was
taken before those in the other half were "aware" of it. Cyrus turned
the waters of the Euphrates where it was defended into a different
channel, and so entered the city by the dried-up channel at night, by
the upper and lower gates ([Dan
5:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#030)).

[Jeremiah 50:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jer 50:25</span></span>

weapons of his indignation--the Medes and Persians ([Isa
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#005)).

[Jeremiah 50:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jer 50:26</span></span>

from the utmost border--namely, of the earth. Or, from all sides
LUDOVICUS DE DIEU\].

storehouses--or, "her houses filled with men and goods" \[MICHAELIS\].
When Cyrus took it, the provisions found there were enough to have
lasted for many years.

as heaps--make of the once glorious city heaps of ruins. Vast mounds of
rubbish now mark the site of ancient Babylon. "Tread her as heaps of
corn which are wont to be trodden down in the threshing-floor"
\[GROTIUS\].

[Jeremiah 50:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jer 50:27</span></span>

bullocks--that is, princes and strong warriors ([Jer
46:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#021); [Psa
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#012); [Isa
34:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#007)).

go down to . . . slaughter--The slaughterhouses lay low beside the
river; therefore it is said, "go down"; appropriate to Babylon on the
Euphrates, the avenue through which the slaughterers entered the city.

[Jeremiah 50:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jer 50:28</span></span>

declare in Zion . . . temple--Some Jews "fleeing" from Babylon at its
fall shall tell in Judea how God avenged the cause of Zion and her
temple that had been profaned ([Jer
52:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#013); [Dan
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#002); [Dan
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#002)).

[Jeremiah 50:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jer 50:29</span></span>

archers--literally, "very many and powerful"; hence the Hebrew word is
used of archers ([Job 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#013)) from the
multitude and force of their arrows.

according to all that she hath done--(See on [Jer
50:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#015)).

proud against the Lord--not merely cruel towards men ([Isa
47:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#010)).

[Jeremiah 50:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">jer 50:30</span></span>

(See on [Jer 49:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#026)).

in the streets--The Babylonians were so discouraged by having lost some
battles that they retired within their walls and would not again meet
Cyrus in the field.

[Jeremiah 50:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">jer 50:31</span></span>

most proud--literally, "pride"; that is, man of pride; the king of
Babylon.

visit--punish ([Jer 50:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#027)).

[Jeremiah 50:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">jer 50:33</span></span>

Israel and . . . Judah were oppressed--He anticipates an objection, in
order to answer it: Ye have been, no doubt, "oppressed," therefore ye
despair of deliverance; but, remember your "Redeemer is strong," and
therefore can and will deliver you.

[Jeremiah 50:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">jer 50:34</span></span>

strong--as opposed to the power of Israel's oppressor ([Rev
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#008)).

plead . . . cause--as their advocate. Image from a court of justice;
appropriate as God delivers His people not by mere might, but by
righteousness. His plea against Satan and all their enemies is His own
everlasting love, reconciling mercy and justice in the Redeemer's work
and person ([Mic 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#009); [Zac
3:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#001); [Jo1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#001)).

give rest . . . disquiet--There is a play on the similarity of sounds in
the two Hebrew verbs to express more vividly the contrast: "that He may
give quiet to the land of Judah (heretofore disquieted by Babylon); but
disquiet to the inhabitants of Babylon" (heretofore quietly secure)
([Isa 14:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#006)).

[Jeremiah 50:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">jer 50:35</span></span>

The repetition of "A sword" in the beginning of each verse, by the
figure anaphora, heightens the effect; the reiterated judgment is
universal; the same sad stroke of the sword is upon each and all
connected with guilty Babylon.

wise men-- ([Isa 47:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#013)). Babylon
boasted that it was the peculiar seat of wisdom and wise men, especially
in astronomy and astrology.

[Jeremiah 50:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">jer 50:36</span></span>

liars--Those whom he before termed "wise men," he here calls "liars"
(impostors), namely, the astrologers (compare [Isa
44:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#025); [Rom
1:21-25](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#021); [Co1
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#020)).

[Jeremiah 50:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">jer 50:37</span></span>

as women--divested of all manliness ([Nah
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#013)).

[Jeremiah 50:38](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">jer 50:38</span></span>

drought--Altering the pointing, this verse will begin as the three
previous verses, "A sword." However, all the pointed manuscripts read,
"A drought," as English Version. Cyrus turned off the waters of the
Euphrates into a new channel and so marched through the dried-up bed
into the city ([Jer 51:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#032)). Babylonia
once was famed for its corn, which often yielded from one to two
hundredfold \[HERODOTUS\]. This was due to its network of water-courses
from the Euphrates for irrigation, traces of which \[LAYARD\] are seen
still on all sides, but dry and barren ([Isa
44:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#027)).

their idols--literally, "terrors." They are mad after idols that are
more calculated to frighten than to attract ([Jer
51:44](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#044), [Jer
51:47](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#047), [Jer
51:52](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#052); [Dan
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#001)). Mere bugbears with which to
frighten children.

[Jeremiah 50:39](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">jer 50:39</span></span>

wild beasts of the desert--wild cats, remarkable for their howl
\[BOCHART\].

wild beasts of the islands--jackals (See on [Isa
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#021)).

owls--rather, "female ostriches"; they delight in solitary places.
Literally, "daughters of crying." Compare as to spiritual Babylon, [Rev
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#002).

no more inhabited for ever--The accumulation of phrases is to express
the final and utter extinction of Babylon; fulfilled not immediately,
but by degrees; Cyrus took away its supremacy. Darius Hystaspes deprived
it, when it had rebelled, of its fortifications. Seleucus Nicanor
removed its citizens and wealth to Seleucia, which he founded in the
neighborhood; and the Parthians removed all that was left to Ctesiphon.
Nothing but its walls was left under the Roman emperor Adrian.

[Jeremiah 50:40](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">jer 50:40</span></span>

([Isa 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#019)). Repeated from [Jer
49:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#018).

[Jeremiah 50:41](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">jer 50:41</span></span>

(Compare [Jer 6:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#022)). The very
language used to describe the calamities which Babylon inflicted on Zion
is that here employed to describe Babylon's own calamity inflicted by
the Medes. Retribution in kind.

kinds--the allies and satraps of the various provinces of the
Medo-Persian empire: Armenia, Hyrcania, Lydia, &c.

coasts--the remote parts.

[Jeremiah 50:42](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">jer 50:42</span></span>

cruel--the character of the Persians, and even of Cyrus, notwithstanding
his wish to be thought magnanimous ([Isa
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#018)).

like a man--So orderly and united is their "array," that the whole army
moves to battle as one man \[GROTIUS\].

[Jeremiah 50:43](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">jer 50:43</span></span>

hands waxed feeble--attempted no resistance; immediately was overcome,
as HERODOTUS tells us.

[Jeremiah 50:44](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">jer 50:44</span></span>

Repeated mainly from [Jer 49:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#019).
The identity of God's principle in His dealing with Edom, and in that
with Babylon, is implied by the similarity of language as to both.

[Jeremiah 50:46](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#046)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">jer 50:46</span></span>

cry . . . among the nations--In Edom's case it is, "at the cry the noise
thereof was heard in the Red Sea." The change implies the wider extent
to which the crash of Babylon's downfall shall be heard.
