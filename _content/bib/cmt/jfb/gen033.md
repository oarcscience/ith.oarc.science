### [Genesis Chapter 33](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#001)

[Genesis 33:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 33:1</span></span>

KINDNESS OF JACOB AND ESAU. ([Gen
33:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#001))

behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men--Jacob having crossed
the ford and ranged his wives and children in order--the dearest last,
that they might be the least exposed to danger--awaited the expected
interview. His faith was strengthened and his fears gone ([Psa
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#003)). Having had power to prevail
with God, he was confident of the same power with man, according to the
promise (compare [Gen 32:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#028)).

[Genesis 33:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 33:3</span></span>

he bowed himself . . . seven times--The manner of doing this is by
looking towards a superior and bowing with the upper part of the body
brought parallel to the ground, then advancing a few steps and bowing
again, and repeating his obeisance till, at the seventh time, the
suppliant stands in the immediate presence of his superior. The members
of his family did the same. This was a token of profound respect, and,
though very marked, it would appear natural; for Esau being the elder
brother, was, according to the custom of the East, entitled to
respectful treatment from his younger brother. His attendants would be
struck by it, and according to Eastern habits, would magnify it in the
hearing of their master.

[Genesis 33:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 33:4</span></span>

Esau ran to meet him--What a sudden and surprising change! Whether the
sight of the princely present and the profound homage of Jacob had
produced this effect, or it proceeded from the impulsive character of
Esau, the cherished enmity of twenty years in a moment disappeared; the
weapons of war were laid aside, and the warmest tokens of mutual
affection reciprocated between the brothers. But doubtless, the
efficient cause was the secret, subduing influence of grace ([Pro
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#001)), which converted Esau from an
enemy into a friend.

[Genesis 33:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 33:5</span></span>

Who are those with thee?--It might have been enough to say, They are my
children; but Jacob was a pious man, and he could not give even a common
answer but in the language of piety ([Psa
127:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#003); [Psa
113:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#009); [Psa
107:41](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#041)).

[Genesis 33:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gen 33:11</span></span>

He urged him and he took it--In the East the acceptance by a superior is
a proof of friendship, and by an enemy, of reconciliation. It was on
both accounts Jacob was so anxious that his brother should receive the
cattle; and in Esau's acceptance he had the strongest proofs of a good
feeling being established that Eastern notions admit of.

[Genesis 33:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gen 33:12</span></span>

THE PARTING. ([Gen 33:12-20](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#012))

And he said, Let us take our journey--Esau proposed to accompany Jacob
and his family through the country, both as a mark of friendship and as
an escort to guard them. But the proposal was prudently declined. Jacob
did not need any worldly state or equipage. Notwithstanding the present
cordiality, the brothers were so different in spirit, character, and
habits--the one so much a man of the world, and the other a man of God,
that there was great risk of something occurring to disturb the harmony.
Jacob having alleged a very reasonable excuse for the tardiness of his
movements, the brothers parted in peace.

[Genesis 33:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gen 33:14</span></span>

until I come unto my lord--It seems to have been Jacob's intention,
passing round the Dead Sea, to visit his brother in Seir, and thus,
without crossing the Jordan, go to Beer-sheba to Isaac; but he changed
his plan, and whether the intention was carried out then or at a future
period has not been recorded.

[Genesis 33:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">gen 33:17</span></span>

Jacob journeyed to Succoth--that is, "booths," that being the first
station at which Jacob halted on his arrival in Canaan. His posterity,
when dwelling in houses of stone, built a city there and called it
Succoth, to commemorate the fact that their ancestor, "a Syrian ready to
perish" \[[Deu 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#005)\], was glad to
dwell in booths.

[Genesis 33:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">gen 33:18</span></span>

Shalem--that is, "peace"; and the meaning may be that Jacob came into
Canaan, arriving safe and sound at the city Shechem--a tribute to Him
who had promised such a return (compare [Gen
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#015)). But most writers take Shalem
as a proper name--a city of Shechem, and the site is marked by one of
the little villages about two miles to the northeast. A little farther
in the valley below Shechem "he bought a parcel of a field," thus being
the first of the patriarchs who became a proprietor of land in Canaan.

[Genesis 33:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">gen 33:19</span></span>

an hundred pieces of money--literally, "lambs"; probably a coin with the
figure of a lamb on it.

[Genesis 33:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">gen 33:20</span></span>

and he erected . . . an altar--A beautiful proof of his personal piety,
a most suitable conclusion to his journey, and a lasting memorial of a
distinguished favor in the name "God, the God of Israel." Wherever we
pitch a tent, God shall have an altar.
