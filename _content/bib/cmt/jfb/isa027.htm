<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">isa 27:1</A></FONT></span></p>CONTINUATION OF THE TWENTY-FOURTH, TWENTY-FIFTH, AND TWENTY-SIXTH CHAPTERS. (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#001">Isa 27:1-13</A>)
<p>
<p>sore--rather, "hard," "well-tempered." 
<p>
<p>leviathan--literally, in Arabic, "the twisted animal," applicable to every great tenant of the waters, sea-serpents, crocodiles, &amp;c. In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#003">Eze 29:3</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#002">Eze 32:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#001">Dan 7:1</A>, &amp;c. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#003">Rev 12:3</A>, &amp;c., potentates hostile to Israel are similarly described; antitypically and ultimately Satan is intended (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#010">Rev 20:10</A>). 
<p>
<p>piercing--rigid [LOWTH]. Flying [MAURER and Septuagint]. Long, extended, namely, as the crocodile which cannot readily bend back its body [HOUBIGANT]. 
<p>
<p>crooked--winding. 
<p>
<p>dragon--Hebrew, tenin; the crocodile. 
<p>
<p>sea--the Euphrates, or the expansion of it near Babylon.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#002">Isaiah 27:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">isa 27:2</A></FONT></span></p>In that day when leviathan shall be destroyed, the vineyard (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#008">Psa 80:8</A>), the Church of God, purged of its blemishes, shall be lovely in God's eyes; to bring out this sense the better, LOWTH, by changing a Hebrew letter, reads "pleasant," "lovely," for "red wine." 
<p>
<p>sing--a responsive song [LOWTH]. 
<p>
<p>unto her--rather, "concerning her" (see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#001">Isa 5:1</A>); namely, the Jewish state [MAURER].
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#003">Isaiah 27:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">isa 27:3</A></FONT></span></p>lest any hurt it--attack it [MAURER]. "Lest aught be wanting in her" [HORSLEY].
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#004">Isaiah 27:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">isa 27:4</A></FONT></span></p>Fury is not in me--that is, I entertain no longer anger towards my vine. 
<p>
<p>who would set . . . in battle--that is, would that I had the briers, &amp;c. (the wicked foe; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#018">Isa 9:18</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#017">Isa 10:17</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#006">Sa2 23:6</A>), before me! "I would go through," or rather, "against them."
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#005">Isaiah 27:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">isa 27:5</A></FONT></span></p>Or--Else; the only alternative, if Israel's enemies wish to escape being "burnt together." 
<p>
<p>strength--rather, "the refuge which I afford" [MAURER]. "Take hold," refers to the horns of the altar which fugitives often laid hold of as an asylum (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#050">Kg1 1:50</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#028">Kg1 2:28</A>). Jesus is God's "strength," or "refuge" which sinners must repair to and take hold of, if they are to have "peace" with God (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#024">Isa 45:24</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#001">Rom 5:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014">Eph 2:14</A>; compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#021">Job 22:21</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#006">Isaiah 27:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">isa 27:6</A></FONT></span></p>He--Jehovah. Here the song of the Lord as to His vineyard (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#002">Isa 27:2-5</A>) ends; and the prophet confirms the sentiment in the song, under the same image of a vine (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#013">Psa 92:13-15</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#005">Hos 14:5-6</A>). 
<p>
<p>Israel . . . fill . . . world-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#012">Rom 11:12</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#007">Isaiah 27:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">isa 27:7</A></FONT></span></p>him . . . those--Israel--Israel's enemies. Has God punished His people as severely as He has those enemies whom He employed to chastise Israel? No! Far from it. Israel, after trials, He will restore; Israel's enemies He will utterly destroy at last. 
<p>
<p>the slaughter of them that are slain by him--rather, "Is Israel slain according to the slaughter of the enemy slain?" the slaughter wherewith the enemy is slain [MAURER].
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#008">Isaiah 27:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">isa 27:8</A></FONT></span></p>In measure--not beyond measure; in moderation (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#006">Job 23:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#001">Psa 6:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#024">Jer 10:24</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#011">Jer 30:11</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#028">Jer 46:28</A>). 
<p>
<p>when it shooteth--image from the vine; rather, passing from the image to the thing itself, "when sending her away (namely, Israel to exile; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#001">Isa 50:1</A>, God only putting the adulteress away when He might justly have put her to death), Thou didst punish her" [GESENIUS]. 
<p>
<p>stayeth--rather, as Margin, "when He removeth it by His rough wind in the day," &amp;c. 
<p>
<p>east wind--especially violent in the East (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#021">Job 27:21</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#017">Jer 18:17</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#009">Isaiah 27:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">isa 27:9</A></FONT></span></p>By this--exile of Israel (the "sending away," <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#008">Isa 27:8</A>). 
<p>
<p>purged--expiated [HORSLEY]. 
<p>
<p>all the fruit--This is the whole benefit designed to be brought about by the chastisement; namely, the removal of his (Israel's) sin (namely, object of idolatry; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#021">Deu 9:21</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#008">Hos 10:8</A>). 
<p>
<p>when he--Jehovah; at the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, His instrument. The Jews ever since have abhorred idolatry (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#008">Isa 17:8</A>). 
<p>
<p>not stand up--shall rise no more [HORSLEY].
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#010">Isaiah 27:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">isa 27:10</A></FONT></span></p>city--Jerusalem; the beating asunder of whose altars and images was mentioned in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#009">Isa 27:9</A> (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#010">Isa 24:10-12</A>). 
<p>
<p>calf feed-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#002">Isa 17:2</A>); it shall be a vast wild pasture. 
<p>
<p>branches--resuming the image of the vine (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#002">Isa 27:2</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#006">Isa 27:6</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#011">Isaiah 27:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">isa 27:11</A></FONT></span></p>boughs . . . broken off--so the Jews are called (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#017">Rom 11:17</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#019">Rom 11:19-20</A>). 
<p>
<p>set . . . on fire--burn them as fuel; "women" are specified, as probably it was their office to collect fuel and kindle the fire for cooking. 
<p>
<p>no understanding--as to the ways of God (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#028">Deu 32:28-29</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#021">Jer 5:21</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#006">Hos 4:6</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#012">Isaiah 27:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">isa 27:12</A></FONT></span></p>Restoration of the Jews from their dispersion, described under the image of fruits shaken from trees and collected. 
<p>
<p>beat off--as fruit beaten off a tree with a stick (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#020">Deu 24:20</A>), and then gathered. 
<p>
<p>river--Euphrates. 
<p>
<p>stream of Egypt--on the confines of Palestine and Egypt (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#005">Num 34:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#004">Jos 15:4</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#047">Jos 15:47</A>), now Wady-el-Arish, Jehovah's vineyard, Israel, extended according to His purpose from the Nile to the Euphrates (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#021">Kg1 4:21</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#024">Kg1 4:24</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#008">Psa 72:8</A>). 
<p>
<p>one by one--gathered most carefully, not merely as a nation, but as individuals.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#013">Isaiah 27:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">isa 27:13</A></FONT></span></p>great trumpet--image from the trumpets blown on the first day of the seventh month to summon the people to a holy convocation (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#024">Lev 23:24</A>). Antitypically, the gospel trumpet (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#015">Rev 11:15</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#006">Rev 14:6</A>) which the Jews shall hearken to in the last days (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010">Zac 12:10</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#001">Zac 13:1</A>). As the passover in the first month answers to Christ's crucifixion, so the day of atonement and the idea of "salvation" connected with the feast of tabernacles in the same seventh month, answer to the crowning of "redemption" at His second coming; therefore redemption is put last in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#030">Co1 1:30</A>. 
<p>
<p>Assyria--whither the ten tribes had been carried; Babylonia is mainly meant, to which Assyria at that time belonged; the two tribes were restored, and some of the ten accompanied them. However, "Assyria" is designedly used to point ultimately to the future restoration of the ten fully, never yet accomplished (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#018">Jer 3:18</A>). 
<p>
<p>Egypt--whither many had fled at the Babylonish captivity (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#017">Jer 41:17-18</A>). Compare as to the future restoration, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#011">Isa 11:11-12</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#016">Isa 11:16</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#009">Isa 51:9-16</A> ("Rahab" being Egypt).
<p>
<p>The twenty-eighth through thirty-third chapters form almost one continuous prophecy concerning the destruction of Ephraim, the impiety and folly of Judah, the danger of their league with Egypt, the straits they would be reduced to by Assyria, from which Jehovah would deliver them on their turning to Him; the twenty-eighth chapter refers to the time just before the sixth year of Hezekiak's reign, the rest not very long before his fourteenth year.
