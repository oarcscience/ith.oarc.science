### [Psalms Chapter 127](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#001)

[Psalms 127:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 127:1</span></span>

The theme of this Psalm, that human enterprises only succeed by the
divine blessing, was probably associated with the building of the temple
by Solomon, its author. It may have been adopted in this view, as suited
to this series especially, as appropriately expressing the sentiments of
God's worshippers in relation to the erection of the second temple.
([Psa 127:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#001))

suggest the view of the theme given.

[Psalms 127:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 127:2</span></span>

so he giveth his beloved sleep--that is, His providential care gives
sleep which no efforts of ours can otherwise procure, and this is a
reason for trust as to other things (compare [Mat
6:26-32](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#026)).

[Psalms 127:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 127:3</span></span>

Posterity is often represented as a blessing from God ([Gen
30:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#002), [Gen
30:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#018); [Sa1
1:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#019)). Children are represented as
the defenders (arrows) of their parents in war, and in litigation.

[Psalms 127:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 127:5</span></span>

adversaries in the gate--or place of public business (compare [Job
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#004); [Psa
69:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#012)).
