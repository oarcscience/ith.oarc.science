<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_000">jos 0:0</A></FONT></span></p>JOSHUA. The title of this book is derived from the pious and valiant leader whose achievements it relates and who is commonly supposed to have been its author. The objections to this idea are founded chiefly on the clause, "unto this day," which occurs several times (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#009">Jos 4:9</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#025">Jos 6:25</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#028">Jos 8:28</A>). But this, at least in the case of Rahab, is no valid reason for rejecting the idea of his authorship; for assuming what is most probable, that this book was composed toward the close of Joshua's long career, or compiled from written documents left by him, Rahab might have been still alive. A more simple and satisfactory way of accounting for the frequent insertion of the clause, "unto this day," is the opinion that it was a comment introduced by Ezra, when revising the sacred canon; and this difficulty being removed, the direct proofs of the book having been produced by a witness of the transactions related in it, the strong and vivid descriptions of the passing scenes, and the use of the words "we" and "us," (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#001">Jos 5:1-6</A>), viewed in connection with the fact, that, after his farewell address to the people, Joshua "wrote these words in the book of the law of God" [<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#026">Jos 24:26</A>] --all afford strong presumptive proof that the entire book was the work of that eminent individual. Its inspiration and canonical authority are fully established by the repeated testimonies of other Scripture writers (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#026">Jos 6:26</A> with <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#034">Kg1 16:34</A>; compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#013">Jos 10:13</A> with <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#011">Hab 3:11</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#014">Jos 3:14</A> with <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#045">Act 7:45</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#017">Jos 6:17-23</A> with <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#030">Heb 11:30</A>; Jos. 2:1-24 with <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#025">Jam 2:25</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#002">Psa 44:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#012">Psa 68:12-14</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#054">Psa 78:54-55</A>). As a narrative of God's faithfulness in giving the Israelites possession of the promised land, this history is most valuable, and bears the same character as a sequel to the Pentateuch, that the Acts of the Apostles do to the Gospels.
