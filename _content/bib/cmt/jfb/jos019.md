### [Joshua Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#001)

[Joshua 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 19:1</span></span>

THE LOT OF SIMEON. ([Jos 19:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#001))

the second lot came forth to Simeon--The next lot that was drawn at
Shiloh, gave the tribe of Simeon his inheritance within the territory,
which had been assigned to that of Judah. The knowledge of Canaan
possessed by the Israelites, when the division of the land commenced,
was but very general, being derived from the rapid sweep they had made
over it during the course of conquest; and it was on the ground of that
rough survey alone that the distribution proceeded, by which Judah
received an inheritance. Time showed that this territory was too large
([Jos 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#009)), either for their numbers,
however great, to occupy and their arms to defend, or too large in
proportion to the allotments of the other tribes. Justice therefore
required (what kind and brotherly feeling readily dictated) a
modification of their possession; and a part of it was appropriated to
Simeon. By thus establishing it within the original domain of another
tribe, the prophecy of Jacob in regard to Simeon was fulfilled ([Gen
49:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#007)); for from its boundaries being
not traced, there is reason to conclude that its people were divided and
dispersed among those of Judah; and though one group of its cities named
([Jos 19:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#002)), gives the idea of a
compact district, as it is usually represented by map makers, the other
group ([Jos 19:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#007)) were situated, two
in the south, and two elsewhere, with tracts of the country around them.

[Joshua 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jos 19:10</span></span>

OF ZEBULUN. ([Jos 19:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#010))

the third lot came up for the children of Zebulun--The boundaries of the
possession assigned to them extended from the Lake of Chinnereth (Sea of
Galilee) on the east, to the Mediterranean on the west. Although they do
not seem at first to have touched on the western shore--a part of
Manasseh running north into Asher ([Jos
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#010)) --they afterwards did,
according to the prediction of Moses ([Deu
33:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#019)). The extent from north to south
cannot be very exactly traced; the sites of many of the places through
which the boundary line is drawn being unknown. Some of the cities were
of note.

[Joshua 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jos 19:17</span></span>

OF ISSACHAR. ([Jos 19:17-23](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#017))

the fourth lot came out to Issachar--Instead of describing the
boundaries of this tribe, the inspired historian gives a list of its
principal cities. These cities are all in the eastern part of the plain
of Esdraelon.

[Joshua 19:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jos 19:24</span></span>

OF ASHER. ([Jos 19:24-31](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#024))

the fifth lot came out for the tribe of the children of Asher--The
western boundary is traced from north to south through the cities
mentioned; the site of them, however, is unknown.

[Joshua 19:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jos 19:26</span></span>

to Carmel . . . and to Shihor-libnath--that is, the "black" or "muddy
river"; probably the Nahr Belka, below Dor (Tantoura); for that town
belonged to Asher ([Jos 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#010)). Thence
the boundary line turned eastward to Beth-dagon, a town at the junction
of Zebulun and Naphtali, and ran northwards as far as Cabul, with other
towns, among which is mentioned ([Jos
19:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#028)) "great Zidon," so called on
account of its being even then the flourishing metropolis of the
PhÅ“nicians. Though included in the inheritance of Asher, this town was
never possessed by them ([Jdg 1:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#031)).

[Joshua 19:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jos 19:29</span></span>

and then the coast turneth to Ramah--now El-Hamra, which stood where the
Leontes (Litany) ends its southern course and flows westward.

and to the strong city Tyre--The original city appears to have stood on
the mainland, and was well-fortified. From Tyre the boundary ran to
Hosah, an inland town; and then, passing the unconquered district of
Achzib ([Jdg 1:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#031)), terminated at the
seacoast.

[Joshua 19:32](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">jos 19:32</span></span>

OF NAPHTALI. ([Jos 19:32-39](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#032))

the sixth lot came out to the children of Naphtali--Although the cities
mentioned have not been discovered, it is evident, from Zaanannim, which
is by Kedesh, that is, on the northwest of Lake Merom ([Jdg
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#011)), that the boundary described
([Jos 19:34](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#034)) ran from the southwest
towards the northeast, up to the sources of the Jordan.

[Joshua 19:34](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">jos 19:34</span></span>

Aznoth-tabor--on the east of Tabor towards the Jordan, for the border
ran thence to Hukkok, touching upon that of Zebulun; and as the
territory of Zebulun did not extend as far as the Jordan, Aznoth-tabor
and Hukkok must have been border towns on the line which separated
Naphtali from Issachar.

to Judah upon Jordan toward the sunrising--The sixty cities,
Havoth-jair, which were on the eastern side of the Jordan, opposite
Naphtali, were reckoned as belonging to Judah, because Jair, their
possessor, was a descendant of Judah (1Ch. 2:4-22) \[KEIL\].

[Joshua 19:40](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">jos 19:40</span></span>

OF DAN. ([Jos 19:40-48](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#040))

the seventh lot came out for the tribe . . . Dan--It lay on the west of
Benjamin and consisted of portions surrendered by Judah and Ephraim. Its
boundaries are not stated, as they were easily distinguishable from the
relative position of Dan to the three adjoining tribes.

[Joshua 19:47](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#047)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">jos 19:47</span></span>

the children of Dan went up to fight against Leshem--The Danites,
finding their inheritance too small, decided to enlarge its boundaries
by the sword; and, having conquered Leshem (Laish), they planted a
colony there, calling the new settlement by the name of Dan (see on [Jdg
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#007)).

[Joshua 19:50](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#050)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">jos 19:50</span></span>

THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL GIVE AN INHERITANCE TO JOSHUA. ([Jos
19:49-51](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#049))

According to the word of the Lord they gave him the city which he
asked--It was most proper that the great leader should receive an
inheritance suited to his dignity, and as a reward for his public
services. But the gift was not left to the spontaneous feelings of a
grateful people. It was conferred "according to the word of the
Lord"--probably an unrecorded promise, similar to what had been made to
Caleb ([Jos 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#009)).

Timnath-serah--or Heres, on Mount Gaash ([Jdg
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#009)). Joshua founded it, and was
afterwards buried there ([Jos 24:30](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#030)).

[Joshua 19:51](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#051)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">jos 19:51</span></span>

These are the inheritances--This verse is the formal close of the
section which narrates the history of the land distribution; and to
stamp it with due importance, the names of the commissioners are
repeated, as well as the spot where so memorable a transaction took
place.
