### [Nehemiah Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#001)

[Nehemiah 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">neh 1:1</span></span>

NEHEMIAH, UNDERSTANDING BY HANANI THE AFFLICTED STATE OF JERUSALEM,
MOURNS, FASTS, AND PRAYS. ([Neh 1:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#001))

Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah--This eminently pious and patriotic Jew is
to be carefully distinguished from two other persons of the same
name--one of whom is mentioned as helping to rebuild the walls of
Jerusalem ([Neh 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#016)), and the other
is noticed in the list of those who accompanied Zerubbabel in the first
detachment of returning exiles ([Ezr
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#002); [Neh
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#007)). Though little is known of his
genealogy, it is highly probable that he was a descendant of the tribe
of Judah and the royal family of David.

in the month Chisleu--answering to the close of November and the larger
part of December.

Shushan the palace--the capital of ancient Susiana, east of the Tigris,
a province of Persia. From the time of Cyrus it was the favorite winter
residence of the Persian kings.

[Nehemiah 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">neh 1:2</span></span>

Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and certain men of Judah--Hanani is
called his brother ([Neh 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#002)). But as
that term was used loosely by Jews as well as other Orientals, it is
probable that no more is meant than that he was of the same family.
According to JOSEPHUS, Nehemiah, while walking around the palace walls,
overheard some persons conversing in the Hebrew language. Having
ascertained that they had lately returned from Judea, he was informed by
them, in answer to his eager enquiries, of the unfinished and desolate
condition of Jerusalem, as well as the defenseless state of the returned
exiles. The commissions previously given to Zerubbabel and Ezra
extending only to the repair of the temple and private dwellings, the
walls and gates of the city had been allowed to remain a mass of
shattered ruins, as they had been laid by the Chaldean siege.

[Nehemiah 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">neh 1:4</span></span>

HIS PRAYER. ([Neh 1:4-11](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#004))

when I heard these words, that I sat down . . . and mourned . . . and
fasted, and prayed--The recital deeply affected the patriotic feelings
of this good man, and no comfort could he find but in earnest and
protracted prayer, that God would favor the purpose, which he seems to
have secretly formed, of asking the royal permission to go to Jerusalem.

[Nehemiah 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">neh 1:11</span></span>

I was the king's cupbearer--This officer, in the ancient Oriental
courts, was always a person of rank and importance; and, from the
confidential nature of his duties and his frequent access to the royal
presence, he possessed great influence.
