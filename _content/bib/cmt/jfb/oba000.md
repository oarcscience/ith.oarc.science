### [Obadiah Introduction](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#001)

[Obadiah](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">oba 0:0</span></span>

This is the shortest book in the Old Testament. The name means "servant
of Jehovah." Obadiah stands fourth among the minor prophets according to
the Hebrew arrangement of the canon, the fifth according to the Greek.
Some consider him to be the same as the Obadiah who superintended the
restoration of the temple under Josiah, 627 B.C. ([Ch2
34:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#012)). But [Oba
1:11-16](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#011), [Oba
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#020) imply that Jerusalem was by this
time overthrown by the Chaldeans, and that he refers to the cruelty of
Edom towards the Jews on that occasion, which is referred to also in
[Lam 4:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#021); [Eze
25:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#012); [Eze
35:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#001); [Psa
137:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#007). From comparing [Oba
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#005) with [Jer
49:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#009), [Oba
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#006) with [Jer
49:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#010), [Oba
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#008) with [Jer
49:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#007), it appears that Jeremiah
embodied in his prophecies part of Obadiah's, as he had done in the case
of other prophets also (compare Isa. 15:1-16:14 with Jer. 48:1-47). The
reason for the present position of Obadiah before other of the minor
prophets anterior in date is: Amos at the close of his prophecies
foretells the subjugation of Edom hereafter by the Jews; the arranger of
the minor prophets in one volume, therefore, placed Obadiah next, as
being a fuller statement, and, as it were, a commentary on the foregoing
briefer prophecy of Amos as to Edom \[MAURER\]. (Compare [Amo
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#011)). The date of Obadiah's
prophecies was probably immediately after the taking of Jerusalem by
Nebuchadnezzar, 588 B.C. Five years afterwards (583 B.C.). Edom was
conquered by Nebuchadnezzar. Jeremiah must have incorporated part of
Obadiah's prophecies with his own immediately after they were uttered,
thus stamping his canonicity.

JEROME makes him contemporary with Hosea, Joel, and Amos. It is an
argument in favor of this view that Jeremiah would be more likely to
insert in his prophecies a portion from a preceding prophet than from a
contemporary. If so, the allusion in [Oba
1:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#011) will be to one of the former
captures of Jerusalem: by the Egyptians under Rehoboam ([Kg1
14:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#025); [Ch2
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#002), &c.), or that by the Philistines
and Arabians in the reign of Joram ([Ch2
21:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#016)); or that by Joash, king of
Israel, in the reign of Amaziah ([Ch2
25:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#022)); or that in the reign of
Jehoiakim ([Kg2 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#001), &c.); or that in
the reign of Jehoiachin ([Kg2
24:8-16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#008)). On all occasions the
Idumeans were hostile to the Jews; and the terms in which that enmity is
characterized are not stronger in Obadiah than in [Joe
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#019) (compare [Oba
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#010); [Amo
1:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#011)). The probable capture of
Jerusalem alluded to by Obadiah is that by Joash and the Israelites in
the reign of Amaziah. For as, a little before, in the reign of the same
Amaziah, the Jews had treated harshly the Edomites after conquering them
in battle ([Ch2 25:11-23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#011)), it is
probable that the Edomites, in revenge, joined the Israelites in the
attack on Jerusalem \[JAEGER\].

This book may be divided into two parts: (1) [Oba
1:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#001) set forth Edom's violence toward
his brother Israel in the day of the latter's distress, and his coming
destruction with the rest of the foes of Judah; (2) [Oba
1:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#017), the coming re-establishment
of the Jews in their own possessions, to which shall be added those of
the neighboring peoples, and especially those of Edom.
