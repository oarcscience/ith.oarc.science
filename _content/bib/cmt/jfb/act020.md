### [Acts Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#001)

[Acts 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 20:1</span></span>

PAUL FULFILS HIS PURPOSE OF PROCEEDING AGAIN TO MACEDONIA AND
GREECE--RETURNING THENCE, ON HIS ROUTE FOR JERUSALEM, HE REVISITS
PHILIPPI AND TROAS--HIS MINISTRATIONS AT TROAS. ([Act
20:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#001))

departed--after Pentecost ([Co1 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#008)).

to go into Macedonia--in pursuance of the first part of his plan ([Act
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#021)). From his Epistles we learn;
(1) That, as might have been expected from its position on the coast, he
revisited Troas ([Co2 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#012); see on
[Act 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#008)). (2) That while on his
former visit he appears to have done no missionary work there, he now
went expressly "to preach Christ's Gospel," and found "a door opened
unto him of the Lord" there, which he entered so effectually as to lay
the foundation of a church there ([Act
20:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#006)). (3) That he would have
remained longer there but for his uneasiness at the non-arrival of
Titus, whom he had despatched to Corinth to finish the collection for
the poor saints at Jerusalem ([Co1
16:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#001); [Co2
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#006)), but still more, that he might
bring him word what effect his first Epistle to that church had
produced. (He had probably arranged that they should meet at Troas). (4)
That in this state of mind, afraid of something wrong, he "took leave"
of the brethren at Troas, and went from thence into Macedonia.

It was, no doubt, the city of PHILIPPI that he came to (landing at
Nicopolis, its seaport, see on [Act
16:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#011)), as appears by comparing
[Co2 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#009), where "Macedonia" is named,
with [Phi 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#015), where it appears that
Philippi is meant. Here he found the brethren, whom he had left on his
former visit in circumstances of such deep interest, a consolidated and
thriving church, generous and warmly attached to their father in Christ;
under the superintendence, probably, of our historian, "the beloved
physician" (see on [Act 16:40](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#040)). All
that is said by our historian of this Macedonian visit is that "he went
over those parts and gave them much exhortation." (5) Titus not having
reached Philippi as soon as the apostle, "his flesh had no rest, but he
was troubled on every side: without were fightings, within were fears"
([Co2 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#005)). (6) At length Titus
arrived, to the joy of the apostle, the bearer of better tidings from
Corinth than he had dared to expect ([Co2
7:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#006), [Co2
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#013)), but checkered by painful
intelligence of the efforts of a hostile party to undermine his
apostolic reputation there (2Co. 10:1-18). (7) Under the mixed feelings
which this produced, he wrote--from Macedonia, and probably
Philippi--his SECOND EPISTLE TO THE CORINTHIANS (see Introduction to
Second Corinthians); despatching Titus with it, and along with him two
other unnamed deputies, expressly chosen to take up and bring their
collection for the poor saints at Jerusalem, and to whom he bears the
beautiful testimony, that they were "the glory of Christ" ([Co2
8:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#022)). (8) It must have been at
this time that he penetrated as far as to the confines of "Illyricum,"
lying along the shores of the Adriatic ([Rom
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#019)). He would naturally wish that
his second Letter to the Corinthians should have some time to produce
its proper effect ere he revisited them, and this would appear a
convenient opportunity for a northwestern circuit, which would enable
him to pay a passing visit to the churches at Thessalonica and Berea,
though of this we have no record. On his way southward to Greece, he
would preach the Gospel in the intermediate regions of Epirus, Thessaly,
and Boeotia (see [Rom 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#019)), though
of this we have no record.

[Acts 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 20:2</span></span>

he came into Greece--or Achaia, in pursuance of the second part of his
plan ([Act 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#021)).

[Acts 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 20:3</span></span>

And there abode three months--Though the province only is here
mentioned, it is the city of CORINTH that is meant, as the province of
"Macedonia" ([Act 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#001)) meant the city
of Philippi. Some rough work he anticipated on his arrival at Corinth
([Co2 10:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#001), [Co2
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#011); [Co2
13:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#001)) though he had reason to
expect satisfaction on the whole; and as we know there were other
churches in Achaia besides that at Corinth ([Co2
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#001); [Co2
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#010)), he would have time enough to
pay them all a brief visit during the three months of his stay there.
This period was rendered further memorable by the despatch of the
EPISTLE TO THE ROMANS, written during his stay at Corinth and sent by
"PhÅ“be, a servant \[deaconess\] of the Church at Cenchrea" (see on [Act
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#003)), a lady apparently of some
standing and substance, who was going thither on private business. (See
on [Rom 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#001) and see Introduction to
Romans).

And when the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into
Syria--He had intended to embark, probably at Cenchrea, the eastern
harbor of the city, for Palestine, on his route to Jerusalem, the third
part of his plan ([Act 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#021)). But
having detected some conspiracy against his life by his bitter Jewish
enemies as at Damascus ([Act 9:22-25](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#022))
and Jerusalem ([Act 9:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#029)), he
changed his plan and determined "to return" as he had come, "through
Macedonia." As he was never more to return to Corinth, so this route
would bring him, for the last time, face to face with the attached
disciples of Berea, Thessalonica, and Philippi.

[Acts 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 20:4</span></span>

there accompanied him into Asia--the province of Asia.

Sopater of Berea--The true reading, beyond doubt, is, "Sopater \[the
son\] of Pyrrhus of Berea." Some think this mention of his father was to
distinguish him from Sosipater (the same name in fuller form), mentioned
in [Rom 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#021). But that they were the
same person seems more probable.

of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus--(See on [Act
19:29](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#029)).

and Secundus--of whom nothing else is known.

Gaius of Derbe--Though the Gaius of [Act
19:29](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#029) is said to be of "Macedonia,"
and this one "of Derbe," there is no sufficient reason for supposing
them different persons; on the contrary, [Rom
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#023) (compare with [Jo3
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#001), where there is hardly any reason
to doubt that the same Gaius is addressed) seems to show that though he
spent an important part of his Christian life away from his native
Derbe, he had latterly retired to some place not very far from it.

and Timotheus--not probably of Derbe, as one might suppose from this
verse, but of Lystra (see on [Act
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#001)); both being so associated in his
early connection with the apostle that the mention of the one in the
previous clause would recall the other on the mention of his name.

and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus--The latter was an Ephesian, and
probably the former also. They seem to have put themselves, from this
time forward, at the apostle's disposal, and to the very last been a
great comfort to him ([Eph 6:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#021);
[Col 4:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#007); [Act
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#029); [Ti2
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#012), [Ti2
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#020)). From the mention of the places
to which each of these companions belonged, and still more the order in
which they occur, we are left to conclude that they were deputies from
their respective churches, charged with taking up and bringing on the
collection for the poor saints at Jerusalem, first at Berea, next at
Thessalonica, then at Philippi \[HOWSON\], where we gather that our
historian himself rejoined the party (from the resumption at [Act
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#005) of the "us," dropped at [Act
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#017)), by whom the Philippian
collection would naturally be brought on.

[Acts 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 20:5</span></span>

These going before--perhaps to announce and prepare for the apostle's
coming.

tarried for us at Troas.

[Acts 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 20:6</span></span>

And we sailed . . . from Philippi after the days of unleavened
bread--(that is, the Passover). This, compared with [Co1
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#008), shows that the three months
spent at Corinth ([Act 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#003)) were the
winter months.

came . . . to Troas--for the third and last time. (See on [Act
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#008) and [Act
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#001)).

in the five days--As it might have been done in two days, the wind must
have been adverse. The vivid style of one now present will be here again
observed.

where we abode seven days--that is, arriving on a Monday, they stayed
over the Jewish sabbath and the Lord's Day following; Paul occupying
himself, doubtless, in refreshing and strengthening fellowship with the
brethren during the interval.

[Acts 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 20:7</span></span>

upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together--This,
compared with [Co1 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#002), and other
similar allusions, plainly indicates that the Christian observance of
the day afterwards distinctly called "the Lord's Day," was already a
fixed practice of the churches.

Paul preached--discoursed. The tense implies continued action--"kept
discoursing."

[Acts 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 20:8</span></span>

there were many lights in the upper chamber--not a mere piece of graphic
detail by an eye-witness \[HACKETT, HOWSON\], but mentioned, probably,
as increasing the heat and contributing to drowsiness \[WEBSTER and
WILKINSON\], as the next clause seems to show.

[Acts 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 20:9</span></span>

in a--"the."

window--or window seat, or recess.

fell down from the third loft--"story."

and was taken up dead--"The window projected (according to the side of
the room where it was situated) either over the street or over the
interior court; so that in either case he fell on the hard earth or
pavement below."

[Acts 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 20:10</span></span>

Paul . . . fell on him--like Elisha ([Kg2
4:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#034)).

his life is in him--now restored; compare [Mar
5:39](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#039).

[Acts 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 20:11</span></span>

broken bread and eaten--with what a mixture of awe and joy after such an
occurrence! "And eaten"--denoting a common repast, as distinguished from
the breaking of the eucharistic bread.

and talked a long while, even till break of day--How lifelike this
record of dear Christian fellowship, as free and gladsome as it was
solemn! (See [Ecc 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#007)).

[Acts 20:13](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 20:13</span></span>

CONTINUING HIS ROUTE TO JERUSALEM HE REACHES MILETUS, WHENCE HE SENDS
FOR THE ELDERS OF EPHESUS--HIS FAREWELL ADDRESS TO THEM. (Acts 20:13-38)

we . . . sailed--from Troas.

unto Assos; there . . . to take in Paul: for so had he appointed,
minding himself to go afoot--"to go by land." (See on [Mar
6:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#033)). In sailing southward from Troas
to Assos, one has to round Cape Lecture, and keeping due east to run
along the northern shore of the Gulf of Adramyttium, on which it lies.
This is a sail of nearly forty miles; whereas by land, cutting right
across, in a southeasterly direction, from sea to sea, by that excellent
Roman road which then existed, the distance was scarcely more than half.
The one way Paul wished his companions to take, while he himself,
longing perhaps to enjoy a period of solitude, took the other, joining
the ship, by appointment, at Assos.

[Acts 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 20:14</span></span>

came to Mitylene--the capital of the beautiful and classical island of
Lesbos, which lies opposite the eastern shore of the Ã†gean Sea, about
thirty miles south of Assos; in whose harbor they seem to have lain for
the night.

[Acts 20:15](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 20:15</span></span>

came the next day over against Chios--now Scio: one of the most
beautiful of those islands between which and the coast the sail is so
charming. They appear not to have touched at it.

next day we arrived--"touched" or "put in."

at Samos--another island coming quite close to the mainland, and about
as far south of Chios as it is south of Lesbos.

tarried--for the night.

at Trogyllium--an anchorage on the projecting mainland, not more than a
mile from the southern extremity of the island of Samos.

next day we came to Miletus--on the mainland; the ancient capital of
Ionia, near the mouth of the Meander.

[Acts 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">act 20:16</span></span>

For Paul had determined to sail by--or "sail past."

Ephesus--He was right opposite to it when approaching Chios.

because he would not spend time in Asia--the Asian province of which
Ephesus was the chief city.

for he hasted, if . . . possible . . . to be at Jerusalem the day of
Pentecost--as a suitable season for giving in the great collection from
all the western churches, for keeping the feast, and clearing his
apostolic position with the Church, then represented in large number at
Jerusalem. The words imply that there was considerable ground to doubt
if he would attain this object--for more than three of the seven weeks
from Passover to Pentecost had already expired--and they are inserted
evidently to explain why he did not once more visit Ephesus.

[Acts 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">act 20:17</span></span>

from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church--As
he was now some forty miles south of Ephesus, we might think that more
time would be lost by sending thus far for the elders to come to him,
than by going at once to Ephesus itself, when so near it. But if
unfavorable winds and stormy weather had overtaken them, his object
could not have been attained, and perhaps he was unwilling to run the
risk of detention at Ephesus by the state of the church and other
causes. Those here called "elders" or "presbyters," are in [Act
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#028) called "bishops." (See on [Act
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#028)). The identity of presbyters and
bishops in the New Testament is beyond all reasonable dispute.

[Acts 20:18](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 20:18</span></span>

Ye know . . . after what manner I have been with you at all seasons--For
the Christian integrity and fidelity of his whole official intercourse
with them he appeals to themselves.

[Acts 20:19](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 20:19</span></span>

Serving the Lord--Jesus.

with all humility . . . and many tears and temptations--Self-exaltation
was unknown to him, and ease of mind: He "sowed in tears," from
anxieties both on account of the converts from whom he "travailed in
birth," and of the Jews, whose bitter hostility was perpetually plotting
against him, interrupting his work and endangering his life.

[Acts 20:20](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 20:20</span></span>

kept back--timidly withheld from fear of consequences.

nothing that was profitable--edification directing all.

have taught you publicly, and from house to house--Did an apostle, whose
functions were of so wide a range, not feel satisfied without private as
well as public ministrations? How then must pastors feel? \[BENGEL\].

[Acts 20:21](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 20:21</span></span>

Testifying both to Jews and . . . Greeks--laboring under a common
malady, and recoverable only by a common treatment.

repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ--(See on
[Act 5:31](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#031)). REPENTANCE, as
distinguished from faith, is that state of the "honest and good heart"
which arises from a discovery of one's contrariety to the righteous
demands of the divine law. This is said to be "toward God," because
seeing Him to be the party dishonored by sin, it feels all its
acknowledgments and compunctions to be properly due to Him, as the great
Lawgiver, and directs them to Him accordingly; condemning, humbling
itself, and grieving before Him, looking also to Him as its only Hope of
deliverance. FAITH is said to be "toward our Lord Jesus Christ," because
in that frame of mind just described it eagerly credits the testimony of
relief divinely provided in Christ, gladly embraces the overtures of
reconciliation in Him, and directs all its expectations of salvation,
from its first stage to its last, to Him as the one appointed Medium of
all grace from God to a sinful world. Thus we have here a brief summary
of all Gospel preaching. And it is easy to see why repentance is here
put before faith; for the former must of necessity precede the latter.
There is a repentance subsequent to faith, the fruit of felt pardon and
restoration. It was this which drew the tears with which the Saviour's
feet were once so copiously moistened. ([Luk
7:37-38](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#037), [Luk
7:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#047); and compare [Eze
16:63](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#063)). But that is not the light in
which it is here presented.

[Acts 20:22](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 20:22</span></span>

And now, behold, I--"I" is emphatic here.

bound in the spirit--compare [Act
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#021). This internal pressure,
unattended with any knowledge of "what was to befall him there," was the
result of that higher guidance which shaped all his movements.

[Acts 20:23](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 20:23</span></span>

Save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, &c.--by prophetic
utterances from city to city, as in [Act
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#004); [Act
21:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#010). Analogous premonitions of
coming events are not unknown to the general method of God's providence.
They would tend to season the apostle's spirit.

[Acts 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 20:24</span></span>

But none of these things move me, neither, &c.--In this noble expression
of absolute dedication to the service of Christ and preparedness for the
worst that could befall him in such a cause, note (1) his jealousy for
the peculiar character of his mission, as immediately from Christ
Himself on which all the charges against him turned; (2) the burden of
that Gospel which he preached--GRACE; it was "the Gospel of the Grace of
God."

[Acts 20:25](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 20:25</span></span>

I know that ye all . . . shall see my face no more--not an inspired
prediction of what was certainly to be, but what the apostle, in his
peculiar circumstances, fully expected. Whether, therefore, he ever did
see them again, is a question to be decided purely on its own evidence.

[Acts 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 20:26</span></span>

I am pure from the blood of all men-- ([Act
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#006); and compare [Sa1
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#003), [Sa1
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#005); [Eze
3:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#017); [Eze
33:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#008)).

[Acts 20:27](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">act 20:27</span></span>

For I have not shunned to declare . . . all the counsel of God--God's
way of salvation, and His kingdom of souls saved by His Son Jesus
Christ. See [Luk 7:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#030).

[Acts 20:28](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">act 20:28</span></span>

Take heed . . . unto yourselves--Compare [Ti1
3:2-7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#002); [Ti1
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#016); [Ti1
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#011).

and to all the flock--Compare [Heb
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#017). Observe here how the personal
is put before the pastoral care.

over . . . which the Holy Ghost hath made you--Compare [Joh
20:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#022); [Eph
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#008), [Eph
4:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#011); [Rev
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#001). ([Act
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#023) shows that the apostle did not
mean to exclude human ordination).

overseers--or, as the same word is everywhere else rendered in our
version, "bishops." The English Version has hardly dealt fair in this
case with the sacred text, in rendering the word "overseers," whereas it
ought here, as in all other places, to have been "bishops," in order
that the fact of elders and bishops having been originally and
apostolically synonymous, might be apparent to the ordinary English
reader, which now it is not \[ALFORD\]. The distinction between these
offices cannot be certainly traced till the second century, nor was it
established till late in that century.

to feed the church of God--or, "the Church of the Lord." Which of these
two readings of the text is the true one, is a question which has
divided the best critics. The evidence of manuscripts preponderates in
favor of "THE LORD"; some of the most ancient Versions, though not all,
so read; and ATHANASIUS, the great champion of the supreme Divinity of
Christ early in the fourth century, says the expression "Church of God"
is unknown to the Scriptures. Which reading, then, does the internal
evidence favor? As "Church of God" occurs nine times elsewhere in Paul's
writings, and "Church of the Lord" nowhere, the probability, it is said,
is that he used his wonted phraseology here also. But if he did, it is
extremely difficult to see how so many early transcribers should have
altered it into the quite unusual phrase, "Church of the Lord"; whereas,
if the apostle did use this latter expression, and the historian wrote
it so accordingly, it it easy to see how transcribers might, from being
so accustomed to the usual phrase, write it "Church of God." On the
whole, therefore, we accept the second reading as most probably the true
one. But see what follows.

which he hath purchased--"made His own," "acquired."

with his own blood--"His own" is emphatic: "That glorified Lord who from
the right hand of power in the heavens is gathering and ruling the
Church, and by His Spirit, through human agency, hath set you over it,
cannot be indifferent to its welfare in your hands, seeing He hath given
for it His own most precious blood, thus making it His own by the
dearest of all ties." The transcendent sacredness of the Church of
Christ is thus made to rest on the dignity of its Lord and the
consequent preciousness of that blood which He shed for it. And as the
sacrificial atoning character of Christ's death is here plainly
expressed, so His supreme dignity is implied as clearly by the second
reading as it is expressed by the first. What a motive to pastoral
fidelity is here furnished!

[Acts 20:29](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">act 20:29</span></span>

after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you--Two classes
of coming enemies are here announced, the one more external to
themselves, the other bred in the bosom of their own community; both
were to be teachers, but the one, "grievous wolves," not sparing, that
is, making a prey of the flock; the other ([Act
20:30](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#030)), simply sectarian "perverters"
of the truth, with the view of drawing a party after them. Perhaps the
one pointed to that subtle poison of Oriental Gnosticism which we know
to have very early infected the Asiatic churches; the other to such
Judaizing tendencies as we know to have troubled nearly all the early
churches. See the Epistles to the Ephesians, Colossians, and Timothy,
also those to the seven churches of Asia (Rev. 2:1-3:22). But
watchfulness against all that tends to injure and corrupt the Church is
the duty of its pastors in every age.

by the space of three years--speaking in round numbers; for it was
nearer three than two years.

I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears--What an appeal
to be able to make! "And if this was an apostle's part, how much more a
pastor's!" \[BENGEL\].

[Acts 20:32](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">act 20:32</span></span>

I commend you to God--the almighty Conservator of His people.

and to the word of his grace--that message of His pure grace ([Act
20:24](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#024)) by the faith of which He keeps
us ([Pe1 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#005)).

which--that is, God.

is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance, &c.--Observe
how salvation--not only in its initial stages of pardon and
regeneration, but in all its subsequent stages of "up-building," even to
its consummation in the final inheritance--is here ascribed to the
"ability" of God to bestow it, as in [Rom
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#025); [Eph
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#020); particularly [Jde
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#024); and compare [Ti2
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#012), where the same thing is ascribed
to Christ.

among all them which are sanctified--Sanctification is here viewed as
the final character and condition of the heirs of glory, regarded as one
saved company.

([Act 26:29](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#029)).

have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me--See
[Act 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#003); [Co1
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#012); [Co1
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#006), written from Ephesus; also [Th1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#009).

ye ought to support the weak to remember the words of the Lord Jesus,
how he--"how Himself."

said, It is more blessed to give than to receive--This golden saying,
snatched from oblivion, and here added to the Church's abiding
treasures, is apt to beget the wish that more of what issued from those
Lips which "dropped as an honeycomb," had been preserved to us. But see
on [Joh 21:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#025).

[Acts 20:36](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">act 20:36</span></span>

he kneeled down and prayed with them all, &c.--Nothing can be more
touching than these three concluding verses, leaving an indelible
impression of rare ministerial fidelity and affection on the apostle's
part, and of warm admiration and attachment on the part of these
Ephesian presbyters. Would to God that such scenes were more frequent in
the Church!
