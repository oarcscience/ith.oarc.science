<p>
<p>At that time--a phrase used often loosely and indefinitely in sacred history. This domestic incident in the family of Jeroboam probably occurred towards the end of his reign; his son Abijah was of age and considered by the people the heir to the throne.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#002">3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">kg1 14:2</A></FONT></span></p>Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise thyself--His natural and intense anxiety as a parent is here seen, blended with the deep and artful policy of an apostate king. The reason of this extreme caution was an unwillingness to acknowledge that he looked for information as to the future, not to his idols, but to the true God; and a fear that this step, if publicly known, might endanger the stability of his whole political system; and a strong impression that Ahijah, who was greatly offended with him, would, if consulted openly by his queen, either insult or refuse to receive her. For these reasons he selected his wife, as, in every view, the most proper for such a secret and confidential errand, but recommended her to assume the garb and manner of a peasant woman. Strange infatuation, to suppose that the God who could reveal futurity could not penetrate a flimsy disguise!
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#003">3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">kg1 14:3</A></FONT></span></p>And take with thee ten loaves, and cracknels, and a cruse of honey, and go to him--This was a present in unison with the peasant character she assumed. Cracknels are a kind of sweet seed-cake. The prophet was blind, but having received divine premonition of the pretended countrywoman's coming, he addressed her as the queen the moment she appeared, apprised her of the calamities which, in consequence of the ingratitude of Jeroboam, his apostasy, and outrageous misgovernment of Israel, impended over their house, as well as over the nation which too readily followed his idolatrous innovations.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">kg1 14:8</A></FONT></span></p>thou hast not been as my servant David--David, though he fell into grievous sins, repented and always maintained the pure worship of God as enjoined by the law.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#010">3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">kg1 14:10</A></FONT></span></p>I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam--Strong expressions are here used to indicate the utter extirpation of his house; 
<p>
<p>him that is shut up and left in Israel--means those who were concealed with the greatest privacy, as the heirs of royalty often are where polygamy prevails; the other phrase, from the loose garments of the East having led to a different practice from what prevails in the West, cannot refer to men; it must signify either a very young boy, or rather, perhaps, a dog, so entire would be the destruction of Jeroboam's house that none, not even a dog, belonging to it should escape. This peculiar phrase occurs only in regard to the threatened extermination of a family (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#022">Sa1 25:22-34</A>). See the manner of extermination (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#004">Kg1 16:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#024">Kg1 21:24</A>).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">kg1 14:12</A></FONT></span></p>the child shall die--The death and general lamentation felt through the country at the loss of the prince were also predicted. The reason for the profound regret shown at his death arose, according to Jewish writers, from his being decidedly opposed to the erection of the golden calves, and using his influence with his father to allow his subjects the free privilege of going to worship in Jerusalem.

<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#013">3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">kg1 14:13</A></FONT></span></p>all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him--the only one of Jeroboam's family who should receive the rites of sepulture.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#014">3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">kg1 14:14</A></FONT></span></p>the Lord shall raise him up a king . . . but what? even now--namely, Baasha (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#027">Kg1 15:27</A>); he was already raised--he was in being, though not in power.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#017">3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">kg1 14:17</A></FONT></span></p>Tirzah--a place of pre-eminent beauty (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#004">Sol 6:4</A>), three hours' travelling east of Samaria, chosen when Israel became a separate kingdom, by the first monarch, and used during three short reigns as a residence of the royal house. The fertile plains and wooded hills in that part of the territory of Ephraim gave an opening to the formation of parks and pleasure-grounds similar to those which were the "paradises" of Assyrian and Persian monarchs [STANLEY]. Its site is occupied by the large village of Taltise [ROBINSON]. As soon as the queen reached the gate of the palace, she received the intelligence that her son was dying, according to the prophet's prediction [<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#012">Kg1 14:12</A>].

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">kg1 14:19</A></FONT></span></p>the rest of the acts of Jeroboam--None of the threatenings denounced against this family produced any change in his policy or government.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#021">3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">kg1 14:21</A></FONT></span></p>REHOBOAM'S WICKED REIGN. (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#021">Kg1 14:21-24</A>)
<p>
<p>he reigned . . . in Jerusalem--Its particular designation as "the city which the Lord did choose out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there," seems given here, both as a reflection on the apostasy of the ten tribes, and as a proof of the aggravated wickedness of introducing idolatry and its attendant vices there. 
<p>
<p>his mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess--Her heathen extraction and her influence as queen mother are stated to account for Rehoboam's tendency to depart from the true religion. Led by the warning of the prophet (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#023">Kg1 12:23</A>), as well as by the large immigration of Israelites into his kingdom (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#017">Kg1 12:17</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#016">Ch2 11:16</A>), he continued for the first three years of his reign a faithful patron of true religion (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#017">Ch2 11:17</A>). But afterwards he began and encouraged a general apostasy; idolatry became the prevailing form of worship, and the religious state of the kingdom in his reign is described by the high places, the idolatrous statues, the groves and impure rites that with unchecked license were observed in them. The description is suited to the character of the Canaanitish worship.
<p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_025">kg1 14:25</A></FONT></span></p>SHISHAK SPOILS JERUSALEM. (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#025">Kg1 14:25-31</A>)
<p>
<p>Shishak king of Egypt came up--He was the instrument in the hand of Providence for punishing the national defection. Even though this king had been Solomon's father-in-law, he was no relation of Rehoboam's; but there is a strong probability that he belonged to another dynasty (see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#002">Ch2 12:2</A>). He was the Sheshonk of the Egyptian monuments, who is depicted on a bas-relief at Karnak, as dragging captives, who, from their peculiar physiognomy, are universally admitted to be Jews.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#029">3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:29</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_029">kg1 14:29</A></FONT></span></p>Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam . . ., are they not written in the book of the chronicles?--not the book so called and comprehended in the sacred canon, but the national archives of Judah.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#030">3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:30</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_030">kg1 14:30</A></FONT></span></p>there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam--The former was prohibited from entering on an aggressive war; but as the two kingdoms kept up a jealous rivalry, he might be forced into vigilant measures of defense, and frequent skirmishes would take place on the borders.
