<p>
<p>Rehoboam went to Shechem--(See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#001">Kg1 12:1</A>). This chapter is, with a few verbal alterations, the same as in 1Ki. 12:1-19.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">ch2 10:3</A></FONT></span></p>And they sent--rather, "for they had sent," &amp;c. This is stated as the reason of Jeroboam's return from Egypt.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">ch2 10:7</A></FONT></span></p>If thou be kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to them--In the Book of Kings [<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#007">Kg1 12:7</A>], the words are, "If thou wilt be a servant unto this people, and wilt serve them." The meaning in both is the same, namely, If thou wilt make some reasonable concessions, redress their grievances, and restore their abridged liberties, thou wilt secure their strong and lasting attachment to thy person and government.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">ch2 10:15</A></FONT></span></p>the king hearkened not unto the people, for the cause was of God--Rehoboam, in following an evil counsel, and the Hebrew people, in making a revolutionary movement, each acted as free agents, obeying their own will and passions. But God, who permitted the revolt of the northern tribes, intended it as a punishment of the house of David for Solomon's apostasy. That event demonstrates the immediate superintendence of His providence over the revolutions of kingdoms; and thus it affords an instance, similar to many other striking instances that are found in Scripture, of divine predictions, uttered long before, being accomplished by the operation of human passions, and in the natural course of events.
