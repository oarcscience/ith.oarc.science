### [Psalms Chapter 102](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#001)

[Psalms 102:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 102:1</span></span>

A Prayer of the afflicted, &c.--The general terms seem to denote the
propriety of regarding the Psalm as suitably expressive of the anxieties
of any one of David's descendants, piously concerned for the welfare of
the Church. It was probably David's composition, and, though specially
suggested by some peculiar trials, descriptive of future times.
Overwhelmed--(compare [Psa 61:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#002)).
Poureth out--pouring out the soul-- ([Psa
62:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#008)). Complaint-- ([Psa
55:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#002)). The tone of complaint
predominates, though in view of God's promises and abiding faithfulness,
it is sometimes exchanged for that of confidence and hope. (Psa.
102:1-28)

The terms used occur in [Psa 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#001); [Psa
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#001), [Psa
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#006); [Psa
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#006); [Psa
31:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#002), [Psa
31:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#010); [Psa
37:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#020).

[Psalms 102:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 102:4</span></span>

(Compare [Psa 121:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#006)).

so that I forget--or, "have forgotten," that is, in my distress ([Psa
107:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#018)), and hence strength fails.

[Psalms 102:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 102:5</span></span>

voice . . . groaning--effect put for cause, my agony emaciates me.

[Psalms 102:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 102:6</span></span>

[Psalms 102:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 102:8</span></span>

sworn against me--or literally, "by me," wishing others as miserable as
I am ([Num 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#021)).

[Psalms 102:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 102:9</span></span>

ashes--a figure of grief, my bread; weeping or tears, my drink ([Psa
80:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#005)).

[Psalms 102:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 102:10</span></span>

lifted . . . cast me down--or, "cast me away" as stubble by a whirlwind
([Isa 64:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#006)).

[Psalms 102:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 102:11</span></span>

shadow . . . declineth--soon to vanish in the darkness of night.

[Psalms 102:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 102:12</span></span>

Contrast with man's frailty (compare [Psa
90:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#001)).

thy remembrance--that by which Thou art remembered, Thy promise.

[Psalms 102:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 102:13</span></span>

Hence it is here adduced.

for--or, "when."

the set time, &c.--the time promised, the indication of which is the
interest felt for Zion by the people of God.

[Psalms 102:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 102:15</span></span>

God's favor to the Church will affect her persecutors with fear.

[Psalms 102:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 102:16</span></span>

When the Lord shall build--or better, "Because the Lord hath built,"
&c., as a reason for the effect on others; for in thus acting and
hearing the humble, He is most glorious.

[Psalms 102:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 102:18</span></span>

people . . . created--(compare [Psa
22:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#031)), an organized body, as a
Church.

[Psalms 102:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 102:19</span></span>

For--or, "That," as introducing the statement of God's condescension. A
summary of what shall be written.

to loose . . . appointed--or, "deliver" them ([Psa
79:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#011)).

[Psalms 102:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">psa 102:21</span></span>

To declare, &c.--or, that God's name may be celebrated in the assemblies
of His Church, gathered from all nations ([Zac
8:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#020)), and devoted to His service.

[Psalms 102:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">psa 102:23</span></span>

The writer, speaking for the Church, finds encouragement in the midst of
all his distresses. God's eternal existence is a pledge of faithfulness
to His promises.

in the way--of providence.

weakened--literally, "afflicted," and made fearful of a premature end, a
figure of the apprehensions of the Church, lest God might not perform
His promise, drawn from those of a person in view of the dangers of
early death (compare [Psa 89:47](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#047)). Paul
([Heb 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#010)) quotes [Psa
102:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#026) as addressed to Christ in
His divine nature. The scope of the Psalm, as already seen, so far from
opposing, favors this view, especially by the sentiments of [Psa
102:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#012) (compare [Isa
60:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#001)). The association of the Messiah
with a day of future glory to the Church was very intimate in the minds
of Old Testament writers; and with correct views of His nature it is
very consistent that He should be addressed as the Lord and Head of His
Church, who would bring about that glorious future on which they ever
dwelt with fond delightful anticipations.
