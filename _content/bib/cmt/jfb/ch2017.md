### [2 Chronicles Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 17:1</span></span>

JEHOSHAPHAT REIGNS WELL AND PROSPERS. ([Ch2
17:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#001))

Jehoshaphat . . . strengthened himself against Israel--The temper and
proceedings of the kings of Israel rendered it necessary for him to
prepare vigorous measures of defense on the northern frontier of his
kingdom. These consisted in filling all the fortresses with their full
complement of troops and establishing military stations in various parts
of the country, as well as in the cities of Mount Ephraim, which
belonged to Jehoshaphat ([Ch2 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#008)).

[2 Chronicles 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 17:3</span></span>

he walked in the first ways of his father David--He imitated the piety
of his great ancestor in the early part of his reign before he made
those unhappy lapses which dishonored his character.

and sought not unto Baalim--a term used for idols generally in
contradistinction to the Lord God of his father.

[2 Chronicles 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch2 17:4</span></span>

and not after the doings of Israel--He observed with scrupulous
fidelity, and employed his royal influence to support the divine
institutions as enacted by Moses, abhorring that spurious and unlawful
calf-worship that now formed the established religion in Israel. Being
thus far removed, alike from gross idolatry and Israelitish apostasy,
and adhering zealously to the requirements of the divine law, the
blessing of God rested on his government. Ruling in the fear of God, and
for the good of his subjects, "the Lord established the kingdom in his
hand."

[2 Chronicles 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 17:5</span></span>

all Judah brought . . . presents--This was customary with the people
generally at the beginning of a reign ([Sa1
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#027)), and with the nobles and high
functionaries yearly afterwards. They were given in the form of
voluntary offerings, to avoid the odious idea of a tax or tribute.

[2 Chronicles 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 17:6</span></span>

his heart was lifted up in the ways of the Lord--Full of faith and
piety, he possessed zeal and courage to undertake the reformation of
manners, to suppress all the works and objects of idolatry (see on [Ch2
20:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#033)), and he held out public
encouragement to the pure worship of God.

[2 Chronicles 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 17:7</span></span>

HE SENDS LEVITES TO TEACH IN JUDAH. ([Ch2
17:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#007))

Also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes, . . . to
teach in the cities of Judah--The ordinary work of teaching devolved on
the priests. But extraordinary commissioners were appointed, probably to
ascertain whether the work had been done or neglected. This deputation
of five princes, assisted by two priests and nine Levites, was to make a
circuit of the towns in Judah. It is the first practical measure we read
of as being adopted by any of the kings for the religious instruction of
the people. Time and unbroken opportunities were afforded for carrying
out fully this excellent plan of home education, for the kingdom enjoyed
internal tranquillity as well as freedom for foreign wars. It is
conformable to the pious style of the sacred historian to trace this
profound peace to the "fear of the Lord having fallen on all kingdoms of
the lands that were round about Judah."

[2 Chronicles 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch2 17:9</span></span>

the book of the law--that is, either the whole Pentateuch or only the
book of Deuteronomy, which contains an abridgment of it.

[2 Chronicles 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 17:11</span></span>

Also some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and tribute
silver--either they had been his tributaries, or they were desirous of
securing his valuable friendship, and now made a voluntary offer of
tribute. Perhaps they were the Philistines who had submitted to the yoke
of David ([Sa2 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#001); [Psa
60:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#008)).

the Arabians--the nomad tribes on the south of the Dead Sea, who,
seeking the protection of Jehoshaphat after his conquest of Edom, paid
their tribute in the way most suitable to their pastoral habits--the
present of so many head of cattle.

[2 Chronicles 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 17:14</span></span>

HIS GREATNESS, CAPTAINS, AND ARMIES. ([Ch2
17:12-19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#012))

these are the numbers--The warriors were arranged in the army according
to their fathers houses. The army of Jehoshaphat, commanded by five
great generals and consisting of five unequal divisions, comprised one
million one hundred and sixty thousand men, without including those who
garrisoned the fortresses. No monarch, since the time of Solomon,
equalled Jehoshaphat in the extent of his revenue, in the strength of
his fortifications, and in the number of his troops.
