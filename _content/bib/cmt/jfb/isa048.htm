Thou canst testify the prediction was uttered long before the fulfilment: "see all this," namely, that the event answers to the prophecy. 
<p>
<p>declare--make the fact known as a proof that Jehovah alone is God (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#008">Isa 44:8</A>). 
<p>
<p>new things--namely, the deliverance from Babylon by Cyrus, new in contradistinction from former predictions that had been fulfilled (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#009">Isa 42:9</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#019">Isa 43:19</A>). Antitypically, the prophecy has in view the "new things" of the gospel treasury (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#013">Sol 7:13</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#052">Mat 13:52</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#017">Co2 5:17</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#005">Rev 21:5</A>). From this point forward, the prophecies as to Messiah's first and second advents and the restoration of Israel, have a new circumstantial distinctness, such as did not characterize the previous ones, even of Isaiah. Babylon, in this view, answers to the mystical Babylon of Revelation. 
<p>
<p>hidden--which could not have been guessed by political sagacity (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#022">Dan 2:22</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#029">Dan 2:29</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#009">Co1 2:9-10</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#007">Isaiah 48:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">isa 48:7</A></FONT></span></p>Not like natural results from existing causes, the events when they took place were like acts of creative power, such as had never before been "from the beginning." 
<p>
<p>even before the day when--rather [MAURER], "And before the day (of their occurrence) thou hast not heard of them"; that is, by any human acuteness; they are only heard of by the present inspired announcement.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#008">Isaiah 48:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">isa 48:8</A></FONT></span></p>heardest not--repeated, as also "knewest not," from <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#007">Isa 48:7</A>. 
<p>
<p>from that time--Mine anger towards thee. Omit "that." "Yea, from "the first thine ear did not open itself," namely, to obey them [ROSENMULLER]. "To open the ear" denotes obedient attention (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#005">Isa 50:5</A>); or, "was not opened" to receive them; that is, they were not declared by Me to thee previously, since, if thou hadst been informed of them, such is thy perversity, thou couldst not have been kept in check [MAURER]. In the former view, the sense of the words following is, "For I knew that, if I had not foretold the destruction of Babylon so plainly that there could be no perverting of it, thou wouldst have perversely ascribed it to idols, or something else than to Me" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#005">Isa 48:5</A>). Thus they would have relapsed into idolatry, to cure them of which the Babylonian captivity was sent: so they had done (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#004">Exo 32:4</A>). After the return, and ever since, they have utterly forsaken idols. 
<p>
<p>wast called--as thine appropriate appellation (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006">Isa 9:6</A>). 
<p>
<p>from the womb--from the beginning of Israel's national existence (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#002">Isa 44:2</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#009">Isaiah 48:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">isa 48:9</A></FONT></span></p>refrain--literally, "muzzle"; His wrath, after the return, was to be restrained a while, and then, because of their sins, let loose again (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#038">Psa 78:38</A>). 
<p>
<p>for thee--that is, that--omit "that": "From thee."

<p>
<p>with silver--rather, "for silver." I sought by affliction to purify thee, but thou wast not as silver obtained by melting, but as dross [GESENIUS]. Thy repentance is not complete: thou art not yet as refined silver. ROSENMULLER explains, "not as silver," not with the intense heat needed to melt silver (it being harder to melt than gold), that is, not with the most extreme severity. The former view is better (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#025">Isa 1:25</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#025">Isa 42:25</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#018">Eze 22:18-20</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#022">Eze 22:22</A>). 
<p>
<p>chosen--or else [LOWTH], tried . . . proved: according to GESENIUS, literally, "to rub with the touchstone," or to cut in pieces so as to examine (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#009">Zac 13:9</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#003">Mal 3:3</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#007">Pe1 1:7</A>).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">isa 48:11</A></FONT></span></p>how should my name--MAURER, instead of "My name" from <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#009">Isa 48:9</A>, supplies "My glory" from the next clause; and translates, "How (shamefully) My glory has been profaned!" In English Version the sense is, "I will refrain (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#009">Isa 48:9</A>, that is, not utterly destroy thee), for why should I permit My name to be polluted, which it would be, if the Lord utterly destroyed His elect people" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#009">Eze 20:9</A>)? 
<p>
<p>not give my glory unto another--If God forsook His people for ever, the heathen would attribute their triumph over Israel to their idols; so God's glory would be given to another.

<p>
<p>Lord . . . loved him; he will, &amp;c.--that is, "He whom the Lord hath loved will do," &amp;c. [LOWTH]; namely, Cyrus (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#028">Isa 44:28</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001">Isa 45:1</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#013">Isa 45:13</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#011">Isa 46:11</A>). However, Jehovah's language of love is too strong to apply to Cyrus, except as type of Messiah, to whom alone it fully applies (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#002">Rev 5:2-5</A>). 
<p>
<p>his pleasure--not Cyrus' own, but Jehovah's.

<p>
<p>from the time, &amp;c.--From the moment that the purpose began to be accomplished in the raising up of Cyrus I was present. 
<p>
<p>sent me--The prophet here speaks, claiming attention to his announcement as to Cyrus, on the ground of his mission from God and His Spirit. But he speaks not in his own person so much as in that of Messiah, to whom alone in the fullest sense the words apply (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001">Isa 61:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#036">Joh 10:36</A>). Plainly, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#001">Isa 49:1</A>, which is the continuation of the forty-eighth chapter, from <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#016">Isa 48:16</A>, where the change of speaker from God (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#001">Isa 48:1</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#012">Isa 48:12-15</A>) begins, is the language of Messiah. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#001">Luk 4:1</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#014">Luk 4:14</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#018">Luk 4:18</A>, shows that the Spirit combined with the Father in sending the Son: therefore "His Spirit" is nominative to "sent," not accusative, following it.

<p>righteousness--religious prosperity; the parent of "peace" or national prosperity; therefore "peace" corresponds to "righteousness" in the parallelism (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#017">Isa 32:17</A>).

<p>
<p>his name . . . cut off--transition from the second person, "thy," to the third "his." Israel's name was cut off "as a nation" during the Babylonish captivity; also it is so now, to which the prophecy especially looks (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#020">Rom 11:20</A>).
