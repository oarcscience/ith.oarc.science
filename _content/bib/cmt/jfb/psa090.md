### [Psalms Chapter 90](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#001)

[Psalms 90:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 90:1</span></span>

Contrasting man's frailty with God's eternity, the writer mourns over it
as the punishment of sin, and prays for a return of the divine favor. A
Prayer \[mainly such\] of Moses the man of God-- ([Deu
33:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#001); [Jos
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#006)); as such he wrote this (see on
[Psa 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#001), title, and [Psa
36:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#001), title). (Psa. 90:1-17)

dwelling-place--home (compare [Eze
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#016)), as a refuge ([Deu
33:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#027)).

[Psalms 90:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 90:2</span></span>

brought forth \[and\] formed--both express the idea of production by
birth.

[Psalms 90:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 90:3</span></span>

to destruction--literally, "even to dust" ([Gen
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#019)), which is partly quoted in the
last clause.

[Psalms 90:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 90:4</span></span>

Even were our days now a thousand years, as Adam's, our life would be
but a moment in God's sight ([Pe2
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#008)).

a watch--or, third part of a night (compare [Exo
14:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#024)).

[Psalms 90:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 90:5</span></span>

Life is like grass, which, though changing under the influence of the
night's dew, and flourishing in the morning, is soon cut down and
withereth ([Psa 103:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#015); [Pe1
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#024)).

[Psalms 90:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 90:7</span></span>

For--A reason, this is the infliction of God's wrath.

troubled--literally, "confounded by terror" ([Psa
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#005)). Death is by sin ([Rom
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#012)). Though "secret," the light of
God's countenance, as a candle, will bring sin to view ([Pro
20:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#027); [Co1
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#005)).

[Psalms 90:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 90:9</span></span>

are passed--literally, "turn," as to depart ([Jer
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#004)).

spend--literally, "consume."

as a tale--literally, "a thought," or, "a sigh" ([Eze
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#010)).

[Psalms 90:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 90:10</span></span>

Moses' life was an exception ([Deu
34:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#007)).

it is . . . cut off--or, "driven," as is said of the quails in using the
same word ([Num 11:31](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#031)). In view of
this certain and speedy end, life is full of sorrow.

[Psalms 90:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 90:11</span></span>

The whole verse may be read as a question implying the negative, "No one
knows what Thy anger can do, and what Thy wrath is, estimated by a true
piety."

[Psalms 90:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 90:12</span></span>

This he prays we may know or understand, so as properly to number or
appreciate the shortness of our days, that we may be wise.

[Psalms 90:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 90:13</span></span>

(Compare [Psa 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#002)).

let it repent--a strong figure, as in [Exo
32:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#012), imploring a change in His
dealings.

[Psalms 90:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 90:14</span></span>

early--promptly.

[Psalms 90:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 90:15</span></span>

As have been our sorrows, so let our joys be great and long.

[Psalms 90:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 90:16</span></span>

thy work--or, providential acts.

thy glory-- ([Psa 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#005); [Psa
45:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#003)), the honor accruing from Thy
work of mercy to us.

[Psalms 90:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 90:17</span></span>

let the beauty--or sum of His gracious acts, in their harmony, be
illustrated in us, and favor our enterprise.
