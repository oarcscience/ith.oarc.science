### [Acts Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#001)

[Acts 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 1:1</span></span>

INTRODUCTION--LAST DAYS OF OUR LORD UPON EARTH--HIS ASCENSION. ([Act
1:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#001))

former treatise--Luke's Gospel.

Theophilus--(See on [Luk 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#003)).

began to do and teach--a very important statement, dividing the work of
Christ into two great branches: the one embracing His work on earth, the
other His subsequent work from heaven; the one in His own Person, the
other by His Spirit; the one the "beginning," the other the continuance
of the same work; the one complete when He sat down at the right hand of
the Majesty on high, the other to continue till His second appearing;
the one recorded in "The Gospels," the beginnings only of the other
related in this book of "The Acts." "Hence the grand history of what
Jesus did and taught does not conclude with His departure to the Father;
but Luke now begins it in a higher strain; for all the subsequent labors
of the apostles are just an exhibition of the ministry of the glorified
Redeemer Himself because they were acting under His authority, and He
was the principle that operated in them all" \[OLSHAUSEN\].

[Acts 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 1:2</span></span>

after that he, through the Holy Ghost, had given commandments,
&c.--referring to the charge recorded in [Mat
28:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#018); [Mar
16:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#015); [Luk
24:44-49](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#044). It is worthy of notice that
nowhere else are such communications of the risen Redeemer said to have
been given "through the Holy Ghost." In general, this might have been
said of all He uttered and all He did in His official character; for it
was for this very end that God "gave not the Spirit by measure unto Him"
([Joh 3:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#034)). But after His
resurrection, as if to signify the new relation in which He now stood to
the Church, He signalized His first meeting with the assembled disciples
by breathing on them (immediately after dispensing to them His peace)
and saying, "Receive ye the Holy Ghost" ([Joh
20:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#022)) thus anticipating the donation
of the Spirit from His hands (see on [Joh
20:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#021)); and on the same principle
His parting charges are here said to have been given "through the Holy
Ghost," as if to mark that He was now all redolent with the Spirit; that
what had been husbanded, during His suffering work, for His own
necessary uses, had now been set free, was already overflowing from
Himself to His disciples, and needed but His ascension and glorification
to flow all forth. (See on [Joh 7:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#039).)

[Acts 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 1:3</span></span>

showed himself alive--As the author is about to tell us that "the
resurrection of the Lord Jesus" was the great burden of apostolic
preaching, so the subject is here filly introduced by an allusion to the
primary evidence on which that great fact rests, the repeated and
undeniable manifestations of Himself in the body to the assembled
disciples, who, instead of being predisposed to believe it, had to be
overpowered by the resistless evidence of their own senses, and were
slow of yielding even to this ([Mar
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#014)).

after his passion--or, suffering. This primary sense of the word
"passion" has fallen into disuse; but it is nobly consecrated in the
phraseology of the Church to express the Redeemer's final endurances.

seen of them forty days--This important specification of time occurs
here only.

speaking of--rather "speaking."

the things pertaining to the kingdom of God--till now only in germ, but
soon to take visible form; the earliest and the latest burden of His
teaching on earth.

[Acts 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 1:4</span></span>

should not depart from Jerusalem--because the Spirit was to glorify the
existing economy, by descending on the disciples at its metropolitan
seat, and at the next of its great festivals after the ascension of the
Church's Head; in order that "out of Zion might go forth the law, and
the word of the Lord from Jerusalem" ([Isa
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#003); and compare [Luk
24:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#049)).

[Acts 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 1:5</span></span>

ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence--ten days
hence, as appears from [Lev 23:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#015);
but it was expressed thus indefinitely to exercise their faith.

[Acts 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 1:6</span></span>

wilt thou at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?--Doubtless their
carnal views of Messiah's kingdom had by this time been modified, though
how far it is impossible to say. But, as they plainly looked for some
restoration of the kingdom to Israel, so they are neither rebuked nor
contradicted on this point.

[Acts 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 1:7</span></span>

It is not for you to know the times, &c.--implying not only that this
was not the time, but that the question was irrelevant to their present
business and future work.

[Acts 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 1:8</span></span>

receive power--See [Luk 24:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#049).

and ye shall be witnesses unto me . . . in Jerusalem . . . in all Judea
. . . and unto the uttermost part of the earth--This order of apostolic
preaching and success supplies the proper key to the plan of the Acts,
which relates first the progress of the Gospel "in Jerusalem, and all
Judea and Samaria" (the first through ninth chapters), and then "unto
the uttermost part of the earth" (the tenth through twenty-eighth
chapters).

[Acts 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 1:9</span></span>

while they beheld, he was taken up--See on [Luk
24:50-53](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#050). Lest it should be thought He
had disappeared when they were looking in some other direction, and so
was only concluded to have gone up to heaven, it is here expressly said
that "while they were looking He was taken up, and a cloud received Him
out of their sight." So Elijah, "If thou see me when I am taken from
thee" ([Kg2 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#010)); "And Elisha saw it"
([Act 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#012)). (See on [Luk
9:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#032).)

[Acts 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 1:10</span></span>

while they looked steadfastly toward heaven--following Him with their
eager eyes, in rapt amazement. Not, however, as a mere fact is this
recorded, but as a part of that resistless evidence of their senses on
which their whole subsequent testimony was to be borne.

two men in white apparel--angels in human form, as in [Luk
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#004).

[Acts 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 1:11</span></span>

Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven, &c.--"as if your
now glorified Head were gone from you never to return: He is coming
again; not another, but 'this same Jesus'; and 'as ye have seen Him go,
in the like manner shall He come'--as personally, as visibly, as
gloriously; and let the joyful expectation of this coming swallow up the
sorrow of that departure."

[Acts 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 1:12</span></span>

RETURN OF THE ELEVEN TO JERUSALEM--PROCEEDINGS IN THE UPPER ROOM TILL
PENTECOST. ([Act 1:12-26](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#012))

a sabbath day's journey--about two thousand cubits.

[Acts 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 1:13</span></span>

went up into an upper room--perhaps the same "large upper room" where
with their Lord they had celebrated the last Passover and the first
Supper ([Luk 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#012)).

where abode--not lodged, but had for their place of rendezvous.

Peter, &c.--(See on [Mat 10:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#002)).

[Acts 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 1:14</span></span>

continued with one accord--knit by a bond stronger than death.

in prayer and supplication--for the promised baptism, the need of which
in their orphan state would be increasingly felt.

and Mary the mother of Jesus--distinguished from the other "women," but
"so as to exclude the idea of her having any pre-eminence over the
disciples. We find her with the rest in prayer to her glorified Son"
\[WEBSTER and WILKINSON\]. This is the last mention of her in the New
Testament. The fable of the Assumption of the Virgin has no foundation
even in tradition \[ALFORD\].

with his brethren--(See on [Joh 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#003)).

[Acts 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 1:15</span></span>

in those days--of expectant prayer, and probably towards the close of
them, when the nature of their future work began more clearly to dawn
upon them, and the Holy Ghost, already "breathed" on the Eleven ([Joh
20:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#022)), was stirring in Peter, who was
to be the leading spirit of the infant community ([Mat
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#019)).

the number . . . about an hundred and twenty--Many, therefore, of the
"five hundred brethren" who saw their risen Lord "at once" ([Co1
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#006)), must have remained in Galilee.

[Acts 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 1:18</span></span>

falling headlong, &c.--This information supplements, but by no means
contradicts, what is said in [Mat
27:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#005).

[Acts 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 1:20</span></span>

his bishopric--or "charge." The words are a combination of [Psa
69:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#025) and [Psa
109:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#008); in which the apostle discerns a
greater than David, and a worse than Ahithophel and his fellow
conspirators against David.

[Acts 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 1:21</span></span>

all the time the Lord Jesus went in and out among us--in the close
intimacies of a three years' public life.

[Acts 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 1:22</span></span>

Beginning from the baptism of John--by whom our Lord was not only
Himself baptized, but first officially announced and introduced to his
own disciples.

unto that same day when he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to
be a witness with us of his resurrection--How clearly is the primary
office of the apostles here expressed: (1) to testify, from personal
observation, to the one great fact of "the resurrection of the Lord
Jesus"; (2) to show how this glorified His whole previous life, of which
they were constant observers, and established His divine claims.

[Acts 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 1:23</span></span>

they appointed--"put up" in nomination; meaning not the Eleven but the
whole company, of whom Peter was the spokesman.

two--The choice would lie between a very few.

[Acts 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 1:24</span></span>

prayed and said, Thou, Lord, &c.--"The word 'Lord,' placed absolutely,
denotes in the New Testament almost universally THE SON; and the words,
'Show whom Thou hast chosen,' are decisive. The apostles are just
Christ's messengers: It is He that sends them, and of Him they bear
witness. Here, therefore, we have the first example of a prayer offered
to the exalted Redeemer; furnishing indirectly the strongest proof of
His divinity" \[OLSHAUSEN\].

which knowest the hearts of all men--See [Joh
2:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#024); [Joh
21:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#015); [Rev
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#023).

[Acts 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 1:25</span></span>

that he might go to his own place--A euphemistic or softened expression
of the awful future of the traitor, implying not only destined
habitation but congenial element.

[Acts 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 1:26</span></span>

was numbered--"voted in" by general suffrage.

with the eleven apostles--completing the broken Twelve.
