<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">jer 29:1</A></FONT></span></p>LETTER OF JEREMIAH TO THE CAPTIVES IN BABYLON, TO COUNTERACT THE ASSURANCES GIVEN BY THE FALSE PROPHETS OF A SPEEDY RESTORATION. (Jer. 29:1-32)
<p>
<p>residue of the elders--those still surviving from the time when they were carried to Babylon with Jeconiah; the other elders of the captives had died by either a natural or a violent death.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#002">Jeremiah 29:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">jer 29:2</A></FONT></span></p>queen--Nehushta, the queen mother, daughter of Elnathan (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#008">Kg2 24:8</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#015">Kg2 24:15</A>). (Elnathan, her father, is perhaps the same as the one mentioned in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#022">Jer 26:22</A>). She reigned jointly with her son. 
<p>
<p>princes--All the men of authority were taken away lest they should organize a rebellion. Jeremiah wrote his letter while the calamity was still recent, to console the captives under it.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#003">Jeremiah 29:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">jer 29:3</A></FONT></span></p>Zedekiah . . . sent unto Babylon--In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#059">Jer 51:59</A>, Zedekiah himself goes to Babylon; here he sends ambassadors. Whatever was the object of the embassy, it shows that Zedekiah only reigned at the pleasure of the king of Babylon, who might have restored Jeconiah, had he pleased. Hence, Zedekiah permitted Jeremiah's letter to be sent, not only as being led by Hananiah's death to attach greater credit to the prophet's words, but also as the letter accorded with his own wish that the Jews should remain in Chaldea till Jeconiah's death. 
<p>
<p>Hilkiah--the high priest who found the book of the law in the house of the Lord, and showed it to "Shaphan" the scribe (the same Shaphan probably as here), who showed it to King Josiah (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#008">Kg2 22:8</A>, &amp;c.). The sons of Hilkiah and Shaphan inherited from their fathers some respect for sacred things. So in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#025">Jer 36:25</A>, "Gemariah" interceded with King Jehoiakim that the prophet's roll should not be burned.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#005">Jeremiah 29:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">jer 29:5</A></FONT></span></p>Build . . . houses--In opposition to the false prophets' suggestions, who told the captives that their captivity would soon cease, Jeremiah tells them that it will be of long duration, and that therefore they should build houses, as Babylon is to be for long their home.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#006">Jeremiah 29:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">jer 29:6</A></FONT></span></p>that ye . . . be . . . not diminished--It was God's will that the seed of Abraham should not fail; thus consolation is given them, and the hope, though not of an immediate, yet of an ultimate, return.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#007">Jeremiah 29:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">jer 29:7</A></FONT></span></p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#010">Ezr 6:10</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#001">Rom 13:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#002">Ti1 2:2</A>). Not only bear the Babylonian yoke patiently, but pray for your masters, that is, while the captivity lasts. God's good time was to come when they were to pray for Babylon's downfall (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#035">Jer 51:35</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#008">Psa 137:8</A>). They were not to forestall that time. True religion teaches patient submission, not sedition, even though the prince be an unbeliever. In all states of life let us not throw away the comfort we may have, because we have not all we would have. There is here a foretaste of gospel love towards enemies (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#044">Mat 5:44</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#008">Jeremiah 29:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">jer 29:8</A></FONT></span></p>your dreams which ye caused to be dreamed--The Latin adage says, "The people wish to be deceived, so let them be deceived." Not mere credulity misleads men, but their own perverse "love of darkness rather than light." It was not priests who originated priestcraft, but the people's own morbid appetite to be deceived; for example, Aaron and the golden calf (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#001">Exo 32:1-4</A>). So the Jews caused or made the prophets to tell them encouraging dreams (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#025">Jer 23:25-26</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#007">Ecc 5:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#002">Zac 10:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#019">Joh 3:19-21</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#010">Jeremiah 29:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">jer 29:10</A></FONT></span></p>(See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#011">Jer 25:11</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#012">Jer 25:12</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#002">Dan 9:2</A>). This proves that the seventy years date from Jeconiah's captivity, not from the last captivity. The specification of time was to curb the impatience of the Jews lest they should hasten before God's time. 
<p>
<p>good word--promise of a return.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#011">Jeremiah 29:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">jer 29:11</A></FONT></span></p>I know--I alone; not the false prophets who know nothing of My purposes, though they pretend to know. 
<p>
<p>thoughts . . . I think-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#009">Isa 55:9</A>). Glancing at the Jews who had no "thoughts of peace," but only of "evil" (misfortune), because they could not conceive how deliverance could come to them. The moral malady of man is twofold--at one time vain confidence; then, when that is disappointed, despair. So the Jews first laughed at God's threats, confident that they should speedily return; then, when cast down from that confidence, they sank in inconsolable despondency. 
<p>
<p>expected end--literally, "end and expectation," that is, an end, and that such an end as you wish for. Two nouns joined by "and," standing for a noun and adjective. So in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#027">Jer 36:27</A>, "the roll and the words," that is, the roll of words; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#016">Gen 3:16</A>, "sorrow and conception," that is, sorrow in conception. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#018">Pro 23:18</A>, where, as here "end" means "a happy issue."
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#012">Jeremiah 29:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">jer 29:12</A></FONT></span></p>Fulfilled (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#003">Dan 9:3</A>, &amp;c.). When God designs mercy, He puts it into the hearts of His people to pray for the mercy designed. When such a spirit of prayer is poured out, it is a sure sign of coming mercy. 
<p>
<p>go--to the temple and other places of prayer: contrasted with their previous sloth as to going to seek God.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#013">Jeremiah 29:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">jer 29:13</A></FONT></span></p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#040">Lev 26:40-42</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#044">Lev 26:44-45</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#014">Jeremiah 29:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">jer 29:14</A></FONT></span></p>to be found-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#006">Psa 32:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#006">Isa 55:6</A>). 
<p>
<p>turn . . . captivity--play upon sounds, shabti . . . shebith.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#015">Jeremiah 29:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">jer 29:15</A></FONT></span></p>Because--referring not to the preceding words, but to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#010">Jer 29:10-11</A>, "Jehovah saith this to you" (that is, the prophecy of the continuance of the captivity seventy years), "because ye have said, The Lord hath raised us up prophets in Babylon," namely, foretelling our speedy deliverance (this their prophecy is supposed, not expressed; accordingly, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#016">Jer 29:16-19</A> contradict this false hope again, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#008">Jer 29:8-9</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#021">Jer 29:21</A>). He, in this fifteenth verse, turns his address from the godly (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#012">Jer 29:12-14</A>) to the ungodly listeners, to false prophets.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#016">Jeremiah 29:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">jer 29:16</A></FONT></span></p>people . . . in this city . . . not gone forth--So far from your returning to Jerusalem soon, even your brethren still left dwelling there shall themselves also be cast into exile. He mentions "the throne of David," lest they should think that, because David's kingdom was to be perpetual, no severe, though temporary, chastisements could interpose (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#029">Psa 89:29-36</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#017">Jeremiah 29:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">jer 29:17</A></FONT></span></p>vile figs--Hebrew, "horrible," or nauseous, from a root, "to regard with loathing" (see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#008">Jer 24:8</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#010">Jer 24:10</A>).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">jer 29:21</A></FONT></span></p>Zedekiah--brother of Zephaniah (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#025">Jer 29:25</A>), both being sons of Maaseiah; probably of the same family as the false prophet under Ahab in Israel (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#011">Kg1 22:11</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#024">Kg1 22:24</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#022">Jeremiah 29:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">jer 29:22</A></FONT></span></p>shall be taken . . . a curse--that is, a formula of imprecation. 
<p>
<p>Lord make thee like Zedekiah--(Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#020">Gen 48:20</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#015">Isa 65:15</A>). 
<p>
<p>roasted in the fire--a Chaldean punishment (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#006">Dan 3:6</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#023">Jeremiah 29:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">jer 29:23</A></FONT></span></p>villainy--literally, "sinful folly" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#006">Isa 32:6</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#024">Jeremiah 29:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">jer 29:24</A></FONT></span></p>A second communication which Jeremiah sent to Babylon, after the messenger who carried his first letter had brought a letter from the false prophet Shemaiah to Zephaniah, &amp;c., condemning Jeremiah and reproving the authorities for not having apprehended him. 
<p>
<p>Nehelamite--a name derived either from his father or from a place: alluding at the same time to the Hebrew meaning, "a dreamer" (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#008">Jer 29:8</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#025">Jeremiah 29:25</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_025">jer 29:25</A></FONT></span></p>in thy name--without sanction of "the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel," which words stand in antithesis to "thy name" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#043">Joh 5:43</A>). 
<p>
<p>Zephaniah--the second priest, or substitute (Sagan) of the high priest. He was one of those sent to consult Jeremiah by Zedekiah (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#001">Jer 21:1</A>). Slain by Nebuchadnezzar at the capture of Jerusalem (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#018">Kg2 25:18-21</A>). Zephaniah was in particular addressed, as being likely to take up against Jeremiah the prophet's prediction against his brother Zedekiah at Babylon (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#021">Jer 29:21</A>). Zephaniah was to read it to the priests, and in the presence of all the people, in the temple.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#026">Jeremiah 29:26</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_026">jer 29:26</A></FONT></span></p>thee . . . in the stead of Jehoiada--Zephaniah's promotion as second priest, owing to Jehoiada's being then in exile, was unexpected. Shemaiah thus accuses him of ingratitude towards God, who had so highly exalted him before his regular time. 
<p>
<p>ye should be officers . . . for every man--Ye should, as bearing rule in the temple (see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#001">Jer 20:1</A>), apprehend every false prophet like Jeremiah. 
<p>
<p>mad--Inspired prophets were often so called by the ungodly (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#011">Kg2 9:11</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#024">Act 26:24</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#013">Act 2:13</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#015">Act 2:15</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#017">Act 2:17-18</A>). Jeremiah is in this a type of Christ, against whom the same charge was brought (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#020">Joh 10:20</A>). 
<p>
<p>prison--rather, "the stocks" (see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#002">Jer 20:2</A>). 
<p>
<p>stocks--from a root, "to confine"; hence rather, "a narrow dungeon." According to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#008">Deu 17:8-9</A>, the priest was judge in such cases, but had no right to put into the stocks; this right he had assumed to himself in the troubled state of the times.
<p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_027">jer 29:27</A></FONT></span></p>of Anathoth--said contemptuously, as "Jesus of Nazareth."

<p>maketh himself--as if God had not made him one, but he himself had done so.

This accords with Shemaiah's imputation against Zephaniah for want of zeal against Jeremiah (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#026">Jer 29:26-27</A>). Hence the latter was chosen by King Zedekiah as one of the deputation to Jeremiah (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#001">Jer 21:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#003">Jer 37:3</A>).
