### [Galatians Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#001)

[Galatians 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gal 4:1</span></span>

THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED: ILLUSTRATION OF OUR SUBJECTION TO THE LAW
ONLY TILL CHRIST CAME, FROM THE SUBJECTION OF AN HEIR TO HIS GUARDIAN
TILL HE IS OF AGE. PETER'S GOOD WILL TO THE GALATIANS SHOULD LEAD THEM
TO THE SAME GOOD WILL TO HIM AS THEY HAD AT FIRST SHOWN. THEIR DESIRE TO
BE UNDER THE LAW SHOWN BY THE ALLEGORY OF ISAAC AND ISHMAEL TO BE
INCONSISTENT WITH THEIR GOSPEL LIBERTY. (Gal. 4:1-31)

The fact of God's sending His Son to redeem us who were under the law
([Gal 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#004)), and sending the Spirit of
His Son into our hearts ([Gal 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#006)),
confirms the conclusion ([Gal 3:29](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#029))
that we are "heirs according to the promise."

the heir-- ([Gal 3:29](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#029)). It is not, as
in earthly inheritances, the death of the father, but our Father's
sovereign will simply that makes us heirs.

child--Greek, "one under age."

differeth nothing, &c.--that is, has no more freedom than a slave (so
the Greek for "servant" means). He is not at his own disposal.

lord of all--by title and virtual ownership (compare [Co1
3:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#021)).

[Galatians 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gal 4:2</span></span>

tutors and governors--rather, "guardians (of the person) and stewards
(of the property)." Answering to "the law was our schoolmaster" or
"tutor" ([Gal 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#024)).

until the time appointed of the father--in His eternal purposes ([Eph
1:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#009)). The Greek is a legal term,
expressing a time defined by law, or testamentary disposition.

[Galatians 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gal 4:3</span></span>

we--the Jews primarily, and inclusively the Gentiles also. For the "we"
in [Gal 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#005) plainly refers to both Jew
and Gentile believers. The Jews in their bondage to the law of Moses, as
the representative people of the world, include all mankind virtually
amenable to God's law ([Rom 2:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#014);
compare Note, see on [Gal 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#013); [Gal
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#023)). Even the Gentiles were under
"bondage," and in a state of discipline suitable to nonage, till Christ
came as the Emancipator.

were in bondage--as "servants" ([Gal
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#001)).

under the elements--or "rudiments"; rudimentary religion teaching of a
non-Christian character: the elementary lessons of outward things
(literally, "of the \[outward\] world"); such as the legal ordinances
mentioned, [Gal 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#010) ([Col
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#008), [Col
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#020)). Our childhood's lessons
\[CONYBEARE and HOWSON\]. Literally, The letters of the alphabet ([Heb
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#012)).

[Galatians 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gal 4:4</span></span>

the fulness of the time--namely, "the time appointed by the Father"
([Gal 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#002)). Compare Note, see on [Eph
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#010); [Luk
1:57](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#057); [Act
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#001); [Eze
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#002). "The Church has its own ages"
\[BENGEL\]. God does nothing prematurely, but, foreseeing the end from
the beginning, waits till all is ripe for the execution of His purpose.
Had Christ come directly after the fall, the enormity and deadly fruits
of sin would not have been realized fully by man, so as to feel his
desperate state and need of a Saviour. Sin was fully developed. Man's
inability to save himself by obedience to the law, whether that of
Moses, or that of conscience, was completely manifested; all the
prophecies of various ages found their common center in this particular
time: and Providence, by various arrangements in the social and
political, as well as the moral world, had fully prepared the way for
the coming Redeemer. God often permits physical evil long before he
teaches the remedy. The smallpox had for long committed its ravages
before inoculation, and then vaccination, was discovered. It was
essential to the honor of God's law to permit evil long before He
revealed the full remedy. Compare "the set time" ([Psa
102:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#013)).

was come--Greek, "came."

sent forth--Greek, "sent forth out of heaven from Himself" \[ALFORD and
BENGEL\]. The same verb is used of the Father's sending forth the Spirit
([Gal 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#006)). So in [Act
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#012). Compare with this verse, [Joh
8:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#042); [Isa
48:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#016).

his--emphatical. "His own Son." Not by adoption, as we are ([Gal
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#005)): nor merely His Son by the
anointing of the Spirit which God sends into the heart ([Gal
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#006); [Joh
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018)).

made of a woman--"made" is used as in [Co1
15:45](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#045), "The first man, Adam, was made
a living soul," Greek, "made to be (born) of a woman." The expression
implies a special interposition of God in His birth as man, namely,
causing Him to be conceived by the Holy Ghost. So ESTIUS.

made under the law--"made to be under the law." Not merely as GROTIUS
and ALFORD explain, "Born subject to the law as a Jew." But "made" by
His Father's appointment, and His own free will, "subject to the law,"
to keep it all, ceremonial and moral, perfectly for us, as the
Representative Man, and to suffer and exhaust the full penalty of our
whole race's violation of it. This constitutes the significance of His
circumcision, His being presented in the temple ([Luk
2:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#021), [Luk
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#027); compare [Mat
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#017)), and His baptism by John, when
He said ([Mat 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#015)), "Thus it becometh
us to fulfil all righteousness."

[Galatians 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gal 4:5</span></span>

To--Greek, "That He might redeem."

them . . . under the law--primarily the Jews: but as these were the
representative people of the world, the Gentiles, too, are included in
the redemption ([Gal 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#013)).

receive--The Greek implies the suitableness of the thing as long ago
predestined by God. "Receive as something destined or due" ([Luk
23:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#041); [Jo2
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#008)). Herein God makes of sons of men
sons of God, inasmuch as God made of the Son of God the Son of man
\[AUGUSTINE on Psalm 52\].

[Galatians 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gal 4:6</span></span>

because ye are sons--The gift of the Spirit of prayer is the consequence
of our adoption. The Gentile Galatians might think, as the Jews were
under the law before their adoption, that so they, too, must first be
under the law. Paul, by anticipation, meets this objection by saying, YE
ARE sons, therefore ye need not be as children ([Gal
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#001)) under the tutorship of the law,
as being already in the free state of "sons" of God by faith in Christ
([Gal 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#026)), no longer in your nonage
(as "children," [Gal 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#001)). The Spirit
of God's only Begotten Son in your hearts, sent from, and leading you to
cry to, the Father, attests your sonship by adoption: for the Spirit is
the "earnest of your inheritance" ([Rom
8:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#015); [Eph
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#013)). "It is because ye are sons that
God sent forth" (the Greek requires this translation, not "hath sent
forth") into OUR (so the oldest manuscripts read for "your," in English
Version) hearts the Spirit of His son, crying, "Abba, Father" ([Joh
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012)). As in [Gal
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#005) he changed from "them," the third
person, to "we," the first person, so here he changes from "ye," the
second person, to "our," the first person: this he does to identify
their case as Gentiles, with his own and that of his believing fellow
countrymen, as Jews. In another point of view, though not the immediate
one intended by the context, this verse expresses, "Because ye are sons
(already in God's electing purpose of love), God sent forth the Spirit
of His Son into your hearts," &c.: God thus, by sending His Spirit in
due time, actually conferring that sonship which He already regarded as
a present reality ("are") because of His purpose, even before it was
actually fulfilled. So [Heb 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#013),
where "the children" are spoken of as existing in His purpose, before
their actual existence.

the Spirit of his Son--By faith ye are one with the Son, so that what is
His is yours; His Sonship ensures your sonship; His Spirit ensures for
you a share in the same. "If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he
is none of His" ([Rom 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#009)). Moreover,
as the Spirit of God proceeds from God the Father, so the Spirit of the
Son proceeds from the Son: so that the Holy Ghost, as the Creed says,
"proceedeth from the Father and the Son." The Father was not begotten:
the Son is begotten of the Father; the Holy Ghost proceeding from the
Father and the Son.

crying--Here the SPIRIT is regarded as the agent in praying, and the
believer as His organ. In [Rom 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#015),
"The Spirit of adoption" is said to be that whereby WE cry, "Abba,
Father"; but in [Rom 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#026), "The SPIRIT
ITSELF maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be
uttered." The believers' prayer is His prayer: hence arises its
acceptability with God.

Abba, Father--The Hebrew says, "Abba" (a Hebrew term), the Greek,
"Father" ("Pater," a Greek term in the original), both united together
in one Sonship and one cry of faith, "Abba, Father." So "Even so ('Nai,'
Greek) Amen (Hebrew)," both meaning the same ([Rev
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#007)). Christ's own former cry is the
believers' cry, "Abba, Father" ([Mar
14:36](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#036)).

[Galatians 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gal 4:7</span></span>

Wherefore--Conclusion inferred from [Gal
4:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#004).

thou--individualizing and applying the truth to each. Such an individual
appropriation of this comforting truth God grants in answer to them who
cry, "Abba, Father."

heir of God through Christ--The oldest manuscripts read, "an heir
through God." This combines on behalf of man, the whole before-mentioned
agency, of THE TRINITY: the Father sent His Son and the Spirit; the Son
has freed us from the law; the Spirit has completed our sonship. Thus
the redeemed are heirs THROUGH the Triune GOD, not through the law, nor
through fleshly descent \[WINDISCHMANN in ALFORD\]; ([Gal
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#018) confirms this).

heir--confirming [Gal 3:29](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#029); compare
[Rom 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#017).

[Galatians 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gal 4:8</span></span>

Appeal to them not to turn back from their privileges as free sons, to
legal bondage again.

then--when ye were "servants" ([Gal
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#007)).

ye knew not God--not opposed to [Rom
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#021). The heathen originally knew God,
as [Rom 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#021) states, but did not
choose to retain God in their knowledge, and so corrupted the original
truth. They might still have known Him, in a measure, from His works,
but as a matter of fact they knew Him not, so far as His eternity, His
power as the Creator, and His holiness, are concerned.

are no gods--that is, have no existence, such as their worshippers
attribute to them, in the nature of things, but only in the corrupt
imaginations of their worshippers (see on [Co1
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#004); [Co1
10:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#019); [Ch2
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#009)). Your "service" was a different
bondage from that of the Jews, which was a true service. Yet theirs,
like yours, was a burdensome yoke; how then is it ye wish to resume the
yoke after that God has transferred both Jews and Gentiles to a free
service?

[Galatians 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gal 4:9</span></span>

known God or rather are known of God--They did not first know and love
God, but God first, in His electing love, knew and loved them as His,
and therefore attracted them to the saving knowledge of Him ([Mat
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#023); [Co1
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#003); [Ti2
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#019); compare [Exo
33:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#012), [Exo
33:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#017); [Joh
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#016); [Phi
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#012)). God's great grace in this made
their fall from it the more heinous.

how--expressing indignant wonder at such a thing being possible, and
even actually occurring ([Gal 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#006)).
"How is it that ye turn back again?"

weak--powerless to justify: in contrast to the justifying power of faith
([Gal 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#024); compare [Heb
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#018)).

beggarly--contrasted with the riches of the inheritance of believers in
Christ ([Eph 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#018)). The state of the
"child" ([Gal 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#001)) is weak, as not
having attained manhood; "beggarly," as not having attained the
inheritance.

elements--"rudiments." It is as if a schoolmaster should go back to
learning the A, B, C'S \[BENGEL\].

again--There are two Greek words in the original. "Ye desire again,
beginning afresh, to be in bondage." Though the Galatians, as Gentiles,
had never been under the Mosaic yoke, yet they had been under "the
elements of the world" ([Gal 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#003)): the
common designation for the Jewish and Gentile systems alike, in contrast
to the Gospel (however superior the Jewish was to the Gentile). Both
systems consisted in outward worship and cleaved to sensible forms. Both
were in bondage to the elements of sense, as though these could give the
justification and sanctification which the inner and spiritual power of
God alone could bestow.

ye desire--or "will." Will-worship is not acceptable to God ([Col
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#018), [Col
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#023)).

[Galatians 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gal 4:10</span></span>

To regard the observance of certain days as in itself meritorious as a
work, is alien to the free spirit of Christianity. This is not
incompatible with observing the Sabbath or the Christian Lord's day as
obligatory, though not as a work (which was the Jewish and Gentile error
in the observance of days), but as a holy mean appointed by the Lord for
attaining the great end, holiness. The whole life alike belongs to the
Lord in the Gospel view, just as the whole world, and not the Jews only,
belong to Him. But as in Paradise, so now one portion of time is needed
wherein to draw off the soul more entirely from secular business to God
([Col 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#016)). "Sabbaths, new moons, and
set feasts" ([Ch1 23:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#031); [Ch2
31:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#003)), answer to "days, months,
times." "Months," however, may refer to the first and seventh months,
which were sacred on account of the number of feasts in them.

times--Greek, "seasons," namely, those of the three great feasts, the
Passover, Pentecost, and Tabernacles.

years--The sabbatical year was about the time of writing this Epistle,
A.D. 48 \[BENGEL\].

[Galatians 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gal 4:11</span></span>

lest--Greek, "lest haply." My fear is not for my own sake, but for
yours.

[Galatians 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gal 4:12</span></span>

be as I am--"As I have in my life among you cast off Jewish habits, so
do ye; for I am become as ye are," namely, in the non-observance of
legal ordinances. "The fact of my laying them aside among Gentiles,
shows that I regard them as not at all contributing to justification or
sanctification. Do you regard them in the same light, and act
accordingly." His observing the law among the Jews was not inconsistent
with this, for he did so only in order to win them, without compromising
principle. On the other hand, the Galatian Gentiles, by adopting legal
ordinances, showed that they regarded them as needful for salvation.
This Paul combats.

ye have not injured me at all--namely, at the period when I first
preached the Gospel among you, and when I made myself as you are,
namely, living as a Gentile, not as a Jew. You at that time did me no
wrong; "ye did not despise my temptation in the flesh" ([Gal
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#014)): nay, you "received me as an
angel of God." Then in [Gal 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#016), he
asks, "Have I then, since that time, become your enemy by telling you
the truth?"

[Galatians 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gal 4:13</span></span>

how through infirmity--rather, as Greek, "Ye know that because of an
infirmity of my flesh I preached," &c. He implies that bodily sickness,
having detained him among them, contrary to his original intentions, was
the occasion of his preaching the Gospel to them.

at the first--literally, "at the former time"; implying that at the time
of writing he had been twice in Galatia. See my Introduction; also see
on [Gal 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#016), and [Gal
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#021). His sickness was probably the
same as recurred more violently afterward, "the thorn in the flesh"
([Co2 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#007)), which also was overruled
to good ([Co2 12:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#009)), as the
"infirmity of the flesh" here.

[Galatians 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gal 4:14</span></span>

my temptation--The oldest manuscripts read, "your temptation." My
infirmity, which was, or might have been, a "temptation," or trial, to
you, ye despised not, that is, ye were not tempted by it to despise me
and my message. Perhaps, however, it is better to punctuate and explain
as LACHMANN, connecting it with [Gal
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#013), "And (ye know) your temptation
(that is, the temptation to which ye were exposed through the infirmity)
which was in my flesh. Ye despised not (through natural pride), nor
rejected (through spiritual pride), but received me," &c. "Temptation
does not mean here, as we now use the word, tendency to an evil habit,
but BODILY TRIAL."

as an angel of God--as a heaven-inspired and sent messenger from God:
angel means "messenger" ([Mal 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#007)).
Compare the phrase, [Sa2 19:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#027), a
Hebrew and Oriental one for a person to be received with the highest
respect ([Zac 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#008)). An angel is free
from the flesh, infirmity, and temptation.

as Christ--being Christ's representative ([Mat
10:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#040)). Christ is Lord of angels.

[Galatians 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gal 4:15</span></span>

Where, &c.--Of what value was your congratulation (so the Greek for
"blessedness" expresses) of yourselves, on account of your having among
you me, the messenger of the Gospel, considering how entirely you have
veered about since? Once you counted yourselves blessed in being favored
with my ministry.

ye would have plucked out your own eyes--one of the dearest members of
the body--so highly did you value me: a proverbial phrase for the
greatest self-sacrifice ([Mat 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#029)).
CONYBEARE and HOWSON think that this particular form of proverb was used
with reference to a weakness in Paul's eyes, connected with a nervous
frame, perhaps affected by the brightness of the vision described, [Act
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#011); [Co2
12:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#001). "You would have torn out your
own eyes to supply the lack of mine." The divine power of Paul's words
and works, contrasting with the feebleness of his person ([Co2
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#010)), powerfully at first impressed
the Galatians, who had all the impulsiveness of the Celtic race from
which they sprang. Subsequently they soon changed with the fickleness
which is equally characteristic of Celts.

[Galatians 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gal 4:16</span></span>

Translate, "Am I then become your enemy (an enemy in your eyes) by
telling you the truth" ([Gal 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#005), [Gal
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#014))? He plainly did not incur their
enmity at his first visit, and the words here imply that he had since
then, and before his now writing, incurred it: so that the occasion of
his telling them the unwelcome truth, must have been at his second visit
([Act 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#023), see my Introduction). The
fool and sinner hate a reprover. The righteous love faithful reproof
([Psa 141:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#005); [Pro
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#008)).

[Galatians 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">gal 4:17</span></span>

They--your flatterers: in contrast to Paul himself, who tells them the
truth.

zealously--zeal in proselytism was characteristic especially of the
Jews, and so of Judaizers ([Gal 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#014);
[Mat 23:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#015); [Rom
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#002)).

affect you--that is, court you ([Co2
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#002)).

not well--not in a good way, or for a good end. Neither the cause of
their zealous courting of you, nor the manner, is what it ought to be.

they would exclude you--"They wish to shut you out" from the kingdom of
God (that is, they wish to persuade you that as uncircumcised Gentiles,
you are shut out from it), "that ye may zealously court them," that is,
become circumcised, as zealous followers of themselves. ALFORD explains
it, that their wish was to shut out the Galatians from the general
community, and attract them as a separate clique to their own party. So
the English word "exclusive," is used.

[Galatians 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">gal 4:18</span></span>

good to be zealously affected--rather, to correspond to "zealously
court" in [Gal 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#018), "to be zealously
courted." I do not find fault with them for zealously courting you, nor
with you for being zealously courted: provided it be "in a good cause"
(translate so), "it is a good thing" ([Co1
9:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#020)). My reason for saying the
"not well" ([Gal 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#017); the Greek is
the same as that for "good," and "in a good cause," in [Gal
4:28](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#028)), is that their zealous courting
of you is not in a good cause. The older interpreters, however, support
English Version (compare [Gal 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#014)).

always--Translate and arrange the words thus, "At all times, and not
only when I am present with you." I do not desire that I exclusively
should have the privilege of zealously courting you. Others may do so in
my absence with my full approval, if only it be in a good cause, and if
Christ be faithfully preached ([Phi
1:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#015)).

[Galatians 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">gal 4:19</span></span>

My little children-- ([Ti1 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#018); [Ti2
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#001); [Jo1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#001)). My relation to you is not merely
that of one zealously courting you ([Gal
4:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#017)), but that of a father to his
children ([Co1 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#015)).

I travail in birth--that is, like a mother in pain till the birth of her
child.

again--a second time. The former time was when I was "present with you"
([Gal 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#018); compare Note, see on [Gal
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#013)).

Christ be formed in you--that you may live nothing but Christ, and think
nothing but Christ ([Gal 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#020)), and
glory in nothing but Him, and His death, resurrection, and righteousness
([Phi 3:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#008); [Col
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#027)).

[Galatians 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">gal 4:20</span></span>

Translate as Greek, "I could wish." If circumstances permitted (which
they do not), I would gladly be with you \[M. STUART\].

now--as I was twice already. Speaking face to face is so much more
effective towards loving persuasion than writing ([Jo2
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#012); [Jo3
1:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#013)).

change my voice--as a mother ([Gal
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#019)): adapting my tone of voice to
what I saw in person your case might need. This is possible to one
present, but not to one in writing \[GROTIUS and ESTIUS\].

I stand in doubt of you--rather, "I am perplexed about you," namely, how
to deal with you, what kind of words to use, gentle or severe, to bring
you back to the right path.

[Galatians 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">gal 4:21</span></span>

desire--of your own accord madly courting that which must condemn and
ruin you.

do ye not hear--do ye not consider the mystic sense of Moses' words?
\[GROTIUS\]. The law itself sends you away from itself to Christ
\[ESTIUS\]. After having sufficiently maintained his point by argument,
the apostle confirms and illustrates it by an inspired allegorical
exposition of historical facts, containing in them general laws and
types. Perhaps his reason for using allegory was to confute the
Judaizers with their own weapons: subtle, mystical, allegorical
interpretations, unauthorized by the Spirit, were their favorite
arguments, as of the Rabbins in the synagogues. Compare the Jerusalem
Talmud \[Tractatu Succa, cap. Hechalil\]. Paul meets them with an
allegorical exposition, not the work of fancy, but sanctioned by the
Holy Spirit. History, if properly understood contains in its complicated
phenomena, simple and continually recurring divine laws. The history of
the elect people, like their legal ordinances, had, besides the literal,
a typical meaning (compare [Co1
10:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#001); [Co1
15:45](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#045), [Co1
15:47](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#047); [Rev
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#008)). Just as the
extra-ordinarily-born Isaac, the gift of grace according to promise,
supplanted, beyond all human calculations, the naturally-born Ishmael,
so the new theocratic race, the spiritual seed of Abraham by promise,
the Gentile, as well as Jewish believers, were about to take the place
of the natural seed, who had imagined that to them exclusively belonged
the kingdom of God.

[Galatians 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">gal 4:22</span></span>

([Gen 16:3-16](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#003); [Gen
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#002)).

Abraham--whose sons ye wish to be (compare [Rom
9:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#007)).

a bond maid . . . a free woman--rather, as Greek, "the bond maid . . .
the free woman."

[Galatians 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">gal 4:23</span></span>

after the flesh--born according to the usual course of nature: in
contrast to Isaac, who was born "by virtue of the promise" (so the
Greek), as the efficient cause of Sarah's becoming pregnant out of the
course of nature ([Rom 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#019)). Abraham
was to lay aside all confidence in the flesh (after which Ishmael was
born), and to live by faith alone in the promise (according to which
Isaac was miraculously born, contrary to all calculations of flesh and
blood).

[Galatians 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">gal 4:24</span></span>

are an allegory--rather, "are allegorical," that is, have another
besides the literal meaning.

these are the two covenants--"these \[women\] are (that is, mean; omit
'the' with all the oldest manuscripts) two covenants." As among the Jews
the bondage of the mother determined that of the child, the children of
the free covenant of promise, answering to Sarah, are free; the children
of the legal covenant of bondage are not so.

one from--that is, taking his origin from Mount Sinai. Hence, it
appears, he is treating of the moral law ([Gal
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#019)) chiefly ([Heb
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#018)). Paul was familiar with the
district of Sinai in Arabia ([Gal
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#017)), having gone thither after his
conversion. At the gloomy scene of the giving of the Law, he learned to
appreciate, by contrast, the grace of the Gospel, and so to cast off all
his past legal dependencies.

which gendereth--that is, bringing forth children unto bondage. Compare
the phrase ([Act 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#025)), "children of
the covenant which God made . . . saying unto Abraham."

Agar--that is, Hagar.

[Galatians 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">gal 4:25</span></span>

Translate, "For this word, Hagar, is (imports) Mount Sinai in Arabia
(that is, among the Arabians--in the Arabian tongue)." So CHRYSOSTOM
explains. Haraut, the traveller, says that to this day the Arabians call
Sinai, "Hadschar," that is, Hagar, meaning a rock or stone. Hagar twice
fled into the desert of Arabia (Gen. 16:1-16; [Gen
21:9-21](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#009)): from her the mountain and
city took its name, and the people were called Hagarenes. Sinai, with
its rugged rocks, far removed from the promised land, was well suited to
represent the law which inspires with terror, and the spirit of bondage.

answereth--literally, "stands in the same rank with"; "she corresponds
to."

Jerusalem which now is--that is, the Jerusalem of the Jews, having only
a present temporary existence, in contrast with the spiritual Jerusalem
of the Gospel, which in germ, under the form of the promise, existed
ages before, and shall be for ever in ages to come.

and--The oldest manuscripts read, "For she is in bondage." As Hagar was
in bondage to her mistress, so Jerusalem that now is, is in bondage to
the law, and also to the Romans: her civil state thus being in
accordance with her spiritual state \[BENGEL\].

[Galatians 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">gal 4:26</span></span>

This verse stands instead of the sentence which we should expect, to
correspond to [Gal 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#024), "One from
Mount Sinai," namely, the other covenant from the heavenly mount above,
which is (answers in the allegory to) Sarah.

Jerusalem . . . above-- ([Heb 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#022)),
"the heavenly Jerusalem." "New Jerusalem, which cometh down out of
heaven from my God" ([Rev 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#012); [Rev
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#002)). Here "the Messianic theocracy,
which before Christ's second appearing is the Church, and after it,
Christ's kingdom of glory" \[MEYER\].

free--as Sarah was; opposed to "she is in bondage" ([Gal
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#025)).

all--omitted in many of the oldest manuscripts, though supported by
some. "Mother of us," namely, believers who are already members of the
invisible Church, the heavenly Jerusalem, hereafter to be manifested
([Heb 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#022)).

[Galatians 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">gal 4:27</span></span>

([Isa 54:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#001)).

thou barren--Jerusalem above: the spiritual Church of the Gospel, the
fruit of "the promise," answering to Sarah, who bore not "after the
flesh": as contrasted with the law, answering to Hagar, who was fruitful
in the ordinary course of nature. Isaiah speaks primarily of Israel's
restoration after her long-continued calamities; but his language is
framed by the Holy Spirit so as to reach beyond this to the spiritual
Zion: including not only the Jews, the natural descendants of Abraham
and children of the law, but also the Gentiles. The spiritual Jerusalem
is regarded as "barren" while the law trammeled Israel, for she then had
no spiritual children of the Gentiles.

break forth--into crying.

cry--shout for joy.

many more--Translate as Greek, "Many are the children of the desolate
(the New Testament Church made up in the greater part from the Gentiles,
who once had not the promise, and so was destitute of God as her
husband), more than of her which hath an (Greek, 'THE') husband (the
Jewish Church having GOD for her husband, [Isa
54:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#005); [Jer
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#002))." Numerous as were the children
of the legal covenant, those of the Gospel covenant are more so. The
force of the Greek article is, "Her who has THE husband of which the
other is destitute."

[Galatians 4:28](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">gal 4:28</span></span>

we--The oldest manuscripts and versions are divided between "we" and
"ye." "We" better accords with [Gal
4:26](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#026), "mother of us."

children of promise--not children after the flesh, but through the
promise ([Gal 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#023), [Gal
4:29](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#029), [Gal
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#031)). "We are" so, and ought to wish
to continue so.

[Galatians 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">gal 4:29</span></span>

persecuted--Ishmael "mocked" Isaac, which contained in it the germ and
spirit of persecution ([Gen 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#009)). His
mocking was probably directed against Isaac's piety and faith in God's
promises. Being the older by natural birth, he haughtily prided himself
above him that was born by promise: as Cain hated Abel's piety.

him . . . born after the Spirit--The language, though referring
primarily to Isaac, born in a spiritual way (namely, by the promise or
word of God, rendered by His Spirit efficient out of the course of
nature, in making Sarah fruitful in old age), is so framed as especially
to refer to believers justified by Gospel grace through faith, as
opposed to carnal men, Judaizers, and legalists.

even so it is now-- ([Gal 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#011); [Gal
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#012), [Gal
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#017); [Act
9:29](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#029); [Act
13:45](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#045), [Act
13:49-50](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#049); [Act
14:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#001), [Act
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#019); [Act
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#005), [Act
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#013); [Act
18:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#005)). The Jews persecuted Paul, not
for preaching Christianity in opposition to heathenism, but for
preaching it as distinct from Judaism. Except in the two cases of
Philippi and Ephesus (where the persons beginning the assault were
pecuniarily interested in his expulsion), he was nowhere set upon by the
Gentiles, unless they were first stirred up by the Jews. The coincidence
between Paul's Epistles and Luke's history (the Acts) in this respect,
is plainly undesigned, and so a proof of genuineness (see PALEY,
HorÃ&brvbr; PaulinÃ&brvbr;).

[Galatians 4:30](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">gal 4:30</span></span>

[Gen 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#010), [Gen
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#012), where Sarah's words are, "shall
not be heir with my son, even with Isaac." But what was there said
literally, is here by inspiration expressed in its allegorical spiritual
import, applying to the New Testament believer, who is antitypically
"the son of the free woman." In [Joh
8:35-36](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#035), Jesus refers to this.

Cast out--from the house and inheritance: literally, Ishmael;
spiritually, the carnal and legalists.

shall not be heir--The Greek is stronger, "must not be heir," or
"inherit."

[Galatians 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">gal 4:31</span></span>

So then--The oldest manuscripts read, "Wherefore." This is the
conclusion inferred from what precedes. In [Gal
3:29](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#029) and [Gal
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#007), it was established that we, New
Testament believers, are "heirs." If, then, we are heirs, "we are not
children of the bond woman (whose son, according to Scripture, was 'not
to be heir,' [Gal 4:30](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#030)), but of the
free woman (whose son was, according to Scripture, to be heir). For we
are not "cast out" as Ishmael, but accepted as sons and heirs.
