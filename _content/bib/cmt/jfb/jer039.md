### [Jeremiah Chapter 39](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 39:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 39:1</span></span>

JERUSALEM TAKEN. ZEDEKIAH'S FATE. JEREMIAH CARED FOR. EBED-MELECH
ASSURED. (Jer. 39:1-18)

ninth year . . . tenth month--and on the tenth day of it ([Jer
52:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#004); [Kg2
25:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#001)). From [Jer
39:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#002), "eleventh year . . . fourth
month . . . ninth day," we know the siege lasted one and a half years,
excepting the suspension of it caused by Pharaoh. Nebuchadnezzar was
present in the beginning of the siege, but was at Riblah at its close
([Jer 39:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#003), [Jer
39:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#006); compare [Jer
38:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#017)).

[Jeremiah 39:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 39:3</span></span>

sat--expressing military occupation or encampment.

middle gate--the gate from the upper city (comprehending Mount Zion) to
the lower city (north of the former and much lower); it was into the
latter (the north side) that the Chaldeans forced an entry and took up
their position opposite the gate of the "middle" wall, between the lower
and upper city. Zedekiah fled in the opposite, that is, the south
direction ([Jer 39:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#004)).

Nergalsharezer, Samgarnebo--proper names formed from those of the idols,
Nergal and Nebo ([Kg2 17:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#030); [Isa
46:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#001)).

Rab-saris--meaning "chief of the eunuchs."

Rab-mag--chief of the magi; brought with the expedition in order that
its issue might be foreknown through his astrological skill. Mag is a
Persian word, meaning "great," "powerful." The magi were a sacerdotal
caste among the Medes, and supported the Zoroastrian religion.

[Jeremiah 39:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 39:4</span></span>

the king's garden--The "gate" to it from the upper, city above was
appropriated to the kings alone; stairs" led down from Mount Zion and
the palace to the king's garden below ([Neh
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#015)).

two walls--Zedekiah might have held the upper city longer, but want of
provisions drove him to flee by the double wall south of Zion, towards
the plains of Jericho ([Jer 39:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#005)), in
order to escape beyond Jordan to Arabia-Deserta. He broke an opening in
the wall to get out ([Eze 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#012)).

[Jeremiah 39:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 39:5</span></span>

Riblah--north of Palestine (see [Jer
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#014); [Num
34:11](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#011)). Hamath is identified by
commentators with Antioch, in Syria, on the Orontes, called Epiphania,
from Antiochus Epiphanes.

gave judgment upon him--literally, "spake judgments with him," that is,
brought him to trial as a common criminal, not as a king. He had
violated his oath ([Eze 17:13-19](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#013); [Ch2
36:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#013)).

[Jeremiah 39:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 39:6</span></span>

slew . . . sons . . . before his eyes--previous to his eyes being "put
out" ([Jer 39:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#007)); literally, "dug
out." The Assyrian sculptures depict the delight with which the kings
struck out, often with their own hands, the eyes of captive princes.
This passage reconciles [Jer 32:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#004),
"his eyes shall behold his eyes"; with [Eze
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#013), "he shall not see Babylon,
though he shall die there."

slew all . . . nobles-- ([Jer 27:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#020)).

[Jeremiah 39:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 39:8</span></span>

burned . . . the houses-- ([Jer
52:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#012)). Not immediately after the
taking of the city, but in the month after, namely, the fifth month
(compare [Jer 39:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#002)). The delay was
probably caused by the princes having to send to Riblah to know the
king's pleasure as to the city.

[Jeremiah 39:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 39:9</span></span>

remnant--excepting the poorest ([Jer
39:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#010)), who caused Nebuchadnezzar no
apprehensions.

those . . . that fell to him--the deserters were distrusted; or they may
have been removed at their own request, lest the people should vent
their rage on them as traitors, after the departure of the Chaldeans.

rest . . . that remained--distinct from the previous "remnant"; there he
means the remnant of those besieged in the city, whom Nebuchadnezzar
spared; here, those scattered through various districts of the country
which had not been besieged \[CALVIN\].

[Jeremiah 39:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 39:10</span></span>

left . . . the poor . . . which had nothing--The poor have least to
lose; one of the providential compensations of their lot. They who
before had been stripped of their possessions by the wealthier Jews
obtain, not only their own, but those of others.

[Jeremiah 39:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 39:11</span></span>

Jeremiah's prophecies were known to Nebuchadnezzar through deserters
([Jer 39:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#009); [Jer
38:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#019)), also through the Jews carried
to Babylon with Jeconiah (compare [Jer
40:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#002)). Hence the king's kindness to
him.

[Jeremiah 39:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 39:12</span></span>

look well to him--Hebrew, "set thine eyes upon him"; provide for his
well-being.

[Jeremiah 39:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 39:13</span></span>

Nebuzara-dan . . . sent--He was then at Ramah ([Jer
40:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#001)).

[Jeremiah 39:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 39:14</span></span>

Gedaliah--son of Ahikam, the former supporter of Jeremiah ([Jer
26:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#024)). Gedaliah was the chief of the
deserters to the Chaldeans, and was set over the remnant in Judea as one
likely to remain faithful to Nebuchadnezzar. His residence was at Mizpah
([Jer 40:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#005)).

home--the house of Gedaliah, wherein Jeremiah might remain as in a safe
asylum. As in [Jer 40:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#001) Jeremiah is
represented as "bound in chains" when he came to Ramah among the
captives to be carried to Babylon, this release of Jeremiah is thought
by MAURER to be distinct from that in [Jer
40:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#005). But he seems first to have
been released from the court of the prison and to have been taken to
Ramah, still in chains, and then committed in freedom to Gedaliah.

dwelt among the people--that is, was made free.

[Jeremiah 39:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 39:15</span></span>

Belonging to the time when the city was not yet taken, and when Jeremiah
was still in the court of the prison ([Jer
38:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#013)). This passage is inserted here
because it was now that Ebed-melech's good act ([Jer
38:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#007); [Mat
25:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#043)) was to be rewarded in his
deliverance.

[Jeremiah 39:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 39:16</span></span>

Go--not literally, for he was in confinement, but figuratively.

before thee--in thy sight.

[Jeremiah 39:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 39:17</span></span>

the men of whom thou art afraid-- ([Jer
38:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#001), [Jer
38:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#004)). The courtiers and princes
hostile to thee for having delivered Jeremiah shall have no power to
hurt. Heretofore intrepid, he was now afraid; this prophecy was
therefore the more welcome to him.

[Jeremiah 39:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 39:18</span></span>

life . . . for a prey--(See on [Jer
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#009); [Jer
38:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#002); [Jer
45:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer045.htm#005)).

put . . . trust in me-- ([Jer 38:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#007)).
Trust in God was the root of his fearlessness of the wrath of men, in
his humanity to the prophet ([Ch1
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#020); [Psa
37:40](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#040)). The "life" he thus risked was
to be his reward, being spared beyond all hope, when the lives of his
enemies should be forfeited ("for a prey").
