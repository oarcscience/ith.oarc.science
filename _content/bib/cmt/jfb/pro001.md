### [Proverbs Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#001)

[Proverbs 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 1:1</span></span>

After the title the writer defines the design and nature of the
instructions of the book. He paternally invites attention to those
instructions and warns his readers against the enticements of the
wicked. In a beautiful personification, wisdom is then introduced in a
most solemn and impressive manner, publicly inviting men to receive its
teachings, warning those who reject, and encouraging those who accept,
the proffered instructions. (Pro. 1:1-33)

[Proverbs 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 1:2</span></span>

To know . . . instruction--literally, "for knowing," that is, such is
the design of these writings.

wisdom--or the use of the best means for the best ends, is generally
employed in this book for true piety.

instruction--discipline, by which men are trained.

to perceive--literally, "for perceiving," the design (as above)

understanding--that is, words which enable one to discern good and evil.

[Proverbs 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 1:3</span></span>

To receive . . . of wisdom--For receiving that discipline which
discretion imparts. The Hebrew for "wisdom" differs from that of [Pro
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#002), and denotes rather discreet
counsel. Compare the opposite traits of the fool ([Pro
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#022)).

justice . . . equity--all the attributes of one upright in all his
relations to God and man.

[Proverbs 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 1:4</span></span>

simple--one easily led to good or evil; so the parallel.

young man--one inexperienced.

subtilty--or prudence ([Pro 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#021); [Pro
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#021)).

discretion--literally, "device," both qualities, either good or bad,
according to their use. Here good, as they imply wariness by which to
escape evil and find good.

[Proverbs 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 1:5</span></span>

Such writings the wise, who pursue right ends by right means, will
value.

learning--not the act, but matter of it.

wise counsels--or the art and principles of governing.

[Proverbs 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 1:6</span></span>

To understand--so as to . . . such will be the result.

interpretation--(Compare Margin).

words of the wise--(Compare [Pro 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#002)).

dark sayings--(Compare [Psa 49:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#004); [Joh
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#025); and see Introduction, Part I).

[Proverbs 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 1:7</span></span>

The fear of the Lord--the principle of true piety (compare [Pro
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#005); [Pro
14:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#026); [Job
28:28](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#028); [Psa
34:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#011); [Psa
111:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#010); [Act
9:31](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#031)).

beginning--first part, foundation.

fools--the stupid and indifferent to God's character and government;
hence the wicked.

[Proverbs 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 1:8</span></span>

My son--This paternal form denotes a tender regard for the reader.
Filial sentiments rank next to piety towards God, and ensure most
distinguished rewards (compare [Pro
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#020); [Eph
6:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#002)).

[Proverbs 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 1:9</span></span>

On the figures of [Pro 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#009), compare
[Gen 41:42](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#042); [Sol
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#010); [Sol
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#009).

[Proverbs 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 1:10</span></span>

A solemn warning against temptation.

entice--literally, "open the way."

consent . . . not--Sin is in consenting or yielding to temptation, not
in being tempted.

[Proverbs 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 1:11</span></span>

Murder and robbery are given as specific illustrations.

lay wait . . . lurk privily--express an effort and hope for successful
concealment.

swallow . . . grave--utterly destroy the victim and traces of the crime
([Num 16:33](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#033); [Psa
55:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#015)). Abundant rewards of villainy
are promised as the fruits of this easy and safe course.

[Proverbs 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 1:15</span></span>

The society of the wicked (way or path) is dangerous. Avoid the
beginnings of sin ([Pro 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#014); [Psa
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001); [Psa
119:101](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#101)).

[Proverbs 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 1:17</span></span>

Men warned ought to escape danger as birds instinctively avoid visibly
spread nets. But stupid sinners rush to their own ruin ([Psa
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#016)), and, greedy of gain, succeed in
the very schemes which destroy them ([Ti1
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#010)), not only failing to catch
others, but procuring their own destruction.

[Proverbs 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pro 1:20</span></span>

Some interpreters regard this address as the language of the Son of God
under the name of Wisdom (compare [Luk
11:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#049)). Others think that wisdom, as
the divine attribute specially employed in acts of counsel and
admonition, is here personified, and represents God. In either case the
address is a most solemn and divine admonition, whose matter and spirit
are eminently evangelical and impressive (see on [Pro
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#001)).

Wisdom--literally, "Wisdoms," the plural used either because of the
unusual sense, or as indicative of the great excellency of wisdom
(compare [Pro 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#001)).

streets--or most public places, not secretly.

[Proverbs 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#021)

common resort.

simple ones--(Compare [Pro 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#004)).

simplicity--implying ignorance.

scorners-- ([Psa 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)) --who despise,
as well as reject, truth.

fools--Though a different word is used from that of [Pro
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#007), yet it is of the same meaning.

[Proverbs 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 1:23</span></span>

reproof--implying conviction deserving it (compare [Joh
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#008), Margin).

pour out--abundantly impart.

my spirit--whether of wisdom personified, or of Christ, a divine agent.

[Proverbs 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 1:24</span></span>

stretched . . . hand--Earnestness, especially in beseeching, is denoted
by the figure (compare [Job 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#013);
[Psa 68:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#031); [Psa
88:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#009)).

[Proverbs 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">pro 1:25</span></span>

set at naught--rejected as of no value.

would none of--literally, "were not willing or inclined to it."

[Proverbs 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">pro 1:26</span></span>

In their extreme distress He will not only refuse help, but aggravate it
by derision.

[Proverbs 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 1:27</span></span>

fear--the object of it.

desolation--literally, "a tumultuous noise," denoting their utter
confusion.

destruction--or calamity ([Pro 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#026))
compared to a whirlwind, as to fatal rapidity.

distress-- ([Psa 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#001); [Psa
44:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#011)).

anguish--a state of inextricable oppression, the deepest despair.

[Proverbs 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">pro 1:28</span></span>

Now no prayers or most diligent seeking will avail ([Pro
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#017)).

[Proverbs 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">pro 1:29</span></span>

The sinner's infatuated rejection brings his ruin.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">pro 1:31</span></span>

fruit . . . way--result of conduct ([Isa
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#010); [Eze

6:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#021); [Gal
6:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#007)).

be filled--even to repletion ([Psa
123:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa123.htm#004)).

[Proverbs 1:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">pro 1:32</span></span>

turning away--that is, from the call of [Pro
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#023).

simple--as in [Pro 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#022).

prosperity--quiet, implying indifference.

[Proverbs 1:33](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#033)
