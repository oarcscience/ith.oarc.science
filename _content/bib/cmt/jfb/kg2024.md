[4 Kings (2 Kings) 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 24:1</span></span>

JEHOIAKIM PROCURES HIS OWN RUIN. ([Kg2
24:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#001))

Nebuchadnezzar--the son of Nabopolassar, the founder of the Chaldee
monarchy. This invasion took place in the fourth year of Jehoiakim's,
and the first of Nebuchadnezzar's reign ([Jer
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#001); compare [Jer
46:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#002)). The young king of Assyria being
probably detained at home on account of his father's demise, despatched,
along with the Chaldean troops on his border, an army composed of the
tributary nations that were contiguous to Judea, to chastise Jehoiakim's
revolt from his yoke. But this hostile band was only an instrument in
executing the divine judgment ([Kg2
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#002)) denounced by the prophets
against Judah for the sins of the people; and hence, though marching by
the orders of the Assyrian monarch, they are described as sent by the
Lord ([Kg2 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#003)).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg2 24:4</span></span>

the Lord would not pardon--(see on [Kg2
23:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#026); [Jer
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#001)).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg2 24:6</span></span>

Jehoiakim slept with his fathers--This phraseology can mean nothing more
than that he died; for he was not buried with his royal ancestors; and
whether he fell in battle, or his body was subjected to posthumous
insults, he was, according to the prediction ([Jer
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#019)), not honored with the rites of
sepulture ([Jer 36:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#030)).

Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead--The very brief reign of this
prince, which lasted only three months, during which he was a humble
vassal of the Assyrians, is scarcely deserving to be taken into account,
and therefore is in no way contradictory to the prophetic menace
denounced against his father ([Jer
36:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#030)).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg2 24:7</span></span>

the king of Egypt--that is, Pharaoh-nechoh.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 24:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 24:8</span></span>

JEHOIACHIN SUCCEEDS HIM. ([Kg2 24:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#008))

Jehoiachin--that is, "God-appointed," contracted into Jeconiah and
Coniah ([Jer 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#024)).

eighteen years old when he began to reign--At the age of eight his
father took him into partnership in the government ([Ch2
36:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#009)). He began to reign alone at
eighteen.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 24:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg2 24:9</span></span>

he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord--Untaught by
experience, and deaf to the prophetic warnings, he pursued the evil
courses which had brought so many disasters upon the royal family as
well as the people of Judah. This bad character is figuratively but
strongly depicted ([Eze 19:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#005)).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 24:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg2 24:10</span></span>

JERUSALEM TAKEN. ([Kg2 24:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#010))

At that time--within three months after his accession to the throne. It
was the spring of the year ([Ch2
36:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#010)); so early did he indicate a
feeling hostile to the interests of his Assyrian liege lord, by forming
a league with Egypt. Nebuchadnezzar sent his generals to besiege
Jerusalem, as Jeremiah had foretold ([Jer
22:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#028); [Jer
34:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#020)), and soon after he followed in
person. Convinced of the hopelessness of making any effectual
resistance, Jehoiachin, going to the camp of the besiegers, surrendered
([Kg2 24:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#012)), in the expectation,
probably, of being allowed to retain his throne as a vassal of the
Assyrian empire. But Nebuchadnezzar's clemency towards the kings of
Judah was now exhausted, so that Jehoiachin was sent as a captive to
Babylon, according to Jeremiah's prediction ([Jer
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#024)), accompanied by the queen
mother (the same who had held that dignity under Jehoahaz) ([Kg2
23:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#031)), his generals, and officers.
This happened in the eighth year of Nebuchadnezzar's reign, computing
from the time when he was associated with his father in the government.
Those that were left consisted chiefly of the poorer sort of people and
the unskilled workmen. The palace and the temple were ransacked. The
smaller golden vessels had been taken on the first capture of Jerusalem
and placed by Nebuchadnezzar in the temple of his god as tokens of
victory. They were used by Belshazzar at his impious feast \[[Dan
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#002)\], for the purpose of rewarding
his army with these trophies, among which were probably the golden
candlesticks, the ark, &c. (compare [Ch2
36:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#007); [Dan
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#002)). Now the gold plating was torn
off all the larger temple furniture.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 24:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg2 24:13</span></span>

as the Lord had said--(compare [Kg2
20:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#017); [Isa
39:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#006); [Jer
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#013); [Jer
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#003)). The elite of the nation for
rank, usefulness, and moral worth, all who might be useful in Babylon or
dangerous in Palestine, were carried off to Babylon, to the number of
ten thousand ([Kg2 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#014)). These are
specified ([Kg2 24:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#015)), warriors,
seven thousand; craftsmen and smiths, one thousand; king's wives,
officers, and princes, also priests and prophets ([Jer
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#001); [Eze
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001)), two thousand; equal to ten
thousand captives in all.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg2 24:17</span></span>

ZEDEKIAH'S EVIL REIGN. ([Kg2 24:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#017))

the king of Babylon made Mattaniah, his father's brother, king in his
stead--Adhering to his former policy of maintaining a show of monarchy,
Nebuchadnezzar appointed the third and youngest son of Josiah ([Ch1
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#015)), full brother of Jehoahaz, and
uncle of the captive Jehoiachin. But, according to the custom of
conquerors, who changed the names of the great men they took captives in
war, in token of their supremacy, he gave him the new name of

Zedekiah--that is, "The righteous of God." This being a purely Hebrew
name, it seems that he allowed the puppet king to choose his own name,
which was confirmed. His heart towards God was the same as that of
Jehoiakim, impenitent and heedless of God's word.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 24:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg2 24:20</span></span>

through the anger of the Lord . . . he cast them out from his
presence--that is, in the course of God's righteous providence, his
policy as king would prove ruinous to his country.

Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon--instigated by ambassadors
from the neighboring states who came to congratulate him on his
ascension to the throne (compare [Jer
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#003), with [Jer
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#001)), and at the same time get him to
join them in a common league to throw off the Assyrian yoke. Though
warned by Jeremiah against this step, the infatuated and perjured ([Eze
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#013)) Zedekiah persisted in his
revolt.
