ESTHER derives its name from the Jewess, who, having become wife of the
king of Persia, employed her royal influence to effect a memorable
deliverance for the persecuted Church of God. Various opinions are
embraced and supported as to the authorship of this book, some ascribing
it to Ezra, to Nehemiah, or to Mordecai. The preponderance of
authorities is in favor of the last. The historical character of the
book is undoubted, since, besides many internal evidences, its
authenticity is proved by the strong testimony of the feast of Purim,
the celebration of which can be traced up to the events which are
described in this book. Its claim, however, to canonical authority has
been questioned on the ground that the name of God does not once occur
in it. But the uniform tradition both of the Jewish and the Christian
Churches supports this claim, which nothing in the book tends to shake;
while it is a record of the superintending care of divine providence
over his chosen people, with which it is of the utmost importance the
Church should be furnished. The name of God is strangely enough omitted,
but the presence of God is felt throughout the history; and the whole
tone and tendency of the book is so decidedly subservient to the honor
of God and the cause of true religion that it has been generally
received by the Church in all ages into the sacred canon.
