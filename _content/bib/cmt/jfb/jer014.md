### [Jeremiah Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 14:1</span></span>

PROPHECIES ON THE OCCASION OF A DROUGHT SENT IN JUDGMENT ON JUDEA. (Jer.
14:1-22)

Literally, "That which was the word of Jehovah to Jeremiah concerning
the dearth"

drought--literally, the "withholdings," namely, of rain ([Deu
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#017); [Ch2
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#013)). This word should be used
especially of the withholding of rain because rain is in those regions
of all things the one chiefly needed ([Jer
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#008), Margin).

[Jeremiah 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 14:2</span></span>

gates--The place of public concourse in each city looks sad, as being no
longer frequented ([Isa 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#026); [Isa
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#004)).

black--that is, they mourn (blackness being indicative of sorrow), ([Jer
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#021)).

unto the ground--bowing towards it.

cry--of distress ([Sa1 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#012); [Isa
24:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#011)).

[Jeremiah 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 14:3</span></span>

little ones--rather, "their inferiors," that is, domestics.

pits--cisterns for collecting rain water, often met with in the East
where there are no springs.

covered . . . heads-- ([Sa2 15:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#030)). A
sign of humiliation and mourning.

[Jeremiah 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 14:5</span></span>

The brute creation is reduced to the utmost extremity for the want of
food. The "hind," famed for her affection to her young, abandons them.

[Jeremiah 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 14:6</span></span>

wild asses--They repair to "the high places" most exposed to the winds,
which they "snuff in" to relieve their thirst.

dragons--jackals \[HENDERSON\].

eyes--which are usually most keen in detecting grass or water from the
"heights," so much so that the traveller guesses from their presence
that there must be herbage and water near; but now "their eyes fail."
Rather the reference is to the great boas and python serpents which
raise a large portion of their body up in a vertical column ten or
twelve feet high, to survey the neighborhood above the surrounding
bushes, while with open jaws they drink in the air. These giant serpents
originated the widely spread notions which typified the deluge and all
destructive agents under the form of a dragon or monster serpent; hence,
the dragon temples always near water, in Asia, Africa, and Britain; for
example, at Abury, in Wiltshire; a symbol of the ark is often associated
with the dragon as the preserver from the waters \[KITTO, Biblical
CyclopÃ&brvbr;dia\].

[Jeremiah 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 14:7</span></span>

do thou it--what we beg of Thee; interpose to remove the drought.
Jeremiah pleads in the name of his nation ([Psa
109:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#021)). So "work for us," absolutely
used ([Sa1 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#006)).

for thy name's sake--"for our backslidings are so many" that we cannot
urge Thee for the sake of our doings, but for the glory of Thy name;
lest, if Thou give us not aid, it should be said it was owing to Thy
want of power ([Jos 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#009); [Psa
79:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#009); [Psa
106:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#008); [Isa
48:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#009); [Eze
20:44](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#044)). The same appeal to God's
mercy, "for His name's sake," as our only hope, since our sin precludes
trust in ourselves, occurs in [Psa
25:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#011).

[Jeremiah 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 14:8</span></span>

The reference is, not to the faith of Israel which had almost ceased,
but to the promise and everlasting covenant of God. None but the true
Israel make God their "hope." ([Jer
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#013)).

turneth aside to tarry--The traveller cares little for the land he
tarries but a night in; but Thou hast promised to dwell always in the
midst of Thy people ([Ch2 33:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#007)).
MAURER translates, "spreadeth," namely, his tent.

[Jeremiah 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 14:9</span></span>

astonied--like a "mighty man," at other times able to help ([Isa
59:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#001)), but now stunned by a sudden
calamity so as to disappoint the hopes drawn from him.

art in the midst of us-- ([Exo
29:45-46](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#045); [Lev
26:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#011)).

called by thy name-- ([Dan 9:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#018)) as
Thine own peculiar people ([Deu 9:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#029)).

[Jeremiah 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 14:10</span></span>

Jehovah's reply to the prayer ([Jer
14:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#007); [Jer
2:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#023)).

Thus--So greatly.

loved-- ([Jer 5:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#031)).

not refrained . . . feet--They did not obey God's command; "withhold thy
foot" ([Jer 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#025)), namely, from
following after idols.

remember . . . iniquity-- ([Hos 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#013);
[Hos 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#009)). Their sin is so great, God
must punish them.

[Jeremiah 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 14:11</span></span>

([Jer 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#016); [Exo
32:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#010)).

[Jeremiah 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 14:12</span></span>

not hear--because their prayers are hypocritical: their hearts are still
idolatrous. God never refuses to hear real prayer ([Jer
7:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#021); [Pro
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#028); [Isa
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#015); [Isa
58:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#003)).

sword . . . famine . . . pestilence--the three sorest judgments at once;
any one of which would be enough for their ruin ([Sa2
24:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#012)).

[Jeremiah 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 14:13</span></span>

Jeremiah urges that much of the guilt of the people is due to the false
prophets' influence.

assured peace--solid and lasting peace. Literally, "peace of truth"
([Isa 39:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#008)).

[Jeremiah 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 14:14</span></span>

([Jer 23:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#021)).

[Jeremiah 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 14:15</span></span>

([Jer 5:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#012)).

By sword and famine . . . consumed--retribution in kind both to the
false prophets and to their hearers ([Jer
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#016)).

[Jeremiah 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 14:16</span></span>

none to bury-- ([Psa 79:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#003)).

pour their wickedness--that is, the punishment incurred by their
wickedness ([Jer 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#019)).

[Jeremiah 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 14:17</span></span>

([Jer 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#001); [Lam
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#016)). Jeremiah is desired to weep
ceaselessly for the calamities coming on his nation (called a "virgin,"
as being heretofore never under foreign yoke), ([Isa
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#004)).

[Jeremiah 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 14:18</span></span>

go about--that is, shall have to migrate into a land of exile. HORSLEY
translates, "go trafficking about the land (see [Jer
5:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#031), Margin; [Co2
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#002); [Pe2
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#003)), and take no knowledge" (that is,
pay no regard to the miseries before their eyes) ([Isa
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#003); [Isa
58:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#003)). If the sense of the Hebrew verb
be retained, I would with English Version understand the words as
referring to the exile to Babylon; thus, "the prophet and the priest
shall have to go to a strange land to practise their religious traffic
([Isa 56:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#011); [Eze
34:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#002); [Mic
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#011)).

[Jeremiah 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 14:19</span></span>

The people plead with God, Jeremiah being forbidden to do so.

no healing-- ([Jer 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#018)).

peace . . . no good-- ([Jer 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#015)).

[Jeremiah 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 14:20</span></span>

([Dan 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#008)).

[Jeremiah 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 14:21</span></span>

us--"the throne of Thy glory" may be the object of "abhor not" ("reject
not"); or "Zion" ([Jer 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#019)).

throne of thy glory--Jerusalem, or, the temple, called God's "footstool"
and "habitation" ([Ch1 28:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#002); [Psa
132:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#005)).

thy covenant-- ([Psa 106:45](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#045); [Dan
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#019)).

[Jeremiah 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 14:22</span></span>

vanities--idols ([Deu 32:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#021)).

rain-- ([Zac 10:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#001)).

heavens--namely, of themselves without God ([Mat
5:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#045); [Act
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#017)); they are not the First Cause,
and ought not to be deified, as they were by the heathen. The
disjunctive "or" favors CALVIN'S explanation: "Not even the heavens
themselves can give rain, much less can the idol vanities."

art not thou he--namely, who canst give rain?
