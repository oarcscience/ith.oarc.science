[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sol 5:1</span></span>

Answer to her prayer ([Isa 65:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#024); [Rev
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#020)).

am come--already ([Sol 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#016)); "come"
([Gen 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#016)).

sister . . . spouse--As Adam's was created of his flesh, out of his
opened side, there being none on earth on a level with him, so the bride
out of the pierced Saviour ([Eph
5:30-32](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#030)).

have gathered . . . myrrh--His course was already complete; the myrrh,
&c. ([Mat 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#011); [Mat
26:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#007); [Joh
19:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#039)), emblems of the indwelling of
the anointing Holy Ghost, were already gathered.

spice--literally, "balsam."

have eaten--answering to her "eat" ([Sol
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#016)).

honeycomb--distinguished here from liquid "honey" dropping from trees.
The last supper, here set forth, is one of espousal, a pledge of the
future marriage ([Sol 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#014); [Rev
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#009)). Feasts often took place in
gardens. In the absence of sugar, then unknown, honey was more widely
used than with us. His eating honey with milk indicates His true, yet
spotless, human nature from infancy ([Isa
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#015)); and after His resurrection
([Luk 24:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#042)).

my wine-- ([Joh 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#011)) --a cup of
wrath to Him, of mercy to us, whereby God's Word and promises become to
us "milk" ([Psa 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#010); [Pe1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#002)). "My" answers to "His" ([Sol
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#016)). The myrrh (emblem, by its
bitterness, of repentance), honey, milk (incipient faith), wine (strong
faith), in reference to believers, imply that He accepts all their
graces, however various in degree.

eat--He desires to make us partakers in His joy ([Isa
55:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#001); [Joh
6:53-57](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#053); [Jo1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#003)).

drink abundantly--so as to be filled ([Eph
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#018); as [Hag
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#006)).

friends-- ([Joh 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#015)).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sol 5:2</span></span>

(CANTICLE IV)--FROM THE AGONY OF GETHSEMANE TO THE CONVERSION OF
SAMARIA. (Son. 5:2-8:4)

Sudden change of scene from evening to midnight, from a betrothal feast
to cold repulse. He has gone from the feast alone; night is come; He
knocks at the door of His espoused; she hears, but in sloth does not
shake off half-conscious drowsiness; namely, the disciples' torpor ([Mat
26:40-43](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#040)), "the spirit willing, the
flesh weak" (compare [Rom 7:18-25](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#018);
[Gal 5:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#016), [Gal
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#024)). Not total sleep. The lamp was
burning beside the slumbering wise virgin, but wanted trimming ([Mat
25:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#005)). It is His voice that rouses
her ([Jon 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#006); [Eph
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#014); [Rev
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#020)). Instead of bitter reproaches,
He addresses her by the most endearing titles, "my sister, my love," &c.
Compare His thought of Peter after the denial ([Mar
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#007)).

dew--which falls heavily in summer nights in the East (see [Luk
9:58](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#058)).

drops of the night-- ([Psa 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#002); [Luk
22:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#044)). His death is not expressed, as
unsuitable to the allegory, a song of love and joy; [Sol
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#004) refers to the scene in the
judgment hall of Caiaphas, when Jesus Christ employed the cock-crowing
and look of love to awaken Peter's sleeping conscience, so that his
"bowels were moved" ([Luk 22:61-62](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#061));
[Sol 5:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#005), the disciples with
"myrrh," &c. ([Luk 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#001), [Luk
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#005)), seeking Jesus Christ in the
tomb, but finding Him not, for He has "withdrawn Himself" ([Joh
7:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#034); [Joh
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#033)); [Sol
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#007), the trials by watchmen extend
through the whole night of His withdrawal from Gethsemane to the
resurrection; they took off the "veil" of Peter's disguise; also,
literally the linen cloth from the young man ([Mar
14:51](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#051)); [Sol
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#008), the sympathy of friends ([Luk
23:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#027)).

undefiled--not polluted by spiritual adultery ([Rev
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#004); [Jam
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#004)).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sol 5:3</span></span>

Trivial excuses ([Luk 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#018)).

coat--rather, the inmost vest, next the skin, taken off before going to
bed.

washed . . . feet--before going to rest, for they had been soiled, from
the Eastern custom of wearing sandals, not shoes. Sloth ([Luk
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#007)) and despondency ([Deu
7:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#017)).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sol 5:4</span></span>

A key in the East is usually a piece of wood with pegs in it
corresponding to small holes in a wooden bolt within, and is put through
a hole in the door, and thus draws the bolt. So Jesus Christ "puts forth
His hand (namely, His Spirit, [Eze
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#014)), by (Hebrew, 'from,' so in [Sol
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#009)) the hole"; in "chastening" ([Psa
38:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#002); [Rev
3:14-22](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#014), singularly similar to this
passage), and other unexpected ways letting Himself in ([Luk
22:61-62](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#061)).

bowels . . . moved for him--It is His which are first troubled for us,
and which cause ours to be troubled for Him ([Jer
31:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#020); [Hos
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#008)).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sol 5:5</span></span>

dropped with myrrh--The best proof a bride could give her lover of
welcome was to anoint herself (the back of the hands especially, as
being the coolest part of the body) profusely with the best perfumes
([Exo 30:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#023); [Est
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#012); [Pro
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#017)); "sweet-smelling" is in the
Hebrew rather, "spontaneously exuding" from the tree, and therefore the
best. She designed also to anoint Him, whose "head was filled with the
drops of night" ([Luk 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#001)). The myrrh
typifies bitter repentance, the fruit of the Spirit's unction ([Co2
1:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#021)).

handles of the lock--sins which closed the heart against Him.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sol 5:6</span></span>

withdrawn--He knocked when she was sleeping; for to have left her then
would have ended in the death sleep; He withdraws now that she is
roused, as she needs correction ([Jer
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#017), [Jer
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#019)), and can appreciate and safely
bear it now, which she could not then. "The strong He'll strongly try"
([Co1 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#013)).

when he spake--rather, "because of His speaking"; at the remembrance of
His tender words ([Job 29:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#002); [Psa
27:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#013); [Psa
142:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#007)), or till He should speak.

no answer-- ([Job 23:3-9](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#003); [Job
30:20](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#020); [Job
34:29](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#029); [Lam
3:44](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#044)). Weak faith receives immediate
comfort ([Luk 8:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#044), [Luk
8:47-48](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#047)); strong faith is tried with
delay ([Mat 15:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#022)).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sol 5:7</span></span>

watchmen--historically, the Jewish priests, &c. (see on [Sol
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#002)); spiritually, ministers ([Isa
62:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#006); [Heb
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#017)), faithful in "smiting" (Psalm
141. 5), but (as she leaves them, v. 8) too harsh; or, perhaps,
unfaithful; disliking her zeal wherewith she sought Jesus Christ, first,
with spiritual prayer, "opening" her heart to Him, and then in
charitable works "about the city"; miscalling it fanaticism ([Isa
66:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#005)), and taking away her veil (the
greatest indignity to an Eastern lady), as though she were positively
immodest. She had before sought Him by night in the streets, under
strong affection ([Sol 3:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#002)), and so
without rebuff from "the watchmen," found Him immediately; but now after
sinful neglect, she encounters pain and delay. God forgives believers,
but it is a serious thing to draw on His forgiveness; so the growing
reserve of God towards Israel observable in Judges, as His people repeat
their demands on His grace.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sol 5:8</span></span>

She turns from the unsympathizing watchmen to humbler persons, not yet
themselves knowing Him, but in the way towards it. Historically, His
secret friends in the night of His withdrawal ([Luk
23:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#027)). Inquirers may find ("if ye
find") Jesus Christ before she who has grieved His Spirit finds Him
again.

tell--in prayer ([Jam 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#016)).

sick of love--from an opposite cause ([Sol
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#005)) than through excess of delight at
His presence; now excess of pain at His absence.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sol 5:9</span></span>

Her own beauty ([Eze 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#014)), and
lovesickness for Him, elicit now their enquiry ([Mat
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#016)); heretofore "other lords besides
Him had dominion over them"; thus they had seen "no beauty in Him" ([Isa
26:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#013); [Isa
53:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#002)).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sol 5:10</span></span>

([Pe1 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#015)).

white and ruddy--health and beauty. So David (equivalent to beloved),
His forefather after the flesh, and type ([Sa1
17:42](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#042)). "The Lamb" is at once His
nuptial and sacrificial name ([Pe1
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#019); [Rev
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#007)), characterized by white and red;
white, His spotless manhood ([Rev
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#014)). The Hebrew for white is
properly "illuminated by the sun," white as the light" (compare [Mat
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#002)); red, in His blood-dyed garment
as slain ([Isa 63:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#001); [Rev
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#006); [Rev
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#013)). Angels are white, not red; the
blood of martyrs does not enter heaven; His alone is seen there.

chiefest--literally, "a standard bearer"; that is, as conspicuous above
all others, as a standard bearer is among hosts ([Psa
45:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#007); [Psa
89:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#006); [Isa
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#010); [Isa
55:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#004); [Heb
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#010); compare [Sa2
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#003); [Job
33:23](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#023); [Phi
2:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#009); [Rev
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#005)). The chief of sinners needs the
"chiefest" of Saviours.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sol 5:11</span></span>

head . . . gold--the Godhead of Jesus Christ, as distinguished from His
heel, that is, His manhood, which was "bruised" by Satan; both together
being one Christ ([Co1 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#003)). Also His
sovereignty, as Nebuchadnezzar, the supreme king was "the head of gold"
([Dan 2:32-38](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#032); [Col
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#018)), the highest creature, compared
with Him, is brass, iron, and clay. "Preciousness" (Greek, [Pe1
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#007)).

bushy--curled, token of Headship. In contrast with her flowing locks
([Sol 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#001)), the token of her
subjection to Him ([Psa 8:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#004); [Co1
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#003), [Co1
11:6-15](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#006)). The Hebrew is (pendulous as)
the branches of a palm, which, when in leaf, resemble waving plumes of
feathers.

black--implying youth; no "gray hairs" ([Psa
102:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#027); [Psa
110:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#003); [Hos
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#009)). Jesus Christ was crucified in
the prime of vigor and manliness. In heaven, on the other hand, His hair
is "white," He being the Ancient of days ([Dan
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#009)). These contrasts often concur in
Him ([Sol 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#010)), "white and ruddy";
here the "raven" ([Sol 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#012)), the
"dove," as both with Noah in the ark ([Gen
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#011)); emblems of judgment and mercy.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sol 5:12</span></span>

as the eyes of doves--rather, "as doves" ([Psa
68:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#013)); bathing in "the rivers"; so
combining in their "silver" feathers the whiteness of milk with the
sparkling brightness of the water trickling over them ([Mat
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#016)). The "milk" may allude to the
white around the pupil of the eye. The "waters" refer to the eye as the
fountain of tears of sympathy ([Eze
16:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#005); [Luk
19:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#041)). Vivacity, purity, and love,
are the three features typified.

fitly set--as a gem in a ring; as the precious stones in the high
priest's breastplate. Rather, translate as Vulgate (the doves), sitting
at the fulness of the stream; by the full stream; or, as MAURER (the
eyes) set in fulness, not sunk in their sockets ([Rev
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#006)), ("seven," expressing full
perfection), ([Zac 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#009); [Zac
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#010)).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sol 5:13</span></span>

cheeks--the seat of beauty, according to the Hebrew meaning
\[GESENIUS\]. Yet men smote and spat on them ([Isa
50:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#006)).

bed--full, like the raised surface of the garden bed; fragrant with
ointments, as beds with aromatic plants (literally, "balsam").

sweet flowers--rather, "terraces of aromatic herbs"--"high-raised
parterres of sweet plants," in parallelism to "bed," which comes from a
Hebrew root, meaning "elevation."

lips-- ([Psa 45:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#002); [Joh
7:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#046)).

lilies--red lilies. Soft and gentle ([Pe1
2:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#022)). How different lips were
man's ([Psa 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#007))!

dropping . . . myrrh--namely, His lips, just as the sweet dewdrops which
hang in the calyx of the lily.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sol 5:14</span></span>

rings set with . . . beryl--Hebrew, Tarshish, so called from the city.
The ancient chrysolite, gold in color (Septuagint), our topaz, one of
the stones on the high priest's breastplate, also in the foundation of
New Jerusalem ([Rev 21:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#019); also
[Dan 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#006)). "Are as," is plainly to be
supplied, see in [Sol 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#013) a similiar
ellipsis; not as MOODY STUART: "have gold rings." The hands bent in are
compared to beautiful rings, in which beryl is set, as the nails are in
the fingers. BURROWES explains the rings as cylinders used as signets,
such as are found in Nineveh, and which resemble fingers. A ring is the
token of sonship ([Luk 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#022)). A slave
was not allowed to wear a gold ring. He imparts His sonship and freedom
to us ([Gal 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#007)); also of authority
([Gen 41:42](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#042); compare [Joh
6:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#027)). He seals us in the name of God
with His signet ([Rev 7:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#002)), compare
below, [Sol 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#006), where she desires to
be herself a signet-ring on His arms; so "graven on the palms," &c.,
that is, on the signet-ring in His hand ([Isa
49:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#016); contrast [Hag
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#023), with [Jer
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#024)).

belly--BURROWES and MOODY STUART translate, "body." NEWTON, as it is
elsewhere, "bowels"; namely, His compassion ([Psa
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#014); [Isa
63:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#015); [Jer
31:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#020); [Hos
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#008)).

bright--literally, "elaborately wrought so as to shine," so His
"prepared" body ([Heb 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005)); the
"ivory palace" of the king ([Psa
45:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#008)); spotless, pure, so the bride's
"neck is as to tower of ivory" ([Sol
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#004)).

sapphires--spangling in the girdle around Him ([Dan
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#005)). "To the pure all things are
pure." As in statuary to the artist the partly undraped figure is
suggestive only of beauty, free from indelicacy, so to the saint the
personal excellencies of Jesus Christ, typified under the ideal of the
noblest human form. As, however, the bride and bridegroom are in public,
the usual robes on the person, richly ornamented, are presupposed ([Isa
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#005)). Sapphires indicate His heavenly
nature (so [Joh 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#013), "is in heaven"),
even in His humiliation, overlaying or cast "over" His ivory human body
([Exo 24:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#010)). Sky-blue in color, the
height and depth of the love of Jesus Christ ([Eph
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#018)).

pillars--strength and steadfastness. Contrast man's "legs" ([Ecc
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#003)). Allusion to the temple ([Kg1
5:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#008); [Kg1
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#021)), the "cedars" of "Lebanon" ([Psa
147:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#010)). Jesus Christ's "legs" were
not broken on the cross, though the thieves' were; on them rests the
weight of our salvation ([Psa 75:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#003)).

sockets of fine gold--His sandals, answering to the bases of the
pillars; "set up from everlasting" ([Pro
8:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#022)). From the head ([Sol
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#011)) to the feet, "of fine gold." He
was tried in the fire and found without alloy.

countenance--rather, "His aspect," including both mien and stature
(compare [Sa2 23:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#021), Margin; with [Ch1
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#023)). From the several parts, she
proceeds to the general effect of the whole person of Jesus Christ.

Lebanon--so called from its white limestone rocks.

excellent--literally, "choice," that is, fair and tall as the cedars on
Lebanon ([Eze 31:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#003), &c.). Majesty is
the prominent thought ([Psa 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#005)).
Also the cedars' duration ([Heb 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#011));
greenness ([Luk 23:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#031)), and refuge
afforded by it ([Eze 17:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#022)).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sol 5:16</span></span>

Literally, "His palate is sweetness, yea, all over loveliness," that is,
He is the essence of these qualities.

mouth--so [Sol 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#002), not the same as
"lips" ([Sol 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#013)), His breath ([Isa
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#004); [Joh
20:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#022)). "All over," all the beauties
scattered among creatures are transcendently concentrated in Him ([Col
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#019); [Col
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#009)).

my beloved--for I love Him.

my friend--for He loves me ([Pro
18:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#024)). Holy boasting ([Psa
34:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#002); [Co1
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#031)).
