<p>
<p>David had abode two days in Ziklag--Though greatly reduced by the Amalekite incendiaries, that town was not so completely sacked and destroyed, but David and his six hundred followers, with their families, could still find some accommodation.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#002">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 1:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">sa2 1:2</A></FONT></span></p>a man came out of the camp from Saul--As the narrative of Saul's death, given in the last chapter, is inspired, it must be considered the true account, and the Amalekite's story a fiction of his own, invented to ingratiate himself with David, the presumptive successor to the throne. David's question, "How went the matter?" evinces the deep interest he took in the war, an interest that sprang from feelings of high and generous patriotism, not from views of ambition. The Amalekite, however, judging him to be actuated by a selfish principle, fabricated a story improbable and inconsistent, which he thought would procure him a reward. Having probably witnessed the suicidal act of Saul, he thought of turning it to his own account, and suffered the penalty of his grievously mistaken calculation (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#009">Sa2 1:9</A> with <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#004">Sa1 31:4-5</A>).

<p>
<p>the bracelet that was on his arm--the armlet worn above the elbow; an ancient mark of royal dignity. It is still worn by kings in some Eastern countries.

<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#013">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 1:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">sa2 1:13</A></FONT></span></p>David said unto the young man . . . Whence art thou?--The man had at the outset stated who he was. But the question was now formally and judicially put. The punishment inflicted on the Amalekite may seem too severe, but the respect paid to kings in the West must not be regarded as the standard for that which the East may think due to royal station. David's reverence for Saul, as the Lord's anointed, was in his mind a principle on which he had faithfully acted on several occasions of great temptation. In present circumstances it was especially important that his principle should be publicly known; and to free himself from the imputation of being in any way accessory to the execrable crime of regicide was the part of a righteous judge, no less than of a good politician.

<p>
<p>David lamented with this lamentation--It has always been customary for Eastern people, on the death of great kings and warriors, to celebrate their qualities and deeds in funeral songs. This inimitable pathetic elegy is supposed by many writers to have become a national war song, and to have been taught to the young Israelites under the name of "The Bow," in conformity with the practice of Hebrew and many classical writers in giving titles to their songs from the principal theme (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#001">Psa 22:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#001">Psa 56:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#001">Psa 60:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#001">Psa 80:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa100.htm#001">Psa 100:1</A>). Although the words "the use of" are a supplement by our translators, they may be rightly introduced, for the natural sense of this parenthetical verse is, that David took immediate measures for instructing the people in the knowledge and practice of archery, their great inferiority to the enemy in this military arm having been the main cause of the late national disaster.

<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#019">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 1:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">sa2 1:19</A></FONT></span></p>The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places--literally, "the gazelle" or "antelope of Israel." In Eastern countries, that animal is the chosen type of beauty and symmetrical elegance of form. 
<p>
<p>how are the mighty fallen!--This forms the chorus.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#021">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 1:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">sa2 1:21</A></FONT></span></p>let there be no dew, neither let there be rain--To be deprived of the genial atmospheric influences which, in those anciently cultivated hills, seem to have reared plenty of first-fruits in the corn harvests, was specified as the greatest calamity the lacerated feelings of the poet could imagine. The curse seems still to lie upon them; for the mountains of Gilboa are naked and sterile. 
<p>
<p>the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away--To cast away the shield was counted a national disgrace. Yet, on that fatal battle of Gilboa, many of the Jewish soldiers, who had displayed unflinching valor in former battles, forgetful of their own reputation and their country's honor, threw away their shields and fled from the field. This dishonorable and cowardly conduct is alluded to with exquisitely touching pathos.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#024">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 1:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">sa2 1:24</A></FONT></span></p>Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, &amp;c.--The fondness for dress, which anciently distinguished Oriental women, is their characteristic still. It appears in their love of bright, gay, and divers colors, in profuse display of ornaments, and in various other forms. The inmost depths of the poet's feeling are stirred, and his amiable disposition appears in the strong desire to celebrate the good qualities of Saul, as well as Jonathan. But the praises of the latter form the burden of the poem, which begins and ends with that excellent prince.
