### [Job Chapter 35](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#001)

[Job 35:2](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 35:2</span></span>

(Job 35:1-16)

more than--rather as in [Job 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#002); [Job
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/job025.htm#004) : "I am righteous (literally, my
righteousness is) before God." The English Version, however, agrees with
[Job 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#017); [Job
16:12-17](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#012); [Job
27:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#002). [Job
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#017) is susceptible of either
rendering. Elihu means Job said so, not in so many words, but virtually.

[Job 35:3](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 35:3</span></span>

Rather, explanatory of "this" in [Job
35:2](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#002), "That thou sayest (to thyself,
as if a distinct person) What advantage is it (thy integrity) to thee?
What profit have I (by integrity) more than (I should have) by my sin?"
that is, more than if I had sinned ([Job
34:9](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#009)). Job had said that the wicked,
who use these very words, do not suffer for it ([Job
21:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#013)); whereby he virtually
sanctioned their sentiments. The same change of persons from oblique to
direct address occurs ([Job 19:28](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#028);
[Job 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#017)).

[Job 35:4](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 35:4</span></span>

companions--those entertaining like sentiments with thee ([Job
34:8](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#008), [Job
34:36](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#036)).

[Job 35:5](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 35:5</span></span>

Elihu like Eliphaz ([Job 22:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#002), [Job
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#012)) shows that God is too exalted
in nature to be susceptible of benefit or hurt from the righteousness or
sin of men respectively; it is themselves that they benefit by
righteousness, or hurt by sin.

behold the clouds, which are higher than thou--spoken with irony. Not
only are they higher than thou, but thou canst not even reach them
clearly with the eye. Yet these are not as high as God's seat. God is
therefore too exalted to be dependent on man. Therefore He has no
inducement to injustice in His dealings with man. When He afflicts, it
must be from a different motive; namely, the good of the sufferer.

[Job 35:6](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 35:6</span></span>

what doest--how canst thou affect Him?

unto him--that can hurt Him? ([Jer
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#019); [Pro
8:36](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#036)).

[Job 35:7](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 35:7</span></span>

([Psa 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#002); [Pro
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#012); [Luk
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#010)).

[Job 35:9](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 35:9</span></span>

([Ecc 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#001).) Elihu states in Job's
words ([Job 24:12](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#012); [Job
30:20](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#020)) the difficulty; the "cries" of
"the oppressed" not being heard might lead man to think that wrongs are
not punished by Him.

[Job 35:10](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 35:10</span></span>

But the reason is that the innocent sufferers often do not humbly seek
God for succor; so to their "pride" is to be laid the blame of their
ruin; also because ([Job 35:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#013))
they, as Job, instead of waiting God's time in pious trust, are prone to
despair of His justice, when it is not immediately visible ([Job
33:19-26](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#019)). If the sufferer would apply
to God with a humbled, penitent spirit, He would hear.

Where, &c.-- ([Jer 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#006), [Jer
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#008); [Isa
51:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#013)).

songs--of joy at deliverance ([Psa
42:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#008); [Psa
149:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#005); [Act
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#025)).

in the night--unexpectedly ([Job
34:20](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#020), [Job
34:25](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#025)). Rather, "in calamity."

[Job 35:11](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 35:11</span></span>

Man's spirit, which distinguishes him from the brute, is the strongest
proof of God's beneficence; by the use of it we may understand that God
is the Almighty helper of all sufferers who humbly seek Him; and that
they err who do not so seek Him.

fowls--(see on [Job 28:21](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#021)).

[Job 35:12](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 35:12</span></span>

There--rather, "Then" (when none humbly casts himself on God, [Job
35:10](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#010)). They cry proudly against God,
rather than humbly to God. So, as the design of affliction is to humble
the sufferer, there can be no answer until "pride" gives place to
humble, penitent prayer ([Psa 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#004);
[Jer 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#017)).

[Job 35:13](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 35:13</span></span>

vanity--that is, cries uttered in an unhumbled spirit, [Job
35:12](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#012), which applies in some degree to
Job's cries; still more to those of the wicked ([Job
27:9](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#009); [Pro
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#029)).

[Job 35:14](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 35:14</span></span>

Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him--(as a temporal deliverer;
for he did look for a Redeemer after death, [Job
19:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#025); which passage cannot
consistently with Elihu's assertion here be interpreted of "seeing" a
temporal "redeemer"), [Job 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#007); [Job
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#011); [Job
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#003), [Job
23:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#008); yet, judgment . . . ;
therefore trust . . . But the Hebrew favors MAURER, "How much less (will
God . . . regard, [Job 35:13](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#013)), since
thou sayest, that He does not regard thee." So in [Job
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#019). Thus Elihu alludes to Job's
words ([Job 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#007); [Job
30:20](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#020)).

judgment--that is, thy cause, thy right; as in [Psa
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#016); [Pro
31:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#005), [Pro
31:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#008).

trust--rather, "wait thou" on Him, patiently, until He take up thy cause
([Psa 37:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#007)).

[Job 35:15](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 35:15</span></span>

As it is, because Job waited not trustingly and patiently ([Job
35:14](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#014); [Num
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#012); [Zep
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#002); [Mic
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#009)), God hath visited . . . ; yet
still he has not taken (severe) cognizance of the great multitude
(English Version wrongly, "extremity") of sins; therefore Job should not
complain of being punished with undue severity ([Job
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#020); [Job
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#006)). MAURER translates: "Because His
anger hath not visited (hath not immediately punished Job for his
impious complaints), nor has He taken strict (great) cognizance of his
folly (sinful speeches); therefore," &c. For "folly," UMBREIT translates
with the Rabbins, "multitude." GESENIUS reads with the Septuagint and
Vulgate needlessly, "transgression."

[Job 35:16](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 35:16</span></span>

Apodosis to [Job 35:15](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#015).

in vain--rashly.
