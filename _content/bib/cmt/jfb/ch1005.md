### [1 Chronicles Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#001)

[1 Chronicles 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 5:1</span></span>

THE LINE OF REUBEN. ([Ch1 5:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#001))

Now the sons of Reuben--In proceeding to give this genealogy, the sacred
historian states, in a parenthesis ([Ch1
5:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#001)), the reason why it was not
placed first, as Reuben was the oldest son of Jacob. The birthright,
which by a foul crime he had forfeited, implied not only dominion, but a
double portion ([Deu 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#017)); and both
of these were transferred to Joseph, whose two sons having been adopted
as the children of Jacob ([Gen 48:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#005)),
received each an allotted portion, as forming two distinct tribes in
Israel. Joseph then was entitled to the precedency; and yet, as his
posterity was not mentioned first, the sacred historian judged it
necessary to explain that "the genealogy was not to be reckoned after
the birthright," but with a reference to a superior honor and privilege
that had been conferred on Judah--not the man, but the tribe, whereby it
was invested with the pre-eminence over all the other tribes, and out of
it was to spring David with his royal lineage, and especially the great
Messiah ([Heb 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#014)). These were the
two reasons why, in the order of enumeration, the genealogy of Judah is
introduced before that of Reuben.

[1 Chronicles 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch1 5:9</span></span>

Eastward he inhabited unto the entering in of the wilderness from the
river Euphrates--The settlement was on the east of Jordan, and the
history of this tribe, which never took any part in the public affairs
or movements of the nation, is comprised in "the multiplication of their
cattle in the land of Gilead," in their wars with the Bedouin sons of
Hagar, and in the simple labors of pastoral life. They had the right of
pasture over an extensive mountain range--the great wilderness of
Kedemoth ([Deu 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#026)) and the Euphrates
being a security against their enemies.

[1 Chronicles 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch1 5:11</span></span>

THE LINE OF GAD. (1Ch. 5:11-26)

the children of Gad dwelt over against them--The genealogy of the
Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh ([Ch1
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#024)) is given along with that of the
Reubenites, as these three were associated in a separate colony.

[1 Chronicles 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch1 5:16</span></span>

Sharon--The term "Sharon" was applied as descriptive of any place of
extraordinary beauty and productiveness. There were three places in
Palestine so called. This Sharon lay east of the Jordan.

upon their borders--that is, of Gilead and Bashan: Gilead proper, or at
least the largest part, belonged to the Reubenites; and Bashan, the
greatest portion of it, belonged to the Manassites. The Gadites occupied
an intermediate settlement on the land which lay upon their borders.

[1 Chronicles 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch1 5:17</span></span>

All these were reckoned . . . in the days of Jotham--His long reign and
freedom from foreign wars as well as intestine troubles were favorable
for taking a census of the people.

and in the days of Jeroboam--the second of that name.

[1 Chronicles 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch1 5:18</span></span>

Hagarites--or, "Hagarenes," originally synonymous with "Ishmaelites,"
but afterwards applied to a particular tribe of the Arabs (compare [Psa
83:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#006)).

Jetur--His descendants were called Itureans, and the country Auranitis,
from Hauran, its chief city. These, who were skilled in archery, were
invaded in the time of Joshua by a confederate army of the tribes of
Reuben, Gad, and half Manasseh, who, probably incensed by the frequent
raids of those marauding neighbors, took reprisals in men and cattle,
dispossessed almost all of the original inhabitants, and colonized the
district themselves. Divine Providence favoured, in a remarkable manner,
the Hebrew army in this just war.

[1 Chronicles 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">ch1 5:26</span></span>

the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul--the Phalluka of the
Ninevite monuments (see on [Kg2
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#019)).

and the spirit of Tilgath-pilneser--the son of the former. By them the
trans-jordanic tribes, including the other half of Manasseh, settled in
Galilee, were removed to Upper Media. This was the first captivity ([Kg2
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029)).
