### [Psalms Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#001)

[Psalms 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 24:1</span></span>

God's supreme sovereignty requires a befitting holiness of life and
heart in His worshippers; a sentiment sublimely illustrated by
describing His entrance into the sanctuary, by the symbol of His
worship--the ark, as requiring the most profound homage to the glory of
His Majesty. ([Psa 24:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#001))

fulness--everything.

world--the habitable globe, with

they that dwell--forming a parallel expression to the first clause.

[Psalms 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 24:2</span></span>

Poetically represents the facts of [Gen
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#009).

[Psalms 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 24:3</span></span>

The form of a question gives vivacity. Hands, tongue, and heart are
organs of action, speech, and feeling, which compose character.

hill of the Lord--(compare [Psa 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#006),
&c.). His Church--the true or invisible, as typified by the earthly
sanctuary.

[Psalms 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 24:4</span></span>

lifted up his soul--is to set the affections ([Psa
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#001)) on an object; here,

vanity--or, any false thing, of which swearing falsely, or to falsehood,
is a specification.

[Psalms 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 24:5</span></span>

righteousness--the rewards which God bestows on His people, or the grace
to secure those rewards as well as the result.

[Psalms 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 24:6</span></span>

Jacob--By "Jacob," we may understand God's people (compare [Isa
43:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#022); [Isa
44:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#002), &c.), corresponding to "the
generation," as if he had said, "those who seek Thy face are Thy chosen
people."

[Psalms 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 24:7</span></span>

The entrance of the ark, with the attending procession, into the holy
sanctuary is pictured to us. The repetition of the terms gives emphasis.

[Psalms 24:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 24:10</span></span>

Lord of hosts--or fully, Lord God of hosts ([Hos
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#005); [Amo
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#013)), describes God by a title
indicative of supremacy over all creatures, and especially the heavenly
armies ([Jos 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#014); [Kg1
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#019)). Whether, as some think, the
actual enlargement of the ancient gates of Jerusalem be the basis of the
figure, the effect of the whole is to impress us with a conception of
the matchless majesty of God.
