### [Genesis Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#001)

[Genesis 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 9:1</span></span>

COVENANT. ([Gen 9:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#001))

And God blessed Noah--Here is republished the law of nature that was
announced to Adam, consisting as it originally did of several parts.

Be fruitful, &c.--The first part relates to the transmission of life,
the original blessing being reannounced in the very same words in which
it had been promised at first \[[Gen
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#028)\].

[Genesis 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 9:2</span></span>

And the fear of you and the dread of you--The second part re-establishes
man's dominion over the inferior animals; it was now founded not as at
first in love and kindness, but in terror; this dread of man prevails
among all the stronger as well as the weaker members of the animal
tribes and keeps away from his haunts all but those employed in his
service.

[Genesis 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 9:3</span></span>

Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you--The third part
concerns the means of sustaining life; man was for the first time, it
would seem, allowed the use of animal food, but the grant was
accompanied with one restriction.

[Genesis 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 9:4</span></span>

But flesh . . . the blood . . . shall ye not eat--The sole intention of
this prohibition was to prevent these excesses of cannibal ferocity in
eating flesh of living animals, to which men in the earlier ages of the
world were liable.

[Genesis 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 9:5</span></span>

surely your blood of your lives will I require--The fourth part
establishes a new power for protecting life--the institution of the
civil magistrate ([Rom 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#004)), armed
with public and official authority to repress the commission of violence
and crime. Such a power had not previously existed in patriarchal
society.

[Genesis 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gen 9:6</span></span>

Whoso sheddeth man's blood . . . for in the image of God made he man--It
is true that image has been injured by the fall, but it is not lost. In
this view, a high value is attached to the life of every man, even the
poorest and humblest, and an awful criminality is involved in the
destruction of it.

[Genesis 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gen 9:13</span></span>

RAINBOW. (Gen. 9:8-29)

I do set my bow in the cloud--set, that is, constitute or appoint. This
common and familiar phenomenon being made the pledge of peace, its
appearance when showers began to fall would be welcomed with the
liveliest feelings of joy.

[Genesis 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">gen 9:20</span></span>

And Noah . . . planted a vineyard--Noah had been probably bred to the
culture of the soil, and resumed that employment on leaving the ark.

[Genesis 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">gen 9:21</span></span>

And he drank of the wine, and was drunken--perhaps at the festivities of
the vintage season. This solitary stain on the character of so eminently
pious a man must, it is believed, have been the result of age or
inadvertency.

[Genesis 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">gen 9:24</span></span>

This incident could scarcely have happened till twenty years after the
flood; for Canaan, whose conduct was more offensive than that even of
his father, was not born till after that event. It is probable that
there is a long interval included between these verses and that this
prophecy, like that of Jacob on his sons, was not uttered till near the
close of Noah's life when the prophetic spirit came upon him; this
presumption is strengthened by the mention of his death immediately
after.

[Genesis 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">gen 9:25</span></span>

Cursed be Canaan--This doom has been fulfilled in the destruction of the
Canaanites--in the degradation of Egypt and the slavery of the Africans,
the descendants of Ham.

[Genesis 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">gen 9:26</span></span>

Blessed be the Lord God of Shem--rather, "Blessed of Jehovah, my God, be
Shem,"--an intimation that the descendants of Shem should be peculiarly
honored in the service of the true God, His Church being for ages
established among them (the Jews), and of them, concerning the flesh,
Christ came. They got possession of Canaan, the people of that land
being made their "servants" either by conquest, or, like the Gibeonites,
by submission \[[Jos 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#025)\].

[Genesis 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">gen 9:27</span></span>

God shall enlarge Japheth--pointing to a vast increase in posterity and
possessions. Accordingly his descendants have been the most active and
enterprising, spread over the best and largest portion of the world, all
Europe and a considerable part of Asia.

he shall dwell in the tents of Shem--a prophecy being fulfilled at the
present day, as in India British Government is established and the
Anglo-Saxons being in the ascendancy from Europe to India, from India
over the American continent. What a wonderful prophecy in a few verses
([Isa 46:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#010); [Pe1
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#025))!
