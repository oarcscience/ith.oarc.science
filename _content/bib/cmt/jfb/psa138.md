### [Psalms Chapter 138](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#001)

[Psalms 138:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 138:1</span></span>

David thanks God for His benefits, and anticipating a wider extension of
God's glory by His means, assures himself of His continued presence and
faithfulness. ([Psa 138:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#001))

I will praise thee with my whole heart--(Compare [Psa
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#001)).

before the gods--whether angels ([Psa
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#005)); or princes ([Exo
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#006); [Psa
82:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#006)); or idols ([Psa
97:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#007)); denotes a readiness to worship
the true God alone, and a contempt of all other objects of worship.

[Psalms 138:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 138:2</span></span>

(Compare [Psa 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#007)).

thy word above all thy name--that is, God's promise ([Sa2
7:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#012)), sustained by His mercy and
truth, exceeded all other manifestations of Himself as subject of
praise.

[Psalms 138:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 138:3</span></span>

That promise, as an answer to his prayers in distress, revived and
strengthened his faith; and, as the basis of other revelations of the
Messiah, it will be the occasion of praise by all who hear and receive
it ([Psa 68:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#029), [Psa
68:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#031); [Isa
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#003)).

[Psalms 138:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 138:5</span></span>

for great is the glory--or, "when the glory shall be great," in God's
fulfilling His purposes of redemption.

[Psalms 138:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 138:6</span></span>

On this general principle of God's government ([Isa
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#011); [Isa
57:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#015); [Isa
66:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#002)), he relies for God's favor in
saving him, and overthrowing his enemies.

knoweth afar off--their ways and deserts ([Psa
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#006)).

[Psalms 138:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 138:8</span></span>

God will fulfil His promise.
