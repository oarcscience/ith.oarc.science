<p>set forth in order--more simply, to draw up a narrative.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#002">Luke 1:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">luk 1:2</A></FONT></span></p>from the beginning--that is, of His public ministry, as is plain from what follows.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">luk 1:3</A></FONT></span></p>from the very first--that is, from the very earliest events; referring to those precious details of the birth and early life, not only of our Lord, but of His forerunner, which we owe to Luke alone. 
<p>
<p>in order--or "consecutively"--in contrast, probably, with the disjointed productions to which he had referred. But this must not be pressed too far; for, on comparing it with the other Gospels, we see that in some particulars the strict chronological order is not observed in this Gospel. 
<p>
<p>most excellent--or "most noble"--a title of rank applied by this same writer twice to Felix and once to Festus (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#026">Act 22:26</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#003">Act 24:3</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#025">Act 26:25</A>). It is likely, therefore, that "Theophilus" was chief magistrate of some city in Greece or Asia Minor [WEBSTER and WILKINSON].

<p>course of Abia--or Abijah; the eighth of the twenty-four orders of courses into which David divided the priests (see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#001">Ch1 24:1</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#004">Ch1 24:4</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#010">Ch1 24:10</A>). Of these courses only four returned after the captivity (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#034">Ezr 2:34-39</A>), which were again subdivided into twenty-four--retaining the ancient name and order of each. They took the whole temple service for a week each. 
<p>
<p>his wife was of the daughters of Aaron--The priests might marry into any tribe, but "it was most commendable of all to marry one of the priests' line" [LIGHTFOOT].

It has been denied that any such distinction was known to the Jews and New Testament writers. But <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#033">Mar 12:33</A>, and other passages, put this beyond all reasonable doubt.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#007">Luke 1:7</A></p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">luk 1:9</A></FONT></span></p>his lot was to burn incense--The part assigned to each priest in his week of service was decided by lot. Three were employed at the offering of incense--to remove the ashes of the former service; to bring in and place on the golden altar the pan filled with hot burning coals taken from the altar of burnt offering; and to sprinkle the incense on the hot coals; and, while the smoke of it ascended, to make intercession for the people. This was the most distinguished part of the service (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#003">Rev 8:3</A>), and this was what fell to the lot of Zacharias at this time [LIGHTFOOT].
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#010">Luke 1:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">luk 1:10</A></FONT></span></p>praying without--outside the court in front of the temple, where stood the altar of burnt offering; the men and women in separate courts, but the altar visible to all. 
<p>
<p>the time of incense--which was offered along with the morning and evening sacrifice of every day; a beautiful symbol of the acceptableness of the sacrifice offered on the altar of burnt offering, with coals from whose altar the incense was burnt (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#012">Lev 16:12-13</A>). This again was a symbol of the "living sacrifice" of themselves and their services offered daily to God by the worshippers. Hence the language of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#002">Psa 141:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#003">Rev 8:3</A>. But that the acceptance of this daily offering depended on the expiatory virtue presupposed in the burnt offering, and pointing to the one "sacrifice of a sweet-smelling savor" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#002">Eph 5:2</A>), is evident from <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#006">Isa 6:6-7</A>.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#011">Luke 1:11</A></p>

But why there? The right was the favorable side (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#033">Mat 25:33</A>) [SCHOTTGEN and WESTEIN in MEYER]; compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#005">Mar 16:5</A>.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#013">Luke 1:13</A></p>

<p>
<p>John--the same as "Johanan," so frequent in the Old Testament, meaning "Jehovah's gracious gift."
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#014">Luke 1:14</A></p>

<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#015">Luke 1:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">luk 1:15</A></FONT></span></p>great in the sight of the Lord--nearer to Him in official standing than all the prophets. (See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#010">Mat 11:10-11</A>.) 
<p>
<p>drink neither wine nor strong drink--that is, shall be a Nazarite, or "a separated one" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#002">Num 6:2</A>, &amp;c.). As the leper was the living symbol of sin, so was the Nazarite of holiness; nothing inflaming was to cross his lips; no razor to come on his head; no ceremonial defilement to be contracted. Thus was he to be "holy to the Lord [ceremonially] all the days of his separation." This separation was in ordinary cases temporary and voluntary: only Samson (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#007">Jdg 13:7</A>), Samuel (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#011">Sa1 1:11</A>), and John Baptist were Nazarites from the womb. It was fitting that the utmost severity of legal consecration should be seen in Christ's forerunner. HE was the REALITY and PERFECTION of the Nazarite without the symbol, which perished in that living realization of it: "Such an High Priest became us, who was SEPARATE FROM SINNERS" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#026">Heb 7:26</A>). 
<p>
<p>filled with the Holy Ghost, from . . . womb--a holy vessel for future service.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">luk 1:16</A></FONT></span></p>A religious and moral reformer, Elijah-like, he should be (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#006">Mal 4:6</A>, where the "turning of the people's heart to the Lord" is borrowed from <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#037">Kg1 18:37</A>). In both cases their success, though great, was partial--the nation was not gained.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#017">Luke 1:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">luk 1:17</A></FONT></span></p>before him--before "the Lord their God" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#016">Luk 1:16</A>). By comparing this with <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001">Mal 3:1</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#003">Isa 40:3</A>, it is plainly "Jehovah" in the flesh of Messiah [CALVIN and OLSHAUSEN] before whom John was to go as a herald to announce His approach, and a pioneer o prepare His way. 
<p>
<p>in the spirit--after the model. 
<p>
<p>and power of Elias--not his miraculous power, for John did no miracle" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#041">Joh 10:41</A>), but his power "turning the heart," or with like success in his ministry. Both fell on degenerate times; both witnessed fearlessly for God; neither appeared much save in the direct exercise of their ministry; both were at the head of schools of disciples; the success of both was similar. 
<p>
<p>fathers to the children--taken literally, this denotes the restoration of parental fidelity [MEYER and others], the decay of which is the beginning of religious and social corruption--one prominent feature of the coming revival being put for the whole. But what follows, explanatory of this, rather suggests a figurative sense. If "the disobedient" be "the children," and to "the fathers" belongs "the wisdom of the just" [BENGEL], the meaning will be, "he shall bring back the ancient spirit of the nation into their degenerate children" [CALVIN, &amp;c.]. So Elijah invoked "the God Abraham, Isaac, and Israel," when seeking to "turn their heart back again" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#036">Kg1 18:36-37</A>). 
<p>
<p>to make ready, &amp;c.--more clearly, "to make ready for the Lord a prepared people," to have in readiness a people prepared to welcome Him. Such preparation requires, in every age and every soul, an operation corresponding to the Baptist's ministry.

Abraham, though older, and doubtless Sarah, too, when the same promise was made to him, "staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strong in faith, giving glory to God." This was that in which Zacharias failed.

The mistake of the Vulgate's rendering, "full of grace," has been taken abundant advantage of by the Romish Church. As the mother of our Lord, she was the most "blessed among women" in external distinction; but let them listen to the Lord's own words. "Nay, rather blessed are they that hear the word of God and keep it." (See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#027">Luk 11:27</A>).

"Turn this as we will, we shall never be able to see the propriety of calling an unborn child "Lord," but by supposing Elisabeth, like the prophets of old, enlightened to perceive the Messiah's Divine nature" [OLSHAUSEN].

Is it unnatural to suppose that the spirit of the blessed Virgin had been drawn beforehand into mysterious sympathy with the ideas and the tone of this hymn, so that when the life and fire of inspiration penetrated her whole soul it spontaneously swept the chorus of this song, enriching the Hymnal of the Church with that spirit-stirring canticle which has resounded ever since from its temple walls? In both songs, those holy women, filled with wonder to behold "the proud, the mighty, the rich," passed by, and, in their persons the lowliest chosen to usher in the greatest events, sing of this as no capricious movement, but a great law of the kingdom of God, by which He delights to "put down the mighty from their seats and exalt them of low degree." In both songs the strain dies away on CHRIST; in Hannah's under the name of "Jehovah's King"--to whom, through all His line, from David onwards to Himself, He will "give strength"; His "Anointed," whose horn He will exalt (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#010">Sa1 2:10</A>); in the Virgin's song, it is as the "Help" promised to Israel by all the prophets.

In the Old Testament, God is said to "visit" chiefly for judgment, in the New Testament for mercy. Zacharias would, as yet, have but imperfect views of such "visiting and redeeming," "saving from and delivering out of the hand of enemies" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#071">Luk 1:71</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#074">Luk 1:74</A>). But this Old Testament phraseology, used at first with a lower reference, is, when viewed in the light of a loftier and more comprehensive kingdom of God, equally adapted to express the most spiritual conceptions of the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.
