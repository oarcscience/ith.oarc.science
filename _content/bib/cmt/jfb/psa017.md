### [Psalms Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#001)

[Psalms 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 17:2</span></span>

This Psalm is termed a prayer because the language of petition is
predominant. With a just cause, sincerely presented, the writer prays
for a just decision and help and protection. Pleading former mercies as
a ground of hope, he urges his prayer in view of the malice, pride,
rapacity, and selfishness of his foes, whose character is contrasted
with his pious devotion and delight in God's favor. ([Psa
17:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#001))

sentence--acquitting judgment.

from thy presence--Thy tribunal.

things that are equal--just and right, do Thou regard.

[Psalms 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 17:3</span></span>

proved . . . visited . . . tried--His character was most rigidly tested,
at all times, and by all methods, affliction and others ([Psa
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#010)).

purposed that, &c.--or, my mouth does not exceed my purpose; I am
sincere.

[Psalms 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 17:4</span></span>

works of men--sinful practices.

by the word of thy lips--as a guide ([Psa
119:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#009), [Psa
119:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#011), [Psa
119:95](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#095)).

destroyer--violent man.

[Psalms 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 17:5</span></span>

May be read as an assertion "my steps or goings have held on to Thy
paths."

[Psalms 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 17:6</span></span>

wilt hear me--that is, graciously ([Psa
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#004)).

[Psalms 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 17:7</span></span>

Show--set apart as special and eminent ([Exo
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#018); [Psa
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#003)).

thy right hand--for Thy power.

[Psalms 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 17:8</span></span>

Similar figures, denoting the preciousness of God's people in His sight,
in [Deu 32:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#010); [Mat
23:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#037).

[Psalms 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 17:9</span></span>

compass me--(compare [Psa 118:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#010)).

[Psalms 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 17:10</span></span>

enclosed . . . fat--are become proud in prosperity, and insolent to God
([Deu 32:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#015); [Psa
73:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#007)).

[Psalms 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 17:11</span></span>

They pursue us as beasts tracking their prey.

[Psalms 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 17:12</span></span>

The figure made more special by that of a lion lurking.

[Psalms 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 17:13</span></span>

disappoint--literally, "come before," or, "encounter him." Supply "with"
before "sword" ([Psa 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#013)), and
"hand" ([Psa 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#014)). These denote
God's power.

[Psalms 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 17:14</span></span>

men . . . world--all men of this present time. They appear, by fulness
of bread and large families, to be prosperous; but ([Psa
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#015)) he implies this will be
transient, contrasting his better portion in a joyful union with God
hereafter.
