### [Jeremiah Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 8:1</span></span>

THE JEW'S COMING PUNISHMENT; THEIR UNIVERSAL AND INCURABLE IMPENITENCE.
(Jer. 8:1-22)

The victorious Babylonians were about to violate the sanctuaries of the
dead in search of plunder; for ornaments, treasures, and insignia of
royalty were usually buried with kings. Or rather, their purpose was to
do the greatest dishonor to the dead ([Isa
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#019)).

[Jeremiah 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 8:2</span></span>

spread . . . before the sun, &c.--retribution in kind. The very objects
which received their idolatries shall unconcernedly witness their
dishonor.

lover . . . served . . . after . . . walked . . . sought . . .
worshipped--Words are accumulated, as if enough could not be said fully
to express the mad fervor of their idolatry to the heavenly host ([Kg2
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#005)).

nor . . . buried-- ([Jer 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#019)).

dung-- ([Jer 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#022); [Psa
83:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#010)).

[Jeremiah 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 8:3</span></span>

The survivors shall be still worse off than the dead ([Job
3:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#021); [Rev
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#006)).

which remain in all the places--"in all places of them that remain,
whither I . . . that is, in all places whither I have driven them that
remain \[MAURER\].

[Jeremiah 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 8:4</span></span>

"Is it not a natural instinct, that if one falls, he rises again; if one
turns away (that is, wanders from the way), he will return to the point
from which he wandered? Why then does not Jerusalem do so?" He plays on
the double sense of return; literal and metaphorical ([Jer
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#012); [Jer
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#001)).

[Jeremiah 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 8:5</span></span>

slidden . . . backsliding--rather, as the Hebrew is the same as in [Jer
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#004), to which this verse refers,
"turned away with a perpetual turning away."

perpetual--in contrast to the "arise" ("rise again," [Jer
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#004)).

refuse to return--in contrast to, "shall he . . . not return" ([Jer
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#004); [Jer
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#003)).

[Jeremiah 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 8:6</span></span>

spake not aright--that is, not so as penitently to confess that they
acted wrong. Compare what follows.

every one . . . his course--The Keri reads "course," but the Chetib,
"courses." "They persevere in the courses whatever they have once
entered on." Their wicked ways were diversified.

horse rusheth--literally, "pours himself forth," as water that has burst
its embankment. The mad rapidity of the war horse is the point of
comparison ([Job 39:19-25](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#019)).

[Jeremiah 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 8:7</span></span>

The instinct of the migratory birds leads them with unfailing regularity
to return every spring from their winter abodes in summer climes ([Sol
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#012)); but God's people will not
return to Him even when the winter of His wrath is past, and He invites
them back to the spring of His favor.

in the heaven--emphatical. The birds whose very element is the air, in
which they are never at rest, yet show a steady sagacity, which God's
people do not.

times--namely, of migrating, and of returning.

my people--This honorable title aggravates the unnatural perversity of
the Jews towards their God.

know not, &c.-- ([Jer 5:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#004); [Isa
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#003)).

[Jeremiah 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 8:8</span></span>

law . . . with us-- ([Rom 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#017)).
Possessing the law, on which they prided themselves, the Jews might have
become the wisest of nations; but by their neglecting its precepts, the
law became given "in vain," as far as they were concerned.

scribes--copyists. "In vain" copies were multiplied. MAURER translates,
"The false pen of the scribes hath converted it \[the law\] into a lie."
See Margin, which agrees with Vulgate.

[Jeremiah 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 8:9</span></span>

dismayed--confounded.

what wisdom--literally, "the wisdom of what?" that is, "wisdom in what
respect?" the Word of the Lord being the only true source of wisdom
([Psa 119:98-100](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#098); [Pro
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#007); [Pro
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#010)).

[Jeremiah 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 8:10</span></span>

Repeated from [Jer 6:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#012). See a
similar repetition, [Jer 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#015); [Jer
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#019).

inherit--succeed to the possession of them.

[Jeremiah 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 8:11</span></span>

([Eze 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#010)).

[Jeremiah 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 8:13</span></span>

surely consume--literally, "gathering I will gather," or "consuming I
will consume."

no grapes . . . nor figs-- ([Joe 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#007);
[Mat 21:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#019)).

things that I have given . . . shall pass away--rather, "I will appoint
to them those who shall overwhelm (pass over) them," that is, I will
send the enemy upon them \[MAURER\]. English Version accords well with
the context; Though their grapes and figs ripen, they shall not be
allowed to enjoy them.

[Jeremiah 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 8:14</span></span>

assemble--for defense.

let us be silent--not assault the enemy, but merely defend ourselves in
quiet, until the storm blow over.

put us to silence--brought us to that state that we can no longer resist
the foe; implying silent despair.

water of gall--literally, "water of the poisonous plant," perhaps the
poppy ([Jer 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#015); [Jer
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#015)).

[Jeremiah 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 8:15</span></span>

Repeated ([Jer 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#019)).

We looked for--owing to the expectations held out by the false prophets.

health--healing; that is, restoration from adversity.

[Jeremiah 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 8:16</span></span>

his horses--the Chaldean's.

was heard--the prophetical past for the future.

from Dan--bordering on PhÅ“nicia. This was to be Nebuchadnezzar's route
in invading Israel; the cavalry in advance of the infantry would scour
the country.

strong ones--a poetical phrase for steeds, peculiar to Jeremiah ([Jer
47:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#003); compare [Jer
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#013), [Jer
4:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#029); [Jer
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#023)).

[Jeremiah 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 8:17</span></span>

I--Jehovah.

cockatrices--basilisks ([Isa 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#008)),
that is, enemies whose destructive power no means, by persuasion or
otherwise, can counteract. Serpent-charmers in the East entice serpents
by music, and by a particular pressure on the neck render them incapable
of darting ([Psa 58:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#004)).

[Jeremiah 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 8:18</span></span>

([Isa 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#004)). The lamentation of the
prophet for the impending calamity of his country.

against sorrow--or, with respect to sorrow. MAURER translates, "Oh, my
exhilaration as to sorrow!" that is, "Oh, that exhilaration ('comfort',
from an Arabic root, to shine as the rising sun) would shine upon me as
to my sorrow!"

in me--within me.

[Jeremiah 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 8:19</span></span>

The prophet in vision hears the cry of the exiled Jews, wondering that
God should have delivered them up to the enemy, seeing that He is Zion's
king, dwelling in her ([Mic 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#011)). In
the latter half of the verse God replies that their own idolatry, not
want of faithfulness on His part, is the cause.

because of them that dwell in a far country--rather, "from a land of
distances," that is, a distant land ([Isa
39:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#003)). English Version understands the
cry to be of the Jews in their own land, because of the enemy coming
from their far-off country.

strange vanities--foreign gods.

[Jeremiah 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 8:20</span></span>

Proverbial. Meaning: One season of hope after another has passed, but
the looked-for deliverance never came, and now all hope is gone.

[Jeremiah 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 8:21</span></span>

black--sad in visage with grief ([Joe
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#006)).

[Jeremiah 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 8:22</span></span>

balm--balsam; to be applied to the wounds of my people. Brought into
Judea first from Arabia Felix, by the queen of Sheba, in Solomon's time
\[JOSEPHUS, Antiquities, 8.2\]. The opobalsamum of PLINY; or else
\[BOCHART\] the resin drawn from the terebinth. It abounded in Gilead,
east of Jordan, where, in consequence, many "physicians" established
themselves ([Jer 46:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#011); [Jer
51:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#008); [Gen
37:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#025); [Gen
43:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#011)).

health . . . recovered--The Hebrew is literally, "lengthening out . . .
gone up"; hence, the long bandage applied to bind up a wound. So the
Arabic also \[GESENIUS\].
