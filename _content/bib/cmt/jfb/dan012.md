### [Daniel Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001)

[Daniel 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">dan 12:1</span></span>

CONCLUSION OF THE VISION (TENTH THROUGH TWELFTH CHAPTERS) AND EPILOGUE
TO THE BOOK. ([Dan 12:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001))

at that time--typically, towards the close of Antiochus' reign;
antitypically, the time when Antichrist is to be destroyed at Christ's
coming.

Michael--the guardian angel of Israel ("thy people"), ([Dan
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#013)). The transactions on earth
affecting God's people have their correspondences in heaven, in the
conflict between good and bad angels; so at the last great contest on
earth which shall decide the ascendency of Christianity ([Rev
12:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#007)). An archangel, not the Lord
Jesus; for he is distinguished from "the Lord" in [Jde
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#009).

there shall be--rather, "it shall be."

time of trouble, such as never was--partially applicable to the time of
Antiochus, who was the first subverter of the Jews' religion, and
persecutor of its professors, which no other world power had done. Fully
applicable to the last times of Antichrist, and his persecutions of
Israel restored to Palestine. Satan will be allowed to exercise an
unhindered, unparalleled energy ([Isa
26:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#020); [Jer
30:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#007); [Mat
24:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#021); compare [Dan
8:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#024); [Dan
11:36](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#036)).

thy people shall be delivered-- ([Rom
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#026)). The same deliverance of Israel
as in [Zac 13:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#008), "the third part . .
. brought through the fire . . . refined as silver." The remnant in
Israel spared, as not having joined in the Antichristian blasphemy ([Rev
14:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#009)); not to be confounded with
those who have confessed Christ before His coming, "the remnant
according to the election of grace" ([Rom
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#005)), part of the Church of the
first-born who will share His millennial reign in glorified bodies; the
spared remnant ([Isa 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#021)) will only
know the Lord Jesus when they see Him, and when the spirit of grace and
supplication is poured out on them \[TREGELLES\].

written in the book--namely, of God's secret purpose, as destined for
deliverance ([Psa 56:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#008); [Psa
69:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#028); [Luk
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#020); [Rev
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#015); [Rev
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#027)). Metaphor from a muster-roll of
citizens ([Neh 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#005)).

[Daniel 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">dan 12:2</span></span>

many . . . that sleep--"many from among the sleepers . . . these shall
be unto everlasting life; but those (the rest of the sleepers who do not
awake at this time) shall be unto shame" \[TREGELLES\]. Not the general
resurrection, but that of those who share in the first resurrection; the
rest of the dead being not to rise till the end of the thousand years
([Rev 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#003), [Rev
20:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#005); compare [Co1
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#023); [Th1
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#016)). Israel's national resurrection,
and the first resurrection of the elect Church, are similarly connected
with the Lord's coming forth out of His place to punish the earth in
[Isa 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#019), [Isa
26:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#021); [Isa
27:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#006). Compare [Isa
25:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#006). The Jewish commentators
support TREGELLES. AUBERLEN thinks the sole purpose for which the
resurrection is introduced in this verse is an incitement to faithful
perseverance in the persecutions of Antiochus; and that there is no
chronological connection between the time of trouble in [Dan
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001) and the resurrection in [Dan
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#002); whence the phrase, "at that
time," twice occurs in [Dan 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001), but
no fixing of time in [Dan 12:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#002); 2
Maccabees 7:9, 14, 23, shows the fruit of this prophecy in animating the
Maccabean mother and her sons to brave death, while confessing the
resurrection in words like those here. Compare [Heb
11:35](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#035). NEWTON'S view that "many" means
all, is not so probable; for [Rom
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#015), [Rom
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#019), which he quotes, is not in
point, since the Greek is "the many," that is, all, but there is no
article in the Hebrew here. Here only in the Old Testament is
"everlasting life" mentioned.

[Daniel 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">dan 12:3</span></span>

wise-- ([Pro 11:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#030)). Answering to
"they that understand" ([Dan 11:33](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#033),
[Dan 11:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#035)), the same Hebrew,
Maskilim; Israelites who, though in Jerusalem when wickedness is coming
to a head, are found intelligent witnesses against it. As then they
appeared worn out with persecutions (typically, of Antiochus;
antitypically, of Antichrist); so now in the resurrection they "shine as
the brightness of the firmament." The design of past afflictions here
appears "to make them white" ([Mat
13:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#043); [Rev
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#009), [Rev
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#014)).

turn . . . to righteousness--literally, "justify," that is, convert many
to justification through Christ ([Jam
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#020)).

stars-- ([Co1 15:41-42](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#041)).

[Daniel 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">dan 12:4</span></span>

shut up . . . seal the book--John, on the contrary, is told ([Rev
22:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#010)) not to seal his visions.
Daniel's prophecy refers to a distant time, and is therefore obscure for
the immediate future, whereas John's was to be speedily fulfilled ([Rev
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#001), [Rev
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#003); [Rev
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#006)). Israel, to whom Daniel
prophesied after the captivity, with premature zeal sought after signs
of the predicted period: Daniel's prophecy was designed to restrain
this. The Gentile Church, on the contrary, for whom John wrote, needs to
be impressed with the shortness of the period, as it is, owing to its
Gentile origin, apt to conform to the world, and to forget the coming of
the Lord (compare [Mat 25:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#013), [Mat
25:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#019); [Mar
13:32-37](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#032); [Pe2
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#008), [Pe2
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#012); [Rev
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#020)).

run to and fro--not referring to the modern rapidity of locomotion, as
some think, nor to Christian missionaries going about to preach the
Gospel to the world at large \[BARNES\], which the context scarcely
admits; but, whereas now but few care for this prophecy of God, "at the
time of the end," that is, near its fulfilment, "many shall run to and
fro," that is, scrutinize it, running through every page. Compare [Hab
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#002) \[CALVIN\]: it is thereby that
"the knowledge (namely, of God's purposes as revealed in prophecy) shall
be increased." This is probably being now fulfilled.

[Daniel 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">dan 12:5</span></span>

A vision of two other angels, one on one side of the Hiddekel or Tigris,
the other on the other side, implying that on all sides angels attend to
execute God's commands. The angel addressing Daniel had been over the
river "from above" ([Dan 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#006),
Margin).

[Daniel 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">dan 12:6</span></span>

one--namely, of the two ([Dan 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#005)).

man . . . in linen--who had spoken up to this point. God impelled the
angel to ask in order to waken us out of our torpor, seeing that the
very "angels desire to look into" the things affecting man's redemption
([Pe1 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#012)), as setting forth the
glory of their Lord and ours ([Eph
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#010)).

How long . . . to the end of these wonders--This question of the angel
refers to the final dealings of God in general, Antichrist's overthrow,
and the resurrection. Daniel's question ([Dan
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#008)) refers to the more immediate
future of his nation \[AUBERLEN\].

[Daniel 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">dan 12:7</span></span>

held up . . . right . . . and . . . left hand--Usually the right hand
was held up in affirmation as an appeal to heaven to attest the truth
([Deu 32:40](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#040); [Rev
10:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#005)). Here both hands are lifted up
for the fuller confirmation.

time, times, and a half--(See on [Dan
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#025)). NEWTON, referring this prophecy
to the Eastern apostasy, Mohammedanism, remarks that the same period of
three and a half years, or 1260 prophetic days, is assigned to it as the
Western apostasy of the little horn ([Dan
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#025)); and so, says PRIDEAUX, Mohammed
began to forge his imposture, retiring to his cave, A.D. 606, the very
year that Phocas made the grant to the bishop of Rome, whence he assumed
the title, The Universal Pastor; Antichrist thus setting both his feet
on Christendom together, the one in the East, and the other in the West.
Three and a half is the time of the world power, in which the earthly
kingdoms rule over the heavenly \[AUBERLEN\]. "Three and a half"
represents the idea of spiritual trial; (besides this certain symbolical
meaning, there is doubtless an accurate chronological meaning, which is
as yet to us uncertain): it is half of "seven," the complete number, so
a semi-perfect state, one of probation. The holy city is trodden by the
Gentiles forty-two months ([Rev 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#002)),
so the exercise of the power of the beast ([Rev
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#005)). The two witnesses preach in
sackcloth 1260 days, and remained unburied three days and a half: so the
woman in the wilderness: also the same for a "time, times, and a half"
([Rev 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#003), [Rev
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#009), [Rev
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#011); [Rev
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#006), [Rev
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#014)). Forty-two connects the Church
with Israel, whose haltings in the wilderness were forty-two (Num.
33:1-50). The famine and drought on Israel in Elijah's days were for
"three years and six months" ([Luk
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#025); [Jam
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#017)); there same period as Antiochus'
persecution: so the ministry of the Man of Sorrows, which ceased in the
midst of a week ([Dan 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027))
\[WORDSWORTH, Apocalypse\].

scatter . . . holy people--"accomplished" here answers to "the
consummation" ([Dan 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027)), namely, the
"pouring out" of the last dregs of the curse on the "desolated holy
people." Israel's lowest humiliation (the utter "scattering of her
power") is the precursor of her exaltation, as it leads her to seek her
God and Messiah ([Mat 23:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#039)).

[Daniel 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">dan 12:8</span></span>

understood not--Daniel "understood" the main features of the vision as
to Antiochus ([Dan 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#001), [Dan
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#014)), but not as to the times. [Pe1
1:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#010) refers mainly to Daniel: for
it is he who foretells "the sufferings of Christ and the glory that
should follow"; it is he who prophesies "not unto himself, but unto us";
it is he who "searched what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ
in him did signify."

[Daniel 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">dan 12:9</span></span>

Daniel's desire of knowing more is thus deferred "till the time of the
end." John's Revelation in part reveals what here is veiled (see on [Dan
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#004); [Dan
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#026)).

[Daniel 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">dan 12:10</span></span>

There is no need of a fuller explanation as to the time; for when the
predictions so far given shall have come to pass, the godly shall be
"purified" by the foretold trials and shall understand that the end is
at hand; but the wicked shall not understand, and so shall rush on to
their own ruin ([Dan 11:33-35](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#033))
\[MAURER\]. The "end" is primarily, of Antiochus' persuasion;
antitypically, the end of Antichrist's. It is the very clearness in the
main which renders necessary the obscurity. The fulfilment of God's
decree is not a mere arithmetical problem which the profane may
understand by arithmetical calculations, but a holy enigma to stimulate
to a faithful observance of God's ways, and to a diligent study of the
history of God's people \[AUBERLEN\]. To this Christ refers ([Mat
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#015)), "Whose readeth, let him
understand."

[Daniel 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">dan 12:11</span></span>

from . . . sacrifice . . . taken way . . . abomination-- ([Dan
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#031)). As to this epoch, which
probably is prophetically germinant and manifold; the profanation of the
temple by Antiochus (in the month Ijar of the year 145 B.C., till the
restoration of the worship by Judas Maccabeus on the twenty-fifth day of
the ninth month \[Chisleu\] of 148 B.C., according to the Seleucid era,
1290 days; forty-five days more elapsed before Antiochus' death in the
month Shebat of 148 B.C., so ending the Jews' calamities \[MAURER\]); by
pagan Rome, after Christ's death; by Mohammed; by Antichrist, the
culmination of apostate Rome. The "abomination" must reach its climax
(see AUBERLEN'S translation, "summit," [Dan
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027)), and the measure of iniquity be
full, before Messiah comes.

thousand two hundred and ninety days--a month beyond the "time, times,
and a half" ([Dan 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#007)). In [Dan
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#012), forty-five days more are added,
in all 1335 days. TREGELLES thinks Jesus at His coming will deliver the
Jews. An interval elapses, during which their consciences are awakened
to repentance and faith in Him. A second interval elapses in which
Israel's outcasts are gathered, and then the united blessing takes
place. These stages are marked by the 1260, 1290, and 1335 days. CUMMING
thinks the 1260 years begin when Justinian in 533 subjected the Eastern
churches to John II, bishop of Rome; ending in 1792, when the Code
Napoleon was established and the Pope was dishonored. 1290 reach to
1822, about the time of the waning of the Turkish power, the successor
to Greece in the empire of the East. Forty-five years more end in 1867,
the end of "the times of the Gentiles." See [Lev
26:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#024), "seven times," that is, 7 X
360, or 2520 years: 652 B.C. is the date of Judah's captivity, beginning
under Manasseh 2520 from this date end in 1868, thus nearly harmonizing
with the previous date, 1867. See on [Dan
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#014). The seventh millenary of the
world \[CLINTON\] begins in 1862. Seven years to 1869 (the date of the
second advent) constitute the reign of the personal Antichrist; in the
last three and a half, the period of final tribulation, Enoch (or else
Moses) and Elijah, the two witnesses, prophesy in sackcloth. This theory
is very dubious (compare [Mat 24:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#036);
[Act 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#007); [Th1
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#002); [Pe2
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#010)); still the event alone can tell
whether the chronological coincidences of such theories are fortuitous,
or solid data on which to fix the future times. HALES makes the periods
1260, 1290, 1335, begin with the Roman destruction of Jerusalem and end
with the precursory dawn of the Reformation, the preaching of Wycliffe
and Huss.

[Daniel 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">dan 12:13</span></span>

rest--in the grave ([Job 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#017); [Isa
57:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#002)). He, like his people Israel, was
to wait patiently and confidently for the blessing till God's time. He
"received not the promise," but had to wait until the Christian elect
saints should be brought in, at the first resurrection, that he and the
older Old Testament saints "without us should not be made perfect" ([Heb
11:40](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#040)).

stand--implying justification unto life, as opposed to condemnation
([Psa 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#005)).
