### [Numbers Chapter 28](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#001)

[Numbers 28:2](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 28:2</span></span>

OFFERINGS TO BE OBSERVED. (Num. 28:1-31)

Command the children of Israel, and say unto them--The repetition of
several laws formerly enacted, which is made in this chapter, was
seasonable and necessary, not only on account of their importance and
the frequent neglect of them, but because a new generation had sprung up
since their first institution and because the Israelites were about to
be settled in the land where those ordinances were to be observed.

My offering, and my bread--used generally for the appointed offerings,
and the import of the prescription is to enforce regularity and care in
their observance.

[Numbers 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">num 28:9</span></span>

This is the burnt offering of every sabbath--There is no previous
mention of a Sabbath burnt offering, which was additional to the daily
sacrifices.

[Numbers 28:11](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">num 28:11</span></span>

And in the beginnings of your months ye shall offer a burnt offering
unto the Lord--These were held as sacred festivals; and though not
possessing the character of solemn feasts, they were distinguished by
the blowing of trumpets over the sacrifices ([Num
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#010)), by the suspension of all labor
except the domestic occupations of women ([Amo
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#005)), by the celebration of public
worship ([Kg2 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#023)), and by social or
family feasts ([Sa1 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#005)). These
observations are not prescribed in the law though they obtained in the
practice of a later time. The beginning of the month was known, not by
astronomical calculations, but, according to Jewish writers, by the
testimony of messengers appointed to watch the first visible appearance
of the new moon; and then the fact was announced through the whole
country by signal-fires kindled on the mountain tops. The new-moon
festivals having been common among the heathen, it is probable that an
important design of their institution in Israel was to give the minds of
that people a better direction; and assuming this to have been one of
the objects contemplated, it will account for one of the kids being
offered unto the Lord ([Num 28:15](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#015)),
not unto the moon, as the Egyptians and Syrians did. The Sabbath and the
new moon are frequently mentioned together.

[Numbers 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">num 28:16</span></span>

in the fourteenth day of the first month is the passover--The law for
that great annual festival is given ([Lev
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#005)), but some details are here
introduced, as certain specified offerings are prescribed to be made on
each of the seven days of unleavened bread \[[Num
28:18-25](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#018)\].

[Numbers 28:26](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">num 28:26</span></span>

in the day of the first-fruits . . . offer the burnt offering--A new
sacrifice is here ordered for the celebration of this festival, in
addition to the other offering, which was to accompany the first-fruits
([Lev 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#018)).
