### [Ezekiel Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#001)

[Ezekiel 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 19:1</span></span>

ELEGY OVER THE FALL OF DAVID'S HOUSE. ([Eze
19:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#001))

princes of Israel--that is, Judah, whose "princes" alone were recognized
by prophecy; those of the ten tribes were, in respect to the theocracy,
usurpers.

[Ezekiel 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 19:2</span></span>

thy mother--the mother of Jehoiachin, the representative of David's line
in exile with Ezekiel. The "mother" is Judea: "a lioness," as being
fierce in catching prey ([Eze 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#003)),
referring to her heathenish practices. Jerusalem was called Ariel (the
lion of God) in a good sense ([Isa
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#001)); and Judah "a lion's whelp . . .
a lion . . . an old lion" ([Gen 49:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#009)),
to which, as also to [Num 23:24](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#024); [Num
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#009), this passage alludes.

nourished . . . among young lions--She herself had "lain" among lions,
that is, had intercourse with the corruptions of the surrounding heathen
and had brought up the royal young ones similarly: utterly degenerate
from the stock of Abraham.

Lay down--or "couched," is appropriate to the lion, the Arab name of
which means "the coucher."

[Ezekiel 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 19:3</span></span>

young lion--Jehoahaz, son of Josiah, carried captive from Riblah to
Egypt by Pharaoh-necho ([Kg2 23:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#033)).

[Ezekiel 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 19:4</span></span>

The nations--Egypt, in the case of Jehoahaz, who probably provoked
Pharaoh by trying to avenge the death of his father by assailing the
bordering cities of Egypt ([Kg2
23:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#029)).

in their pit--image from the pitfalls used for catching wild beasts
([Jer 22:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#011)).

chains--or hooks, which were fastened in the noses of wild beasts (see
on [Eze 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#009)).

[Ezekiel 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 19:5</span></span>

saw that she had waited, and her hope was lost--that is, that her
long-waited-for hope was disappointed, Jehoahaz not being restored to
her from Egypt.

she took another of her whelps--Jehoiakim, brother of Jehoahaz, who was
placed on the throne by Pharaoh ([Kg2
23:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#034)), according to the wish of
Judah.

[Ezekiel 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 19:6</span></span>

went up and down among the lions--imitated the recklessness and tyranny
of the surrounding kings ([Jer
22:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#013)).

catch . . . prey--to do evil, gratifying his lusts by oppression ([Kg2
23:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#037)).

[Ezekiel 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 19:7</span></span>

knew . . . desolate palaces--that is, claimed as his own their palaces,
which he then proceeded to "desolate." The Hebrew, literally "widows";
hence widowed palaces ([Isa 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#022)).
VATABLUS (whom FAIRBAIRN follows) explains it, "He knew (carnally) the
widows of those whom he devoured" ([Eze
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#006)). But thus the metaphor and the
literal reality would be blended: the lion being represented as knowing
widows. The reality, however, often elsewhere thus breaks through the
veil.

fulness thereof--all that it contained; its inhabitants.

[Ezekiel 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 19:8</span></span>

the nations--the Chaldeans, Syrians, Moab, and Ammon ([Kg2
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#002)).

[Ezekiel 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 19:9</span></span>

in chains-- ([Ch2 36:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#006); [Jer
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#018)). Margin, "hooks"; perhaps
referring to the hook often passed through the nose of beasts; so, too,
through that of captives, as seen in the Assyrian sculptures (see on
[Eze 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#004)).

voice--that is, his roaring.

no more be heard upon the mountains--carrying on the metaphor of the
lion, whose roaring on the mountains frightens all the other beasts. The
insolence of the prince, not at all abated though his kingdom was
impaired, was now to cease.

[Ezekiel 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 19:10</span></span>

A new metaphor taken from the vine, the chief of the fruit-bearing
trees, as the lion is of the beasts of prey (see [Eze
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#006)).

in thy blood--"planted when thou wast in thy blood," that is, in thy
very infancy; as in [Eze 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#006), when
thou hadst just come from the womb, and hadst not yet the blood washed
from thee. The Jews from the first were planted in Canaan to take root
there \[CALVIN\]. GROTIUS translates as the Margin, "in thy quietness,"
that is, in the period when Judah had not yet fallen into her present
troubles. English Version is better. GLASSIUS explains it well,
retaining the metaphor, which CALVIN'S explanation breaks, "in the blood
of thy grapes," that is, in her full strength, as the red wine is the
strength of the grape. [Gen 49:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#011) is
evidently alluded to.

many waters--the well-watered land of Canaan ([Deu
8:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#007)).

[Ezekiel 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 19:11</span></span>

strong rods--princes of the royal house of David. The vine shot forth
her branches like so many scepters, not creeping lowly on the ground
like many vines, but trained aloft on a tree or wall. The mention of
their former royal dignity, contrasting sadly with her present sunken
state, would remind the Jews of their sins whereby they had incurred
such judgments.

stature-- ([Dan 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#011)).

among the thick branches--that is, the central stock or trunk of the
tree shot up highest "among its own branches" or offshoots, surrounding
it. Emblematic of the numbers and resources of the people. HENGSTENBERG
translates, "among the clouds." But [Eze
31:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#003), [Eze
31:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#010), [Eze
31:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#014), supports English Version.

[Ezekiel 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 19:12</span></span>

plucked up--not gradually withered. The sudden upturning of the state
was designed to awaken the Jews out of their torpor to see the hand of
God in the national judgment.

east wind--(See on [Eze 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#010)).

[Ezekiel 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 19:13</span></span>

planted--that is, transplanted. Though already "dried up" in regard to
the nation generally, the vine is said to be "transplanted" as regards
God's mercy to the remnant in Babylon.

dry . . . ground--Chaldea was well-watered and fertile; but it is the
condition of the captive people, not that of the land, which is referred
to.

[Ezekiel 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 19:14</span></span>

fire . . . out of a rod of her branches--The Jews' disaster was to be
ascribed, not so much to the Chaldeans as to themselves; the "fire out
of the rod" is God's wrath kindled by the perjury of Zedekiah ([Eze
17:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#018)). "The anger of the Lord"
against Judah is specified as the cause why Zedekiah was permitted to
rebel against Babylon ([Kg2 24:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#020);
compare [Jdg 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#015)), thus bringing
Nebuchadnezzar against Jerusalem.

no strong rod . . . sceptre to rule--No more kings of David's stock are
now to rule the nation. Not at least until "the Lord shall send the rod
of His strength ("Messiah," [Psa
110:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#002); [Isa
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001)) out of Zion," to reign first as
a spiritual, then hereafter as a literal king.

is . . . and shall be for a lamentation--Part of the lamentation (that
as to Jehoahaz and Jehoiakim) was matter of history as already
accomplished; part (as to Zedekiah) was yet to be fulfilled; or, this
prophecy both is a subject for lamentation, and shall be so to distant
posterity.
