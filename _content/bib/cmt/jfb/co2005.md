### [2 Corinthians Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#001)

[2 Corinthians 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co2 5:1</span></span>

THE HOPE ([Co2 4:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#017)) OF ETERNAL
GLORY IN THE RESURRECTION BODY. (2Co. 5:1-21)

For--Assigning the reason for the statement ([Co2
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#017)), that affliction leads to
exceeding glory.

we know--assuredly ([Co2 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#014); [Job
19:25](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#025)).

if--For all shall not die; many shall be "changed" without "dissolution"
([Co1 15:51-53](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#051)). If this daily
delivering unto death ([Co2 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#011))
should end in actual death.

earthly--not the same as earthy ([Co1
15:47](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#047)). It stands in contrast to "in
the heavens."

house of this tabernacle--rather, "house of the tabernacle." "House"
expresses more permanency than belongs to the body; therefore the
qualification, "of the tabernacle" (implying that it is shifting, not
stationary), is added (compare [Job
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#019); [Pe2
1:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#013)). It thus answers to the
tabernacle in the wilderness. Its wooden frame and curtains wore out in
course of time when Israel dwelt in Canaan, and a fixed temple was
substituted for it. The temple and the tabernacle in all essentials were
one; there was the same ark, the same cloud of glory. Such is the
relation between the "earthly" body and the resurrection body. The Holy
Spirit is enshrined in the believer's body as in a sanctuary ([Co1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#016)). As the ark went first in taking
down the wilderness tabernacle, so the soul (which like the ark is
sprinkled with blood of atonement, and is the sacred deposit in the
inmost shrine, [Ti2 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#012)) in the
dissolution of the body; next the coverings were removed, answering to
the flesh; lastly, the framework and boards, answering to the bones,
which are last to give way (Num. 4:1-49). Paul, as a tent-maker, uses an
image taken from his trade ([Act
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#003)).

dissolved--a mild word for death, in the case of believers.

we have--in assured prospect of possession, as certain as if it were in
our hands, laid up "in the heavens" for us. The tense is present
(compare [Joh 3:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#036); [Joh
6:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#047), "hath").

a building of God--rather "from God." A solid building, not a temporary
tabernacle or tent. "Our" body stands in contrast to "from God." For
though our present body be also from God, yet it is not fresh and
perfect from His hands, as our resurrection body shall be.

not made with hands--contrasted with houses erected by man's hands ([Co1
15:44-49](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#044)). So Christ's body is
designated, as contrasted with the tabernacle reared by Moses ([Mar
14:58](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#058); [Heb
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#011)). This "house" can only be the
resurrection body, in contrast to the "earthly house of the tabernacle,"
our present body. The intermediate state is not directly taken into
account. A comma should separate "eternal," and "in the heavens."

[2 Corinthians 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co2 5:2</span></span>

For in this--Greek, "For also in this"; "herein" ([Co2
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#010)). ALFORD takes it, "in this"
tabernacle. [Co2 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#004), which seems
parallel, favors this. But the parallelism is sufficiently exact by
making "in this we groan" refer generally to what was just said ([Co2
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#001)), namely, that we cannot obtain
our "house in the heavens" except our "earthly tabernacle" be first
dissolved by death.

we groan-- ([Rom 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#023)) under the
body's weaknesses now and liability to death.

earnestly desiring to be clothed upon--translate, "earnestly longing to
have ourselves clothed upon," &c., namely, by being found alive at
Christ's coming, and so to escape dissolution by death ([Co2
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#001), [Co2
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#004)), and to have our heavenly body
put on over the earthly. The groans of the saints prove the existence of
the longing desire for the heavenly glory, a desire which cannot be
planted by God within us in vain, as doomed to disappointment.

our house--different Greek from that in [Co2
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#001); translate, "our habitation," "our
domicile"; it has a more distinct reference to the inhabitant than the
general term "house" ([Co2 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#001))
\[BENGEL\].

from heaven--This domicile is "from heaven" in its origin, and is to be
brought to us by the Lord at His coming again "from heaven" ([Th1
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#016)). Therefore this "habitation" or
"domicile" is not heaven itself.

[2 Corinthians 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co2 5:3</span></span>

If so be, &c.--Our "desire" holds good, should the Lord's coming find us
alive. Translate, "If so be that having ourselves clothed (with our
natural body, compare [Co2 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#004)) we
shall not be found naked (stripped of our present body)."

[2 Corinthians 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co2 5:4</span></span>

For--resuming [Co2 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#002).

being burdened: not for that--rather, "in that we desire not to have
ourselves unclothed (of our present body), but clothed upon (with our
heavenly body).

that mortality, &c.--rather, "that what is mortal (our mortal part) may
be swallowed up of (absorbed and transformed into) life." Believers
shrink from, not the consequences, but the mere act of dying; especially
as believing in the possibility of their being found alive at the Lord's
coming ([Th1 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#015)), and so of having
their mortal body absorbed into the immortal without death. Faith does
not divest us of all natural feeling, but subordinates it to higher
feeling. Scripture gives no sanction to the contempt for the body
expressed by philosophers.

[2 Corinthians 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co2 5:5</span></span>

wrought us--framed us by redemption, justification, and sanctification.

for the selfsame thing--"unto" it; namely, unto what is mortal of us
being swallowed up in life ([Co2 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#004)).

who also--The oldest manuscripts omit "also."

earnest of the Spirit--(See on [Co2
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#022)). It is the Spirit (as "the
first-fruits") who creates in us the groaning desire for our coming
deliverance and glory ([Rom 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#023)).

[2 Corinthians 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co2 5:6</span></span>

Translate as Greek, "Being therefore always confident and knowing," &c.
He had intended to have made the verb to this nominative, "we are
willing" (rather, "well content"), but digressing on the word
"confident" ([Co2 5:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#006)), he resumes
the word in a different form, namely, as an assertion: "We are confident
and well content." "Being confident . . . we are confident" may be the
Hebraic idiom of emphasis; as [Act
7:34](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#034), Greek, "Having seen, I have
seen," that is, I have surely seen.

always--under all trials. BENGEL makes the contrast between "always
confident" and "confident" especially at the prospect of being "absent
from the body." We are confident as well at all times, as also most of
all in the hope of a blessed departure.

whilst . . . at home . . . absent--Translate as Greek, "While we sojourn
in our home in the body, we are away from our home in the Lord." The
image from a "house" is retained (compare [Phi
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#020); [Heb
11:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#013); [Heb
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#014)).

[2 Corinthians 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co2 5:7</span></span>

we walk--in our Christian course here on earth.

not by sight--Greek, "not by appearance." Our life is governed by faith
in our immortal hope; not by the outward specious appearance of present
things \[TITTMANN, Greek Synonyms of the New Testament\]. Compare
"apparently," the Septuagint, "by appearance," [Num
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#008). WAHL supports English Version.
[Co2 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#018) also confirms it (compare
[Rom 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#024); [Co1
13:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#012)). God has appointed in this
life faith for our great duty, and in the next, vision for our reward
\[SOUTH\] ([Pe1 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#008)).

[2 Corinthians 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co2 5:8</span></span>

willing--literally, "well content." Translate also, "To go (literally,
migrate) from our home in the body, and to come to our home with the
Lord." We should prefer to be found alive at the Lord's coming, and to
be clothed upon with our heavenly body ([Co2
5:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#002)). But feeling, as we do, the
sojourn in the body to be a separation from our true home "with the
Lord," we prefer even dissolution by death, so that in the intermediate
disembodied state we may go to be "with the Lord" ([Phi
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#023)). "To be with Christ" (the
disembodied state) is distinguished from Christ's coming to take us to
be with Him in soul and body ([Th1
4:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#014), "with the Lord"). Perhaps the
disembodied spirits of believers have fulness of communion with Christ
unseen; but not the mutual recognition of one another, until clothed
with their visible bodies at the resurrection (compare [Th1
4:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#013)), when they shall with joy
recognize Christ's image in each other perfect.

[2 Corinthians 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co2 5:9</span></span>

Wherefore--with such a sure "confidence" of being blessed, whether we
die before, or be found alive at Christ's coming.

we labour--literally, "make it our ambition"; the only lawful ambition.

whether present or absent--whether we be found at His coming present in
the body, or absent from it.

accepted--Greek, "well-pleasing."

[2 Corinthians 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co2 5:10</span></span>

appear--rather, "be made manifest," namely, in our true character. So
"appear," Greek, "be manifested" ([Col
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#004); compare [Co1
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#005)). We are at all times, even now,
manifest to God; then we shall be so to the assembled intelligent
universe and to ourselves: for the judgment shall be not only in order
to assign the everlasting portion to each, but to vindicate God's
righteousness, so that it shall be manifest to all His creatures, and
even to the conscience of the sinner himself.

receive--His reward of grace proportioned to "the things done," &c.
([Co2 9:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#006); [Jo2
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#008)). Though salvation be of grace
purely, independent of works, the saved may have a greater or less
reward, according as he lives to, and labors for, Christ more or less.
Hence there is scope for the holy "ambition" (see on [Co2
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#009); [Heb
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#010)). This verse guards against the
Corinthians supposing that all share in the house "from heaven" ([Co2
5:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#001)). There shall be a searching
judgment which shall sever the bad from the good, according to their
respective,deeds, the motive of the deeds being taken into account, not
the mere external act; faith and love to God are the sole motives
recognized by God as sound and good ([Mat
12:36-37](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#036); [Mat
25:35-45](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#035)),

done in his body--The Greek may be, "by the instrumentality of the
body"; but English Version is legitimate (compare Greek, [Rom
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#027)). Justice requires that
substantially the same body which has been the instrument of the
unbelievers' sin, should be the object of punishment. A proof of the
essential identity of the natural and the resurrection body.

[2 Corinthians 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co2 5:11</span></span>

terror of the Lord--the coming judgment, so full of terrors to
unbelievers \[ESTIUS\]. ELLICOTT and ALFORD, after GROTIUS and BENGEL,
translate, "The fear of the Lord" ([Co2
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#001); [Ecc
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#013); [Act
9:31](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#031); [Rom
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#018); [Eph
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#021)).

persuade--Ministers should use the terrors of the Lord to persuade men,
not to rouse their enmity ([Jde 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#023)).
BENGEL, ESTIUS, and ALFORD explain: "Persuade men" (by our whole lives,
[Co2 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#013)), namely, of our integrity
as ministers. But this would have been expressed after "persuade," had
it been the sense. The connection seems as follows: He had been accused
of seeking to please and win men, he therefore says (compare [Gal
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#010)), "It is as knowing the terror
(or fear) of the Lord that we persuade men; but (whether men who hear
our preaching recognize our sincerity or not) we are made manifest unto
God as acting on such motives ([Co2
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#002)); and I trust also in your
consciences." Those so "manifested" need have no "terror" as to their
being "manifested (English Version, 'appear') before the judgment-seat"
([Co2 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#010)).

[2 Corinthians 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co2 5:12</span></span>

For--the reason why he leaves the manifestation of his sincerity in
preaching to their consciences ([Co2
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#001)), namely, his not wishing to
"commend" himself again.

occasion to glory-- ([Co2 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#014)),
namely, as to our sincerity.

in appearance--Greek, "face" (compare [Sa1
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#007)). The false teachers gloried in
their outward appearance, and in external recommendations ([Co2
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#018)) their learning, eloquence,
wisdom, riches, not in vital religion in their heart. Their conscience
does not attest their inward sincerity, as mine does ([Co2
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#012)).

[2 Corinthians 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co2 5:13</span></span>

be--rather as Greek, "have been." The contrast is between the single act
implied by the past tense, "If we have ever been beside ourselves," and
the habitual state implied by the present, "Or whether we be sober,"
that is, of sound mind. beside ourselves--The accusation brought by
Festus against him ([Act 26:24](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#024)). The
holy enthusiasm with which he spake of what God effected by His
apostolic ministry, seemed to many to be boasting madness.

sober--humbling myself before you, and not using my apostolic power and
privileges.

to God . . . for your cause--The glorifying of his office was not for
his own, but for God's glory. The abasing of himself was in adaptation
to their infirmity, to gain them to Christ ([Co1
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#022)).

[2 Corinthians 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co2 5:14</span></span>

For--Accounting for his being "beside himself" with enthusiasm: the love
of Christ towards us (in His death for us, the highest proof of it, [Rom
5:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#006)), producing in turn love in us
to Him, and not mere "terror" ([Co2
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#011)).

constraineth us--with irresistible power limits us to the one great
object to the exclusion of other considerations. The Greek implies to
compress forcibly the energies into one channel. Love is jealous of any
rival object engrossing the soul ([Co2
11:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#001)).

because we thus judge--literally, "(as) having judged thus"; implying a
judgment formed at conversion, and ever since regarded as a settled
truth.

that if--that is, that since. But the oldest manuscripts omit "if."
"That one died for all (Greek, 'in behalf of all')." Thus the following
clause will be, "Therefore all (literally, 'the all,' namely, for whom
He 'died') died." His dying is just the same as if they all died; and in
their so dying, they died to sin and self, that they might live to God
their Redeemer, whose henceforth they are ([Rom
6:2-11](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#002); [Gal
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#020); [Col
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#003); [Pe1
4:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#001)).

[2 Corinthians 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co2 5:15</span></span>

they which live--in the present life ([Co2
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#011), "we which live") \[ALFORD\]; or,
they who are thus indebted to Him for life of soul as well as body
\[MENOCHIUS\].

died for them--He does not add, "rose again for them," a phrase not
found in Paul's language \[BENGEL\]. He died in their stead, He arose
again for their good, "for (the effecting of) their justification" ([Rom
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#025)), and that He might be their Lord
([Rom 14:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#007)). ELLICOTT and ALFORD
join "for them" with both "died" and "rose again"; as Christ's death is
our death, so His resurrection is our resurrection; Greek, "Who for them
died and rose again."

not henceforth--Greek, "no longer"; namely, now that His death for them
has taken place, and that they know that His death saves them from death
eternal, and His resurrection life brings spiritual and everlasting life
to them.

[2 Corinthians 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co2 5:16</span></span>

Wherefore--because of our settled judgment ([Co2
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#014)),

henceforth--since our knowing Christ's constraining love in His death
for us.

know we no man after the flesh--that is, according to his mere worldly
and external relations ([Co2 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#018);
[Joh 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#015); [Phi
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#004)), as distinguished from what he is
according to the Spirit, as a "new creature" ([Co2
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#017)). For instance, the outward
distinctions of Jew or Gentile, rich or poor, slave or free, learned or
unlearned, are lost sight of in the higher life of those who are dead in
Christ's death, and alive with Him in the new life of His resurrection
([Gal 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#006); [Gal
3:28](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#028)).

yea, though--The oldest manuscripts read, "if even."

known Christ after the flesh--Paul when a Jew had looked for a temporal
reigning, not a spiritual, Messiah. (He says "Christ," not Jesus: for he
had not known personally Jesus in the days of His flesh, but he had
looked for Christ or the Messiah). When once he was converted he no
longer "conferred with flesh and blood" ([Gal
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#016)). He had this advantage over the
Twelve, that as one born out of due time he had never known Christ save
in His heavenly life. To the Twelve it was "expedient that Christ should
go away" that the Comforter should come, and so they might know Christ
in the higher spiritual aspect and in His new life-giving power, and not
merely "after the flesh," in the carnal aspect of Him ([Rom
6:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#009); [Co1
15:45](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#045); [Pe1
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#018); [Pe1
4:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#001)). Doubtless Judaizing Christians
at Corinth prided themselves on the mere fleshly ([Co2
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#018)) advantage of their belonging to
Israel, the nation of Christ, or on their having seen Him in the flesh,
and thence claimed superiority over others as having a nearer connection
with Him ([Co2 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#012); [Co2
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#007)). Paul here shows the true aim
should be to know Him spiritually as new creatures ([Co2
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#015), [Co2
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#017)), and that outward relations
towards Him profit nothing ([Luk
18:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#019); [Joh
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#007), [Joh
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#022); [Phi
3:3-10](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#003)). This is at variance with both
Romish Mariolatry and transubstantiation. Two distinct Greek verbs are
used here for "know"; the first ("know we no man") means "to be
personally acquainted with"; the latter ("known Christ . . . know . . .
more") is to recognize, or estimate. Paul's estimate of Christ, or the
expected Messiah, was carnal, but is so now no more.

[2 Corinthians 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">co2 5:17</span></span>

Therefore--connected with the words in [Co2
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#016), "We know Christ no more after
the flesh." As Christ has entered on His new heavenly life by His
resurrection and ascension, so all who are "in Christ" (that is, united
to Him by faith as the branch is In the vine) are new creatures ([Rom
6:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#009)). "New" in the Greek implies a
new nature quite different from anything previously existing, not merely
recent, which is expressed by a different Greek word ([Gal
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#015)).

creature--literally, "creation," and so the creature resulting from the
creation (compare [Joh 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#003), [Joh
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#005); [Eph
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#010); [Eph
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#023); [Col
3:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#010)). As we are "in Christ," so
"God was in Christ" ([Co2 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#019)): hence
He is Mediator between God and us.

old things--selfish, carnal views (compare [Co2
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#016)) of ourselves, of other men, and
of Christ.

passed away--spontaneously, like the snow of early spring \[BENGEL\]
before the advancing sun.

behold--implying an allusion to [Isa
43:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#019); [Isa
65:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#017).

[2 Corinthians 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">co2 5:18</span></span>

all--Greek, "THE."

things--all our privileges in this new creation ([Co2
5:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#014)).

reconciled us--that is, restored us ("the world," [Co2
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#019)) to His favor by satisfying the
claims of justice against us. Our position judicially considered in the
eye of the law is altered, not as though the mediation of Christ had
made a change in God's character, nor as if the love of God was produced
by the mediation of Christ; nay, the mediation and sacrifice of Christ
was the provision of God's love, not its moving cause ([Rom
8:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#032)). Christ's blood was the price
paid at the expense of God Himself, and was required to reconcile the
exercise of mercy with justice, not as separate, but as the eternally
harmonious attributes in the one and the same God ([Rom
3:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025)). The Greek "reconcile" is
reciprocally used as in the Hebrew Hithpahel conjugation, appease,
obtain the favor of. [Mat 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#024), "Be
reconciled to thy brother"; that is, take measures that he be reconciled
to thee, as well as thou to him, as the context proves. Diallagethi,
however ([Mat 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#024)), implying mutual
reconciliation, is distinct from Katallagethi here, the latter referring
to the change of status wrought in one of the two parties. The manner of
God reconciling the world to Himself is implied ([Co2
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#019)), namely, by His "not imputing
their trespasses to them." God not merely, as subsequently, reconciles
the world by inducing them to lay aside their enmity, but in the first
instance, does so by satisfying His own justice and righteous enmity
against sin ([Psa 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#011)). Compare [Sa1
29:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#004), "Reconcile himself unto his
master"; not remove his own anger against his master, but his master's
against him \[ARCHBISHOP MAGEE, Atonement\]. The reconciling of men to
God by their laying aside their enmity is the consequence of God laying
aside His just enmity against their sin, and follows at [Co2
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#020).

to us--ministers ([Co2 5:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#019)).

[2 Corinthians 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">co2 5:19</span></span>

God was in Christ, reconciling--that is, God was BY Christ (in virtue of
Christ's intervention) reconciling," &c. Was reconciling" implies the
time when the act of reconciliation was being carried into effect ([Co2
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#021)), namely, when "God made Jesus,
who knew no sin, to be sin for us." The compound of "was" and the
participle "reconciling," instead of the imperfect (Greek), may also
imply the continuous purpose of God, from before the foundation of the
world, to reconcile man to Himself, whose fall was foreseen. The
expression " IN Christ" for "by Christ" may be used to imply
additionally that God was IN Christ ([Joh
10:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#038); [Joh
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#010)), and so by Christ (the God-man)
was reconciling . . . The Greek for "by" or "through" Christ (the best
manuscripts omit "Jesus"), [Co2 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#018),
is different. "In" must mean here in the person of Christ. The Greek
Katallasson implies "changing" or altering the judicial status from one
of condemnation to one of justification. The atonement (at-one-ment), or
reconciliation, is the removal of the bar to peace and acceptance with a
holy God, which His righteousness interposed against our sin. The first
step towards restoring peace between us and God was on God's side ([Joh
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#016)). The change therefore now to be
effected must be on the part of offending man, God the offended One
being already reconciled. It is man, not God, who now needs to be
reconciled, and to lay aside his enmity against God ([Rom
5:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#010)). ("We have received the
atonement" \[Greek, reconciliation\], cannot mean "We have received the
laying aside of our own enmity"). Compare [Rom
3:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#024).

the world--all men ([Col 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#020); [Jo1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#002)). The manner of the reconciling is
by His "not imputing to men their trespasses," but imputing them to
Christ the Sin-bearer. There is no incongruity that a father should be
offended with that son whom he loveth, and at that time offended with
him when he loveth him. So, though God loved men whom He created, yet He
was offended with them when they sinned, and gave His Son to suffer for
them, that through that Son's obedience He might be reconciled to them
(reconcile them to Himself, that is, restore them WITH JUSTICE to His
favor) \[BISHOP PEARSON, Exposition of the Creed\].

hath committed unto us--Greek, "hath put into our hands." "Us," that is,
ministers.

[2 Corinthians 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">co2 5:20</span></span>

for Christ . . . in Christ's stead--The Greek of both is the same:
translate in both cases "on Christ's behalf."

beseech . . . pray--rather, "entreat \[plead with you\] . . . beseech."
Such "beseeching" is uncommon in the case of "ambassadors," who
generally stand on their dignity (compare [Co2
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#002); [Th1
2:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#006)).

be ye reconciled to God--English Version here inserts "ye," which is not
in the original, and which gives the wrong impression, as if it were
emphatic thus: God is reconciled to you, be ye reconciled to God. The
Greek expresses rather, God was the RECONCILER in Christ . . . let this
reconciliation then have its designed effect. Be reconciled to God, that
is, let God reconcile you to Himself ([Co2
5:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#018)).

[2 Corinthians 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">co2 5:21</span></span>

For--omitted in the oldest manuscripts. The grand reason why they should
be reconciled to God, namely, the great atonement in Christ provided by
God, is stated without the "for" as being part of the message of
reconciliation ([Co2 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#019)).

he--God.

sin--not a sin offering, which would destroy the antithesis to
"righteousness," and would make "sin" be used in different senses in the
same sentence: not a sinful person, which would be untrue, and would
require in the antithesis "righteous men," not "righteousness"; but
"sin," that is, the representative Sin-bearer (vicariously) of the
aggregate sin of all men past, present, and future. The sin of the world
is one, therefore the singular, not the plural, is used; though its
manifestations are manifold ([Joh
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#029)). "Behold the Lamb of God, that
taketh away the SIN of the world." Compare "made a curse for us," [Gal
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#013).

for us--Greek, "in our behalf." Compare [Joh
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#014), Christ being represented by the
brazen serpent, the form, but not the substance, of the old serpent. At
His death on the cross the sin-bearing for us was consummated.

knew no sin--by personal experience ([Joh
8:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#046)) \[ALFORD\]. [Heb
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#026); [Pe1
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#022); [Jo1
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#005).

might be made--not the same Greek as the previous "made." Rather, "might
become."

the righteousness of God--Not merely righteous, but righteousness
itself; not merely righteousness, but the righteousness of God, because
Christ is God, and what He is we are ([Jo1
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#017)), and He is "made of God unto us
righteousness." As our sin is made over to Him, so His righteousness to
us (in His having fulfilled all the righteousness of the law for us all,
as our representative, [Jer 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#006); [Co1
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#030)). The innocent was punished
voluntarily as if guilty, that the guilty might be gratuitously rewarded
as if innocent ([Pe1 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#024)). "Such are
we in the sight of God the Father, as is the very Son of God himself"
\[HOOKER\].

in him--by virtue of our standing in Him, and in union with Him
\[ALFORD\].
