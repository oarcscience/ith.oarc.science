### [Psalms Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#001)

[Psalms 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 21:1</span></span>

The pious are led by the Psalmist to celebrate God's favor to the king
in the already conferred and in prospective victories. The doxology
added may relate to both Psalms; the preceding of petition, chiefly this
of thanksgiving, ascribing honor to God for His display of grace and
power to His Church in all ages, not only under David, but also under
his last greatest successor, "the King of the Jews." ([Psa
21:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#001))

thy strength . . . thy salvation--as supplied by Thee.

[Psalms 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 21:2</span></span>

The sentiment affirmed in the first clause is reaffirmed by the negation
of its opposite in the second.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 21:3</span></span>

([Psa 59:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#010); compare opposite, [Psa
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#013)).

blessings of goodness--which confer happiness.

[Psalms 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 21:4</span></span>

(Compare [Sa2 7:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#013)). The glory and
blessedness of the king as head of his line, including Christ, as well
as in being God's specially selected servant, exceeded that of all
others.

[Psalms 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 21:6</span></span>

made him most blessed--or set him "to be blessings," as Abraham ([Gen
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#002)).

with thy countenance--by sight of thee ([Psa
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#011)), or by Thy favor expressed by
the light of Thy countenance ([Num
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#025)), or both.

[Psalms 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 21:7</span></span>

The mediate cause is the king's faith, the efficient, God's mercy.

[Psalms 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 21:8</span></span>

The address is now made to the king.

hand--denotes power, and

right hand--a more active and efficient degree of its exercise.

find out--reach, lay hold of, indicating success in pursuit of his
enemies.

[Psalms 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 21:9</span></span>

The king is only God's agent.

anger--literally, "face," as appearing against them.

as a fiery oven--as in it.

[Psalms 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 21:10</span></span>

fruit--children ([Psa 37:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#025); [Hos
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#016)).

[Psalms 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 21:11</span></span>

This terrible overthrow, reaching to posterity, is due to their crimes
([Exo 20:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#005)).

[Psalms 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 21:12</span></span>

turn their back--literally, "place them \[as to the\] shoulder."

against the face of them--The shooting against their faces would cause
them to turn their backs in flight.

[Psalms 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 21:13</span></span>

The glory of all is ascribable to God alone.
