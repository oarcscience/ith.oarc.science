### [Psalms Chapter 51](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#001)

[Psalms 51:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 51:1</span></span>

On the occasion, compare [Sa2 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#012).
The Psalm illustrates true repentance, in which are comprised
conviction, confession, sorrow, prayer for mercy, and purposes of
amendment, and it is accompanied by a lively faith. (Psa. 51:1-19)

A plea for mercy is a confession of guilt.

blot out--as from a register.

transgressions--literally, "rebellions" ([Psa
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#013); [Psa
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001)).

[Psalms 51:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 51:2</span></span>

Wash me--Purity as well as pardon is desired by true penitents.

[Psalms 51:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 51:3</span></span>

For . . . before me--Conviction precedes forgiveness; and, as a gift of
God, is a plea for it ([Sa2 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#013);
[Psa 32:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#005); [Jo1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#009)).

[Psalms 51:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 51:4</span></span>

Against thee--chiefly, and as sins against others are violations of
God's law, in one sense only.

that . . . judgest--that is, all palliation of his crime is excluded; it
is the design in making this confession to recognize God's justice,
however severe the sentence.

[Psalms 51:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 51:5</span></span>

His guilt was aggravated by his essential, native sinfulness, which is
as contrary to God's requisitions of inward purity as are outward sins
to those for right conduct.

[Psalms 51:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 51:6</span></span>

thou shalt make, &c.--may be taken to express God's gracious purpose in
view of His strict requisition; a purpose of which David might have
availed himself as a check to his native love for sin, and, in not doing
so, aggravated his guilt.

truth . . . and . . .wisdom--are terms often used for piety (compare
[Job 28:28](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#028); [Psa
119:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#030)).

[Psalms 51:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 51:7</span></span>

A series of prayers for forgiveness and purifying.

Purge . . . hyssop--The use of this plant in the ritual ([Exo
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#022); [Num
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#006), [Num
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#018)) suggests the idea of atonement
as prominent here; "purge" refers to vicarious satisfaction ([Num
19:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#017)).

[Psalms 51:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 51:8</span></span>

Make . . . joy--by forgiving me, which will change distress to joy.

[Psalms 51:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 51:9</span></span>

Hide, &c.--Turn from beholding.

[Psalms 51:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 51:10</span></span>

Create--a work of almighty power.

in me--literally, "to me," or, "for me"; bestow as a gift, a heart free
from taint of sin ([Psa 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#004); [Psa
73:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#001)).

renew--implies that he had possessed it; the essential principle of a
new nature had not been lost, but its influence interrupted ([Luk
22:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#032)); for [Psa
51:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#011) shows that he had not lost God's
presence and Spirit ([Sa1 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#013)),
though he had lost the "joy of his salvation" ([Psa
51:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#012)), for whose return he prays.

right spirit--literally, "constant," "firm," not yielding to temptation.

[Psalms 51:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 51:12</span></span>

free spirit--"thy" ought not to be supplied, for the word "free" is,
literally, "willing," and "spirit" is that of David. "Let a willing
spirit uphold me," that is, with a soul willingly conformed to God's
law, he would be preserved in a right course of conduct.

[Psalms 51:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 51:13</span></span>

Then--Such will be the effect of this gracious work.

ways--of providence and human duty ([Psa
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#021), [Psa
18:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#030); [Psa
32:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#008); [Luk
22:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#032)).

[Psalms 51:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 51:14</span></span>

Deliver--or, "Free me" ([Psa 39:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#008))
from the guilt of murder ([Sa2
12:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#009); [Psa
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#006)).

righteousness--as in [Psa 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#017); [Psa
31:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#001).

[Psalms 51:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 51:15</span></span>

open . . . lips--by removing my sense of guilt.

[Psalms 51:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 51:16</span></span>

Praise is better than sacrifice ([Psa
50:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#014)), and implying faith, penitence,
and love, glorifies God. In true penitents the joys of pardon mingle
with sorrow for sin.

[Psalms 51:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 51:18</span></span>

Do good, &c.--Visit not my sin on Thy Church.

build . . . walls--is to show favor; compare [Psa
89:40](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#040), for opposite form and idea.

[Psalms 51:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 51:19</span></span>

God reconciled, material sacrifices will be acceptable ([Psa
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#005); compare [Isa
1:11-17](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#011)).
