<p>
<p>The prince is to go through the east gate without (open on the Sabbath only, to mark its peculiar sanctity) to the entrance of the gate of the inner court; he is to go no further, but "stand by the post" (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#014">Kg1 8:14</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#022">Kg1 8:22</A>, Solomon standing before the altar of the Lord in the presence of the congregation; also <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#014">Kg2 11:14</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#003">Kg2 23:3</A>, "by a pillar": the customary place), the court within belonging exclusively to the priests. There, as representative of the people, in a peculiarly near relation to God, he is to present his offerings to Jehovah, while at a greater distance, the people are to stand worshipping at the outer gate of the same entrance. The offerings on Sabbaths are larger than those of the Mosaic law, to imply that the worship of God is to be conducted by the prince and people in a more munificent spirit of self-sacrificing liberality than formerly.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">eze 46:12</A></FONT></span></p>Not only is he to perform official acts of worship on holy days and feasts, but in "voluntary" offerings daily he is to show his individual zeal, surpassing all his people in liberality, and so setting them a princely example.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze046.htm#016">Ezekiel 46:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">eze 46:16</A></FONT></span></p>The prince's possession is to be inalienable, and any portion given to a servant is to revert to his sons at the year of jubilee, that he may have no temptation to spoil his people of their inheritance, as formerly (compare Ahab and Naboth, 1Ki. 21:1-29). The mention of the year of jubilee implies that there is something literal meant, besides the spiritual sense. The jubilee year was restored after the captivity [JOSEPHUS, Antiquities, 14.10,6; 1 Maccabees 6:49]. Perhaps it will be restored under Messiah's coming reign. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#002">Isa 61:2-3</A>, where "the acceptable year of the Lord" is closely connected with the comforting of the mourners in Zion, and "the day of vengeance" on Zion's foes. The mention of the prince's sons is another argument against Messiah being meant by "the prince."

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">eze 46:19</A></FONT></span></p>Due regard is to be had for the sanctity of the officiating priests' food, by cooking courts being provided close to their chambers. One set of apartments for cooking was to be at the corners of the inner court, reserved for the flesh of the sin offerings, to be eaten only by the priests whose perquisite it was (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#025">Lev 6:25</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#007">Lev 7:7</A>), before coming forth to mingle again with the people; another set at the corners of the outer court, for cooking the flesh of the peace offerings, of which the people partook along with the priests. All this implies that no longer are the common and unclean to be confounded with the sacred and divine, but that in even the least things, as eating and drinking, the glory of God is to be the aim (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#031">Co1 10:31</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze046.htm#022">Ezekiel 46:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">eze 46:22</A></FONT></span></p>courts joined--FAIRBAIRN translates, "roofed" or "vaulted." But these cooking apartments seem to have been uncovered, to let the smoke and smell of the meat the more easily pass away. They were "joined" or "attached" to the walls of the courts at the corners of the latter [MENOCHIUS].
<p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">eze 46:23</A></FONT></span></p>boiling places--boilers. 
<p>
<p>under the rows--At the foot of the rows, that is, in the lowest part of the walls, were the places for boiling made.
<p>
<p>The happy fruit to the earth at large of God's dwelling with Israel in holy fellowship is that the blessing is no longer restricted to the one people and locality, but is to be diffused with comprehensive catholicity through the whole world. So the plant from the cedar of Lebanon is represented as gathering under its shelter "all fowl of every wing" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#023">Eze 17:23</A>). Even the desert places of the earth shall be made fruitful by the healing waters of the Gospel (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#001">Isa 35:1</A>).
