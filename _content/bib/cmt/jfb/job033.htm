<p>
<p>mouth--rather, "palate," whereby the taste discerns. Every man speaks with his mouth, but few, as Elihu, try their words with discrimination first, and only say what is really good (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#030">Job 6:30</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#011">Job 12:11</A>).

On the other hand, "the breath of the Almighty hath inspired me" (as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#008">Job 32:8</A>); not as English Version, "given me life"; therefore "I am according to thy wish (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#032">Job 9:32-33</A>) in God's stead" to thee; a "daysman," umpire, or mediator, between God and thee. So Elihu was designed by the Holy Ghost to be a type of Jesus Christ (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#023">Job 33:23-26</A>).

In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#030">Job 9:30</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#023">Job 13:23</A>, Job had acknowledged sin; but the general spirit of his words was to maintain himself to be "clean," and to charge God with injustice. He went too far on the opposite side in opposing the friends' false charge of hypocrisy. Even the godly, though willing to confess themselves sinners in general, often dislike sin in particular to be brought as a charge against them. Affliction is therefore needed to bring them to feel that sin in them deserves even worse than they suffer and that God does them no injustice. Then at last humbled under God they find, affliction is for their real good, and so at last it is taken away either here, or at least at death. To teach this is Elihu's mission.

It cannot be that God should jealously "watch" man, though "spotless," as an "enemy," or as one afraid of him as an equal. For "God is greater than man!" There must be sin in man, even though he be no hypocrite, which needs correction by suffering for the sufferer's good.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#013">Job 33:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">job 33:13</A></FONT></span></p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#009">Isa 45:9</A>). 
<p>
<p>his matters--ways. Our part is, not to "strive" with God, but to submit. To believe it is right because He does it, not because we see all the reasons for His doing it.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#014">Job 33:14</A></p>

Elihu implies that God's reason for sending affliction is because, when God has communicated His will in various ways, man in prosperity has not heeded it; God therefore must try what affliction will effect (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#002">Joh 15:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#011">Psa 62:11</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#010">Isa 28:10</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#013">Isa 28:13</A>).

Elihu has in view Eliphaz (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#013">Job 4:13</A>), and also Job himself (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#014">Job 7:14</A>). "Dreams" in sleep, and "visions" of actual apparitions, were among the ways whereby God then spake to man (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#003">Gen 20:3</A>).

So "business" in a bad sense (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#019">Sa1 20:19</A>). Elihu alludes to Job's words (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#011">Job 17:11</A>). "Pride," an open "pit" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#018">Job 33:18</A>) which God hides or covers up, lest man should fall into it. Even the godly need to learn the lesson which trials teach, to "humble themselves under the mighty hand of God."
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#018">Job 33:18</A></p>

<p>
<p>the pit--the grave; a symbol of hell. 
<p>
<p>perishing by the sword--that is, a violent death; in the Old Testament a symbol of the future punishment of the ungodly.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#019">Job 33:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">job 33:19</A></FONT></span></p>When man does not heed warnings of the night, he is chastened, &amp;c.

<p>
<p>multitude--so the Margin, Hebrew (Keri). Better with the text (Chetib), "And with the perpetual (strong) contest of his bones"; the never-resting fever in his bones (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#003">Psa 38:3</A>) [UMBREIT].
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#020">Job 33:20</A></p>

The taking away of desire for food by sickness symbolizes the removal by affliction of lust, for things which foster the spiritual fever of pride. 
<p>
<p>soul--desire.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#021">Job 33:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">job 33:21</A></FONT></span></p>His flesh once prominent "can no more be seen." His bones once not seen now appear prominent. 
<p>
<p>stick out--literally, "are bare." The Margin, Hebrew (Keri) reading. The text (Chetib) reads it a noun "(are become) bareness." The Keri was no doubt an explanatory reading of transcribers.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#022">Job 33:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">job 33:22</A></FONT></span></p>destroyers--angels of death commissioned by God to end man's life (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#016">Sa2 24:16</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#049">Psa 78:49</A>). The death pains personified may, however, be meant; so "gnawers" (see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#017">Job 30:17</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#023">Job 33:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">job 33:23</A></FONT></span></p>Elihu refers to himself as the divinely-sent (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#008">Job 32:8</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#006">Job 33:6</A>) "messenger," the "interpreter" to explain to Job and vindicate God's righteousness; such a one Eliphaz had denied that Job could look for (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#001">Job 5:1</A>), and Job (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#033">Job 9:33</A>) had wished for such a "daysman" or umpire between him and God. The "messenger" of good is antithetical to the "destroyers" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#023">Job 33:23</A>). 
<p>
<p>with him--if there be vouchsafed to the sufferer. The office of the interpreter is stated "to show unto man God's uprightness" in His dealings; or, as UMBREIT, "man's upright course towards God" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#002">Pro 14:2</A>). The former is better; Job maintained his own "uprightness" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#017">Job 16:17</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#005">Job 27:5-6</A>); Elihu on the contrary maintains God's, and that man's true uprightness lies in submission to God. "One among a thousand" is a man rarely to be found. So Jesus Christ (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#010">Sol 5:10</A>). Elihu, the God-sent mediator of a temporal deliverance, is a type of the God-man Jesus Christ the Mediator of eternal deliverance: "the messenger of the covenant" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001">Mal 3:1</A>). This is the wonderful work of the Holy Ghost, that persons and events move in their own sphere in such a way as unconsciously to shadow forth Him, whose "testimony is the Spirit of prophecy"; as the same point may be center of a small and of a vastly larger concentric circle.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#024">Job 33:24</A></p>

<p>
<p>he--God. 
<p>
<p>Deliver--literally, "redeem"; in it and "ransom" there is reference to the consideration, on account of which God pardons and relieves the sufferers; here it is primarily the intercession of Elihu. But the language is too strong for its full meaning to be exhausted by this. The Holy Ghost has suggested language which receives its full realization only in the "eternal redemption found" by God in the price paid by Jesus Christ for it; that is, His blood and meritorious intercession (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#012">Heb 9:12</A>). "Obtained," literally, "found"; implying the earnest zeal, wisdom, and faithfulness of the finder, and the newness and joyousness of the finding. Jesus Christ could not but have found it, but still His seeking it was needed [BENGEL], (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#008">Luk 15:8</A>). God the Father, is the Finder (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#019">Psa 89:19</A>). Jesus Christ the Redeemer, to whom He saith, Redeem (so Hebrew) him from going, &amp;c. (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#019">Co2 5:19</A>). 
<p>
<p>ransom--used in a general sense by Elihu, but meant by the Holy Ghost in its strict sense as applied to Jesus Christ, of a price paid for deliverance (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#030">Exo 21:30</A>), an atonement (that is, means of selling at once, that is, reconciling "two" who are estranged), a covering, as of the ark with pitch, typical of what covers us sinners from wrath (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#014">Gen 6:14</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001">Psa 32:1</A>). The pit is primarily here the grave (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#017">Isa 38:17</A>), but the spiritual pit is mainly shadowed forth (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#011">Zac 9:11</A>).
