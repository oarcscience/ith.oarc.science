### [2 Thessalonians Introduction](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#001)

[2 Thessalonians](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">th2 0:0</span></span>

Its GENUINENESS is attested by POLYCARP \[Epistle to the Philippians,
11\], who alludes to [Th2 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#015). JUSTIN
MARTYR \[Dialogue with Trypho, p. 193.32\], alludes to [Th2
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#003). IRENÃ†US \[Against Heresies,
7.2\] quotes [Th2 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#008). CLEMENT OF
ALEXANDRIA \[Miscellanies, 1.5, p. 554; The Instructor, 1.17\], quotes
[Th2 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#002), as Paul's words. TERTULLIAN
\[On the Resurrection of the Flesh, 24\] quotes [Th2
2:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#001), as part of Paul's Epistle.

DESIGN.--The accounts from Thessalonica, after the sending of the first
Epistle, represented the faith and love of the Christians there as on
the increase; and their constancy amidst persecutions unshaken. One
error of doctrine, however, resulting in practical evil, had sprung up
among them. The apostle's description of Christ's sudden second coming
([Th1 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#013), &c., and [Th1
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#002)), and the possibility of its being
at any time, led them to believe it was actually at hand. Some professed
to know by "the Spirit" ([Th2 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#002))
that it was so; and others alleged that Paul had said so when with them.
A letter, too, purporting to be from the apostle to that effect, seems
to have been circulated among them. (That [Th2
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#002) refers to such a spurious letter,
rather than to Paul's first Epistle, appears likely from the statement,
[Th2 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#017), as to his autograph
salutation being the mark whereby his genuine letters might be known).
Hence some neglected their daily business and threw themselves on the
charity of others, as if their sole duty was to wait for the coming of
the Lord. This error, therefore, needed rectifying, and forms a leading
topic of the second Epistle. He in it tells them (2Th. 2:1-17), that
before the Lord shall come, there must first be a great apostasy, and
the Man of Sin must be revealed; and that the Lord's sudden coming is no
ground for neglecting daily business; that to do so would only bring
scandal on the Church, and was contrary to his own practice among them
([Th2 3:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#007)), and that the faithful
must withdraw themselves from such disorderly professors ([Th2
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#006), [Th2
3:10-15](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#010)). Thus, there are three
divisions of the Epistle: (1) [Th2
1:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#001). Commendations of the
Thessalonians' faith, love, and patience, amidst persecutions. (2) 2Th.
2:1-17. The error as to the immediate coming of Christ corrected, and
the previous rise and downfall of the Man of Sin foretold. (3) 2Th.
3:1-16. Exhortations to orderly conduct in their whole walk, with
prayers for them to the God of peace, followed by his autograph
salutation and benediction.

DATE OF WRITING.--AS the Epistle is written in the joint names of
Timothy and Silas, as well as his own, and as these were with him while
at Corinth, and not with him for a long time subsequently to his having
left that city (compare [Act 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#018),
with [Act 19:22](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#022); indeed, as to Silas,
it is doubtful whether he was ever subsequently with Paul), it follows,
the place of writing must have been Corinth, and the date, during the
one "year and six months" of his stay there, [Act
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#011) (namely, beginning with the
autumn of A.D. 52, and ending with the spring of A.D. 54), say about six
months after his first Epistle, early in A.D. 53.

STYLE.--The style is not different from that of most of Paul's other
writings, except in the prophetic portion of it ([Th2
2:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#001)), which is distinguished from
them in subject matter. As is usual in his more solemn passages (for
instance, in the denunciatory and prophetic portions of his Epistles,
for example, compare [Col 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#008), [Col
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#016), with [Th2
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#003); [Co1
15:24-28](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#024), with [Th2
2:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#008); [Rom
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#018), with [Th2
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#008), [Th2
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#010)), his diction here is more lofty,
abrupt, and elliptical. As the former Epistle dwells mostly on the
second Advent in its aspect of glory to the sleeping and the living
saints (1Th. 4:1-5:28), so this Epistle dwells mostly on it in its
aspect of everlasting destruction to the wicked and him who shall be the
final consummation of wickedness, the Man of Sin. So far was Paul from
laboring under an erroneous impression as to Christ's speedy coming,
when he wrote his first Epistle (which rationalists impute to him), that
he had distinctly told them, when he was with them, the same truths as
to the apostasy being about first to arise, which he now insists upon in
this second Epistle ([Th2 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#005)).
Several points of coincidence occur between the two Epistles, confirming
the genuineness of the latter. Thus, compare [Th2
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#002), with [Th1
2:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#015); again, [Th2
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#009), the Man of Sin "coming after the
working of Satan," with [Th1 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#018);
[Th1 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#005), where Satan's incipient work
as the hinderer of the Gospel, and the tempter, appears; again, mild
warning is enjoined, [Th1 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#014); but,
in this second Epistle, when the evil had grown worse, stricter
discipline ([Th2 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#006), [Th2
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#014)): "withdraw from" the "company"
of such.

Paul probably visited Thessalonica on his way to Asia subsequently ([Act
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#004)), and took with him thence
Aristarchus and Secundus: the former became his "companion in travel"
and shared with him his perils at Ephesus, also those of his shipwreck,
and was his "fellow prisoner" at Rome ([Act
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#002); [Col
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#010); [Plm
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#024)). According to tradition he
became bishop of Apamea.
