### [Isaiah Chapter 36](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#001)

[Isaiah 36:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 36:1</span></span>

SENNACHERIB'S INVASION; BLASPHEMOUS SOLICITATIONS; HEZEKIAH IS TOLD OF
THEM. (Isa. 36:1-22)

fourteenth--the third of Sennacherib's reign. His ultimate object was
Egypt, Hezekiah's ally. Hence he, with the great body of his army ([Ch2
32:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#009)), advanced towards the Egyptian
frontier, in southwest Palestine, and did not approach Jerusalem.

[Isaiah 36:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 36:2</span></span>

Rab-shakeh--In [Kg2 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#017), Tartan and
Rab-saris are joined with him. Rab-shakeh was probably the chief leader;
Rab is a title of authority, "chief-cup-bearer."

Lachish--a frontier town southwest of Jerusalem, in Judah; represented
as a great fortified city in a hilly and fruitful country in the
Koyunjik bas-reliefs, now in the British Museum; also, its name is found
on a slab over a figure of Sennacherib on his throne.

upper pool--the side on which the Assyrians would approach Jerusalem
coming from the southwest (see on [Isa
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#003)).

[Isaiah 36:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 36:3</span></span>

Eliakim--successor to Shebna, who had been "over the household," that
is, chief minister of the king; in [Isa
22:15-20](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#015), this was foretold.

scribe--secretary, recorder--literally, "one who reminds"; a
remembrancer to keep the king informed on important facts, and to act as
historiographer. In [Kg2 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#018), the
additional fact is given that the Assyrian envoys "called to the king,"
in consequence of which Eliakim, &c., "came out to them."

[Isaiah 36:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 36:4</span></span>

great king--the usual title of the Persian and Assyrian kings, as they
had many subordinate princes or kings under them over provinces ([Isa
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#008)).

[Isaiah 36:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 36:5</span></span>

counsel--Egypt was famed for its wisdom.

[Isaiah 36:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 36:6</span></span>

It was a similar alliance with So (that is, Sabacho, or else Sevechus),
the Ethiopian king of Egypt, which provoked the Assyrian to invade and
destroy Israel, the northern kingdom, under Hoshea.

[Isaiah 36:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 36:7</span></span>

The Assyrian mistakes Hezekiah's religious reforms whereby he took away
the high places ([Kg2 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#004)) as
directed against Jehovah. Some of the high places may have been
dedicated to Jehovah, but worshipped under the form of an image in
violation of the second commandment: the "brazen serpent," also (broken
in pieces by Hezekiah, and called Nehushtan, "a piece of brass," because
it was worshipped by Israel) was originally set up by God's command.
Hence the Assyrian's allegation has a specious color: you cannot look
for help from Jehovah, for your king has "taken away His altars."

to Jerusalem-- ([Deu 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#005), [Deu
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#011); [Joh
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#020)).

[Isaiah 36:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 36:8</span></span>

give pledges--a taunting challenge. Only give the guarantee that you can
supply as many as two thousand riders, and I will give thee two thousand
horses. But seeing that you have not even this small number (see on [Isa
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#007)), how can you stand against the
hosts of Assyrian cavalry? The Jews tried to supply their weakness in
this "arm" from Egypt ([Isa 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#001)).

[Isaiah 36:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 36:9</span></span>

captain--a governor under a satrap; even he commands more horsemen than
this.

[Isaiah 36:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 36:10</span></span>

A boastful inference from the past successes of Assyria, designed to
influence the Jews to surrender; their own principles bound them to
yield to Jehovah's will. He may have heard from partisans in Judah what
Isaiah had foretold ([Isa 10:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005)).

[Isaiah 36:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 36:11</span></span>

Syrian--rather, "Aramean": the language spoken north and east of
Palestine, and understood by the Assyrians as belonging to the same
family of languages as their own: nearly akin to Hebrew also, though not
intelligible to the multitude (compare [Kg2
5:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#005)). "Aram" means a "high land,"
and includes parts of Assyria as well as Syria.

Jews' language--The men of Judah since the disruption of Israel, claimed
the Hebrew as their own peculiarly, as if they were now the only true
representatives of the whole Hebrew twelve tribes.

ears of . . . people on . . . wall--The interview is within hearing
distance of the city. The people crowd on the wall, curious to hear the
Assyrian message. The Jewish rulers fear that it will terrify the people
and therefore beg Rab-shakeh to speak Aramean.

[Isaiah 36:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 36:12</span></span>

Is it to thy master and thee that I am sent? Nay, it is to the men on
the wall, to let them know (so far am I from wishing them not to hear,
as you would wish), that unless they surrender, they shall be reduced to
the direst extremities of famine in the siege ([Ch2
32:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#011), explains the word here),
namely, to eat their own excrements: or, connecting, "that they may
eat," &c., with "sit upon the wall"; who, as they hold the wall, are
knowingly exposing themselves to the direst extremities \[MAURER\].
Isaiah, as a faithful historian, records the filthy and blasphemous
language of the Assyrians to mark aright the true character of the
attack on Jerusalem.

[Isaiah 36:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 36:13</span></span>

Rab-shakeh speaks louder and plainer than ever to the men on the wall.

[Isaiah 36:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 36:15</span></span>

The foes of God's people cannot succeed against them, unless they can
shake their trust in Him (compare [Isa
36:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#010)).

[Isaiah 36:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 36:16</span></span>

agreement . . . by . . . present--rather, "make peace with me";
literally, "blessing" so called from the mutual congratulations
attending the ratification of peace. So Chaldee. Or else, "Do homage to
me" \[HORSLEY\].

come out--surrender to me; then you may remain in quiet possession of
your lands till my return from Egypt, when I will lead you away to a
land fruitful as your own. Rab-shakeh tries to soften, in the eyes of
the Jews, the well-known Assyrian policy of weakening the vanquished by
deporting them to other lands ([Gen
47:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#021); [Kg2
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#006)).

[Isaiah 36:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 36:19</span></span>

Hamath . . . Arphad--(See on [Isa
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#009)).

Sepharvaim--literally, "the two scribes"; now Sipphara, on the east of
Euphrates, above Babylon. It was a just retribution ([Pro
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#031); [Jer
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#019)). Israel worshipped the gods of
Sepharvaim, and so colonists of Sepharvaim were planted in the land of
Israel (thenceforth called Samaria) by the Assyrian conqueror ([Kg2
17:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#024); compare [Kg2
18:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#034)).

Samaria--Shalmaneser began the siege against Hoshea, because of his
conspiring with So of Egypt ([Kg2
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#004)). Sargon finished it; and, in his
palace at Khorsabad, he has mentioned the number of Israelites carried
captive--27,280 \[G. V. SMITH\].

[Isaiah 36:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 36:20</span></span>

(Compare [Isa 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#011); [Ch2
32:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#019)). Here he contradicts his own
assertion ([Isa 36:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#010)), that he had
"come up against the land with the Lord." Liars need good memories. He
classes Jehovah with the idols of the other lands; nay, thinks Him
inferior in proportion as Judah, under His tutelage, was less than the
lands under the tutelage of the idols.

[Isaiah 36:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 36:21</span></span>

not a word--so as not to enter into a war of words with the blasphemer
([Exo 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#014); [Jde
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#009)).

[Isaiah 36:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 36:22</span></span>

clothes rent--in grief and horror at the blasphemy ([Mat
26:65](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#065)).
