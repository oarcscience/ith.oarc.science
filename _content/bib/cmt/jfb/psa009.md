### [Psalms Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#001)

[Psalms 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 9:1</span></span>

Upon Muthlabben, or, after the manner according to "death to the Son,"
by which some song was known, to whose air or melody the musician is
directed to perform this Psalm. This mode of denoting a song by some
prominent word or words is still common (compare [Psa
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#001)). The Psalmist praises God for
deliverance from his enemies and celebrates the divine government, for
providing security to God's people and punishment to the wicked. Thus
encouraging himself, he prays for new occasions to recount God's
mercies, and confident of His continued judgment on the wicked and
vindication of the oppressed, he implores a prompt and efficient
manifestation of the divine sovereignty. (Psa. 9:1-20)

Heartfelt gratitude will find utterance.

[Psalms 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 9:3</span></span>

When . . . are turned back--It is the result of God's power alone. He,
as a righteous Judge ([Psa 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#011)),
vindicates His people. He rebukes by acts as well as words ([Psa
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#001); [Psa
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#015)), and so effectually as to
destroy the names of nations as well as persons.

[Psalms 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 9:6</span></span>

Literally, "As to the enemy finished are his ruins for ever. Thou
\[God\] hast destroyed," &c. ([Sa1
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#003), [Sa1
15:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#007); [Sa1
27:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#008)). The wicked are utterly
undone. Their ruins shall never be repaired.

[Psalms 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 9:7</span></span>

God's eternal possession of a throne of justice is contrasted with the
ruin of the wicked.

[Psalms 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 9:9</span></span>

The oppressed, and all who know Him ([Psa
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#003); [Psa
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#001)), find Him a sure refuge.

[Psalms 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 9:11</span></span>

(Compare [Psa 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#006); [Psa
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#004)).

[Psalms 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 9:12</span></span>

for blood--that is, murders ([Psa
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#006)), including all the oppressions of
His people.

maketh inquisition--(compare [Gen
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#005)). He will avenge their cause.

[Psalms 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 9:13</span></span>

gates--or, "regions."

of death--Gates being the entrance is put for the bounds.

[Psalms 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 9:14</span></span>

gates . . . Zion--The enclosure of the city (compare [Psa
48:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#012); [Isa
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#012)), or, church, as denoted by this
phrase contrasted with that of death, carries out the idea of exaltation
as well as deliverance. Signal favors should lead us to render signal
and public thanks.

[Psalms 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 9:15</span></span>

The undesigned results of the devices of the wicked prove them to be of
God's overruling or ordering, especially when those results are
destructive to the wicked themselves.

[Psalms 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 9:16</span></span>

Higgaion--means "meditation," and, combined with Selah, seems to denote
a pause of unusual solemnity and emphasis (compare [Psa
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#002)). Though Selah occurs
seventy-three times, this is the only case in which Higgaion is found.
In the view which is given here of the retribution on the wicked as an
instance of God's wise and holy ordering, we may well pause in adoring
wonder and faith.

[Psalms 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 9:17</span></span>

shall be turned--or, "shall turn," retreating under God's vengeance, and
driven by Him to the extreme of destruction, even hell itself. Those who
forget God are classed with the depraved and openly profane.

[Psalms 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 9:18</span></span>

(Compare [Psa 13:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#001)).

the needy--literally, "poor," as deprived of anything; hence miserable.

expectation of the poor--or, "meek," "humble," made so by affliction.

[Psalms 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 9:19</span></span>

Arise--(compare [Psa 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#007)).

let not man-- ([Psa 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#004)).

let . . . be judged--and of course condemned.

[Psalms 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 9:20</span></span>

By their effectual subjection, make them to realize their frail nature
([Psa 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#004)), and deter them from all
conceit and future rebellion.
