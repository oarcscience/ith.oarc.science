### [Acts Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#001)

[Acts 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 17:1</span></span>

AT THESSALONICA THE SUCCESS OF PAUL'S PREACHING ENDANGERING HIS LIFE, HE
IS DESPATCHED BY NIGHT TO BEREA, WHERE HIS MESSAGE MEETS WITH
ENLIGHTENED ACCEPTANCE--A HOSTILE MOVEMENT FROM THESSALONICA OCCASIONS
HIS SUDDEN DEPARTURE FROM BEREA--HE ARRIVES AT ATHENS. ([Act
17:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#001))

when they had passed through Amphipolis--thirty-three miles southwest of
Philippi, on the river Strymon, and at the head of the gulf of that
name, on the northern coast of the Ã†gean Sea.

and Apollonia--about thirty miles southwest of Amphipolis; but the exact
site is not known.

they came to Thessalonica--about thirty-seven miles due west from
Apollonia, at the head of the Thermaic (or Thessalonian) Gulf, at the
northwestern extremity of the Ã†gean Sea; the principal and most
populous city in Macedonia. "We see at once how appropriate a place it
was for one of the starting-points of the Gospel in Europe, and can
appreciate the force of what Paul said to the Thessalonians within a few
months of his departure from them: "From you, the word of the Lord
sounded forth like a trumpet, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but in
every place,"" ([Th1 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#008)) \[HOWSON\].

where was a synagogue of the Jews--implying that (as at Philippi) there
was none at Amphipolis and Apollonia.

[Acts 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 17:2</span></span>

Paul, as his manner was--always to begin with the Jews.

went in unto them--In writing to the converts but a few months after
this, he reminds them of the courage and superiority to indignity, for
the Gospel's sake, which this required after the shameful treatment he
had so lately experienced at Philippi ([Th1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#002)).

[Acts 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 17:3</span></span>

Opening and alleging that Christ must needs have suffered, &c.--His
preaching, it seems, was chiefly expository, and designed to establish
from the Old Testament Scriptures (1) that the predicted Messiah was to
be a suffering and dying, and therefore a rising, Messiah; (2) that this
Messiah was none other than Jesus of Nazareth.

[Acts 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 17:4</span></span>

consorted--cast in their lot.

with Paul and Silas--Compare [Co2 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#005).

of the chief women--female proselytes of distinction. From the First
Epistle to the Thessalonians it appears that the converts were nearly
all Gentiles; not only such as had before been proselytes, who would be
gained in the synagogue, but such as up to that time had been idolaters
([Th1 1:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#009)). During his stay, while
Paul supported himself by his own labor ([Th1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#009); [Th2
3:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#007)), he received supplies once and
again from the Philippians, of which he makes honorable acknowledgment
([Phi 4:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#015)).

[Acts 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 17:5</span></span>

the Jews . . . moved with envy--seeing their influence undermined by
this stranger.

lewd fellows of the baser sort--better, perhaps, "worthless market
people," that is, idle loungers about the market-place, of indifferent
character.

gathered a company--rather, "having raised a mob."

assaulted the house of Jason--with whom Paul and Silas abode ([Act
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#007)), one of Paul's kinsmen,
apparently ([Rom 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#021)), and from his
name, which was sometimes used as a Greek form of the word Joshua
\[GROTIUS\], probably a Hellenistic Jew.

sought to bring them--Jason's lodgers.

[Acts 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 17:6</span></span>

And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain brethren unto
the rulers--literally, "the politarchs"; the very name given to the
magistrates of Thessalonica in an inscription on a still remaining arch
of the city--so minute is the accuracy of this history.

crying, These that have turned the world upside down--(See on [Act
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#020)).

[Acts 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 17:7</span></span>

all do contrary to the decrees of CÃ&brvbr;sar, &c.--meaning, probably,
nothing but what is specified in the next words.

saying . . . there is another king, one Jesus--(See on [Joh
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#012)).

[Acts 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 17:9</span></span>

And when they had taken security of Jason and of the other--"the
others"--probably making them deposit a money pledge that the preachers
should not again endanger the public peace.

[Acts 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 17:10</span></span>

the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night--for it would
have been as useless as rash to attempt any further preaching at that
time, and the conviction of this probably made his friends the more
willing to pledge themselves against any present continuance of
missionary effort.

unto Berea--fifty or sixty miles southwest of Thessalonica; a town even
still of considerable population and importance.

[Acts 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 17:11</span></span>

These were more noble than those in Thessalonica--The comparison is
between the Jews of the two places; for the triumphs of the Gospel at
Thessalonica were mostly among the Gentiles. See on [Act
17:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#002).

in that they received the word with all readiness of mind--heard it not
only without prejudice, but with eager interest, "in an honest and good
heart" ([Luk 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#017)), with sincere
desire to be taught aright (see [Joh
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#017)). Mark the "nobility" ascribed to
this state of mind.

searched the scriptures daily whether those things were so--whether the
Christian interpretation which the apostle put upon the Old Testament
Scriptures was the true one.

[Acts 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 17:12</span></span>

Therefore many of them believed--convinced that Jesus of Nazareth whom
Paul preached was indeed the great Promise and Burden of the Old
Testament. From this it is undeniable, (1) that the people, no less than
the ministers of the Church, are entitled and bound to search the
Scriptures; (2) that they are entitled and bound to judge, on their own
responsibility, whether the teaching they receive from the ministers of
the Church is according to the word of God; (3) that no faith but such
as results from personal conviction ought to be demanded, or is of any
avail.

of honourable women which were Greeks, and of men--which were Greeks.

not a few--"The upper classes in these European-Greek and Romanized
towns were probably better educated than those of Asia Minor" \[WEBSTER
and WILKINSON\].

[Acts 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 17:13</span></span>

the Jews of Thessalonica . . . came thither also--"like hunters upon
their prey, as they had done before from Iconium to Lystra" \[HOWSON\].

[Acts 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 17:14</span></span>

immediately the brethren--the converts gathered at Berea.

sent away Paul--as before from Jerusalem ([Act
9:30](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#030)), and from Thessalonica ([Act
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#010)). How long he stayed at Berea we
know not; but as we know that he longed and expected soon to return to
the Thessalonians ([Th1 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#017)), it is
probable he remained some weeks at least, and only abandoned his
intention of revisiting Thessalonica at that time when the virulence of
his enemies there, stimulated by his success at Berea, brought them down
thither to counterwork him.

to go as it were to the sea--rather, perhaps, "in the direction of the
sea." Probably he delayed fixing his next destination till he should
reach the coast, and the providence of God should guide him to a vessel
bound for the destined spot. Accordingly, it was only on arriving at
Athens, that the convoy of Berean brethren, who had gone thus far with
him, were sent back to bid Silas and Timothy follow him thither.

Silas and Timotheus abode there still--"to build it up in its holy
faith, to be a comfort and support in its trials and persecutions, and
to give it such organization as might be necessary" \[HOWSON\].
Connecting this with the apostle's leaving Timothy and Luke at Philippi
on his own departure (see on [Act
16:40](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#040)), we may conclude that this was
his fixed plan for cherishing the first beginning of the Gospel in
European localities, and organizing the converts. Timotheus must have
soon followed the apostle to Thessalonica, the bearer, probably, of one
of the Philippian "contributions to his necessity" ([Phi
4:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#015)), and from thence he would
with Silas accompany him to Berea.

[Acts 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 17:15</span></span>

Silas and Timotheus to come to him with all speed--He probably wished
their company and aid in addressing himself to so new and great a sphere
as Athens. Accordingly it is added that he "waited for them" there, as
if unwilling to do anything till they came. That they did come, there is
no good reason to doubt (as some excellent critics do). For though Paul
himself says to the Thessalonians that he "thought it good to be left at
Athens alone" ([Th1 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#001)), he
immediately adds that he "sent Timotheus to establish and comfort them"
([Act 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#002)); meaning, surely, that he
despatched him from Athens back to Thessalonica. He had indeed sent for
him to Athens; but, probably, when it appeared that little fruit was to
be reaped there, while Thessalonica was in too interesting a state to be
left uncherished, he seems to have thought it better to send him back
again. (The other explanations which have been suggested seem less
satisfactory). Timotheus rejoined the apostle at Corinth ([Act
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#005)).

[Acts 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">act 17:16</span></span>

PAUL AT ATHENS. (Acts 17:16-34)

wholly given to idolatry--"covered with idols"; meaning the city, not
the inhabitants. Petronius, a contemporary writer at Nero's court, says
satirically that it was easier to find a god at Athens than a man. This
"stirred the spirit" of the apostle. "The first impression which the
masterpieces of man's taste for art left on the mind of St. Paul was a
revolting one, since all this majesty and beauty had placed itself
between man and his Creator, and bound him the faster to his gods, who
were not God. Upon the first contact, therefore, which the Spirit of
Christ came into with the sublimest creations of human art, the judgment
of the Holy Ghost--through which they have all to pass--is set up as
"the strait gate," and this must remain the correct standard for ever"
\[BAUMGARTEN\].

[Acts 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">act 17:17</span></span>

Therefore disputed--or, discussed.

he in the synagogue with the Jews--The sense is not, "Therefore went he
to the Jews," because the Gentile Athenians were steeped in idolatry;
but, "Therefore set he himself to lift up his voice to the idol city,
but, as his manner was, he began with the Jews."

and with the devout persons--Gentile proselytes. After that,

daily with them that met with him--or "came in his way."

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 17:18</span></span>

certain . . . of the Epicureans--a well-known school of atheistic
materialists, who taught that pleasure was the chief end of human
existence; a principle which the more rational interpreted in a refined
sense, while the sensual explained it in its coarser meaning.

and of the Stoics--a celebrated school of severe and lofty pantheists,
whose principle was that the universe was under the law of an iron
necessity, the spirit of which was what is called the Deity: and that a
passionless conformity of the human will to this law, unmoved by all
external circumstances and changes, is the perfection of virtue. While
therefore the Stoical was in itself superior to the Epicurean system,
both were alike hostile to the Gospel. "The two enemies it has ever had
to contend with are the two ruling principles of the Epicureans and
Stoics--Pleasure and Pride" \[HOWSON\].

What will this babbler say?--The word, which means "a picker-up of
seeds," bird-like, is applied to a gatherer and retailer of scraps of
knowledge, a prater; a general term of contempt for any pretended
teacher.

a setter forth of strange gods--"demons," but in the Greek (not Jewish)
sense of "objects of worship."

because he preached Jesus and the resurrection--Not as if they thought
he made these to be two divinities: the strange gods were Jehovah and
the Risen Saviour, ordained to judge the world.

[Acts 17:19](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 17:19</span></span>

they took him, and brought him to Areopagus--"the hill where the most
awful court of judicature had sat from time immemorial to pass sentence
on the greatest criminals, and to decide on the most solemn questions
connected with religion. No place in Athens was so suitable for a
discourse on the mysteries of religion" \[HOWSON\]. The apostle,
however, was not here on his trial, but to expound more fully what he
had thrown out in broken conversations in the Agora.

[Acts 17:21](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 17:21</span></span>

all the Athenians . . . spent their time in nothing else but to tell or
hear some new thing--literally, "newer thing," as if what was new
becoming presently stale, they craved something still more new
\[BENGEL\]. This lively description of the Athenian character is
abundantly attested by their own writers.

[Acts 17:22](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 17:22</span></span>

Then Paul stood . . . and said--more graphically, "standing in the midst
of Mars' hill, said." This prefatory allusion to the position he
occupied shows the writer's wish to bring the situation vividly before
us \[BAUMGARTEN\].

I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious--rather (with
most modern interpreters and the ancient Greek ones), "in all respects
extremely reverential" or "much given to religious worship," a
conciliatory and commendatory introduction, founded on his own
observation of the symbols of devotion with which their city was
covered, and from which all Greek writers, as well as the apostle,
inferred the exemplary religiousness of the Athenians. (The authorized
translation would imply that only too much superstition was wrong, and
represents the apostle as repelling his hearers in the very first
sentence; whereas the whole discourse is studiously courteous).

[Acts 17:23](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 17:23</span></span>

as I passed by and beheld your devotions--rather, "the objects of your
devotion," referring, as is plain from the next words, to their works of
art consecrated to religion.

I found an altar . . . To the--or, "an"

unknown god--erected, probably, to commemorate some divine
interposition, which they were unable to ascribe to any known deity.
That there were such altars, Greek writers attest; and on this the
apostle skilfully fastens at the outset, as the text of his discourse,
taking it as evidence of that dimness of religious conception which, in
virtue of his better light, he was prepared to dissipate.

Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship--rather, "Whom, therefore, knowing
Him not, ye worship," alluding to "The Unknown God."

him declare--announce.

I unto you--This is like none of his previous discourses, save that to
the idolaters of Lycaonia ([Act
14:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#015)). His subject is not, as in
the synagogues, the Messiahship of Jesus, but THE LIVING GOD, in
opposition to the materialistic and pantheistic polytheism of Greece,
which subverted all true religion. Nor does he come with speculation on
this profound subject--of which they had had enough from others--but an
authoritative "announcement" of Him after whom they were groping not
giving Him any name, however, nor even naming the Saviour Himself but
unfolding the true character of both as they were able to receive it.

[Acts 17:24](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 17:24</span></span>

God that made the world and all . . . therein--The most profound
philosophers of Greece were unable to conceive any real distinction
between God and the universe. Thick darkness, therefore, behooved to
rest on all their religious conceptions. To dissipate this, the apostle
sets out with a sharp statement of the fact of creation as the central
principle of all true religion--not less needed now, against the
transcendental idealism of our day.

seeing he is Lord--or Sovereign.

of heaven and earth--holding in free and absolute subjection all the
works of His hands; presiding in august royalty over them, as well as
pervading them all as the principle of their being. How different this
from the blind Force or Fate to which all creatures were regarded as in
bondage!

dwelleth not in temples made with hands--This thought, so familiar to
Jewish ears ([Kg1 8:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#027); [Isa
66:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#001); [Act
7:48](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#048)), and so elementary to
Christians, would serve only more sharply to define to his heathen
audience the spirituality of that living, personal God, whom he
"announced" to them.

[Acts 17:25](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 17:25</span></span>

Neither is worshipped with--ministered unto, served by

men's hands, as though he needed anything--No less familiar as this
thought also is to us, even from the earliest times of the Old Testament
([Job 35:6](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#006), [Job
35:8](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#008); [Psa
16:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#002); [Psa
50:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#012); [Isa
40:14-18](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#014)), it would pour a flood of
light upon any candid heathen mind that heard it.

seeing he--He Himself.

giveth to all life, and breath, and all things--The Giver of all cannot
surely be dependent for aught upon the receivers of all ([Ch1
29:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#014)). This is the culminating point
of a pure Theism.

[Acts 17:26](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 17:26</span></span>

and hath made of one blood all nations of men to dwell on all the face
of the earth--Holding with the Old Testament teaching, that in the blood
is the life ([Gen 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#004); [Lev
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#011); [Deu
12:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#023)), the apostle sees this life
stream of the whole human race to be one, flowing from one source
\[BAUMGARTEN\].

and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their
habitation--The apostle here opposes both Stoical Fate and Epicurean
Chance, ascribing the periods and localities in which men and nations
flourish to the sovereign will and prearrangements of a living God.

[Acts 17:27](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">act 17:27</span></span>

That they should seek the Lord--That is the high end of all these
arrangements of Divine Power, Wisdom, and Love.

if haply they might feel after him--as men groping their way in the
dark.

and find him--a lively picture of the murky atmosphere of Natural
Religion.

though he be not far from every one of us--The difficulty of finding God
outside the pale of revealed religion lies not in His distance from us,
but in our distance from Him through the blinding effect of sin.

[Acts 17:28](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">act 17:28</span></span>

For in him we live, and move, and have our being--(or, more briefly,
"exist").--This means, not merely, "Without Him we have no life, nor
that motion which every inanimate nature displays, nor even existence
itself" \[MEYER\], but that God is the living, immanent Principle of all
these in men.

as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his
offspring--the first half of the fifth line, word for word, of an
astronomical poem of Aratus, a Greek countryman of the apostle, and his
predecessor by about three centuries. But, as he hints, the same
sentiment is to be found in other Greek poets. They meant it doubtless
in a pantheistic sense; but the truth which it expresses the apostle
turns to his own purpose--to teach a pure, personal, spiritual Theism.
(Probably during his quiet retreat at Tarsus. [Act
9:30](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#030), revolving his special vocation
to the Gentiles he gave himself to the study of so much Greek literature
as might be turned to Christian account in his future work. Hence this
and his other quotations from the Greek poets, [Co1
15:33](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#033); [Tit
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#012)).

[Acts 17:29](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">act 17:29</span></span>

Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to
think--The courtesy of this language is worthy of notice.

that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art
and man's device--("graven by the art or device of man"). One can hardly
doubt that the apostle would here point to those matchless monuments of
the plastic art, in gold and silver and costliest stone, which lay so
profusely beneath and around him. The more intelligent pagan Greeks no
more pretended that these sculptured gods and goddesses were real
deities, or even their actual likenesses, than Romanist Christians do
their images; and Paul doubtless knew this; yet here we find him
condemning all such efforts visibly to represent the invisible God. How
shamefully inexcusable then are the Greek and Roman churches in
paganizing the worship of the Christian Church by the encouragement of
pictures and images in religious service! (In the eighth century, the
second council of Nicea decreed that the image of God was as proper an
object of worship as God Himself).

[Acts 17:30](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">act 17:30</span></span>

the times of this ignorance God winked at--literally (and far better),
"overlooked," that is, bore with, without interposing to punish it,
otherwise than suffering the debasing tendency of such worship to
develop itself (compare [Act 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#016),
and see on [Rom 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#024), &c.).

but now--that a new light was risen upon the world.

commandeth--"That duty--all along lying upon man estranged from his
Creator, but hitherto only silently recommending itself and little
felt--is now peremptory."

all men every where to repent--(compare [Col
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#006), [Col
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#023); [Tit
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#011)) --a tacit allusion to the narrow
precincts of favored Judaism, within which immediate and entire
repentance was ever urged. The word "repentance" is here used (as in
[Luk 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#003), [Luk
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#005); [Luk
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#010)) in its most comprehensive sense
of "repentance unto life."

[Acts 17:31](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">act 17:31</span></span>

Because he hath appointed a day in the which he will judge the
world--Such language beyond doubt teaches that the judgment will, in its
essence, be a solemn judicial assize held upon all mankind at once.
"Aptly is this uttered on the Areopagus, the seat of judgment"
\[BENGEL\].

by that man whom he hath ordained--compare [Joh
5:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#022), [Joh
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#027); [Act
10:42](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#042).

whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him
from the dead--the most patent evidence to mankind at large of the
judicial authority with which the Risen One is clothed.

when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked--As the
Greek religion was but the glorification of the present life, by the
worship of all its most beauteous forms, the Resurrection, which
presupposes the vanity of the present life, and is nothing but life out
of the death of all that sin has blighted, could have no charm for the
true Greek. It gave the death blow to his fundamental and most cherished
ideas; nor until these were seen to be false and fatal could the
Resurrection, and the Gospel of which it was a primary doctrine, seem
otherwise than ridiculous.

others said, We will hear thee again of this--"an idle compliment to
Paul and an opiate to their consciences, such as we often meet with in
our own day. They probably, like Felix, feared to hear more, lest they
should be constrained to believe unwelcome truths" ([Act
24:25](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#025); and compare [Mat
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#015)) \[WEBSTER and WILKINSON\].

So Paul departed--Whether he would have opened, to any extent, the
Gospel scheme in this address, if he had not been interrupted, or
whether he reserved this for exposition afterwards to earnest inquirers,
we cannot tell. Only the speech is not to be judged of as quite
complete.

Howbeit certain men clave unto him--Instead of mocking or politely
waiving the subject, having listened eagerly, they joined themselves to
the apostle for further instruction; and so they "believed."

Dionysius the Areopagite--a member of that august tribunal. Ancient
tradition says he was placed by the apostle over the little flock at
Athens. "Certainly the number of converts there and of men fit for
office in the Church was not so great that there could be much choice"
\[OLSHAUSEN\].

a woman named Damaris--not certainly one of the apostle's audience on
the Areopagus, but won to the faith either before or after. Nothing else
is known of her. Of any further labors of the apostle at Athens, and how
long he stayed, we are not informed. Certainly he was not driven away.
But "it is a serious and instructive fact that the mercantile
populations of Thessalonica and Corinth received the message of God with
greater readiness than the highly educated and polished Athenians. Two
letters to the Thessalonians, and two to the Corinthians, remain to
attest the flourishing state of those churches. But we possess no letter
written by Paul to the Athenians; and we do not read that he was ever in
Athens again" \[HOWSON\].
