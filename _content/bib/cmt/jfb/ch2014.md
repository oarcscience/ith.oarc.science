### [2 Chronicles Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 14:1</span></span>

ASA DESTROYS IDOLATRY. ([Ch2 14:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#001))

In his days the land was quiet ten years--This long interval of peace
was the continued effect of the great battle of Zemaraim (compare [Kg1
15:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#011)).

[2 Chronicles 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 14:2</span></span>

Asa did that which was good and right--(compare [Kg1
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#014)). Still his character and life
were not free from faults ([Ch2 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#007),
[Ch2 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#010), [Ch2
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#012)).

[2 Chronicles 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 14:3</span></span>

brake down the images--of Baal (see on [Ch2
34:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#004); [Lev
26:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#030)).

cut down the groves--rather, "Asherim."

[2 Chronicles 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 14:5</span></span>

he took away . . . the high places--that is, those devoted to idolatrous
rites.

took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the
images--All public objects and relics of idolatry in Jerusalem and other
cities through his kingdom were destroyed; but those high places where
God was worshipped under the figure of an ox, as at Beth-el, were
allowed to remain ([Kg1 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#014)); so far
the reformation was incomplete.

[2 Chronicles 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 14:6</span></span>

HAVING PEACE, HE STRENGTHENS HIS KINGDOM WITH FORTS AND ARMIES. ([Ch2
14:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#006))

he built fenced cities in Judah--(See on [Kg1
15:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#022)).

[2 Chronicles 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 14:7</span></span>

while the land is yet before us--that is, while we have free and
undisputed progress everywhere; no foe is near; but, as this happy time
of peace may not last always and the kingdom is but small and weak, let
us prepare suitable defenses in case of need. He had also an army of
five hundred eighty thousand men. Judah furnished the heavily armed
soldiers, and Benjamin the archers. This large number does not mean a
body of professional soldiers, but all capable of bearing arms and
liable to be called into service.

[2 Chronicles 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch2 14:9</span></span>

HE OVERCOMES ZERAH, AND SPOILS THE ETHIOPIANS. ([Ch2
14:9-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#009))

there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian--This could not have
been from Ethiopia south of the cataracts of the Nile, for in the reign
of Osorkon I, successor of Shishak, no foreign army would have been
allowed a free passage through Egypt. Zerah must, therefore, have been
chief of the Cushites, or Ethiopians of Arabia, as they were evidently a
nomad horde who had a settlement of tents and cattle in the neighborhood
of Gerar.

a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots--"Twenty camels employed
to carry couriers upon them might have procured that number of men to
meet in a short time. As Zerah was the aggressor, he had time to choose
when he would summon these men and attack the enemy. Every one of these
Cushite shepherds, carrying with them their own provisions of flour and
water, as is their invariable custom, might have fought with Asa without
eating a loaf of Zerah's bread or drinking a pint of his water" \[BRUCE,
Travels\].

[2 Chronicles 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch2 14:10</span></span>

Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array . . . at
Mareshah--one of the towns which Rehoboam fortified ([Ch2
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#008)), near a great southern pass in
the low country of Judah ([Jos 15:44](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#044)).
The engagement between the armies took place in a plain near the town,
called "the valley of Zephathah," supposed to be the broad way coming
down Beit Jibrin towards Tell Es-Safren \[ROBINSON\].

[2 Chronicles 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 14:11</span></span>

Asa cried unto the Lord his God--Strong in the confidence that the power
of God was able to give the victory equally with few as with many, the
pious king marched with a comparatively small force to encounter the
formidable host of marauders at his southern frontier. Committing his
cause to God, he engaged in the conflict--completely routed the enemy,
and succeeded in obtaining, as the reward of his victory, a rich booty
in treasure and cattle from the tents of this pastoral horde.
