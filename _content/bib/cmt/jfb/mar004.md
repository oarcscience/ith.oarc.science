### [Mark Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#001)

[Mark 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 4:1</span></span>

PARABLE OF THE SOWER--REASON FOR TEACHING IN PARABLES--PARABLES OF THE
SEED GROWING WE KNOW NOT HOW, AND OF THE MUSTARD SEED. ( = Mat. 13:1-23,
31, 32; [Luk 8:4-18](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#004)). (Mark 4:1-34)

And he began again to teach by the seaside: and there was gathered unto
him a great multitude--or, according to another well-supported reading,
"a mighty" or "immense multitude."

so that he entered into a ship--rather, "the ship," meaning the one
mentioned in [Mar 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#009). (See on [Mat
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#015)).

and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the
land--crowded on the seashore to listen to Him. (See on [Mat
13:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#001).)

[Mark 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mar 4:2</span></span>

And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his
doctrine--or "teaching."

Parable of the Sower ([Mar 4:3-9](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#003), [Mar
4:13-20](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#013)).

[Mark 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mar 4:3</span></span>

THE SOWER, THE SEED, AND THE SOIL. ([Mar
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#003), [Mar
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#014))

Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow--What means this? See on
[Mar 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#014).

First Case: THE WAYSIDE. ([Mar 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#004),
[Mar 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#015)).

[Mark 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mar 4:4</span></span>

And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the wayside--by the side
of the hard path through the field, where the soil was not broken up.

and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up--Not only could the
seed not get beneath the surface, but "it was trodden down" ([Luk
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#005)), and afterwards picked up and
devoured by the fowls. What means this? See on [Mar
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#015).

Second Case: THE STONY or rather, ROCKY GROUND. ([Mar
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#005), [Mar
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#016)).

[Mark 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mar 4:5</span></span>

And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth--"the rocky
ground"; in Matthew ([Mat 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#005)), "the
rocky places"; in Luke ([Luk 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#006)),
"the rock." The thing intended is, not ground with stones in it which
would not prevent the roots striking downward, but ground where a quite
thin surface of earth covers a rock. What means this? See on [Mar
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#016).

Third Case: THE THORNY GROUND. ([Mar
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#007), [Mar
4:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#018)).

[Mark 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mar 4:7</span></span>

And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and
it yielded no fruit--This case is that of ground not thoroughly cleaned
of the thistles, &c.; which, rising above the good seed, "choke" or
"smother" it, excluding light and air, and drawing away the moisture and
richness of the soil. Hence it "becomes unfruitful" ([Mat
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#022)); it grows, but its growth is
checked, and it never ripens. The evil here is neither a hard nor a
shallow soil--there is softness enough, and depth enough; but it is the
existence in it of what draws all the moisture and richness of the soil
away to itself, and so starves the plant. What now are these "thorns?"
See on [Mar 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#019).

Fourth Case: THE GOOD GROUND. ([Mar
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#008), [Mar
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#020)).

[Mark 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mar 4:8</span></span>

And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit, &c.--The goodness of
this last soil consists in its qualities being precisely the reverse of
the other three soils: from its softness and tenderness, receiving and
cherishing the seed; from its depth, allowing it to take firm root, and
not quickly losing its moisture; and from its cleanness, giving its
whole vigor and sap to the plant. In such a soil the seed "brings forth
fruit," in all different degrees of profusion, according to the measure
in which the soil possesses those qualities. See on [Mar
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#020).

[Mark 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mar 4:9</span></span>

And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.

After this parable is recorded the Evangelist says:

[Mark 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mar 4:10</span></span>

And when he was alone, they that were about him with the
twelve--probably those who followed Him most closely and were firmest in
discipleship, next to the Twelve.

asked of him the parable--The reply would seem to intimate that this
parable of the sower was of that fundamental, comprehensive, and
introductory character which we have assigned to it (see on [Mat
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#001)).

Reason for Teaching in Parables ([Mar
4:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#011), [Mar
4:21-25](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#021)).

[Mark 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mar 4:11</span></span>

And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the
kingdom of God: but unto them, &c.--See on [Mat
13:10-17](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#010).

[Mark 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mar 4:13</span></span>

Know ye not this parable? and how then will ye know all
parables?--Probably this was said not so much in the spirit of rebuke,
as to call their attention to the exposition of it which He was about to
give, and so train them to the right apprehension of His future
parables. As in the parables which we have endeavored to explain in Mat.
13:1-58, we shall take this parable and the Lord's own exposition of the
different parts of it together.

[Mark 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mar 4:14</span></span>

The sower soweth the word--or, as in Luke ([Luk
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#011)), "Now the parable is this: The
seed is the word of God." But who is "the sower?" This is not expressed
here because if "the word of God" be the seed, every scatterer of that
precious seed must be regarded as a sower. It is true that in the
parable of the tares it is said, "He that soweth the good seed is the
Son of man," as "He that soweth the tares is the devil" ([Mat
13:37-38](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#037)). But these are only the
great unseen parties, struggling in this world for the possession of
man. Each of these has his agents among men themselves; and Christ's
agents in the sowing of the good seed are the preachers of the word.
Thus, as in all the cases about to be described, the sower is the same,
and the seed is the same; while the result is entirely different, the
whole difference must lie in the soils, which mean the different states
of the human heart. And so, the great general lesson held forth in this
parable of the sower is, that however faithful the preacher, and how
pure soever his message, the effect of the preaching of the word depends
upon the state of the hearer's heart. Now follow the cases. See on [Mar
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#004).

[Mark 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mar 4:15</span></span>

And these are they by the wayside, where the word is sown; but, when
they have heard, &c.--or, more fully ([Mat
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#019)), "When any one heareth the word
of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one,
and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart." The great truth
here taught is, that hearts all unbroken and hard are no fit soil for
saving truth. They apprehend it not ([Mat
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#019)) as God's means of restoring
them to Himself; it penetrates not, makes no impression, but lies
loosely on the surface of the heart, till the wicked one--afraid of
losing a victim by his "believing to salvation" ([Luk
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#012)) --finds some frivolous subject
by whose greater attractions to draw off the attention, and straightway
it is gone. Of how many hearers of the word is this the graphic but
painful history!

[Mark 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mar 4:16</span></span>

And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground,
&c.--"Immediately" the seed in such a case "springs up"--all the quicker
from the shallowness of the soil--"because it has no depth of earth."
But the sun, beating on it, as quickly scorches and withers it up,
"because it has no root" ([Mar 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#006)),
and "lacks moisture" ([Luk 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#006)). The
great truth here taught is that hearts superficially impressed are apt
to receive the truth with readiness, and even with joy ([Luk
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#013)); but the heat of tribulation or
persecution because of the word, or the trials which their new
profession brings upon them quickly dries up their relish for the truth,
and withers all the hasty promise of fruit which they showed. Such
disappointing issues of a faithful and awakening ministry--alas, how
frequent are they!

[Mark 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mar 4:18</span></span>

And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word,

[Mark 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mar 4:19</span></span>

And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the
lusts of other things entering in--or "the pleasures of this life" ([Luk
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#014)).

choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful--First, "The cares of this
world"--anxious, unrelaxing attention to the business of this present
life; second, "The deceitfulness of riches"--of those riches which are
the fruit of this worldly "care"; third, "The pleasures of this life,"
or "the lusts of other things entering in"--the enjoyments in themselves
may be innocent, which worldly prosperity enables one to indulge. These
"choke" or "smother" the word; drawing off so much of one's attention,
absorbing so much of one's interest, and using up so much of one's time,
that only the dregs of these remain for spiritual things, and a ragged,
hurried, and heartless formalism is at length all the religion of such
persons. What a vivid picture is this of the mournful condition of many,
especially in great commercial countries, who once promised much fruit!
"They bring no fruit to perfection" ([Luk
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#014)); indicating how much growth
there may be, in the early stages of such a case, and promise of
fruit--which after all never ripens.

[Mark 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mar 4:20</span></span>

And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word,
and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and
some an hundred--A heart soft and tender, stirred to its depths on the
great things of eternity, and jealously guarded from worldly
engrossments, such only is the "honest and good heart" ([Luk
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#015)), which "keeps," that is,
"retains" the seed of the word, and bears fruit just in proportion as it
is such a heart. Such "bring forth fruit with patience" ([Mar
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#015)), or continuance, "enduring to
the end"; in contrast with those in whom the word is "choked" and brings
no fruit to perfection. The "thirtyfold" is designed to express the
lowest degree of fruitfulness; the "hundredfold" the highest; and the
"sixtyfold" the intermediate degrees of fruitfulness. As a
"hundredfold," though not unexampled ([Gen
26:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#012)), is a rare return in the
natural husbandry, so the highest degrees of spiritual fruitfulness are
too seldom witnessed. The closing words of this introductory parable
seem designed to call attention to the fundamental and universal
character of it.

[Mark 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mar 4:21</span></span>

And he said unto them, Is a candle--or "lamp"

brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a
candlestick?--"that they which enter in may see the light" ([Luk
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#016)). See on [Mat
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#015), of which this is nearly a
repetition.

[Mark 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mar 4:22</span></span>

For there is nothing hid which shall not be manifested, &c.--See on [Mat
10:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#026); but the connection there and
here is slightly different. Here the idea seems to be this--"I have
privately expounded to you these great truths, but only that ye may
proclaim them publicly; and if ye will not, others will. For these are
not designed for secrecy. They are imparted to be diffused abroad, and
they shall be so; yea, a time is coming when the most hidden things
shall be brought to light."

[Mark 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mar 4:23</span></span>

If any man have ears to hear, let him hear--This for the second time on
the same subject (see on [Mar 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#009)).

[Mark 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mar 4:24</span></span>

And he saith unto them, Take heed what ye hear--In Luke ([Luk
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#018)) it is, "Take heed how ye hear."
The one implies the other, but both precepts are very weighty.

with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you--See on [Mat
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#002).

and unto you that hear--that is, thankfully, teachably, profitably.

shall more be given.

[Mark 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mar 4:25</span></span>

For he that hath, to him shall be given; and he that hath not, from him
shall be taken even that which he hath--or "seemeth to have," or
"thinketh he hath." (See on [Mat
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#012)). This "having" and "thinking he
hath" are not different; for when it hangs loosely upon him, and is not
appropriated to its proper ends and uses, it both is and is not his.

Parable of the Seed Growing We Know not How ([Mar
4:26-29](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#026)).

This beautiful parable is peculiar to Mark. Its design is to teach the
Imperceptible Growth of the word sown in the heart, from its earliest
stage of development to the ripest fruits of practical righteousness.

[Mark 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mar 4:26</span></span>

So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;
and should sleep, and rise night and day--go about his other ordinary
occupations, leaving it to the well-known laws of vegetation under the
genial influences of heaven. This is the sense of "the earth bringing
forth fruit of herself," in [Mar 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#027).

[Mark 4:28](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mar 4:28</span></span>

For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the
ear, after that the full corn in the ear--beautiful allusion to the
succession of similar stages, though not definitely marked periods, in
the Christian life, and generally in the kingdom of God.

[Mark 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">mar 4:29</span></span>

But when the fruit is brought forth--to maturity

immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come--This
charmingly points to the transition from the earthly to the heavenly
condition of the Christian and the Church.

Parable of the Mustard Seed ([Mar
4:30-32](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#030)).

For the exposition of this portion, see on [Mat
13:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#031).

[Mark 4:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">mar 4:33</span></span>

And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were
able to hear it--Had this been said in the corresponding passage of
Matthew, we should have concluded that what that Evangelist recorded was
but a specimen of other parables spoken on the same occasion. But
Matthew ([Mat 13:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#034)) says, "All these
things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables"; and as Mark records
only some of the parables which Matthew gives, we are warranted to infer
that the "many such parables" alluded to here mean no more than the full
complement of them which we find in Matthew.

[Mark 4:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mar 4:34</span></span>

But without a parable spake he not unto them--See on [Mat
13:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#034).

and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples--See
on [Mar 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#022).

[Mark 4:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">mar 4:35</span></span>

JESUS CROSSING THE SEA OF GALILEE, MIRACULOUSLY STILLS A TEMPEST--HE
CURES THE DEMONIAC OF GADARA. ( = [Mat
8:23-34](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#023); Luke 8:22-39). (Mark
4:35-5:20)

And the same day--on which He spoke the memorable parables of the
preceding section, and of the thirteenth chapter.

when the even was come--(See on [Mar
6:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#035)). This must have been the earlier
evening--what we should call the afternoon--since after all that passed
on the other side, when He returned to the west side, the people were
waiting for Him in great numbers ([Mar
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#021); [Luk
8:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#040)).

he saith unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side--to the east
side of the lake, to grapple with a desperate case of possession, and
set the captive free, and to give the Gadarenes an opportunity of
hearing the message of salvation, amid the wonder which that marvellous
cure was fitted to awaken and the awe which the subsequent events could
not but strike into them.

[Mark 4:36](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">mar 4:36</span></span>

And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was
in the ship--that is, without any preparation, and without so much as
leaving the vessel, out of which He had been all day teaching.

And there were also with him other little ships--with passengers,
probably, wishing to accompany Him.

[Mark 4:37](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">mar 4:37</span></span>

And there arose a great storm of wind--"a tempest of wind." To such
sudden squalls the Sea of Galilee is very liable from its position, in a
deep basin, skirted on the east by lofty mountain ranges, while on the
west the hills are intersected by narrow gorges through which the wind
sweeps across the lake, and raises its waters with great rapidity into a
storm.

and the waves beat into the ship--kept beating or pitching on the ship.

so that it was now full--rather, "so that it was already filling." In
Matthew ([Mat 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#024)), "insomuch that
the ship was covered with the waves"; but this is too strong. It should
be, "so that the ship was getting covered by the waves." So we must
translate the word used in Luke ([Luk
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#023)) --not as in our version--"And
there came down a storm on the lake, and they were filled \[with
water\]"--but "they were getting filled," that is, those who sailed;
meaning, of course, that their ship was so.

[Mark 4:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">mar 4:38</span></span>

And he was in the hinder part of the ship--or stern.

asleep on a pillow--either a place in the vessel made to receive the
head, or a cushion for the head to rest on. It was evening; and after
the fatigues of a busy day of teaching under the hot sun, having nothing
to do while crossing the lake, He sinks into a deep sleep, which even
this tempest raging around and tossing the little vessel did not
disturb.

and they awake him, and say unto him, Master--or "Teacher." In Luke
([Luk 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#024)) this is doubled--in token
of their life-and-death earnestness--"Master, Master."

carest thou not that we perish?--Unbelief and fear made them sadly
forget their place, to speak so. Luke has it, "Lord, save us, we
perish." When those accustomed to fish upon that deep thus spake, the
danger must have been imminent. They say nothing of what would become of
Him, if they perished; nor think, whether, if He could not perish, it
was likely He would let this happen to them; but they hardly knew what
they said.

[Mark 4:39](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">mar 4:39</span></span>

And he arose, and rebuked the wind--"and the raging of the water" ([Luk
8:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#024)).

and said unto the sea, Peace, be still--two sublime words of command,
from a Master to His servants, the elements.

And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm--The sudden hushing of
the wind would not at once have calmed the sea, whose commotion would
have settled only after a considerable time. But the word of command was
given to both elements at once.

[Mark 4:40](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">mar 4:40</span></span>

And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful?--There is a natural
apprehension under danger; but there was unbelief in their fear. It is
worthy of notice how considerately the Lord defers this rebuke till He
had first removed the danger, in the midst of which they would not have
been in a state to listen to anything.

how is it that ye have no faith?--next to none, or none in present
exercise. In Matthew ([Mat 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#026)) it
is, "Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith?" Faith they had, for they
applied to Christ for relief: but little, for they were afraid, though
Christ was in the ship. Faith dispels fear, but only in proportion to
its strength.

[Mark 4:41](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">mar 4:41</span></span>

And they feared exceedingly--were struck with deep awe.

and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind
and the sea obey him?--"What is this?" Israel has all along been singing
of JEHOVAH, "Thou rulest the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof
arise, Thou stillest them!" "The Lord on high is mightier than the noise
of many waters, yea, than the mighty waves of the sea!" ([Psa
89:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#009); [Psa
93:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#004)). But, lo, in this very boat of
ours is One of our own flesh and blood, who with His word of command
hath done the same! Exhausted with the fatigues of the day, He was but a
moment ago in a deep sleep, undisturbed by the howling tempest, and we
had to waken Him with the cry of our terror; but rising at our call, His
majesty was felt by the raging elements, for they were instantly
hushed--"WHAT MANNER OF MAN IS THIS?"

Glorious Cure of the Gadarene Demoniac (Mark 5:1-20).
