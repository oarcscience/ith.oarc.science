*A Commentary, Critical, Practical, and Explanatory on the Old and New
Testaments*, by Robert Jamieson, A.R. Fausset and David Brown \[1882\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Isaiah Chapter 59](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#001)

[Isaiah 59:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 59:1</span></span>

THE PEOPLE'S SIN THE CAUSE OF JUDGMENTS: THEY AT LAST OWN IT THEMSELVES:
THE REDEEMER'S FUTURE INTERPOSITION IN THEIR EXTREMITY. (Isa. 59:1-21)

hand . . . shortened--(See on [Isa
50:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#002)).

ear heavy-- ([Isa 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#010)).

[Isaiah 59:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 59:2</span></span>

hid--Hebrew, "caused Him to hide" ([Lam
3:44](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#044)).

[Isaiah 59:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 59:3</span></span>

([Isa 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#015); [Rom
3:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#013)).

hands . . . fingers--Not merely the "hands" perpetrate deeds of grosser
enormity ("blood"), but the "fingers" commit more minute acts of
"iniquity."

lips . . . tongue--The lips "speak" openly "lies," the tongue "mutters"
malicious insinuations ("perverseness"; perverse misrepresentations of
others) ([Jer 6:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#028); [Jer
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#004)).

[Isaiah 59:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 59:4</span></span>

Rather, "No one calleth an adversary into court with justice," that is,
None bringeth a just suit: "No one pleadeth with truth."

they trust . . . iniquity--(So [Job
15:35](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#035); [Psa
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#014)).

[Isaiah 59:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 59:5</span></span>

cockatrice--probably the basilisk serpent, cerastes. Instead of crushing
evil in the egg, they foster it.

spider's web--This refers not to the spider's web being made to entrap,
but to its thinness, as contrasted with substantial "garments," as [Isa
59:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#006) shows. Their works are vain and
transitory ([Job 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#014); [Pro
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#018)).

eateth . . . their eggs--he who partakes in their plans, or has anything
to do with them, finds them pestiferous.

that which is crushed--The egg, when it is broken, breaketh out as a
viper; their plans, however specious in their undeveloped form like the
egg, when developed, are found pernicious. Though the viper is
viviparous (from which "vi-per" is derived), yet during gestation, the
young are included in eggs, which break at the birth \[BOCHART\];
however, metaphors often combine things without representing everything
to the life.

[Isaiah 59:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 59:6</span></span>

not . . . garments--like the "fig leaves" wherewith Adam and Eve vainly
tried to cover their shame, as contrasted with "the coats of skins"
which the Lord God made to clothe them with ([Isa
64:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#006); [Rom
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#014); [Gal
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#027); [Phi
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#009)). The artificial self-deceiving
sophisms of human philosophy ([Ti1
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#005); [Ti2
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#016), [Ti2
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#023)).

[Isaiah 59:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 59:7</span></span>

feet--All their members are active in evil; in [Isa
59:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#003), the "hands, fingers, lips, and
tongue," are specified.

run . . . haste-- ([Rom 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#015)).
Contrast David's "running and hasting" in the ways of God ([Psa
119:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#032), [Psa
119:60](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#060)).

thoughts--not merely their acts, but their whole thoughts.

[Isaiah 59:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 59:8</span></span>

peace--whether in relation to God, to their own conscience, or to their
fellow men ([Isa 57:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#020)).

judgment--justice.

crooked--the opposite of "straightforward" ([Pro
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#015); [Pro
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#018)).

[Isaiah 59:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 59:9</span></span>

judgment far--retribution in kind because they had shown "no judgment in
their goings" ([Isa 59:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#008)). "The
vindication of our just rights by God is withheld by Him from us."

us--In [Isa 59:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#008) and previous verses,
it was "they," the third person; here, "us . . . we," the first person.
The nation here speaks: God thus making them out of their own mouth
condemn themselves; just as He by His prophet had condemned them before.
Isaiah includes himself with his people and speaks in their name.

justice--God's justice bringing salvation ([Isa
46:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#013)).

light--the dawn of returning prosperity.

obscurity--adversity ([Jer 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#015)).

[Isaiah 59:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 59:10</span></span>

grope--fulfilling Moses' threat ([Deu
28:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#029)).

stumble at noon . . . as . . . night--There is no relaxation of our
evils; at the time when we might look for the noon of relief, there is
still the night of our calamity.

in desolate places--rather, to suit the parallel words "at noonday," in
fertile (literally, "fat"; [Gen 27:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#028))
fields \[GESENIUS\] (where all is promising) we are like the dead (who
have no hope left them); or, where others are prosperous, we wander
about as dead men; true of all unbelievers ([Isa
26:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#010); [Luk
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#017)).

[Isaiah 59:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 59:11</span></span>

roar--moan plaintively, like a hungry bear which growls for food.

doves-- ([Isa 38:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#014); [Eze
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#016)).

salvation--retribution in kind: because not salvation, but "destruction"
was "in their paths" ([Isa 59:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#007)).

[Isaiah 59:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 59:12</span></span>

([Dan 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#005), &c.).

thee . . . us--antithesis.

with us--that is, we are conscious of them ([Job
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#003), Margin; [Job
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#009)).

know--acknowledge they are our iniquities.

[Isaiah 59:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 59:13</span></span>

The particulars of the sins generally confessed in [Isa
59:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#012) ([Isa
48:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#008); [Jer
2:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#019)). The act, the word, and the
thought of apostasy, are all here marked: transgression and departing,
&c.; lying (compare [Isa 59:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#004)), and
speaking, &c.; conceiving and uttering from the heart.

[Isaiah 59:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 59:14</span></span>

Justice and righteousness are put away from our legal courts.

in the street--in the forum, the place of judicature, usually at the
gate of the city ([Zac 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#016)).

cannot enter--is shut out from the forum, or courts of justice.

[Isaiah 59:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 59:15</span></span>

faileth--is not to be found.

he that departeth . . . prey--He that will not fall in with the
prevailing iniquity exposes himself as a prey to the wicked ([Psa
10:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#008)).

Lord saw it--The iniquity of Israel, so desperate as to require nothing
short of Jehovah's interposition to mend it, typifies the same necessity
for a Divine Mediator existing in the deep corruption of man; Israel,
the model nation, was chosen to illustrate his awful fact.

[Isaiah 59:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 59:16</span></span>

no man--namely, to atone by his righteousness for the unrighteousness of
the people. "Man" is emphatic, as in [Kg1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#002); no representative man able to
retrieve the cause of fallen men ([Isa
41:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#028); [Isa
63:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#005); [Jer
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#001); [Eze
22:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#030)).

no intercessor--no one to interpose, "to help . . . uphold" ([Isa
63:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#005)).

his arm-- ([Isa 40:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#010); [Isa
51:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#005)). Not man's arm, but His alone
([Psa 98:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#001); [Psa
44:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#003)).

his righteousness--the "arm" of Messiah. He won the victory for us, not
by mere might as God, but by His invincible righteousness, as man having
"the Spirit without measure" ([Isa
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#005); [Isa
42:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#006), [Isa
42:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#021); [Isa
51:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#008); [Isa
53:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#011); [Jo1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#001)).

[Isaiah 59:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 59:17</span></span>

Messiah is represented as a warrior armed at all points, going forth to
vindicate His people. Owing to the unity of Christ and His people, their
armor is like His, except that they have no "garments of vengeance"
(which is God's prerogative, [Rom
12:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#019)), or "cloak of zeal" (in the
sense of judicial fury punishing the wicked; this zeal belongs properly
to God, [Kg2 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#016); [Rom
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#002); [Phi
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#006); "zeal," in the sense of anxiety
for the Lord's honor, they have, [Num
25:11](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#011), [Num
25:13](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#013); [Psa
69:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#009); [Co2
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#011); [Co2
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#002)); and for "salvation," which is of
God alone ([Psa 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#008)), they have as
their helmet, "the hope of salvation" ([Th1
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#008)). The "helmet of salvation" is
attributed to them ([Eph 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#014), [Eph
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#017)) in a secondary sense; namely,
derived from Him, and as yet only in hope, not fruition ([Rom
8:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#024)). The second coming here, as
often, is included in this representation of Messiah. His "zeal" ([Joh
2:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#015)) at His first coming was but a
type of His zeal and vengeance against the foes of God at His second
coming ([Th2 1:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#008); [Rev
19:11-21](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#011)).

[Isaiah 59:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 59:18</span></span>

deeds--Hebrew, "recompenses"; "according as their deeds demand"
\[MAURER\]. This verse predicts the judgments at the Lord's second
coming, which shall precede the final redemption of His people ([Isa
66:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#018), [Isa
66:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#015)).

islands--(See on [Isa 41:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#001)). Distant
countries.

[Isaiah 59:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 59:19</span></span>

([Isa 45:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#006); [Mal
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#011)). The result of God's judgments
([Isa 26:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#009); [Isa
66:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#018)).

like a flood-- ([Jer 46:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#007); [Rev
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#015)).

lift up a standard--rather, from a different Hebrew root, "shall put him
to flight," "drive him away" \[MAURER\]. LOWTH, giving a different sense
to the Hebrew for "enemy" from that in [Isa
59:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#018), and a forced meaning to the
Hebrew for "Spirit of the Lord," translates, "When He shall come as a
river straitened in its course, which a mighty wind drives along."

[Isaiah 59:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 59:20</span></span>

to Zion-- [Rom 11:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#026) quotes it, "out
of Zion." Thus Paul, by inspiration, supplements the sense from [Psa
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#007) : He was, and is come to Zion,
first with redemption, being sprung as man out of Zion. The Septuagint
translates "for the sake of Zion." Paul applies this verse to the coming
restoration of Israel spiritually.

them that turn from-- ([Rom 11:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#026)).
"shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob"; so the Septuagint, Paul herein
gives the full sense under inspiration. They turn from transgression,
because He first turns them from it, and it from them ([Psa
130:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#004); [Lam
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#021)).

[Isaiah 59:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 59:21</span></span>

covenant with them . . . thee--The covenant is with Christ, and with
them only as united to Him ([Heb
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#013)). Jehovah addresses Messiah the
representative and ideal Israel. The literal and spiritual Israel are
His seed, to whom the promise is to be fulfilled ([Psa
22:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#030)).

spirit . . . not depart . . . for ever-- ([Jer
31:31-37](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#031); [Mat
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#020)).

An ode of congratulation to Zion on her restoration at the Lord's second
advent to her true position as the mother church from which the Gospel
is to be diffused to the whole Gentile world; the first promulgation of
the Gospel among the Gentiles, beginning at Jerusalem \[[Luk
24:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#047)\], is an earnest of this. The
language is too glorious to apply to anything that as yet has happened.
