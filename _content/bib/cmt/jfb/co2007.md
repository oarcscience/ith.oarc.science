### [2 Corinthians Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#001)

[2 Corinthians 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co2 7:1</span></span>

SELF-PURIFICATION THEIR DUTY RESULTING FROM THE FOREGOING. HIS LOVE TO
THEM, AND JOY AT THE GOOD EFFECTS ON THEM OF HIS FORMER EPISTLE, AS
REPORTED BY TITUS. (2Co. 7:1-16)

cleanse ourselves--This is the conclusion of the exhortation ([Co2
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#001), [Co2
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#014); [Jo1
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#003); [Rev
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#011)).

filthiness--"the unclean thing" ([Co2
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#017)).

of the flesh--for instance, fornication, prevalent at Corinth ([Co1
6:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#015)).

and spirit--for instance, idolatry, direct or indirect ([Co1
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#009); [Co1
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#001), [Co1
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#007); [Co1
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#007), [Co1
10:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#021)). The spirit ([Psa
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#002)) receives pollution through the
flesh, the instrument of uncleanness.

perfecting holiness--The cleansing away impurity is a positive step
towards holiness ([Co2 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#017)). It is
not enough to begin; the end crowns the work ([Gal
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#003); [Gal
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#007); [Phi
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#006)).

fear of God--often conjoined with the consideration of the most glorious
promises ([Co2 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#011); [Heb
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#001)). Privilege and promise go hand in
hand.

[2 Corinthians 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co2 7:2</span></span>

Receive us--with enlarged hearts ([Co2
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#013)).

we have wronged . . . corrupter . . . defrauded no man--(compare [Co2
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#009)). This is the ground on which he
asks their reception of (making room for) him in their hearts. We
wronged none by an undue exercise of apostolic authority; [Co2
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#013) gives an instance in point. We
have corrupted none, namely, by beguilements and flatteries, while
preaching "another Gospel," as the false teachers did ([Co2
11:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#003)). We have defrauded none by
"making a gain" of you ([Co2 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#017)).
Modestly he leaves them to supply the positive good which he had done;
suffering all things himself that they might be benefited ([Co2
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#009), [Co2
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#012); [Co2
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#013)).

[2 Corinthians 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co2 7:3</span></span>

In excusing myself, I do not accuse you, as though you suspected me of
such things \[MENOCHIUS\], or as though you were guilty of such things;
for I speak only of the false apostles \[ESTIUS and Greek
commentators\]. Rather, "as though you were ungrateful and treacherous"
\[BEZA\].

I have said before--in [Co2 6:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#011);
compare [Phi 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#007).

die and live with you--the height of friendship. I am ready to die and
live with you and for you ([Phi 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#007),
[Phi 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#020), [Phi
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#024); [Phi
2:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#017)). Compare as to Christ, [Joh
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#011).

[2 Corinthians 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co2 7:4</span></span>

boldness of speech--(compare [Co2
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#011)).

glorying of you--Not only do I speak with unreserved openness to you,
but I glory (boast) greatly to others in your behalf, in speaking of
you.

filled with comfort--at the report of Titus ([Co2
7:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#006), [Co2
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#009), [Co2
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#013); [Co2
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#004)).

exceeding joyful--Greek, I overabound with joy ([Co2
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#007), [Co2
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#009), [Co2
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#016)).

our tribulation--described in [Co2
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#005); also in [Co2
4:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#007); [Co2
6:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#004).

[2 Corinthians 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co2 7:5</span></span>

Greek, "For also" (for "even"). This verse is thus connected with [Co2
2:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#012), "When I came to Troas, I had
no rest in my spirit"; so "also" now, when I came to Macedonia, my
"flesh" had no rest (he, by the term "flesh," excepts his spiritual
consolations) from "fightings" with adversaries "without" ([Co1
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#012)), and from fears for the
Corinthian believers "within" the Church, owing to "false brethren"
([Co2 11:26](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#026)). Compare [Co2
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#008); [Deu
32:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#025), to which he seems to allude.

[2 Corinthians 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co2 7:6</span></span>

Translate in the order required by the Greek, "But he that comforteth
those that are cast down, even God." Those that are of an high spirit
are not susceptible of such comfort.

[2 Corinthians 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co2 7:7</span></span>

when he told us--Greek, "telling us." We shared in the comfort which
Titus felt in recording your desire ([Co2
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#013)). He rejoiced in telling the
news; we in hearing them \[ALFORD\].

earnest desire--Greek, "longing desire," namely, to see me \[GROTIUS\];
or, in general, towards me, to please me.

mourning--over your own remissness in not having immediately punished
the sin ([Co1 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#001), &c.) which called
forth my rebuke.

fervent mind--Greek, "zeal" (compare [Co2
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#011); [Joh
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#017)).

toward me--Greek, "for me"; for my sake. They in Paul's behalf showed
the zeal against the sin which Paul would have shown had he been
present.

rejoiced the more--more than before, at the mere coming of Titus.

[2 Corinthians 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co2 7:8</span></span>

with a letter--Greek, "in the letter" namely, the first Epistle to the
Corinthians.

I do not repent, though I did repent--Translate, "I do not regret it,
though I did regret it." The Greek words for regret and repent are
distinct. Paul was almost regretting, through parental tenderness, his
having used rebukes calculated to grieve the Corinthians; but now that
he has learned from Titus the salutary effect produced on them, he no
longer regrets it.

for I perceive, &c.--This is explanatory of "I did repent" or "regret
it," and is parenthetical ("for I perceive that that Epistle did make
you sorry, though it was but for a season").

[2 Corinthians 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co2 7:9</span></span>

Now I rejoice--Whereas "I did repent" or regret having made you sorry by
my letter, I rejoice NOW, not that ye were caused sorrow, but that your
sorrow resulted in your repentance.

ye sorrowed--rather, as before, "ye were made sorry."

after a godly manner--literally, "according to God," that is, your
sorrow having regard to God, and rendering your mind conformable to God
([Rom 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#022); [Pe1
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#006)).

that--Translate in Greek order, "to the end that (compare [Co2
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#009)) ye might in nothing receive
damage from us," which ye would have received, had your sorrow been
other than that "after a godly manner" ([Co2
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#010)).

[2 Corinthians 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co2 7:10</span></span>

worketh . . . worketh--In the best Greek reading the translation is,
"worketh (simply) . . . worketh out." "Sorrow" is not repentance, but,
where it is "godly," "worketh" it; that is, contributes or tends to it
(the same Greek word is in [Rom
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#010)). The "sorrow of the world"
(that is, such as is felt by the worldly) "worketh out," as its result
at last, (eternal) death (the same Greek verb is in [Co2
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#017); also see on [Co2
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#017)).

repentance . . . not to be repented of--There is not in the Greek this
play on words, so that the word qualified is not "repentance" merely,
but "repentance unto salvation"; this, he says, none will ever regret,
however attended with "sorrow" at the time. "Repentance" implies a
coming to a right mind; "regret" implies merely uneasiness of feeling at
the past or present, and is applied even to the remorse of Judas ([Mat
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#003); Greek, "stricken with remorse,"
not as English Version, "repented himself"); so that, though always
accompanying repentance, it is not always accompanied by repentance.
"Repentance" removes the impediments in the way of "salvation" (to which
"death," namely, of the soul, is opposed). "The sorrow of the world" is
not at the sin itself, but at its penal consequences: so that the tears
of pain are no sooner dried up, than the pleasures of ungodliness are
renewed. So Pharaoh, [Exo 9:27-30](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#027); and
Saul, [Sa1 15:23-30](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#023). Compare [Isa
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#013); [Rev
16:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#010). Contrast David's "godly
sorrow," [Sa2 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#013), and Peter's, [Mat
26:75](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#075).

[2 Corinthians 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co2 7:11</span></span>

Confirmation of [Co2 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#010) from the
Corinthians' own experience.

carefulness--solicitude, literally, "diligence"; opposed to their past
negligence in the matter.

in you--Greek "for you."

yea--not only "carefulness" or diligence, but also "clearing of
yourselves," namely, to me by Titus: anxiety to show you disapproved of
the deed.

indignation--against the offender.

fear--of the wrath of God, and of sinning any more \[SCLATER and
CALVIN\]; fear of Paul \[GROTIUS\], ([Co1
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#002), [Co1
4:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#019)).

vehement desire--longing for restoration to Paul's approval \[CONYBEARE
and HOWSON\]. "Fear" is in spite of one's self. "Longing desire" is
spontaneous, and implies strong love and an aspiration for correction
\[CALVIN\]. "Desire" for the presence of Paul, as he had given them the
hope of it ([Co1 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#019); [Co1
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#005)) \[GROTIUS and ESTIUS\].

zeal--for right and for God's honor against what is wrong. Or, "for the
good of the soul of the offender" \[BENGEL\].

revenge--Translate, "Exacting of punishment" ([Co1
5:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#002)). Their "carefulness" was
exhibited in the six points just specified: "clearing of themselves,"
and "indignation" in relation to themselves; "fear" and "vehement
desire" in respect to the apostle; "zeal" and "revenge" in respect to
the offender \[BENGEL\]; (compare [Co2
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#007)).

In all--the respects just stated.

clear--Greek, "pure," namely, from complicity in the guilty deed.
"Approved yourselves," Greek, "commended yourselves." Whatever suspicion
of complicity rested on you ([Co1 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#002),
[Co1 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#006)) through your former
remissness, you have cleared off by your present strenuousness in
reprobating the deed.

[2 Corinthians 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co2 7:12</span></span>

though I wrote unto you--"making you sorry with my letter" ([Co2
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#008)).

his cause that suffered wrong--the father of the incestuous person who
had his father's wife ([Co1 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#001)). The
father, thus it seems, was alive.

that our care for you, &c.--Some of the oldest manuscripts read thus,
"That YOUR care for us might be made manifest unto you," &c. But the
words, "unto you," thus, would be rather obscure; still the obscurity of
the genuine reading may have been the very reason for the change being
made by correctors into the reading of English Version. ALFORD explains
the reading: "He wrote in order to bring out their zeal on his behalf
(that is, to obey his command), and make it manifest to themselves in
God's sight, that is, to bring out among them their zeal to regard and
obey him." But some of the oldest manuscripts and versions (including
the Vulgate and old Italian) support English Version. And the words, "to
you," suit it better than the other reading. [Co2
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#004), "I wrote . . . that ye might know
the love which I have more abundantly unto you," plainly accords with
it, and disproves ALFORD'S assertion that English Version is
inconsistent with the fact as to the purpose of his letter. His writing,
he says, was not so much for the sake of the individual offender, or the
individual offended, but from his "earnest care" or concern for the
welfare of the Church.

[2 Corinthians 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co2 7:13</span></span>

The oldest manuscripts read thus, "Therefore (Greek, 'for this cause,'
namely, because our aim has been attained) we have been (English
Version, 'were,' is not so accurate) comforted; yea (Greek, 'but'), in
OUR comfort we exceedingly the more joyed for the joy of Titus," &c.
(compare [Co2 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#007)).

[2 Corinthians 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co2 7:14</span></span>

anything--that is, at all.

I am not ashamed--"I am not put to shame," namely, by learning from
Titus that you did not realize the high character I gave him of you.

as . . . all things . . . in truth, even so our boasting . . . is found
a truth--As our speaking in general to you was true ([Co2
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#018)), so our particular boasting to
Titus concerning you is now, by his report, proved to be truth (compare
[Co2 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#002)). Some oldest manuscripts
read expressly, "concerning you"; this in either reading is the sense.

[2 Corinthians 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co2 7:15</span></span>

his inward affection--literally, "bowels" (compare [Co2
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#012); [Phi
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#008); [Phi
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#001); [Col
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#012)).

obedience-- ([Co2 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#009)).

fear and trembling--with trembling anxiety to obey my wishes, and
fearful lest there should be aught in yourselves to offend him and me
([Co2 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#011); compare [Co1
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#003)).

[2 Corinthians 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co2 7:16</span></span>

therefore--omitted in the oldest manuscripts. The conclusion is more
emphatical without it.

that I have confidence in you in all things--rather, as Greek, "that in
everything I am of good courage concerning (literally, 'in the case of')
you," as contrasted with my former doubts concerning you.
