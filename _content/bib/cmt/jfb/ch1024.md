### [1 Chronicles Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#001)

[1 Chronicles 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 24:1</span></span>

DIVISION OF THE SONS OF AARON INTO FOUR AND TWENTY ORDERS. (1Ch.
24:1-19)

Now these are the divisions of the sons of Aaron--(See on [Ch1
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#006)).

[1 Chronicles 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch1 24:2</span></span>

Nadab and Abihu died before their father--that is, not in his presence,
but during his lifetime (see [Num 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#004);
[Num 26:61](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#061)).

therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priest's office--In
consequence of the death of his two oldest sons without issue, the
descendants of Aaron were comprised in the families of Eleazar and
Ithamar. Both of these sons discharged the priestly functions as
assistants to their father. Eleazar succeeded him, and in his line the
high priesthood continued until it was transferred to the family of
Ithamar, in the person of Eli.

[1 Chronicles 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch1 24:3</span></span>

Zadok . . . and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar--This statement, taken
in connection with [Ch1 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#006), is not a
little perplexing, since ([Sa2 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#024),
[Sa2 15:35](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#035); [Sa2
20:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#025)) Abiathar is mentioned as the
person conjoined in David's time with Zadok, in the collegiate exercise
of the high priesthood. Some think that the words have been transposed,
reading Abiathar, the son of Ahimelech. But there is no ground for
regarding the text as faulty. The high priests of the line of Ithamar
were the following: Ahiah or Ahimelech, his son Abiathar, his son
Ahimelech. We frequently find the grandfather and grandson called by the
same name (see list of high priests of the line of Eleazar, [Ch1
6:30-41](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#030)). Hence the author of the
Chronicles was acquainted with Ahimelech, son of Abiathar, who, for some
reason, discharged the duties of high priest in David's reign, and
during the lifetime of his father (for Abiathar was living in the time
of Solomon, [Kg1 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#027)) \[KEIL\].

[1 Chronicles 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch1 24:4</span></span>

there were more chief men found--The Hebrew may be translated, "There
were more men as to heads of the sons of Eleazar." It is true, in point
of fact, that by the census the number of individuals belonging to the
family of Eleazar was found greater than in that of Ithamar. And this,
of necessity, led to there being more fathers' houses, and consequently
more chiefs or presidents in the former.

[1 Chronicles 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch1 24:5</span></span>

Thus were they divided by lot--This method of allocation was adopted
manifestly to remove all cause of jealousy as to precedence and the
right of performing particular duties.

[1 Chronicles 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 24:6</span></span>

one principal household--The marginal reading is preferable, "one house
of the father." The lot was cast in a deliberate and solemn manner in
presence of the king, the princes, the two high priests, and the chiefs
of the priestly and Levitical families. The heads of families belonging
to Eleazar and Ithamar were alternately brought forward to draw, and the
name of each individual, as called, registered by an attendant
secretary. To accommodate the casting of the lots to the inequality of
the number, there being sixteen fathers' houses of Eleazar, and only
eight of Ithamar, it was arranged that every house of Ithamar should be
followed by two of Eleazar, or, what is the same thing, that every two
houses of Eleazar should be followed by one of Ithamar. If, then, we
suppose a commencement to have been made by Eleazar, the order would be
as follows: one and two, Eleazar; three, Ithamar; four and five,
Eleazar; six, Ithamar; seven and eight, Eleazar; nine, Ithamar; and so
forth \[BERTHEAU\]. The lot determined also the order of the priests'
service. That of the Levites was afterwards distributed by the same
arrangement ([Ch1 24:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#031)).
