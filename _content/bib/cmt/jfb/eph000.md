### [Ephesians Introduction](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#001)

[Ephesians](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eph 0:0</span></span>

THE headings ([Eph 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#001), and [Eph
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#001), show that this Epistle claims to
be that of Paul. This claim is confirmed by the testimonies of IRENÃ†US,
\[Against Heresies, 5.2,3; 1.8,5\]; CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA,
\[Miscellanies, 4, P. 65, and The Instructor, 1.8\]; ORIGEN, \[Against
Celsus, 4,211\]. It is quoted by VALENTINUS, A.D. 120, namely, [Eph
3:14-18](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#014), as we know from HIPPOLYTUS
\[The Refutation of All Heresies, p. 193\]. POLYCARP \[Epistle to the
Philippians, 12\], testifies to its canonicity. So TERTULLIAN \[Against
Marcion, 5,17\]. IGNATIUS \[Epistle to the Ephesians, 12\], which
alludes to the frequent and affectionate mention made by Paul of the
Christian state, privileges, and persons of the Ephesians in his
Epistle.

Two theories, besides the ordinary one, have been held on the question,
to whom the Epistle is addressed. GROTIUS, after the heretic Marcion,
maintains that it was addressed to the Church at Laodicea, and that it
is the Epistle to which Paul refers in [Col
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#016). But the Epistle to the
Colossians was probably written before that to the Ephesians, as appears
from the parallel passages in Ephesians bearing marks of being expanded
from those in Colossians; and Marcion seems to have drawn his notion, as
to our Epistle, from Paul's allusion ([Col
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#016)) to an Epistle addressed by him
to the Laodiceans. ORIGEN and CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA, and even
TERTULLIAN, who refers to Marcion, give no sanction to his notion. No
single manuscript contains the heading, "to the saints that are at
Laodicea." The very resemblance of the Epistle to the Ephesians, to that
to the Colossians, is against the theory; for if the former were really
the one addressed to Laodicea ([Col
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#016)), Paul would not have deemed it
necessary that the churches of Colosse and Laodicea should interchange
Epistles. The greetings, moreover ([Col
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#015)), which he sends through the
Colossians to the Laodiceans, are quite incompatible with the idea that
Paul wrote an Epistle to the Laodiceans at the same time, and by the
same bearer, Tychicus (the bearer of our Epistle to the Ephesians, as
well as of that to Colosse, [Eph 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#021);
[Col 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#007)); for who, under such
circumstances, would not send the greetings directly in the letter to
the party saluted? The letter to Laodicea was evidently written some
time before that to Colosse, Archbishop USHER has advanced the second
theory: That it was an encyclical letter headed, as in Manuscript B.,
"to the saints that are . . . and to the faithful," the name of each
Church being inserted in the copy sent to it; and that its being sent to
Ephesus first, occasioned its being entitled, as now, the Epistle to the
Ephesians. ALFORD makes the following objections to this theory: (1) It
is at variance with the spirit of the Epistle, which is clearly
addressed to one set of persons throughout, co-existing in one place,
and as one body, and under the same circumstances. (2) The improbability
that the apostle, who in two of his Epistles (Second Corinthians and
Galatians) has so plainly specified their encyclical character, should
have here omitted such specification. (3) The still greater
improbability that he should have, as on this hypothesis must be
assumed, written a circular Epistle to a district, of which Ephesus was
the commercial capital, addressed to various churches within that
district, yet from its very contents (as by the opponents' hypothesis)
not admitting of application to the Church of that metropolis, in which
he had spent so long a time, and to which he was so affectionately
bound. (4) The inconsistency of this hypothesis with the address of the
Epistle, and the universal testimony of the ancient Church. The absence
of personal greetings is not an argument for either of the two theories;
for similarly there are none in Galatians, Philippians, First and Second
Thessalonians, First Timothy. The better he knows the parties addressed,
and the more general and solemn the subject, the less he seems to give
of these individual notices. Writing, as he does in this Epistle, on the
constitution and prospects of Christ's universal Church, he refers the
Ephesians, as to personal matters, to the bearer of the Epistle,
Tychicus ([Eph 6:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#021)). As to the
omission of "which are at Ephesus" ([Eph
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#001)), in Manuscript B., so "in Rome"
([Rom 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#007)) is omitted in some old
manuscripts: it was probably done by churches among whom it was read, in
order to generalize the reference of its contents, and especially where
the subject of the Epistle is catholic. The words are found in the
margin of Manuscript B, from a first hand; and are found in all the
oldest manuscripts and versions.

Paul's first visit to Ephesus (on the seacoast of Lydia, near the river
Cayster) is related in [Act 18:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#019).
The work, begun by his disputations with the Jews in his short visit,
was carried on by Apollos ([Act
18:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#024)), and Aquila and Priscilla
([Act 18:26](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#026)). At his second visit,
after his journey to Jerusalem, and thence to the east regions of Asia
Minor, he remained at Ephesus "three years" ([Act
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#010), the "two years" in which verse
are only part of the time, and [Act
20:31](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#031)); so that the founding and
rearing of this Church occupied an unusually large portion of the
apostle's time and care; whence his language in this Epistle shows a
warmth of feeling, and a free outpouring of thought, and a union in
spiritual privileges and hope between him and them ([Eph
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#003), &c.), such as are natural from
one so long and so intimately associated with those whom he addresses.
On his last journey to Jerusalem, he sailed by Ephesus and summoned the
elders of the Ephesian Church to meet him at Miletus, where he delivered
his remarkable farewell charge (Acts 20:18-35).

This Epistle was addressed to the Ephesians during the early part of his
imprisonment at Rome, immediately after that to the Colossians, to which
it bears a close resemblance in many passages, the apostle having in his
mind generally the same great truths in writing both. It is an
undesigned proof of genuineness that the two Epistles, written about the
same date, and under the same circumstances, bear a closer mutual
resemblance than those written at distant dates and on different
occasions. Compare [Eph 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#007) with [Col
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#014); [Eph
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#010) with [Col
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#020); [Eph
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#002) with [Col
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#025); [Eph
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#019) with [Col
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#016); [Eph
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#022) with [Col
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#008); [Eph
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#019); [Eph
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#005) with [Col
2:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#012); [Eph
4:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#002) with [Col
3:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#012); [Eph
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#016) with [Col
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#019); [Eph
4:32](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#032) with [Col
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#013); [Eph
4:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#022) with [Col
3:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#009); [Eph
5:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#006) with [Col
3:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#006); [Eph
5:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#015) with [Col
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#005); [Eph
6:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#019) with [Col
4:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#003); [Eph
5:22-33](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#022); [Eph
6:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#001) with [Col
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#018); [Eph
4:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#024) with [Col
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#009); [Eph
5:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#020) with [Col
3:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#017). Tychicus and Onesimus were
being sent to Colosse, the former bearing the two Epistles to the two
churches respectively, the latter furnished with a letter of
recommendation to Philemon, his former master, residing at Colosse. The
date was probably about four years after his parting with the Ephesian
elders at Miletus (Acts 20:6-38), about A.D. 62, before his imprisonment
had become of the more severe kind, which appears in his Epistle to the
Philippians. From [Eph 6:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#019) it is
plain he had at the time, though a prisoner, some degree of freedom in
preaching, which accords with [Act
28:23](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#023), [Act
28:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#030), where he is represented as
receiving at his lodgings all inquirers. His imprisonment began in
February A.D. 61 and lasted "two whole years" ([Act
28:30](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#030)) at least, and perhaps longer.

The Church of Ephesus was made up of converts partly from the Jews and
partly from the Gentiles ([Act
19:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#008)). Accordingly, the Epistle so
addresses a Church constituted ([Eph
2:14-22](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014)). Ephesus was famed for its
idol temple of Artemis or Diana, which, after its having been burnt down
by Herostratus on the night that Alexander the Great was born (355
B.C.), was rebuilt at enormous cost and was one of the wonders of the
world. Hence, perhaps, have arisen his images in this Epistle drawn from
a beautiful temple: the Church being in true inner beauty that which the
temple of the idol tried to realize in outward show ([Eph
2:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#019)). The Epistle ([Eph
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#017); [Eph
5:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#001)) implies the profligacy for
which the Ephesian heathen were notorious. Many of the same expressions
occur in the Epistle as in Paul's address to the Ephesian elders.
Compare [Eph 1:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#006); [Eph
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#007), as to "grace," with [Act
20:24](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#024), [Act
20:32](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#032) : this may well be called "the
Epistle of the grace of God" \[ALFORD\]. Also, as to his "bonds," [Eph
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#001), and [Eph
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#001) with [Act
20:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#022). Also [Eph
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#011), as to "the counsel of God," with
[Act 20:27](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#027). Also [Eph
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#014), as to "the redemption of the
purchased possession," with [Act
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#028). Also [Eph
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#014), [Eph
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#018); [Eph
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#020); [Eph
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#005), as to "building up" the
"inheritance," with [Act 20:32](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#032).

The object of the Epistle is "to set forth the ground, the course, and
the aim and end of THE CHURCH OF THE FAITHFUL IN CHRIST. He speaks to
the Ephesians as a type or sample of the Church universal" \[ALFORD\].
Hence, "the Church" throughout the Epistle is spoken of in the singular,
not in the plural, "churches." The Church's foundation, its course, and
its end, are his theme alike in the larger and smaller divisions of the
whole Epistle. "Everywhere the foundation of the Church is in the will
of the Father; the course of the Church is by the satisfaction of the
Son; the end of the Church is the life in the Holy Spirit" \[ALFORD\].
Compare respectively [Eph 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#011); [Eph
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#005); [Eph
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#016). This having been laid down as a
matter of doctrine (this part closing with a sublime doxology, [Eph
3:14-21](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#014)), is then made the ground of
practical exhortations. In these latter also (from [Eph
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#001), onward), the same threefold
division prevails, for the Church is represented as founded on the
counsel of "God the Father, who is above all, through all, and in all,"
reared by the "one Lord," Jesus Christ, through the "one Spirit" ([Eph
4:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#004), &c.), who give their respective
graces to the several members. These last are therefore to exercise all
these graces in the several relations of life, as husbands, wives,
servants, children, &c. The conclusion is that we must put on "the whole
armor of God" ([Eph 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#013)).

The sublimity of the STYLE and LANGUAGE corresponds to the sublimity of
the subjects and exceeds almost that of any part of his Epistles. It is
appropriate that those to whom he so wrote were Christians long grounded
in the faith. The very sublimity is the cause of the difficulty of the
style, and of the presence of peculiar expressions occurring, not found
elsewhere.
