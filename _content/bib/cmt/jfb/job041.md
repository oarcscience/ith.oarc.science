### [Job Chapter 41](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#001)

[Job 41:1](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 41:1</span></span>

(Job 41:1-34)

leviathan--literally, "the twisted animal," gathering itself in folds: a
synonym to the Thannin ([Job 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#008),
Margin; see [Psa 74:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#014); type of the
Egyptian tyrant; [Psa 104:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#026); [Isa
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#001); the Babylon tyrant). A poetical
generalization for all cetacean, serpentine, and saurian monsters (see
on [Job 40:15](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#015), hence all the
description applies to no one animal); especially the crocodile; which
is naturally described after the river horse, as both are found in the
Nile.

tongue . . . lettest down?--The crocodile has no tongue, or a very small
one cleaving to the lower jaw. But as in fishing the tongue of the fish
draws the baited hook to it, God asks, Canst thou in like manner take
leviathan?

[Job 41:2](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 41:2</span></span>

hook--rather, "a rope of rushes."

thorn--rather, a "ring" or "hook." So wild beasts were led about when
caught ([Isa 37:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#029); [Eze
29:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#004)); fishes also were secured thus
and thrown into the water to keep them alive.

[Job 41:3](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 41:3</span></span>

soft words--that thou mayest spare his life. No: he is untamable.

[Job 41:4](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 41:4</span></span>

Can he be tamed for domestic use (so [Job
39:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#010))?

[Job 41:5](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 41:5</span></span>

a bird?--that is, tamed.

[Job 41:6](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 41:6</span></span>

Rather, "partners" (namely, in fishing).

make a banquet--The parallelism rather supports UMBREIT, "Do partners
(in trade) desire to purchase him?" So the Hebrew ([Deu
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#006)).

merchants--literally, "Canaanites," who were great merchants ([Hos
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#007), Margin).

[Job 41:7](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 41:7</span></span>

His hide is not penetrable, as that of fishes.

[Job 41:8](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 41:8</span></span>

If thou lay . . . thou wilt have reason ever to remember . . . and thou
wilt never try it again.

[Job 41:9](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 41:9</span></span>

the hope--of taking him.

cast down--with fear "at the (mere) sight of him."

[Job 41:10](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 41:10</span></span>

fierce--courageous. If a man dare attack one of My creatures ([Gen
49:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#009); [Num
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#009)), who will dare (as Job has
wished) oppose himself ([Psa 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#002)) to
Me, the Creator? This is the main drift of the description of leviathan.

[Job 41:11](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 41:11</span></span>

prevented--done Me a favor first: anticipated Me with service ([Psa
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#003)). None can call Me to account
("stand before Me," [Job 41:10](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#010)) as
unjust, because I have withdrawn favors from him (as in Job's case): for
none has laid Me under a prior obligation by conferring on Me something
which was not already My own. What can man give to Him who possesses
all, including man himself? Man cannot constrain the creature to be his
"servant" ([Job 41:4](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#004)), much less the
Creator.

[Job 41:12](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 41:12</span></span>

I will not conceal--a resumption of the description broken off by the
digression, which formed an agreeable change.

his power--literally, "the way," that is, true proportion or expression
of his strength (so Hebrew, [Deu
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#004)).

comely proportion--literally, "the comeliness of his structure" (his
apparatus: so "suit of apparel" [Jdg
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#010)) \[MAURER\]. UMBREIT translates,
"his armor." But that follows after.

[Job 41:13](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 41:13</span></span>

discover--rather, "uncover the surface" of his garment (skin, [Job
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#011)): strip off the hard outer coat
with which the inner skin is covered.

with--rather, "within his double jaws"; literally, "bridle"; hence that
into which the bridle is put, the double row of teeth; but "bridle" is
used to imply that none dare put his hand in to insert a bridle where in
other animals it is placed ([Job 41:4](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#004);
[Job 39:10](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#010)).

[Job 41:14](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 41:14</span></span>

doors of . . . face--his mouth. His teeth are sixty in number, larger in
proportion than his body, some standing out, some serrated, fitting into
each other like a comb \[BOCHART\].

[Job 41:15](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 41:15</span></span>

Rather, his "furrows of shields" (as "tubes," "channels," see on [Job
40:18](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#018)), are, &c., that is, the rows of
scales, like shields covering him: he has seventeen such rows.

shut up--firmly closed together. A musket ball cannot penetrate him,
save in the eye, throat, and belly.

[Job 41:18](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 41:18</span></span>

Translate: "his sneezing, causeth a light to shine." Amphibious animals,
emerging after having long held their breath under water, respire by
violently expelling the breath like one sneezing: in the effort the eyes
which are usually directed towards the sun, seem to flash fire; or it is
the expelled breath that, in the sun, seems to emit light.

eyelids of morning--The Egyptian hieroglyphics paint the eyes of the
crocodile as the symbol for morning, because the eyes appear the first
thing, before the whole body emerges from the deep \[HorÃ&brvbr;
HierogliphicÃ&brvbr; 1.65. BOCHART\].

[Job 41:19](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 41:19</span></span>

burning lamps--"torches"; namely, in respiring ([Job
41:18](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#018)), seem to go out.

[Job 41:20](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 41:20</span></span>

seething--boiling: literally, "blown under," under which a fire is
blown.

[Job 41:21](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 41:21</span></span>

kindleth coals--poetical imagery ([Psa
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#008)).

[Job 41:22](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 41:22</span></span>

remaineth--abideth permanently. His chief strength is in the neck.

sorrow--anxiety or dismay personified.

is turned into joy--rather, "danceth," "exulteth"; wherever he goes, he
spreads terror "before him."

[Job 41:23](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">job 41:23</span></span>

flakes--rather, "dewlaps"; that which falls down (Margin). They are
"joined" fast and firm, together, not hanging loose, as in the ox.

are firm--UMBREIT and MAURER, "are spread."

in themselves--rather, "upon him."

[Job 41:24](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">job 41:24</span></span>

heart--"In large beasts which are less acute in feeling, there is great
firmness of the heart, and slower motion" \[BOCHART\]. The nether
millstone, on which the upper turns, is especially hard.

[Job 41:25](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">job 41:25</span></span>

he--the crocodile; a type of the awe which the Creator inspires when He
rises in wrath.

breakings--namely, of the mind, that is, terror.

purify themselves--rather, "they wander from the way," that is, flee
away bewildered \[MAURER and UMBREIT\].

[Job 41:26](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">job 41:26</span></span>

cannot hold--on his hard skin.

habergeon--coat of mail; avail must be taken by zeugma out of "hold," as
the verb in the second clause: "hold" cannot apply to the "coat of
mail."

[Job 41:27](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">job 41:27</span></span>

iron . . . brass--namely, weapons.

[Job 41:28](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">job 41:28</span></span>

arrow--literally, "son of the bow"; Oriental imagery ([Lam
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#013); Margin).

stubble--Arrows produce no more effect than it would to throw stubble at
him.

[Job 41:29](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">job 41:29</span></span>

Darts--rather, "clubs"; darts have been already mentioned ([Job
41:26](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#026)).

[Job 41:30](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">job 41:30</span></span>

stones--rather, "potsherds," that is, the sharp and pointed scales on
the belly, like broken pieces of pottery.

sharp-pointed things--rather, "a threshing instrument," but not on the
fruits of the earth, but "on the mire"; irony. When he lies on the mire,
he leaves the marks of his scales so imprinted on it, that one might
fancy a threshing instrument with its sharp teeth had been drawn over it
([Isa 28:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#027)).

[Job 41:31](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">job 41:31</span></span>

Whenever he moves.

sea--the Nile ([Isa 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#005); [Nah
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#008)).

pot of ointment--the vessel in which it is mixed. Appropriate to the
crocodile, which emits a musky smell.

[Job 41:32](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">job 41:32</span></span>

path--the foam on his track.

hoary--as hair of the aged.

[Job 41:33](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">job 41:33</span></span>

who--being one who, &c.

[Job 41:34](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">job 41:34</span></span>

beholdeth--as their superior.

children of pride--the proud and fierce beasts. So [Job
28:8](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#008); Hebrew, "sons of pride." To
humble the pride of man and to teach implicit submission, is the aim of
Jehovah's speech and of the book; therefore with this as to leviathan,
the type of God in His lordship over creation, He closes.
