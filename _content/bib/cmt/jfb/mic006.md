### [Micah Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#001)

[Micah 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mic 6:1</span></span>

APPEAL BEFORE ALL CREATION TO THE ISRAELITES TO TESTIFY, IF THEY CAN, IF
JEHOVAH EVER DID AUGHT BUT ACTS OF KINDNESS TO THEM FROM THE EARLIEST
PERIOD: GOD REQUIRES OF THEM NOT SO MUCH SACRIFICES, AS REAL PIETY AND
JUSTICE: THEIR IMPIETIES AND COMING PUNISHMENT. (Mic. 6:1-16)

contend thou--Israel is called by Jehovah to pie ad with Him in
controversy. [Mic 5:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#011) suggested
the transition from those happy times described in the fourth and fifth
chapters, to the prophet's own degenerate times and people.

before the mountains--in their presence; personified as if witnesses
(compare [Mic 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#002); [Deu
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#001); [Isa
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#002)). Not as the Margin, "with"; as
God's controversy is with Israel, not with them.

[Micah 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mic 6:2</span></span>

Lord's controversy--How great is Jehovah's condescension, who, though
the supreme Lord of all, yet wishes to prove to worms of the earth the
equity of His dealings ([Isa 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#003); [Isa
43:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#026)).

[Micah 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mic 6:3</span></span>

my people--the greatest aggravation of their sin, that God always
treated them, and still treats them, as His people.

what have I done unto thee?--save kindness, that thou revoltest from Me
([Jer 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#005), [Jer
2:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#031)).

wherein have I wearied thee?--What commandments have I enjoined that
should have wearied thee as irksome ([Jo1
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#003))?

[Micah 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mic 6:4</span></span>

For--On the contrary, so far from doing anything harsh, I did thee every
kindness from the earliest years of thy nationality.

Miriam--mentioned, as being the prophetess who led the female chorus who
sang the song of Moses ([Exo 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#020)).
God sent Moses to give the best laws; Aaron to pray for the people;
Miriam as an example to the women of Israel.

[Micah 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mic 6:5</span></span>

what Balak . . . consulted--how Balak plotted to destroy thee by getting
Balaam to curse thee ([Num 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#005)).

what Balaam . . . answered--how the avaricious prophet was constrained
against his own will, to bless Israel whom he had desired to curse for
the sake of Balak's reward ([Num
24:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#009)) \[MAURER\]. GROTIUS explains
it, "how Balaam answered, that the only way to injure thee was by
tempting thee to idolatry and whoredom" ([Num
31:16](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#016)). The mention of "Shittim"
agrees with this: as it was the scene of Israel's sin ([Num
25:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#001); [Pe2
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#015); [Rev
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#014)).

from Shittim unto Gilgal--not that Balaam accompanied Israel from
Shittim to Gilgal: for he was slain in Midian ([Num
31:8](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#008)). But the clause, "from Shittim,"
alone applies to Balaam. "Remember" God's kindnesses "from Shittim," the
scene of Balaam's wicked counsel taking effect in Israel's sin, whereby
Israel merited utter destruction but for God's sparing mercy, "to
Gilgal," the place of Israel's first encampment in the promised land
between Jericho and Jordan, where God renewed the covenant with Israel
by circumcision ([Jos 5:2-11](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#002)).

know the righteousness--Recognize that, so far from God having treated
thee harshly ([Mic 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#003)), His dealings
have been kindness itself (so "righteous acts" for gracious, [Jdg
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#011); [Psa
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#005), [Psa
112:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#009)).

[Micah 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mic 6:6</span></span>

Wherewith shall I come before the Lord?--The people, convicted by the
previous appeal of Jehovah to them, ask as if they knew not (compare
[Mic 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#008)) what Jehovah requires of
them to appease Him, adding that they are ready to offer an immense heap
of sacrifices, and those the most costly, even to the fruit of their own
body.

burnt offerings-- (Lev. 1:1-17).

calves of a year old--which used to be offered for a priest ([Lev
9:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#002)).

[Micah 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mic 6:7</span></span>

rivers of oil--used in sacrifices ([Lev
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#001), [Lev
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#015)). Will God be appeased by my
offering so much oil that it shall flow in myriads of torrents?

my first-born-- ([Kg2 3:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#027)). As the
king of Moab did.

fruit of my body--my children, as an atonement ([Psa
132:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#011)). The Jews offered human
sacrifices in the valley of Hinnom ([Jer
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#005); [Jer
32:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#035); [Eze
23:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#027)).

[Micah 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mic 6:8</span></span>

He--Jehovah.

hath showed thee--long ago, so that thou needest not ask the question as
if thou hadst never heard ([Mic 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#006);
compare [Deu 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#012); [Deu
30:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#011)).

what is good--"the good things to come" under Messiah, of which "the law
had the shadow." The Mosaic sacrifices were but suggestive
foreshadowings of His better sacrifice ([Heb
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#023); [Heb
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#001)). To have this "good" first
"showed," or revealed by the Spirit, is the only basis for the
superstructure of the moral requirements which follow. Thus the way was
prepared for the Gospel. The banishment of the Jews from Palestine is
designed to preclude the possibility of their looking to the Mosaic
rites for redemption, and shuts them up to Messiah.

justly . . . mercy--preferred by God to sacrifices. For the latter being
positive ordinances, are only means designed with a view to the former,
which being moral duties are the ends, and of everlasting obligation
([Sa1 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#022); [Hos
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#006); [Hos
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#006); [Amo
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#022), [Amo
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#024)). Two duties towards man are
specified--justice, or strict equity; and mercy, or a kindly abatement
of what we might justly demand, and a hearty desire to do good to
others.

to walk humbly with thy God--passive and active obedience towards God.
The three moral duties here are summed up by our Lord ([Mat
23:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#023)), "judgment, mercy, and faith"
(in [Luk 11:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#042), "the love of God).
Compare [Jam 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#027). To walk with God
implies constant prayer and watchfulness, familiar yet "humble" converse
with God ([Gen 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#024); [Gen
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#001)).

[Micah 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mic 6:9</span></span>

unto the city--Jerusalem.

the man of wisdom--As in [Pro 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#006),
Hebrew, "sin" is used for "a man of sin," and in [Psa
109:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#004), "prayer" for "a man of prayer";
so here "wisdom" for "the man of wisdom."

shall see thy name--shall regard Thee, in Thy revelations of Thyself.
Compare the end of [Mic 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#007). God's
"name" expresses the sum-total of His revealed attributes. Contrast with
this [Isa 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#010), "will not behold the
majesty of the Lord." Another reading is adopted by the Septuagint,
Syriac, and Vulgate, "there is deliverance for those who fear Thy name."
English Version is better suited to the connection; and the rarity of
the Hebrew expression, as compared with the frequency of that in the
other reading, makes it less likely to be an interpolation.

hear . . . the rod, &c.--Hear what punishment (compare [Mic
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#013), &c.; [Isa
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#003); [Isa
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005), [Isa
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#024)) awaits you, and from whom. I am
but a man, and so ye may disregard me; but remember my message is not
mine, but God's. Hear the rod when it is come, and you feel its smart.
Hear what counsels, what cautions it speaks.

appointed it-- ([Jer 47:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#007)).

[Micah 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mic 6:10</span></span>

Are there yet--notwithstanding all My warnings. Is there to be no end of
acquiring treasures by wickedness? Jehovah is speaking ([Mic
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#009)).

scant measure . . . abominable-- ([Pro
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#001); [Amo
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#005)).

[Micah 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mic 6:11</span></span>

Shall I count them pure--literally, "Shall I be pure with?" &c. With the
pure God shows Himself pure; but with the froward God shows Himself
froward ([Psa 18:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#026)). Men often are
changeable in their judgments. But God, in the case of the impure who
use "wicked balances," cannot be pure, that is, cannot deal with them as
He would with the pure. VATABLUS and HENDERSON make the "I" to be "any
one"; "Can I (that is, one) be innocent with wicked balances?" But as
"I," in [Mic 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#013), refers to Jehovah,
it must refer to Him also here.

the bag--in which weights used to be carried, as well as money ([Deu
25:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#013); [Pro
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#011)).

[Micah 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mic 6:12</span></span>

For--rather, "Inasmuch as"; the conclusion "therefore," &c. following in
[Mic 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#013).

thereof--of Jerusalem.

[Micah 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mic 6:13</span></span>

make thee sick in smiting-- ([Lev
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#016), to which perhaps the allusion
here is, as in [Mic 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#014); [Psa
107:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#017); [Jer
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#013)).

[Micah 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mic 6:14</span></span>

eat . . . not be satisfied--fulfiling the threat, [Lev
26:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#026).

thy casting down shall be in the midst of thee--Thou shalt be cast down,
not merely on My borders, but in the midst of thee, thy metropolis and
temple being overthrown \[TIRINUS\]. Even though there should be no
enemy, yet thou shalt be consumed with intestine evils \[CALVIN\].
MAURER translates as from an Arabic root, "there shall be emptiness in
thy belly." Similarly GROTIUS, "there shall be a sinking of thy belly
(once filled with food), through hunger." This suits the parallelism to
the first clause. But English Version maintains the parallelism
sufficiently. The casting down in the midst of the land, including the
failure of food, through the invasion thus answering to, "Thou shalt
eat, and not be satisfied."

thou shalt take hold, but . . . not deliver--Thou shalt take hold (with
thine arms), in order to save \[CALVIN\] thy wives, children and goods.
MAURER, from a different root, translates, "thou shalt remove them," in
order to save them from the foe. But thou shalt fail in the attempt to
deliver them ([Jer 50:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#037)).

that which thou deliverest--If haply thou dost rescue aught, it will be
for a time: I will give it up to the foe's sword.

[Micah 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mic 6:15</span></span>

sow . . . not reap--fulfilling the threat ([Lev
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#016); [Deu
28:38-40](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#038); [Amo
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#011)).

[Micah 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mic 6:16</span></span>

statutes of Omri--the founder of Samaria and of Ahab's wicked house; and
a supporter of Jeroboam's superstitions ([Kg1
16:16-28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#016)). This verse is a
recapitulation of what was more fully stated before, Judah's sin and
consequent punishment. Judah, though at variance with Israel on all
things else, imitated her impiety.

works of . . . Ahab-- ([Kg1 21:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#025)).

ye walk in their counsels--Though these superstitions were the fruit of
their king's "counsels" as a master stroke of state policy, yet these
pretexts were no excuse for setting at naught the counsels and will of
God.

that I should make thee a desolation--Thy conduct is framed so, as if it
was thy set purpose "that I should make thee a desolation."

inhabitants thereof--namely, of Jerusalem.

hissing-- ([Lam 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#015)).

the reproach of my people--The very thing ye boast of, namely, that ye
are "My people," will only increase the severity of your punishment. The
greater My grace to you, the greater shall be your punishment for having
despised it, Your being God's people in name, while walking in His love,
was an honor; but now the name, without the reality, is only a
"reproach" to you.
