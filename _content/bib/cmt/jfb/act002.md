Testaments*, by Robert Jamieson, A.R. Fausset and David Brown \[1882\]

### [Acts Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#001)

[Acts 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 2:1</span></span>

DESCENT OF THE SPIRIT--THE DISCIPLES SPEAK WITH TONGUES--AMAZEMENT OF
THE MULTITUDE. ([Act 2:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#001))

when the day of Pentecost was fully come--The fiftieth from the morrow
after the first Passover sabbath ([Lev
23:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#015)).

with one accord--the solemnity of the day, perhaps, unconsciously
raising their expectations.

[Acts 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 2:2</span></span>

And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a rushing mighty
wind, &c.--"The whole description is so picturesque and striking that it
could only come from an eye-witness" \[OLSHAUSEN\]. The suddenness,
strength, and diffusiveness of the sound strike with deepest awe the
whole company, and thus complete their preparation for the heavenly
gift. Wind was a familiar emblem of the Spirit ([Eze
37:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#009); [Joh
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#008); [Joh
20:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#022)). But this was not a rush of
actual wind. It was only a sound "as of" it.

[Acts 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 2:3</span></span>

cloven tongues, like as of fire, &c.--"disparted tongues," that is,
tongue-shaped, flame-like appearances, rising from a common center or
root, and resting upon each of that large company:--beautiful visible
symbol of the burning energy of the Spirit now descending in all His
plenitude upon the Church, and about to pour itself through every
tongue, and over every tribe of men under heaven!

[Acts 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 2:4</span></span>

they . . . began to speak with . . . tongues, &c.--real, living
languages, as is plain from what follows. The thing uttered, probably
the same by all, was "the wonderful works of God," perhaps in the
inspired words of the Old Testament evangelical hymns; though it is next
to certain that the speakers themselves understood nothing of what they
uttered (see on 1Co. 14:1-25).

[Acts 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 2:5</span></span>

there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men out of every
nation--not, it would seem, permanently settled there (see [Act
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#009)), though the language seems to
imply more than a temporary visit to keep this one feast.

[Acts 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 2:9</span></span>

Parthians, &c.--Beginning with the farthest east, the Parthians, the
enumeration proceeds farther and farther westward till it comes to
Judea; next come the western countries, from Cappadocia to Pamphylia;
then the southern, from Egypt to Cyrene; finally, apart from all
geographical consideration, Cretes and Arabians are placed together.
This enumeration is evidently designed to convey an impression of
universality \[BAUMGARTEN\].

[Acts 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 2:14</span></span>

PETER FOR THE FIRST TIME, PUBLICLY PREACHES CHRIST. (Acts 2:14-36)

Peter, standing up with the eleven--in advance, perhaps, of the rest.

[Acts 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 2:15</span></span>

these are not drunken--meaning, not the Eleven, but the body of the
disciples.

but the third hour--nine A.M. (see [Ecc
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#016); [Isa
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#011); [Th1
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#017)).

[Acts 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">act 2:17</span></span>

in the last days--meaning, the days of the Messiah ([Isa
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002)); as closing all preparatory
arrangements, and constituting the final dispensation of God's kingdom
on earth.

pour out of my Spirit--in contrast with the mere drops of all preceding
time.

upon all flesh--hitherto confined to the seed of Abraham.

sons . . . daughters . . . young men . . . old men . . . servants . . .
handmaidens--without distinction of sex, age, or rank.

see visions . . . dream dreams--This is a mere accommodation to the ways
in which the Spirit operated under the ancient economy, when the
prediction was delivered; for in the New Testament, visions and dreams
are rather the exception than the rule.

[Acts 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 2:19</span></span>

I will show wonders, &c.--referring to the signs which were to precede
the destruction of Jerusalem (see on [Luk
21:25-28](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#025)).

[Acts 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 2:21</span></span>

whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved--This points
to the permanent establishment of the economy of salvation, which
followed on the breaking up of the Jewish state.

[Acts 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 2:22</span></span>

a man approved of God--rather, "authenticated," "proved," or
"demonstrated to be from God."

by miracles . . . which God did by him--This is not a low view of our
Lord's miracles, as has been alleged, nor inconsistent with [Joh
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#011), but is in strict accordance with
His progress from humiliation to glory, and with His own words in [Joh
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#019). This view of Christ is here
dwelt on to exhibit to the Jews the whole course of Jesus of Nazareth as
the ordinance and doing of the God of Israel \[ALFORD\].

[Acts 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 2:23</span></span>

determinate counsel and foreknowledge--God's fixed plan and perfect
foresight of all the steps involved in it.

ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain--How
strikingly is the criminality of Christ's murderers here presented in
harmony with the eternal purpose to surrender Him into their hands!

[Acts 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 2:24</span></span>

was not possible he should be holden of it--Glorious saying! It was
indeed impossible that "the Living One" should remain "among the dead"
([Luk 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#005)); but here, the
impossibility seems to refer to the prophetic assurance that He should
not see corruption.

[Acts 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">act 2:27</span></span>

wilt not leave my soul in hell--in its disembodied state (see on [Luk
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#023)).

neither . . . suffer thine Holy One to see corruption--in the grave.

[Acts 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">act 2:28</span></span>

Thou hast made known to me the ways of life--that is, resurrection-life.

thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance--that is, in glory;
as is plain from the whole connection and the actual words of the
sixteenth Psalm.

[Acts 2:29](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">act 2:29</span></span>

David . . . is . . . dead and buried, &c.--Peter, full of the Holy
Ghost, sees in this sixteenth Psalm, one Holy Man, whose life of high
devotedness and lofty spirituality is crowned with the assurance, that
though He taste of death, He shall rise again without seeing corruption,
and be admitted to the bliss of God's immediate presence. Now as this
was palpably untrue of David, it could be meant only of One other, even
of Him whom David was taught to expect as the final Occupant of the
throne of Israel. (Those, therefore, and they are many, who take David
himself to be the subject of this Psalm, and the words quoted to refer
to Christ only in a more eminent sense, nullify the whole argument of
the apostle). The Psalm is then affirmed to have had its only proper
fulfilment in JESUS, of whose resurrection and ascension they were
witnesses, while the glorious effusion of the Spirit by the hand of the
ascended One, setting an infallible seal upon all, was even then
witnessed by the thousands who stood listening to Him. A further
illustration of Messiah's ascension and session at God's right hand is
drawn from [Psa 110:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001), in which David
cannot be thought to speak of himself, seeing he is still in his grave.

[Acts 2:36](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">act 2:36</span></span>

Therefore--that is, to sum up all.

let all the house of Israel--for in this first discourse the appeal is
formally made to the whole house of Israel, as the then existing Kingdom
of God.

know assuredly--by indisputable facts, fulfilled predictions, and the
seal of the Holy Ghost set upon all.

that God hath made--for Peter's object was to show them that, instead of
interfering with the arrangements of the God of Israel, these events
were His own high movements.

this same Jesus, whom ye have crucified--"The sting is at the close"
\[BENGEL\]. To prove to them merely that Jesus was the Messiah might
have left them all unchanged in heart. But to convince them that He whom
they had crucified had been by the right hand of God exalted, and
constituted the "LORD" whom David in spirit adored, to whom every knee
shall bow, and the CHRIST of God, was to bring them to "look on Him whom
they had pierced and mourn for Him."

[Acts 2:37](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">act 2:37</span></span>

pricked in their hearts--the begun fulfilment of [Zac
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010), whose full accomplishment is
reserved for the day when "all Israel shall be saved" (see on [Rom
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#026)).

what shall we do?--This is that beautiful spirit of genuine compunction
and childlike docility, which, discovering its whole past career to have
been one frightful mistake, seeks only to be set right for the future,
be the change involved and the sacrifices required what they may. So
Saul of Tarsus ([Act 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#006)).

[Acts 2:38](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">act 2:38</span></span>

Repent--The word denotes change of mind, and here includes the reception
of the Gospel as the proper issue of that revolution of mind which they
were then undergoing.

baptized . . . for the remission of sins--as the visible seal of that
remission.

[Acts 2:39](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">act 2:39</span></span>

For the promise--of the Holy Ghost, through the risen Saviour, as the
grand blessing of the new covenant.

all afar off--the Gentiles, as in [Eph
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#017)), but "to the Jew first."

[Acts 2:40](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">act 2:40</span></span>

with many other words did he testify and exhort--Thus we have here but a
summary of Peter's discourse; though from the next words it would seem
that only the more practical parts, the home appeals, are omitted.

Save yourselves from this untoward generation--as if Peter already
foresaw the hopeless impenitence of the nation at large, and would have
his hearers hasten in for themselves and secure their own salvation.

[Acts 2:41](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">act 2:41</span></span>

BEAUTIFUL BEGINNINGS OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH. ([Act
2:41-47](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#041))

they that gladly received his word were baptized--"It is difficult to
say how three thousand could be baptized in one day, according to the
old practice of a complete submersion; and the more as in Jerusalem
there was no water at hand except Kidron and a few pools. The difficulty
can only be removed by supposing that they already employed sprinkling,
or baptized in houses in large vessels. Formal submersion in rivers, or
larger quantities of water, probably took place only where the locality
conveniently allowed it" \[OLSHAUSEN\].

the same day there were added to them about three thousand
souls--fitting inauguration of the new kingdom, as an economy of the
Spirit!

[Acts 2:42](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">act 2:42</span></span>

continued steadfastly in--"attended constantly upon."

the apostles' doctrine--"teaching"; giving themselves up to the
instructions which, in their raw state, would be indispensable to the
consolidation of the immense multitude suddenly admitted to visible
discipleship.

fellowship--in its largest sense.

breaking of bread--not certainly in the Lord's Supper alone, but rather
in frugal repasts taken together, with which the Lord's Supper was
probably conjoined until abuses and persecution led to the
discontinuance of the common meal.

prayers--probably, stated seasons of it.

[Acts 2:43](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">act 2:43</span></span>

fear came upon every soul--A deep awe rested upon the whole community.

[Acts 2:44](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">act 2:44</span></span>

all that believed were together, and had all things common--(See on [Act
4:34-37](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#034)).

[Acts 2:46](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#046)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">act 2:46</span></span>

daily . . . in the temple--observing the hours of Jewish worship.

and breaking bread from house to house--rather, "at home" (Margin), that
is, in private, as contrasted with their temple-worship, but in some
stated place or places of meeting.

eat their meat with gladness--"exultation."

and singleness of heart.

[Acts 2:47](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#047)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">act 2:47</span></span>

Praising God--"Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine
with a merry heart, for God now accepteth thy works" ([Ecc
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#007), also see on [Act
8:39](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#039)).

having favour with all the people--commending themselves by their lovely
demeanor to the admiration of all who observed them.

And the Lord--that is, JESUS, as the glorified Head and Ruler of the
Church.

added--kept adding; that is, to the visible community of believers,
though the words "to the Church" are wanting in the most ancient
manuscripts.

such as should be saved--rather, "the saved," or "those who were being
saved." "The young Church had but few peculiarities in its outward form,
or even in its doctrine: the single discriminating principle of its few
members was that they all recognized the crucified Jesus of Nazareth as
the Messiah. This confession would have been a thing of no importance,
if it had only presented itself as a naked declaration, and would never
in such a case have been able to form a community that would spread
itself over the whole Roman empire. It acquired its value only through
the power of the Holy Ghost, passing from the apostles as they preached
to the hearers; for He brought the confession from the very hearts of
men ([Co1 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#003)), and like a burning
flame made their souls glow with love. By the power of this Spirit,
therefore, we behold the first Christians not only in a state of active
fellowship, but also internally changed: the narrow views of the natural
man are broken through; they have their possessions in common, and they
regard themselves as one family" \[OLSHAUSEN\].
