### [Numbers Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#001)

[Numbers 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 12:1</span></span>

MIRIAM'S AND AARON'S SEDITION. ([Num
12:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#001))

an Ethiopian woman--Hebrew, "a Cushite woman"--Arabia was usually called
in Scripture the land of Cush, its inhabitants being descendants of that
son of Ham (see on [Exo 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#015)) and
being accounted generally a vile and contemptible race (see on [Amo
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#007)). The occasion of this seditious
outbreak on the part of Miriam and Aaron against Moses was the great
change made in the government by the adoption of the seventy rulers
\[[Num 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#016)\]. Their irritating
disparagement of his wife (who, in all probability, was Zipporah \[[Exo
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#021)\], and not a second wife he had
recently married) arose from jealousy of the relatives, through whose
influence the innovation had been first made ([Exo
18:13-26](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#013)), while they were overlooked
or neglected. Miriam is mentioned before Aaron as being the chief
instigator and leader of the sedition.

[Numbers 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 12:2</span></span>

Hath the Lord indeed spoken only by Moses? hath he not also spoken by
us?--The prophetical name and character was bestowed upon Aaron ([Exo
4:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#015)) and Miriam ([Exo
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#020)); and, therefore, they
considered the conduct of Moses, in exercising an exclusive authority in
this matter, as an encroachment on their rights ([Mic
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#004)).

[Numbers 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">num 12:3</span></span>

the man Moses was very meek-- ([Exo
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#013); [Exo
32:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#012); [Num
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#013); [Num
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#007); [Deu
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#018)). This observation might have
been made to account for Moses taking no notice of their angry
reproaches and for God's interposing so speedily for the vindication of
His servant's cause. The circumstance of Moses recording an eulogium on
a distinguishing excellence of his own character is not without a
parallel among the sacred writers, when forced to it by the insolence
and contempt of opponents ([Co2 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#005);
[Co2 12:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#011)). But it is not
improbable that, as this verse appears to be a parenthesis, it may have
been inserted as a gloss by Ezra or some later prophet. Others, instead
of "very meek," suggest "very afflicted," as the proper rendering.

[Numbers 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">num 12:4</span></span>

the Lord spake suddenly unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto Miriam--The
divine interposition was made thus openly and immediately, in order to
suppress the sedition and prevent its spreading among the people.

[Numbers 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">num 12:5</span></span>

the Lord came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood the door of the
tabernacle--without gaining admission, as was the usual privilege of
Aaron, though it was denied to all other men and women. This public
exclusion was designed to be a token of the divine displeasure.

[Numbers 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">num 12:6</span></span>

Hear now my words--A difference of degree is here distinctly expressed
in the gifts and authority even of divinely commissioned prophets.
Moses, having been set over all God's house, (that is, His church and
people), was consequently invested with supremacy over Miriam and Aaron
also and privileged beyond all others by direct and clear manifestations
of the presence and will of God.

[Numbers 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">num 12:8</span></span>

with him will I speak mouth to mouth--immediately, not by an
interpreter, nor by visionary symbols presented to his fancy.

apparently--plainly and surely.

not in dark speeches--parables or similitudes.

the similitude of the Lord shall he behold--not the face or essence of
God, who is invisible ([Exo 33:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#020);
[Col 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015); [Joh
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018)); but some unmistakable evidence
of His glorious presence ([Exo 33:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#002);
[Exo 34:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#005)). The latter clause should
have been conjoined with the preceding one, thus: "not in dark speeches,
and in a figure shall he behold the Lord." The slight change in the
punctuation removes all appearance of contradiction to [Deu
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#015).

[Numbers 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">num 12:10</span></span>

MIRIAM'S LEPROSY. ([Num 12:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#010))

the cloud departed from the tabernacle--that is, from the door to resume
its permanent position over the mercy seat.

Miriam became leprous--This malady in its most malignant form ([Exo
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#006); [Kg2
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#027)) as its color, combined with its
sudden appearance, proved, was inflicted as a divine judgment; and she
was made the victim, either because of her extreme violence or because
the leprosy on Aaron would have interrupted or dishonored the holy
service.

[Numbers 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">num 12:11</span></span>

On the humble and penitential submission of Aaron, Moses interceded for
both the offenders, especially for Miriam, who was restored; not,
however, till she had been made, by her exclusion, a public example
\[[Num 12:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#014)\].

[Numbers 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">num 12:14</span></span>

her father had but spit in her face, should she not be ashamed seven
days?--The Jews, in common with all people in the East, seem to have had
an intense abhorrence of spitting, and for a parent to express his
displeasure by doing so on the person of one of his children, or even on
the ground in his presence, separated that child as unclean from society
for seven days.

[Numbers 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">num 12:15</span></span>

the people journeyed not till Miriam was brought in again--Either not to
crush her by a sentence of overwhelming severity or not to expose her,
being a prophetess, to popular contempt.

[Numbers 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">num 12:16</span></span>

pitched in the wilderness of Paran--The station of encampments seems to
have been Rithma ([Num 33:19](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#019)).
