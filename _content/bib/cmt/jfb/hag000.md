### [Haggai Introduction](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#001)

[Haggai](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#001)

THE name Haggai means "my feast"; given, according to COCCEIUS, in
anticipation of the joyous return from exile. He probably was one of the
Jewish exiles (of the tribes Judah, Benjamin, and Levi) who returned
under Zerubbabel, the civil head of the people, and Joshua, the high
priest, 536 B.C., when Cyrus (actuated by the striking prophecies as to
himself, [Isa 44:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#028); [Isa
45:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001)) granted them their liberty, and
furnished them with the necessaries for restoring the temple ([Ch2
36:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#023); [Ezr
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001); [Ezr
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#002)). The work of rebuilding went on
under Cyrus and his successor Cambyses (called Ahasuerus in [Ezr
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#006)) in spite of opposition from the
Samaritans, who, when their offers of help were declined, began to try
to hinder it. These at last obtained an interdict from the usurper
Smerdis the Magian (called Artaxerxes in Ezra 4:7-23), whose suspicions
were easy to rouse. The Jews thereupon became so indifferent to the work
that when Darius came to the throne (521 B.C.), virtually setting aside
the prohibitions of the usurper, instead of recommencing their labors,
they pretended that as the prophecy of the seventy years applied to the
temple as well as to the captivity in Babylon ([Hag
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#002)), they were only in the
sixty-eighth year of it \[HENDERSON\]; so that, the proper time not
having yet arrived, they might devote themselves to building splendid
mansions for themselves. Haggai and Zechariah were commissioned by
Jehovah ([Hag 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#001)) in the second year
of Darius (Hystaspes), 520 B.C., sixteen years after the return under
Zerubbabel, to rouse them from their selfishness to resume the work
which for fourteen years had been suspended. Haggai preceded Zechariah
in the work by two months.

The dates of his four distinct prophecies are accurately given: (1) The
first ([Hag 1:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#001)), on the first day
of the sixth month of the second year of Darius, 520 B.C., reproved the
people for their apathy in allowing the temple to lie in ruins and
reminded them of their ill success in everything because of their not
honoring God as to His house. The result was that twenty-four days
afterwards they commenced building under Zerubbabel ([Hag
1:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#012)). (2) The second, on the
twenty-first day of the seventh month ([Hag
2:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#001)), predicts that the glory of the
new temple would be greater than that of Solomon's, so that the people
need not be discouraged by the inferiority in outward splendor of the
new, as compared with the old temple, which had so moved to tears the
elders who had remembered the old ([Ezr
3:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#012)). Isaiah, Jeremiah, and
Ezekiel had implied the same prediction, whence some had doubted whether
they ought to proceed with a building so inferior to the former one; but
Haggai shows wherein the superior glory was to consist, namely, in the
presence of Him who is the "desire of all nations" ([Hag
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#007)). (3) The third, on the
twenty-fourth day of the ninth month ([Hag
2:10-19](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#010)), refers to a period when
building materials had been collected, and the workmen had begun to put
them together, from which time forth God promises His blessing; it
begins with removing their past error as to the efficacy of mere outward
observances to cleanse from the taint of disobedience as to the temple
building. (4) The fourth ([Hag
2:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#020)), on the same day as the
preceding, was addressed to Zerubbabel, as the representative of the
theocratic people, and as having asked as to the national revolutions
spoken of in the second prophecy ([Hag
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#007)).

The prophecies are all so brief as to suggest the supposition that they
are only a summary of the original discourses. The space occupied is but
three months from the first to the last.

The Jews' adversaries, on the resumption of the work under Zerubbabel,
Haggai, and Zechariah, tried to set Darius against it; but that monarch
confirmed Cyrus' decree and ordered all help to be given to the building
of the temple ([Ezr 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#003), &c.; [Ezr
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#001), &c.). So the temple was completed
in the sixth year of Darius' reign 516-515 B.C. ([Ezr
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#014)).

The style of Haggai is consonant with his messages: pathetic in
exhortation, vehement in reproofs, elevated in contemplating the
glorious future. The repetition of the same phrases (for example, "saith
the Lord," or "the Lord of hosts," [Hag
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#002), [Hag
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#005), [Hag
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#007); and thrice in one verse, [Hag
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#004); so "the spirit," thrice in one
verse, [Hag 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#014)) gives a simple
earnestness to his style, calculated to awaken the solemn attention of
the people, and to awaken them from their apathy, to which also the
interrogatory form, often adopted, especially tends. Chaldaisms occur
([Hag 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#003); [Hag
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#006); [Hag
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#016)), as might have been expected in
a writer who was so long in Chaldea. Parts are purely prose history; the
rest is somewhat rhythmical, and observant of poetic parallelism.

Haggai is referred to in [Ezr 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#001);
[Ezr 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#014); and in the New Testament
([Heb 12:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#026); compare [Hag
2:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#006), [Hag
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#022)).
