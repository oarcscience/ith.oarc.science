[4 Kings (2 Kings) 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 11:1</span></span>

JEHOASH SAVED FROM ATHALIAH'S MASSACRE. ([Kg2
11:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#001))

Athaliah--(See on [Ch2 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#002)). She had
possessed great influence over her son, who, by her counsels, had ruled
in the spirit of the house of Ahab.

destroyed all the seed royal--all connected with the royal family who
might have urged a claim to the throne, and who had escaped the
murderous hands of Jehu ([Ch2 21:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#002);
[Ch2 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#001); [Kg2
10:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#013)). This massacre she was
incited to perpetrate--partly from a determination not to let David's
family outlive hers; partly as a measure of self-defense to secure
herself against the violence of Jehu, who was bent on destroying the
whole of Ahab's posterity to which she belonged ([Kg2
8:18-26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#018)); but chiefly from personal
ambition to rule, and a desire to establish the worship of Baal. Such
was the sad fruit of the unequal alliance between the son of the pious
Jehoshaphat and a daughter of the idolatrous and wicked house of Ahab.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg2 11:2</span></span>

Jehosheba--or Jehoshabeath ([Ch2
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#011)).

daughter of King Joram--not by Athaliah, but by a secondary wife.

stole him from among the king's sons which were slain--either from among
the corpses, he being considered dead, or out of the palace nursery.

hid him . . . in the bedchamber--for the use of the priests, which was
in some part of the temple ([Kg2
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#003)), and of which Jehoiada and his
wife had the sole charge. What is called, however, the bedchamber in the
East is not the kind of apartment that we understand by the name, but a
small closet, into which are flung during the day the mattresses and
other bedding materials spread on the floors or divans of the
sitting-rooms by day. Such a slumber-room was well suited to be a
convenient place for the recovery of his wounds, and a hiding-place for
the royal infant and his nurse.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg2 11:4</span></span>

HE IS MADE KING. ([Kg2 11:4-12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#004))

the seventh year--namely, of the reign of Athaliah, and the rescue of
Jehoash.

Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers, &c.--He could scarcely have
obtained such a general convocation except at the time, or on pretext,
of a public and solemn festival. Having revealed to them the secret of
the young king's preservation and entered into a covenant with them for
the overthrow of the tyrant, he then arranged with them the plan and
time of carrying their plot into execution (see on 2Ch. 22:10-23:21).
The conduct of Jehoiada, who acted the leading and chief part in this
conspiracy, admits of an easy and full justification; for, while
Athaliah was a usurper, and belonged to a race destined by divine
denunciation to destruction, even his own wife had a better and stronger
claim to the throne; the sovereignty of Judah had been divinely
appropriated to the family of David, and therefore the young prince on
whom it was proposed to confer the crown, possessed an inherent right to
it, of which a usurper could not deprive him. Moreover, Jehoiada was
most probably the high priest, whose official duty it was to watch over
the due execution of God's laws, and who in his present movement, was
encouraged and aided by the countenance and support of the chief
authorities, both civil and ecclesiastical, in the country. In addition
to all these considerations, he seems to have been directed by an
impulse of the Divine Spirit, through the counsels and exhortations of
the prophets of the time.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg2 11:13</span></span>

ATHALIAH SLAIN. ([Kg2 11:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#013))

Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people--The profound
secrecy with which the conspiracy had been conducted rendered the
unusual acclamations of the vast assembled crowd the more startling and
roused the suspicions of the tyrant.

she came . . . into the temple of the Lord--that is, the courts, which
she was permitted to enter by Jehoiada's directions ([Kg2
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#008)) in order that she might be
secured.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg2 11:14</span></span>

the king stood by a pillar--or on a platform, erected for that purpose
(see on [Ch2 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#013)).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg2 11:15</span></span>

without the ranges--that is, fences, that the sacred place might not be
stained with human blood.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg2 11:17</span></span>

JEHOIADA RESTORES GOD'S WORSHIP. ([Kg2
11:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#017))

a covenant between the Lord and the king and the people--The covenant
with the Lord was a renewal of the national covenant with Israel (Exo.
19:1-24:18; "to be unto him a people of inheritance," [Deu
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#006); [Deu
27:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#009)). The covenant between the king
and the people was the consequence of this, and by it the king bound
himself to rule according to the divine law, while the people engaged to
submit, to give him allegiance as the Lord's anointed. The immediate
fruit of this renewal of the covenant was the destruction of the temple
and the slaughter of the priests of Baal (see [Kg2
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#027)); the restoration of the pure
worship of God in all its ancient integrity; and the establishment of
the young king on the hereditary throne of Judah \[[Kg2
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#019)\].
