### [Proverbs Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#001)

[Proverbs 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 16:1</span></span>

(Pro. 16:1-33)

preparations--schemes.

in man--or literally, "to man," belonging, or pertaining to him.

the answer . . . Lord--The efficient ordering is from God: "Man
proposes; God disposes."

[Proverbs 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 16:2</span></span>

clean--or, "faultless."

weigheth--or, "tries," "judges," implying that they are faulty ([Pro
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#002); [Pro
24:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#012)).

[Proverbs 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 16:3</span></span>

(Compare Margin). Rely on God for success to your lawful purposes.

49:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#005); [Jer
17:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#018)); sinning and suffering answer
to each other, are indissolubly united.

[Proverbs 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 16:5</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 3:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#032)).

[Proverbs 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 16:6</span></span>

By mercy and truth--that is, God's ([Psa
85:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#010)); He effects the atonement, or
covering of sin; and the principles of true piety incline men to depart
from evil; or, "mercy" and "truth" may be man's, indicative of the
gracious tempers which work instrumentally in procuring pardon.

purged--expiated (as in [Lev 16:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#033);
[Isa 27:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#009), Hebrew).

[Proverbs 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#007)

15:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#016)).

[Proverbs 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 16:9</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#003)).

directeth--establisheth.

[Proverbs 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 16:10</span></span>

The last clause depends on the first, expressing the importance of
equity in decisions, so authoritative.

[Proverbs 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 16:11</span></span>

are the Lord's . . . his work--that is, what He has ordered, and hence
should be observed by men.

[Proverbs 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 16:12</span></span>

power is sustained by righteousness.

[Proverbs 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 16:13</span></span>

A specification of the general sentiment of [Pro
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#012).

[Proverbs 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 16:14</span></span>

2:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#025)), can be appeased by the wise.

[Proverbs 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 16:18</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 15:33](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#033)). Haughtiness and

best efforts are folly.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 16:24</span></span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 16:27</span></span>

ungodly man--(Compare [Pro 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#012)).

(Compare [Pro 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#014); [Pro

(Compare [Pro 20:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#029)).

4:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#010), that piety is blessed with long
