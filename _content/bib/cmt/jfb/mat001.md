### [Matthew Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001)

[Matthew 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 1:1</span></span>

GENEALOGY OF CHRIST. ( = Luke 3:23-38). (Mat. 1:1-17)

The book of the generation--an expression purely Jewish; meaning, "table
of the genealogy." In [Gen 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#001) the
same expression occurs in this sense. We have here, then, the title, not
of this whole Gospel of Matthew, but only of the first seventeen verses.

of Jesus Christ--For the meaning of these glorious words, see on [Mat
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#016); [Mat
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021). "Jesus," the name given to our
Lord at His circumcision ([Luk 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#021)),
was that by which He was familiarly known while on earth. The word
"Christ"--though applied to Him as a proper name by the angel who
announced His birth to the shepherds ([Luk
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#011)), and once or twice used in this
sense by our Lord Himself ([Mat 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#008),
[Mat 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#010); [Mar
9:41](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#041)) --only began to be so used by
others about the very close of His earthly career ([Mat
26:68](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#068); [Mat
27:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#017)). The full form, "Jesus Christ,"
though once used by Himself in His Intercessory Prayer ([Joh
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#003)), was never used by others till
after His ascension and the formation of churches in His name. Its use,
then, in the opening words of this Gospel (and in [Mat
1:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#017)) is in the style of the late
period when our Evangelist wrote, rather than of the events he was going
to record.

the son of David, the son of Abraham--As Abraham was the first from
whose family it was predicted that Messiah should spring ([Gen
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#018)), so David was the last. To a
Jewish reader, accordingly, these behooved to be the two great
starting-points of any true genealogy of the promised Messiah; and thus
this opening verse, as it stamps the first Gospel as one peculiarly
Jewish, would at once tend to conciliate the writer's people. From the
nearest of those two fathers came that familiar name of the promised
Messiah, "the son of David" ([Luk
20:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#041)), which was applied to Jesus,
either in devout acknowledgment of His rightful claim to it ([Mat
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#027); [Mat
20:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#031)), or in the way of insinuating
inquiry whether such were the case (see on [Joh
4:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#029); [Mat
12:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#023)).

[Matthew 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 1:2</span></span>

Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas and
his brethren--Only the fourth son of Jacob is here named, as it was from
his loins that Messiah was to spring ([Gen
49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010)).

[Matthew 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 1:3</span></span>

And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and
Esrom begat Aram; 4. And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat
Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon; 5. And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab;
and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse; 6. And Jesse begat
David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of her of Urias--Four
women are here introduced; two of them Gentiles by birth--Rachab and
Ruth; and three of them with a blot at their names in the Old
Testament--Thamar, Rachab, and Bath-sheba. This feature in the present
genealogy--herein differing from that given by Luke--comes well from him
who styles himself in his list of the Twelve, what none of the other
lists do, "Matthew the publican"; as if thereby to hold forth, at the
very outset, the unsearchable riches of that grace which could not only
fetch in "them that are afar off," but teach down even to "publicans and
harlots," and raise them to "sit with the princes of his people." David
is here twice emphatically styled "David the king," as not only the
first of that royal line from which Messiah was to descend, but the one
king of all that line from which the throne that Messiah was to occupy
took its name--"the throne of David." The angel Gabriel, in announcing
Him to His virgin-mother, calls it "the throne of David His father,"
sinking all the intermediate kings of that line, as having no importance
save as links to connect the first and the last king of Israel as father
and son. It will be observed that Rachab is here represented as the
great-grandmother of David (see [Rut
4:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#020); [Ch1
2:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#011)) --a thing not beyond
possibility indeed, but extremely improbable, there being about four
centuries between them. There can hardly be a doubt that one or two
intermediate links are omitted.

[Matthew 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mat 1:7</span></span>

And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa; 8.
And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat
Ozias--or Uzziah. Three kings are here omitted--Ahaziah, Joash, and
Amaziah ([Ch1 3:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#011)). Some omissions
behooved to be made, to compress the whole into three fourteens ([Mat
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#017)). The reason why these, rather
than other names, are omitted, must be sought in religious
considerations--either in the connection of those kings with the house
of Ahab (as LIGHTFOOT, EBRARD, and ALFORD view it); in their slender
right to be regarded as true links in the theocratic chain (as LANGE
takes it); or in some similar disqualification.

[Matthew 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mat 1:11</span></span>

And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren--Jeconiah was Josiah's
grandson, being the son of Jehoiakim, Josiah's second son ([Ch1
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#015)); but Jehoiakim might well be
sunk in such a catalogue, being a mere puppet in the hands of the king
of Egypt ([Ch2 36:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#004)). The "brethren"
of Jechonias here evidently mean his uncles--the chief of whom,
Mattaniah or Zedekiah, who came to the throne ([Kg2
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#017)), is, in [Ch2
36:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#010), as well as here, called "his
brother."

about the time they were carried away to Babylon--literally, "of their
migration," for the Jews avoided the word "captivity" as too bitter a
recollection, and our Evangelist studiously respects the national
feeling.

[Matthew 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mat 1:12</span></span>

And after they were brought to Babylon--after the migration of Babylon.

Jechonias begat Salathiel--So [Ch1
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#017). Nor does this contradict [Jer
22:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#030), "Thus saith the Lord, Write ye
this man (Coniah, or Jeconiah) childless"; for what follows explains in
what sense this was meant--"for no man of his seed shall prosper,
sitting upon the throne of David." He was to have seed, but no reigning
child.

and Salathiel--or Shealtiel.

begat Zorobabel--So [Ezr 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#002); [Neh
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#001); [Hag
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#001). But it would appear from [Ch1
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#019) that Zerubbabel was Salathiel's
grandson, being the son of Pedaiah, whose name, for some reason unknown,
is omitted.

[Matthew 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mat 1:13</span></span>

And Zorobabel begat Abiud, &c.--None of these names are found in the Old
Testament; but they were doubtless taken from the public or family
registers, which the Jews carefully kept, and their accuracy was never
challenged.

[Matthew 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mat 1:16</span></span>

And Jacob begat Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born
Jesus--From this it is clear that the genealogy here given is not that
of Mary, but of Joseph; nor has this ever been questioned. And yet it is
here studiously proclaimed that Joseph was not the natural, but only the
legal father of our Lord. His birth of a virgin was known only to a few;
but the acknowledged descent of his legal father from David secured that
the descent of Jesus Himself from David should never be questioned. See
on [Mat 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#020).

who is called Christ--signifying "anointed." It is applied in the Old
Testament to the kings ([Sa1 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#006),
[Sa1 24:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#010)); to the priests ([Lev
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#005), [Lev
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#016), &c.); and to the prophets ([Kg1
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#016)) --these all being anointed will
oil, the symbol of the needful spiritual gifts to consecrate them to
their respective offices; and it was applied, in its most sublime and
comprehensive sense, to the promised Deliverer, inasmuch as He was to be
consecrated to an office embracing all three by the immeasurable
anointing of the Holy Ghost ([Isa
61:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001); compare [Joh
3:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#034)).

[Matthew 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mat 1:17</span></span>

So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations;
and from David until the carrying away--or migration.

into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into
Babylon--the migration of Babylon.

unto Christ are fourteen generations--that is, the whole may be
conveniently divided into three fourteens, each embracing one marked
era, and each ending with a notable event, in the Israelitish annals.
Such artificial aids to memory were familiar to the Jews, and much
larger gaps than those here are found in some of the Old Testament
genealogies. In [Ezr 7:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#001) no fewer
than six generations of the priesthood are omitted, as will appear by
comparing it with [Ch1 6:3-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#003). It will
be observed that the last of the three divisions of fourteen appears to
contain only thirteen distinct names, including Jesus as the last. LANGE
thinks that this was meant as a tacit hint that Mary was to be supplied,
as the thirteenth link of the last chain, as it is impossible to
conceive that the Evangelist could have made any mistake in the matter.
But there is a simpler way of accounting for it. As the Evangelist
himself ([Mat 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#017)) reckons David
twice--as the last of the first fourteen and the first of the
second--so, if we reckon the second fourteen to end with Josiah, who was
coeval with the "carrying away into captivity" ([Mat
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#011)), and third to begin with
Jeconiah, it will be found that the last division, as well as the other
two, embraces fourteen names, including that of our Lord.

[Matthew 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mat 1:18</span></span>

BIRTH OF CHRIST. ([Mat 1:18-25](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#018))

Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise--or, "thus."

When as his mother Mary was espoused--rather, "betrothed."

to Joseph, before they came together, she was found--discovered to be.

with child of the Holy Ghost--It was, of course, the fact only that was
discovered; the explanation of the fact here given is the Evangelist's
own. That the Holy Ghost is a living conscious Person is plainly implied
here, and is elsewhere clearly taught ([Act
5:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#003), &c.): and that, in the unity of
the Godhead, He is distinct both from the Father and the Son, is taught
with equal distinctness ([Mat 28:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#019);
[Co2 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#014)). On the miraculous
conception of our Lord, see on [Luk
1:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#035).

[Matthew 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mat 1:19</span></span>

Then Joseph her husband--Compare [Mat
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#020), "Mary, thy wife." Betrothal was,
in Jewish law, valid marriage. In giving Mary up, therefore, Joseph had
to take legal steps to effect the separation.

being a just man, and not willing to make her a public example--to
expose her (see [Deu 22:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#023))

was minded to put her away privily--that is, privately by giving her the
required writing of divorcement ([Deu
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#001)), in presence of only two or
three witnesses, and without cause assigned, instead of having her
before a magistrate. That some communication had passed between him and
his betrothed, directly or indirectly, on the subject, after she
returned from her three months' visit to Elizabeth, can hardly be
doubted. Nor does the purpose to divorce her necessarily imply
disbelief, on Joseph's part, of the explanation given him. Even
supposing him to have yielded to it some reverential assent--and the
Evangelist seems to convey as much, by ascribing the proposal to screen
her to the justice of his character--he might think it altogether
unsuitable and incongruous in such circumstances to follow out the
marriage.

[Matthew 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mat 1:20</span></span>

But while he thought on these things--Who would not feel for him after
receiving such intelligence, and before receiving any light from above?
As he brooded over the matter alone, in the stillness of the night, his
domestic prospects darkened and his happiness blasted for life, his mind
slowly making itself up to the painful step, yet planning how to do it
in the way least offensive--at the last extremity the Lord Himself
interposes.

behold, the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph
thou son of David--This style of address was doubtless advisedly chosen
to remind him of what all the families of David's line so early coveted,
and thus it would prepare him for the marvellous announcement which was
to follow.

fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife, for that which is conceived in
her is of the Holy Ghost--Though a dark cloud now overhangs this
relationship, it is unsullied still.

[Matthew 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mat 1:21</span></span>

And she shall bring forth a son--Observe, it is not said, "she shall
bear thee a son," as was said to Zacharias of his wife Elizabeth ([Luk
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#013)).

and thou--as his legal father.

shalt call his name JESUS--from the Hebrew meaning "Jehovah the
Saviour"; in Greek JESUS--to the awakened and anxious sinner sweetest
and most fragrant of all names, expressing so melodiously and briefly
His whole saving office and work!

for he shall save--The "He" is here emphatic--He it is that shall save;
He personally, and by personal acts (as WEBSTER and WILKINSON express
it).

his people--the lost sheep of the house of Israel, in the first
instance; for they were the only people He then had. But, on the
breaking down of the middle wall of partition, the saved people embraced
the "redeemed unto God by His blood out of every kindred and people and
tongue and nation."

from their sins--in the most comprehensive sense of salvation from sin
([Rev 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#005); [Eph
5:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#025)).

[Matthew 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mat 1:22</span></span>

Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of
the Lord by the prophet-- ([Isa 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014)).

saying--as follows.

[Matthew 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mat 1:23</span></span>

Behold, a virgin--It should be "the virgin" meaning that particular
virgin destined to this unparalleled distinction.

shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call
his name Emmanuel, which, being interpreted, is, God with us--Not that
He was to have this for a proper name (like "Jesus"), but that He should
come to be known in this character, as God manifested in the flesh, and
the living bond of holy and most intimate fellowship between God and men
from henceforth and for ever.

[Matthew 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mat 1:24</span></span>

Then Joseph, being raised from sleep--and all his difficulties now
removed.

did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his
wife--With what deep and reverential joy would this now be done on his
part; and what balm would this minister to his betrothed one, who had
till now lain under suspicions of all others the most trying to a chaste
and holy woman--suspicions, too, arising from what, though to her an
honor unparalleled, was to all around her wholly unknown!

[Matthew 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mat 1:25</span></span>

And knew her not till she had brought forth her first-born son: and he
called his name JESUS--The word "till" does not necessarily imply that
they lived on a different footing afterwards (as will be evident from
the use of the same word in [Sa1
15:35](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#035); [Sa2
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#023); [Mat
12:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#020)); nor does the word "first-born"
decide the much-disputed question, whether Mary had any children to
Joseph after the birth of Christ; for, as LIGHTFOOT says, "The law, in
speaking of the first-born, regarded not whether any were born after or
no, but only that none were born before." (See on [Mat
13:55-56](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#055)).
