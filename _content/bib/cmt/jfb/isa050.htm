<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">isa 50:1</A></FONT></span></p>THE JUDGMENTS ON ISRAEL WERE PROVOKED BY THEIR CRIMES, YET THEY ARE NOT FINALLY CAST OFF BY GOD. (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#001">Isa 50:1-11</A>)
<p>
<p>Where . . . mothers divorcement--Zion is "the mother"; the Jews are the children; and God the Husband and Father (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#005">Isa 54:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#005">Isa 62:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#014">Jer 3:14</A>). GESENIUS thinks that God means by the question to deny that He had given "a bill of divorcement" to her, as was often done on slight pretexts by a husband (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#001">Deu 24:1</A>), or that He had "sold" His and her "children," as a poor parent sometimes did (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#007">Exo 21:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#001">Kg2 4:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#005">Neh 5:5</A>) under pressure of his "creditors"; that it was they who sold themselves through their own sins. MAURER explains, "Show the bill of your mother's divorcement, whom . . . ; produce the creditors to whom ye have been sold; so it will be seen that it was not from any caprice of Mine, but through your own fault, your mother has been put away, and you sold" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#003">Isa 52:3</A>). HORSLEY best explains (as the antithesis between "I" and "yourselves" shows, though LOWTH translates, "Ye are sold") I have never given your mother a regular bill of divorcement; I have merely "put her away" for a time, and can, therefore, by right as her husband still take her back on her submission; I have not made you, the children, over to any "creditor" to satisfy a debt; I therefore still have the right of a father over you, and can take you back on repentance, though as rebellious children you have sold yourselves to sin and its penalty (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#025">Kg1 21:25</A>). 
<p>
<p>bill . . . whom--rather, "the bill with which I have put her away" [MAURER].

<p>
<p>no man--willing to believe in and obey Me (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#001">Isa 52:1</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#003">Isa 52:3</A>). The same Divine Person had "come" by His prophets in the Old Testament (appealing to them, but in vain, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#025">Jer 7:25-26</A>), who was about to come under the New Testament. 
<p>
<p>hand shortened--the Oriental emblem of weakness, as the long stretched-out hand is of power (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#001">Isa 59:1</A>). Notwithstanding your sins, I can still "redeem" you from your bondage and dispersion. 
<p>
<p>dry up . . . sea-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#021">Exo 14:21</A>). The second exodus shall exceed, while it resembles in wonders, the first (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#011">Isa 11:11</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#015">Isa 11:15</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#015">Isa 51:15</A>). 
<p>
<p>make . . . rivers . . . wilderness--turn the prosperity of Israel's foes into adversity. 
<p>
<p>fish stinketh--the very judgment inflicted on their Egyptian enemies at the first exodus (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#018">Exo 7:18</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#021">Exo 7:21</A>).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">isa 50:4</A></FONT></span></p>Messiah, as "the servant of Jehovah" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001">Isa 42:1</A>), declares that the office has been assigned to Him of encouraging the "weary" exiles of Israel by "words in season" suited to their case; and that, whatever suffering it is to cost Himself, He does not shrink from it (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#005">Isa 50:5-6</A>), for that He knows His cause will triumph at last (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#007">Isa 50:7-8</A>). 
<p>
<p>learned--not in mere human learning, but in divinely taught modes of instruction and eloquence (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#002">Isa 49:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#011">Exo 4:11</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#028">Mat 7:28-29</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#054">Mat 13:54</A>). 
<p>
<p>speak a word in season-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#023">Pro 15:23</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#011">Pro 25:11</A>). Literally, "to succor by words," namely, in their season of need, the "weary" dispersed ones of Israel (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#065">Deu 28:65-67</A>). Also, the spiritual "weary" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#003">Isa 42:3</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#028">Mat 11:28</A>). 
<p>
<p>wakeneth morning by morning, &amp;c.--Compare "daily rising up early" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#025">Jer 7:25</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#035">Mar 1:35</A>). The image is drawn from a master wakening his pupils early for instruction. 
<p>
<p>wakeneth . . . ear--prepares me for receiving His divine instructions. 
<p>
<p>as the learned--as one taught by Him. He "learned obedience," experimentally, "by the things which He suffered"; thus gaining that practical learning which adapted Him for "speaking a word in season" to suffering men (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#008">Heb 5:8</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#005">Isaiah 50:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">isa 50:5</A></FONT></span></p>opened . . . ear--(See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#020">Isa 42:20</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#008">Isa 48:8</A>); that is, hath made me obediently attentive (but MAURER, "hath informed me of my duty"), as a servant to his master (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006">Psa 40:6-8</A>, with <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007">Phi 2:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001">Isa 42:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#003">Isa 49:3</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#006">Isa 49:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#013">Isa 52:13</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#011">Isa 53:11</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#028">Mat 20:28</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#027">Luk 22:27</A>). 
<p>
<p>not rebellious--but, on the contrary, most willing to do the Father's will in proclaiming and procuring salvation for man, at the cost of His own sufferings (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005">Heb 10:5-10</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#006">Isaiah 50:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">isa 50:6</A></FONT></span></p>smiters--with scourges and with the open hand (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#014">Isa 52:14</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#065">Mar 14:65</A>). Literally fulfilled (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#026">Mat 27:26</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#027">Mat 26:27</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#033">Luk 18:33</A>). To "pluck the hair" is the highest insult that can be offered an Oriental (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#004">Sa2 10:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#030">Lam 3:30</A>). "I gave" implies the voluntary nature of His sufferings; His example corresponds to His precept (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#039">Mat 5:39</A>). 
<p>
<p>spitting--To spit in another's presence is an insult in the East, much more on one; most of all in the face (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#010">Job 30:10</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#030">Mat 27:30</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#032">Luk 18:32</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#007">Isaiah 50:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">isa 50:7</A></FONT></span></p>Sample of His not being "discouraged" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#004">Isa 42:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#005">Isa 49:5</A>). 
<p>
<p>set . . . face like . . . flint--set Myself resolutely, not to be daunted from My work of love by shame or suffering (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#008">Eze 3:8-9</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#008">Isaiah 50:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">isa 50:8</A></FONT></span></p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#004">Isa 49:4</A>). The believer, by virtue of his oneness with Christ, uses the same language (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#008">Psa 138:8</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#032">Rom 8:32-34</A>). But "justify" in His case, is God's judicial acceptance and vindication of Him on the ground of His own righteousness (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#044">Luk 23:44-47</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#004">Rom 1:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016">Ti1 3:16</A>, with which compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#018">Pe1 3:18</A>); in their case, on the ground of His righteousness and meritorious death imputed to them (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#019">Rom 5:19</A>). 
<p>
<p>stand together--in judgment, to try the issue. 
<p>
<p>adversary--literally, "master of my cause," that is, who has real ground of accusation against me, so that he can demand judgment to be given in his favor (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#001">Zac 3:1</A>, &amp;c. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#010">Rev 12:10</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#009">Isaiah 50:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">isa 50:9</A></FONT></span></p>(Compare "deal," or "proper," <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#013">Isa 52:13</A>, Margin; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#010">Isa 53:10</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#006">Psa 118:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005">Jer 23:5</A>). 
<p>
<p>as a garment-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#006">Isa 51:6</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#008">Isa 51:8</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#026">Psa 102:26</A>). A leading constituent of wealth in the East is change of raiment, which is always liable to the inroads of the moth; hence the frequency of the image in Scripture.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#010">Isaiah 50:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">isa 50:10</A></FONT></span></p>Messiah exhorts the godly after His example (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#004">Isa 49:4-5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#004">Isa 42:4</A>) when in circumstances of trial ("darkness," <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#005">Isa 47:5</A>), to trust in the arm of Jehovah alone. 
<p>
<p>Who is, &amp;c.--that is, Whosoever (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#003">Jdg 7:3</A>). 
<p>
<p>obeyeth . . . servant--namely, Messiah. The godly "honor the Son, even as they honor the Father" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#023">Joh 5:23</A>). 
<p>
<p>darkness-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#008">Mic 7:8-9</A>). God never had a son who was not sometimes in the dark. For even Christ, His only Son, cried out, "My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?" 
<p>
<p>light--rather, "splendor"; bright sunshine; for the servant of God is never wholly without "light" [VITRINGA]. A godly man's way may be dark, but his end shall be peace and light. A wicked man's way may be bright, but his end shall be utter darkness (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#004">Psa 112:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#011">Psa 97:11</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#024">Psa 37:24</A>). 
<p>
<p>let him trust in the name of the Lord--as Messiah did (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#008">Isa 50:8-9</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#011">Isaiah 50:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">isa 50:11</A></FONT></span></p>In contrast to the godly (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#010">Isa 50:10</A>), the wicked, in times of darkness, instead of trusting in God, trust in themselves (kindle a light for themselves to walk by) (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#009">Ecc 11:9</A>). The image is continued from <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#010">Isa 50:10</A>, "darkness"; human devices for salvation (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#021">Pro 19:21</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#009">Pro 16:9</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#025">Pro 16:25</A>) are like the spark that goes out in an instant in darkness (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#006">Job 18:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#017">Job 21:17</A>, with <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#028">Psa 18:28</A>). 
<p>
<p>sparks--not a steady light, but blazing sparks extinguished in a moment. 
<p>
<p>walk--not a command, but implying that as surely as they would do so, they should lie down in sorrow (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#025">Jer 3:25</A>). In exact proportion to mystic Babylon's previous "glorifying" of herself shall be her sorrow (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#030">Mat 25:30</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#012">Mat 8:12</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#007">Rev 18:7</A>).
