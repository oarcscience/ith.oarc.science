### [Joshua Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#001)

[Joshua 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 20:1</span></span>

THE LORD COMMANDS THE CITIES OF REFUGE. ([Jos
20:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#001))

The Lord spake unto Joshua . . . Appoint out for you cities of
refuge--(See Num. 35:9-28; [Deu
19:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#001)). The command here recorded
was given on their going to occupy their allotted settlements. The
sanctuaries were not temples or altars, as in other countries, but
inhabited cities; and the design was not to screen criminals, but only
to afford the homicide protection from the vengeance of the deceased's
relatives until it should have been ascertained whether the death had
resulted from accident and momentary passion, or from premeditated
malice. The institution of the cities of refuge, together with the rules
prescribed for the guidance of those who sought an asylum within their
walls, was an important provision, tending to secure the ends of justice
as well as of mercy.

[Joshua 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jos 20:4</span></span>

he that doth flee unto one of those cities shall stand at the entering
of the gate of the city--It was the place of public resort, and on
arriving there he related his tale of distress to the elders, who were
bound to give him shelter and the means of support, until the local
authorities ([Jos 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#006)), having
carefully investigated the case, should have pronounced the decision. If
found guilty, the manslayer was surrendered to the blood-avenger; if
extenuating circumstances appeared, he was to remain in the city of
refuge, where he would be safe from the vindictive feelings of his
pursuers; but he forfeited the privilege of immunity the moment he
ventured beyond the walls.

[Joshua 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jos 20:6</span></span>

until the death of the high priest--His death secured the complete
deliverance of the manslayer from his sin, only because he had been
anointed with the holy oil ([Num
35:25](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#025)), the symbol of the Holy Ghost;
and thus the death of the earthly high priest became a type of that of
the heavenly one ([Heb 9:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#014)).

[Joshua 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jos 20:7</span></span>

THE ISRAELITES APPOINT BY NAME THE CITIES OF REFUGE. ([Jos
20:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#007))

they appointed . . . cities--There were six; three on the west, and
three on the east, of Jordan. In the first instance, they were a
provision of the criminal law of the Hebrews, necessary in the
circumstances of that people (see on [Num
35:11](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#011); [Deu
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#002)). At the same time they were
designed also typically to point out the sinner's way to Christ ([Heb
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#018)).
