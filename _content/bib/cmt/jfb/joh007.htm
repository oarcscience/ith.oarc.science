Hence it appears that our Lord did not attend the Passover mentioned in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#004">Joh 6:4</A> --being the third since His ministry began, if the feast mentioned in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#001">Joh 5:1</A> was a Passover.

(See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#033">Lev 23:33</A>, &amp;c.; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#013">Deu 16:13</A>, &amp;c.; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#014">Neh 8:14-18</A>).

<p>
<p>Depart . . . into Judea, &amp;c.--In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#005">Joh 7:5</A> this speech is ascribed to their unbelief. But as they were in the "upper room" among the one hundred and twenty disciples who waited for the descent of the Spirit after the Lord's ascension (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#014">Act 1:14</A>), they seem to have had their prejudices removed, perhaps after His resurrection. Indeed here their language is more that of strong prejudice and suspicion (such as near relatives, even the best, too frequently show in such cases), than from unbelief. There was also, probably, a tincture of vanity in it. "Thou hast many disciples in Judea; here in Galilee they are fast dropping off; it is not like one who advances the claims Thou dost to linger so long here, away from the city of our solemnities, where surely 'the kingdom of our father David' is to be set up: 'seeking,' as Thou dost, 'to be known openly,' those miracles of Thine ought not to be confined to this distant corner, but submitted at headquarters to the inspection of 'the world.'" (See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#008">Psa 69:8</A>, "I am become a stranger to my brethren, an alien unto my mother's children!")

<p>
<p>your time is always ready--that is "It matters little when we go up, for ye have no great plans in life, and nothing hangs upon your movements. With Me it is otherwise; on every movement of Mine there hangs what ye know not. The world has no quarrel with you, for ye bear no testimony against it, and so draw down upon yourselves none of its wrath; but I am here to lift up My voice against its hypocrisy, and denounce its abominations; therefore it cannot endure Me, and one false step might precipitate its fury on its Victim's head before the time. Away, therefore, to the feast as soon as it suits you; I follow at the fitting moment, but 'My time is not yet full come.'"

<p>
<p>went up into the temple and taught--The word denotes formal and continuous teaching, as distinguished from mere casual sayings. This was probably the first time that He did so thus openly in Jerusalem. He had kept back till the feast was half through, to let the stir about Him subside, and entering the city unexpectedly, had begun His "teaching" at the temple, and created a certain awe, before the wrath of the rulers had time to break it.
<p>

<p>having never learned--at any rabbinical school, as Paul under Gamaliel. These rulers knew well enough that He had not studied under any human teacher--an important admission against ancient and modern attempts to trace our Lord's wisdom to human sources [MEYER]. Probably His teaching on this occasion was expository, manifesting that unrivalled faculty and depth which in the Sermon on the Mount had excited the astonishment of all.

<p>
<p>whether . . . of God, or . . . of myself--from above or from beneath; is divine or an imposture of Mine. A principle of immense importance, showing, on the one hand, that singleness of desire to please God is the grand inlet to light on all questions vitally affecting one's eternal interests, and on the other, that the want of his, whether perceived or not, is the chief cause of infidelity amidst the light of revealed religion.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">joh 7:21</A></FONT></span></p>I have done one work, &amp;c.--Taking no notice of the popular appeal, as there were those there who knew well enough what He meant, He recalls His cure of the impotent man, and the murderous rage it had kindled (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#009">Joh 5:9</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#016">Joh 5:16</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#018">Joh 5:18</A>). It may seem strange that He should refer to an event a year and a half old, as if but newly done. But their present attempt "to kill Him" brought up the past scene vividly, not only to Him, but without doubt to them, too, if indeed they had ever forgotten it; and by this fearless reference to it, exposing their hypocrisy and dark designs, He gave His position great moral strength.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#022">John 7:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">joh 7:22</A></FONT></span></p>Moses . . . gave unto you circumcision, &amp;c.--Though servile work was forbidden on the sabbath, the circumcision of males on that day (which certainly was a servile work) was counted no infringement of the Law. How much less ought fault to be found with One who had made a man "every whit whole"--or rather, "a man's entire body whole"--on the sabbath-day? What a testimony to the reality of the miracle, none daring to meet the bold appeal.

This was evidently the language of friendly persons, overborne by their spiteful superiors, but unable to keep quite silent.
<p>

Yet a little while and we part company--for ever; for I go whither ye cannot come: nor, even when ye at length seek Him whom ye now despise, shall ye be able to find Him"--referring not to any penitential, but to purely selfish cries in their time of desperation.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_037">joh 7:37</A></FONT></span></p>the last day, that great day of the feast--the eighth (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#039">Lev 23:39</A>). It was a sabbath, the last feast day of the year, and distinguished by very remarkable ceremonies. "The generally joyous character of this feast broke out on this day into loud jubilation, particularly at the solemn moment when the priest, as was done on every day of this festival, brought forth, in golden vessels, water from the stream of Siloah, which flowed under the temple-mountain, and solemnly poured it upon the altar. Then the words of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#003">Isa 12:3</A> were sung, With joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of Salvation, and thus the symbolical reference of this act, intimated in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#039">Joh 7:39</A>, was expressed" [OLSHAUSEN]. So ecstatic was the joy with which this ceremony was performed--accompanied with sound of trumpets--that it used to be said, "Whoever had not witnessed it had never seen rejoicing at all" [LIGHTFOOT]. 
<p>
<p>Jesus stood--On this high occasion, then, He who had already drawn all eyes upon Him by His supernatural power and unrivalled teaching--"JESUS stood," probably in some elevated position. 
<p>
<p>and cried--as if making proclamation in the audience of all the people. 
<p>
<p>If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink!--What an offer! The deepest cravings of the human spirit are here, as in the Old Testament, expressed by the figure of "thirst," and the eternal satisfaction of them by "drinking." To the woman of Samaria He had said almost the same thing, and in the same terms (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#013">Joh 4:13-14</A>). But what to her was simply affirmed to her as a fact, is here turned into a world-wide proclamation; and whereas there, the gift by Him of the living water is the most prominent idea--in contrast with her hesitation to give Him the perishable water of Jacob's well--here, the prominence is given to Himself as the Well spring of all satisfaction. He had in Galilee invited all the WEARY AND HEAVY-LADEN of the human family to come under His wing and they should find REST (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#028">Mat 11:28</A>), which is just the same deep want, and the same profound relief of it, under another and equally grateful figure. He had in the synagogue of Capernaum (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#036">Joh 6:36</A>) announced Himself, in every variety of form, as "the BREAD of Life," and as both able and authorized to appease the "HUNGER," and quench the "THIRST," of all that apply to Him. There is, and there can be, nothing beyond that here. But what was on all those occasions uttered in private, or addressed to a provincial audience, is here sounded forth in the streets of the great religious metropolis, and in language of surpassing majesty, simplicity, and grace. It is just Jehovah's ancient proclamation now sounding forth through human flesh, "HO, EVERY ONE THAT THIRSTETH, COME YE TO THE WATERS, AND HE THAT HATH NO MONEY!" &amp;c. (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#001">Isa 55:1</A>). In this light we have but two alternatives; either to say with Caiaphas of Him that uttered such words, "He is guilty of death," or falling down before Him to exclaim with Thomas, " MY LORD AND MY GOD!"
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#038">John 7:38</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_038">joh 7:38</A></FONT></span></p>as the scripture hath said--These words belong to what follows, "Out of his belly, as the scripture hath said, shall flow," &amp;c. referring not to any particular passage, but to such as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#011">Isa 58:11</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#018">Joe 3:18</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#008">Zac 14:8</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#001">Eze 47:1-12</A>; in most of which the idea is that of waters issuing from beneath the temple, to which our Lord compares Himself and those who believe in Him. 
<p>
<p>out of his belly--that is, his inner man, his soul, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#027">Pro 20:27</A>. 
<p>
<p>rivers of living water--(See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#013">Joh 4:13</A>). It refers primarily to the copiousness, but indirectly also to the diffusiveness, of this living water to the good of others.
<p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_039">joh 7:39</A></FONT></span></p>this spake he of the Spirit--who, by His direct personal agency, opens up this spring of living waters in the human spirit (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#006">Joh 3:6</A>), and by His indwelling in the renewed soul ensures their unfailing flow. 
<p>
<p>they that believe, &amp;c.--As the Holy Ghost is, in the redemption of man, entirely at the service of Christ, as His Agent, so it is only in believing connection with Christ that any one "receives" the Spirit. 
<p>
<p>for the Holy Ghost was not yet given--Beyond all doubt the word "given," or some similar word, is the right supplement. In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#007">Joh 16:7</A> the Holy Ghost is represented not only as the gift of Christ, but a gift the communication of which was dependent upon His own departure to the Father. Now as Christ was not yet gone, so the Holy Ghost was not yet given. 
<p>
<p>Jesus not yet glorified--The word "glorified" is here used advisedly, to teach the reader not only that the departure of Christ to the Father was indispensable to the giving of the Spirit, but that this illustrious Gift, direct from the hands of the ascended Saviour, was God's intimation to the world that He whom it had cast out, crucified, and slain, was "His Elect, in whom His soul delighted," and that it was through the smiting of that Rock that the waters of the Spirit--for which the Church was waiting, and with pomp at the feast of tabernacles proclaiming its expectation--had gushed forth upon a thirsty world.

Doubtless they were strangers to the profound intent of Christ's teaching, but there was that in it which by its mysterious grandeur and transparent purity and grace, held them spellbound. No doubt it was of God that they should so feel, that their arm might be paralyzed, as Christ's hour was not yet come; but even in human teaching there has sometimes been felt such a divine power, that men who came to kill them (for example, ROWLAND HISS) have confessed to all that they were unmanned.

Even a word of caution, or the gentlest proposal to inquire before condemning, was with them equivalent to an espousal of the hated One. 
<p>
<p>Search . . . out of Galilee . . . no prophet--Strange! For had not Jonah (of Gath-hepher) and even Elijah (of Thisbe) arisen out of Galilee? And there it may be more, of whom we have no record. But rage is blind, and deep prejudice distorts all facts. Yet it looks as if they were afraid of losing Nicodemus, when they take the trouble to reason the point at all. It was just because he had "searched," as they advised him, that he went the length even that he did.
