### [2 Chronicles Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2010.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2010.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 10:1</span></span>

REHOBOAM REFUSING THE OLD MEN'S GOOD COUNSEL. ([Ch2
10:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2010.htm#001))

Rehoboam went to Shechem--(See on [Kg1
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#001)). This chapter is, with a few
verbal alterations, the same as in 1Ki. 12:1-19.

[2 Chronicles 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2010.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 10:3</span></span>

And they sent--rather, "for they had sent," &c. This is stated as the
reason of Jeroboam's return from Egypt.

[2 Chronicles 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2010.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 10:7</span></span>

If thou be kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to
them--In the Book of Kings \[[Kg1
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#007)\], the words are, "If thou wilt
be a servant unto this people, and wilt serve them." The meaning in both
is the same, namely, If thou wilt make some reasonable concessions,
redress their grievances, and restore their abridged liberties, thou
wilt secure their strong and lasting attachment to thy person and
government.

[2 Chronicles 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2010.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch2 10:15</span></span>

the king hearkened not unto the people, for the cause was of
God--Rehoboam, in following an evil counsel, and the Hebrew people, in
making a revolutionary movement, each acted as free agents, obeying
their own will and passions. But God, who permitted the revolt of the
northern tribes, intended it as a punishment of the house of David for
Solomon's apostasy. That event demonstrates the immediate
superintendence of His providence over the revolutions of kingdoms; and
thus it affords an instance, similar to many other striking instances
that are found in Scripture, of divine predictions, uttered long before,
being accomplished by the operation of human passions, and in the
natural course of events.
