### [Malachi Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#001)

[Malachi 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mal 1:1</span></span>

GOD'S LOVE: ISRAEL'S INGRATITUDE: THE PRIESTS' MERCENARY SPIRIT: A
GENTILE SPIRITUAL PRIESTHOOD SHALL SUPERSEDE THEM. ([Mal
1:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#001))

burden--heavy sentence.

to Israel--represented now by the two tribes of Judah and Benjamin, with
individuals of the ten tribes who had returned with the Jews from
Babylon. So "Israel" is used, [Ezr
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#010). Compare [Ch2
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#002), "Jehoshaphat king of Israel,"
where Judah, rather than the ten tribes, is regarded as the truest
representative of Israel (compare [Ch2
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#006); [Ch2
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#019)).

Malachi--see Introduction. God sent no prophet after him till John the
Baptist, the forerunner of Christ, in order to enflame His people with
the more ardent desire for Him, the great antitype and fulfiller of
prophecy.

[Malachi 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mal 1:2</span></span>

I have loved you--above other men; nay, even above the other descendants
of Abraham and Isaac. Such gratuitous love on My part called for love on
yours. But the return ye make is sin and dishonor to Me. This which is
to be supplied is left unexpressed, sorrow as it were breaking off the
sentence \[MENOCHIUS\], ([Deu 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#008);
[Hos 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001)).

Wherein hast thou loved us?--In painful contrast to the tearful
tenderness of God's love stands their insolent challenge. The root of
their sin was insensibility to God's love, and to their own wickedness.
Having had prosperity taken from them, they imply they have no tokens of
God's love; they look at what God had taken, not at what God had left.
God's love is often least acknowledged where it is most manifested. We
must not infer God does not love us because He afflicts us. Men, instead
of referring their sufferings to their proper cause, their own sin,
impiously accuse God of indifference to their welfare \[MOORE\]. Thus
[Mal 1:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#001) form a fit introduction to
the whole prophecy.

Was not Esau Jacob's brother?--and so, as far as dignity went, as much
entitled to God's favor as Jacob. My adoption of Jacob, therefore, was
altogether by gratuitous favor ([Rom
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#013)). So God has passed by our elder
brethren, the angels who kept not their first estate, and yet He has
provided salvation for man. The perpetual rejection of the fallen
angels, like the perpetual desolations of Edom, attests God's severity
to the lost, and goodness to those gratuitously saved. The sovereign
eternal purpose of God is the only ground on which He bestows on one
favors withheld from another. There are difficulties in referring
salvation to the election of God, there are greater in referring it to
the election of man \[MOORE\]. Jehovah illustrates His condescension and
patience in arguing the case with them.

[Malachi 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mal 1:3</span></span>

hated--not positively, but relatively; that is, did not choose him out
to be the object of gratuitous favor, as I did Jacob (compare [Luk
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#026), with [Mat
10:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#037); [Gen
29:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#030); [Deu
21:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#015)).

laid his mountains . . . waste--that is, his territory which was
generally mountainous. Israel was, it is true, punished by the
Chaldeans, but Edom has been utterly destroyed; namely, either by
Nebuchadnezzar \[ROSENMULLER\], or by the neighboring peoples, Egypt,
Ammon, and Moab \[JOSEPHUS, Antiquities, 10.9,7; MAURER\], ([Jer
49:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#018)).

dragons--jackals \[MOORE\] (compare [Isa
34:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#013)). MAURER translates, "Abodes of
the wilderness," from an Arabic root "to stop," or "to abide." English
Version is better.

[Malachi 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mal 1:4</span></span>

Whereas--"But if" Edom say \[MAURER\]. Edom may strive as she may to
recover herself, but it shall be in vain, for I doom her to perpetual
desolation, whereas I restore Israel. This Jehovah states, to illustrate
His gratuitous love to Israel, rather than to Edom.

border of wickedness--a region given over to the curse of reprobation
\[CALVIN\]. For a time Judea seemed as desolate as Idumea; but though
the latter was once the highway of Eastern commerce, now the lonely
rock-houses of Petra attest the fulfilment of the prophecy. It is still
"the border of wickedness," being the resort of the marauding tribes of
the desert. Judea's restoration, though delayed, is yet certain.

the Lord hath indignation--"the people of My curse" ([Isa
34:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#005)).

[Malachi 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mal 1:5</span></span>

from the border of Israel--Ye, restored to your own "borders" in Israel,
"from" them shall raise your voices to "magnify the Lord," acknowledging
that Jehovah has shown to you a gratuitous favor not shown to Edom, and
so ought to be especially "magnified from the borders of Israel."

[Malachi 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mal 1:6</span></span>

Turning from the people to the priests, Jehovah asks, whereas His love
to the people was so great, where was their love towards Him? If the
priests, as they profess, regard Him as their Father ([Isa
63:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#016)) and Master, let them show the
reality of their profession by love and reverential fear ([Exo
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#012); [Luk
6:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#046)). He addresses the priests
because they ought to be leaders in piety to the rest of the people,
whereas they are foremost in "despising His name."

Wherein have we despised, &c.--The same captious spirit of
self-satisfied insensibility as prompted their question ([Mal
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#002)), "Wherein hast Thou loved us?"
They are blind alike to God's love and their own guilt.

[Malachi 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mal 1:7</span></span>

ye offer, &c.--God's answer to their challenge ([Mal
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#006)), "Wherein have we despised?"

polluted bread--namely, blemished sacrifices ([Mal
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#008), [Mal
1:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#013); [Deu
15:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#021)). So "the bread of thy God" is
used for "sacrifices to God" ([Lev
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#008)).

polluted thee--that is, offered to thee "polluted bread."

table of the Lord--that is, the altar ([Eze
41:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#022)) (not the table of showbread).
Just as the sacrificial flesh is called "bread."

contemptible-- ([Mal 1:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#012)). Ye
sanction the niggardly and blemished offerings of the people on the
altar, to gain favor with them. Darius, and probably his successors, had
liberally supplied them with victims for sacrifice, yet they presented
none but the worst. A cheap religion, costing little, is rejected by
God, and so is worth nothing. It costs more than it is worth, for it is
worth nothing, and so proves really dear. God despises not the widow's
mite, but he does despise the miser's mite \[MOORE\].

[Malachi 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mal 1:8</span></span>

Your earthly ruler would feel insulted, if offered by you the offering
with which ye put off God (see [Lev
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#022), [Lev
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#024)).

is it not evil?--MAURER translates, "There is no evil," in your opinion,
in such an offering; it is quite good enough for such a purpose.

[Malachi 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mal 1:9</span></span>

now . . . beseech God that he will be gracious--Ironical. Think you that
God will be persuaded by such polluted gifts to be gracious to you? Far
from it.

this hath been by your means--literally, "hand." These contemptible
offerings are your doing, as being the priests mediating between God and
the people; and think you, will God pay any regard to you (compare [Mal
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#008), [Mal
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#010))? "Accept thy person" ("face"),
[Mal 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#008), answers to "regard your
persons," in this verse.

[Malachi 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mal 1:10</span></span>

Who . . . for naught--Not one even of the least priestly functions (as
shutting the doors, or kindling a fire on the altar) would ye exercise
without pay, therefore ye ought to fulfil them faithfully ([Co1
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#013)). DRUSIUS and MAURER translate,
"Would that there were absolutely some one of you who would shut the
doors of the temple (that is, of the inner court, in which was the altar
of burnt offerings), and that ye would not kindle fire on My altar in
vain!" Better no sacrifices than vain ones ([Isa
1:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#011)). It was the duty of some of
the priests to stand at the doors of the court of the altar of burnt
offerings, and to have excluded blemished victims \[CALVIN\].

[Malachi 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mal 1:11</span></span>

For--Since ye Jewish priests and people "despise My name" ([Mal
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#006)), I shall find others who will
magnify it ([Mat 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#009)). Do not think I
shall have no worshippers because I have not you; for from the east to
the west My name shall be great among the Gentiles ([Isa
66:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#019)), those very peoples whom ye
look down upon as abominable.

pure offering--not "the blind, the lame, and the sick," such as ye offer
([Mal 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#008)). "In every place," implies
the catholicity of the Christian Church ([Joh
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#021), [Joh
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#023); [Ti1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#008)). The "incense" is figurative of
prayers ([Psa 141:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#002); [Rev
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#003)). "Sacrifice" is used
metaphorically ([Psa 51:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#017); [Heb
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#010), [Heb
13:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#015); [Pe1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005), [Pe1
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#012)). In this sense the reference to
the Lord's Supper, maintained by many of the fathers, may be admitted;
it, like prayer, is a spiritual offering, accepted through the literal
offering of the "Lamb without blemish," once for all slain.

[Malachi 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mal 1:12</span></span>

Renewal of the charge in [Mal 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#007).

fruit . . . meat--the offerings of the people. The "fruit" is the
produce of the altar, on which the priests subsisted. They did not
literally say, The Lord's table is contemptible; but their acts
virtually said so. They did not act so as to lead the people to
reverence, and to offer their best to the Lord on it. The people were
poor, and put off God with the worst offerings. The priests let them do
so, for fear of offending the people, and so losing all gains from them.

[Malachi 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mal 1:13</span></span>

what a weariness is it!--Ye regard God's service as irksome, and
therefore try to get it over by presenting the most worthless offerings.
Compare [Mic 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#003), where God challenges
His people to show wherein is the "weariness" or hardship of His
service. Also [Isa 43:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#022), wherein
He shows that it is they who have "wearied" Him, not He who has wearied
them.

snuffed at--despised.

it--the table of the Lord, and the meat on it ([Mal
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#012)).

torn--namely, by beasts, which it was not lawful to eat, much less to
offer ([Exo 22:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#031)).

thus . . . offering--Hebrew, mincha; the unbloody offering of flour, &c.
Though this may have been of ordinary ingredients, yet the sacrifices of
blemished animals accompanying it rendered it unacceptable.

[Malachi 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mal 1:14</span></span>

deceiver--hypocrite. Not poverty, but avarice was the cause of their
mean offerings.

male--required by law ([Lev 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#003), [Lev
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#010)).

great King-- ([Psa 48:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#002); [Mat
5:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#035)).

my name . . . dreadful among . . . heathen--Even the heathen dread Me
because of My judgments; what a reproach this is to you, My people, who
fear Me not ([Mal 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#006))! Also it may be
translated, "shall be feared among," &c. agreeing with the prophecy of
the call of the Gentiles ([Mal 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#011)).
