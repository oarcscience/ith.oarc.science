### [2 Corinthians Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#001)

[2 Corinthians 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co2 8:1</span></span>

THE COLLECTION FOR THE SAINTS; THE READINESS OF THE MACEDONIANS A
PATTERN TO THE CORINTHIANS; CHRIST THE HIGHEST PATTERN; EACH IS TO GIVE
WILLINGLY AFTER HIS ABILITY; TITUS AND TWO OTHERS ARE THE AGENTS
ACCREDITED TO COMPLETE THE COLLECTION. (2Co. 8:1-24)

we do you to wit--we make known to you.

the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia--Their liberality
was not of themselves naturally, but of God's grace bestowed on them,
and enabling them to be the instrument of God's "grace" to others ([Co2
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#006), [Co2
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#019)). The importance given in this
Epistle to the collection, arose as well from Paul's engagement ([Gal
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#010)), as also chiefly from his hope
to conciliate the Judaizing Christians at Jerusalem to himself and the
Gentile believers, by such an act of love on the part of the latter
towards their Jewish brethren.

[2 Corinthians 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co2 8:2</span></span>

trial of affliction--The Greek expresses, "in affliction (or,
'tribulation') which tested them"; literally, "in a great testing of
affliction."

abundance of their joy--The greater was the depth of their poverty, the
greater was the abundance of their joy. A delightful contrast in terms,
and triumph, in fact, of spirit over flesh.

their deep poverty--Greek, "their poverty down to the death of it."

abounded unto the riches of their liberality--another beautiful contrast
in terms: their poverty had the effect, not of producing stinted gifts,
but of "abounding in the riches of liberality" (not as Margin,
"simplicity"; though the idea of singleness of motive to God's glory and
man's good, probably enters into the idea); (compare [Rom
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#008), and Margin; [Co2
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#011), Margin; see on [Co2
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#013); [Jam
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#005)).

[2 Corinthians 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co2 8:3</span></span>

they were willing--rather, supply from [Co2
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#005), the ellipsis thus, "According to
their power . . . yea, and beyond their power, THEY GAVE."

of themselves--not only not being besought, but themselves beseeching
us.

[2 Corinthians 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co2 8:4</span></span>

that we would receive--omitted in the oldest manuscripts. Translate
therefore, "Beseeching of us . . . the grace and fellowship of (that is,
to grant them the favor of sharing in) the ministering unto the saints."
The Macedonian contributions must have been from Philippi, because
Philippi was the only church that contributed to Paul's support ([Phi
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#010), [Phi
4:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#015)).

[2 Corinthians 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co2 8:5</span></span>

And this they did, not as we hoped--Translate, "And not as we hoped
(that is, far beyond our hopes), but their own selves gave they first to
the Lord." "First," not indicating priority of time, but first of all,
above all in importance. The giving of themselves takes precedency of
their other gifts, as being the motive which led them to the latter
([Rom 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#016)).

by the will of God--not "according to the will of God," but "moved by
the will of God, who made them willing" ([Phi
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#013)). It is therefore called ([Co2
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#001)), "the grace of God."

[2 Corinthians 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co2 8:6</span></span>

Insomuch that--As we saw the Macedonians' alacrity in giving, we could
not but exhort Titus, that as we collected in Macedonia, so he in
Corinth should complete the work of collecting which he had already
begun there, lest ye, the wealthy people of Corinth, should be outdone
in liberality by the poor Macedonians.

as he had begun--Greek, "previously begun," namely, the collection at
Corinth, before the Macedonians began to contribute, during the visit to
Corinth from which he had just returned.

finish in you the same grace--complete among you this act of grace or
beneficence on your part.

also--as well as other things which he had to do among them \[ALFORD\].

[2 Corinthians 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co2 8:7</span></span>

in faith-- ([Co2 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#024)).

utterance--(See on [Co1 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#005)). Not as
ALFORD, "doctrine" or "word."

knowledge-- ([Co1 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#001)).

diligence--in everything that is good.

your love to us--literally, "love from you (that is, on your part) in
us" (that is, which has us for its object; which is felt in the case of
us).

[2 Corinthians 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co2 8:8</span></span>

not by commandment--"not by way of commandment."

but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and &c.--rather, "But by
(mention of) the forwardness of others (as an inducement to you), and to
prove (literally, 'proving') the sincerity of your love." The Greek is
"by means of," not "on account of the forwardness," &c. BENGEL,
ELLICOTT, and others translate, "By means of the forwardness of others,
proving the sincerity of your love ALSO." The former is the simpler
construction in the Greek.

[2 Corinthians 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co2 8:9</span></span>

ye know the grace--the act of gratuitous love whereby the Lord emptied
Himself of His previous heavenly glory ([Phi
2:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006)) for your sakes.

became poor--Yet this is not demanded of you ([Co2
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#014)); but merely that, without
impoverishing yourselves, you should relieve others with your abundance.
If the Lord did so much more, and at so much heavier a cost, for your
sakes; much more may you do an act of love to your brethren at so little
a sacrifice of self.

might be rich--in the heavenly glory which constitutes His riches, and
all other things, so far as is really good for us (compare [Co1
3:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#021)).

[2 Corinthians 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co2 8:10</span></span>

advice--Herein he does not (as some misinterpret the passage) disclaim
inspiration for the advice he gives; but under the Spirit, states that
it is his "opinion" \[ALFORD\] or "judgment" \[ELLICOTT, and others\],
not a command, that so their offering might be free and spontaneous.

this--my giving you an advice, not a command.

who have begun before--"seeing that ye have begun before" the Macedonian
churches; "a year ago" should be connected with this clause.

not only to do, but also to be forward--There were three steps: (1) the
forwardness, more literally, "the will"; (2) the setting about it,
literally, "doing it"; (3) completion of it \[ALFORD\]. In the two
former, not only the act, but the intention, the Corinthians preceded
the Macedonians. BENGEL explains, "Not only to do" FOR THE PAST YEAR,
"but also to be forward" or willing FOR THIS YEAR. ELLICOTT translates,
"already," instead of "before": "Ye began already a year ago, not only
to do, but also to be forward." It appears hence, that something had
been done in the matter a year before; other texts, however, show the
collection was not yet paid (compare [Co2
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#011) and [Co2
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#005), [Co2
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#007)). This agrees with one, and only
one supposition, namely, that every man had laid by in store the fund
from which he was afterwards to contribute, the very case which is shown
by [Co1 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#002) to have existed \[PALEY,
HorÃ&brvbr; PaulinÃ&brvbr;\].

[2 Corinthians 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co2 8:11</span></span>

perform--"complete the doing also" (see on [Co2
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#010)).

a readiness to will--Greek, "the readiness of will"; referring to [Co2
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#010), where the Greek for "to be
forward," ought to be translated as here, "to will."

performance--"completion" \[ALFORD\], The godly should show the same
zeal to finish, as well as to begin well, which the worldly exhibit in
their undertakings ([Jer 44:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#025)).

[2 Corinthians 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co2 8:12</span></span>

For--Following up the rule "out of that which ye have" ([Co2
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#011)), and no more.

a willing mind--rather, as Greek, "the readiness," namely, to will,
referring to [Co2 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#011).

accepted--Greek "favorably accepted."

according to that a man hath--The oldest manuscripts omit "a man."
Translate, "According to whatsoever it have"; the willing mind, or
"readiness" to will, is personified \[ALFORD\]. Or better, as BENGEL,
"He is accepted according to whatsoever he have"; so [Co2
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#007), The Lord loveth a cheerful
giver." Compare as to David, [Kg1
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#018). God accepts the will for the
deed. He judges not according to what a man has the opportunity to do,
but according to what he would do if he had the opportunity (compare
[Mar 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#008); and the widow's mite, [Luk
21:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#003)).

[2 Corinthians 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co2 8:13</span></span>

For--Supply from [Co2 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#008), "I speak."
My aim is not that others (namely, the saints at Jerusalem) may be
relieved at the cost of your being "distressed" (so the Greek for
"burdened"). The golden rule is, "Love thy neighbour as thyself," not
more than thyself.

[2 Corinthians 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co2 8:14</span></span>

by an equality--"by the rule of equality" \[ALFORD\]: literally, "Out of
equality."

now at this time--Greek, "at the present juncture" or season.

that their abundance also--The Greek being distinct from the previous
"that," translate, "in order that," namely, at another season, when your
relative circumstances may be reversed. The reference is solely to
temporal wants and supplies. Those, as BENGEL, who quote [Rom
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#027) for interpreting it of spiritual
supplies from the Jews to the Gentiles, forget that [Rom
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#027) refers to the past benefit
spiritually, which the Jews have conferred on the Gentiles, as a motive
to gratitude on the part of the latter, not to a prospective benefit to
be looked for from the former, which the text refers to.

[2 Corinthians 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co2 8:15</span></span>

([Exo 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#018); Septuagint). As God gave
an equal portion of manna to all the Israelites, whether they could
gather much or little; so Christians should promote by liberality an
equality, so that none should need the necessaries of life while others
have superfluities. "Our luxuries should yield to our neighbor's
comforts; and our comforts to his necessities" \[J. HOWARD\].

[2 Corinthians 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co2 8:16</span></span>

Returning to the subject of [Co2 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#006).

for you--Translate, "Which put the same earnest care for you into the
heart of Titus," as was in myself. My care for you led me to "desire"
him ([Co2 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#006), [Co2
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#017), "exhortation," the same Greek);
but Titus had of himself the same care, whence he "accepted (gladly) my
exhortation" ([Co2 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#017)) to go to you
([Co2 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#006)).

[2 Corinthians 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">co2 8:17</span></span>

being more forward--more earnest than to need such exhortation.

he went--Greek, "went forth." We should say, he is going forth; but the
ancients put the past tense in letter writing, as the things will have
been past by the time that the correspondent, receives the letter. "Of
his own accord," that is, it is true he has been exhorted by me to go,
but he shows that he has anticipated my desires, and already, "of his
own accord," has desired to go.

[2 Corinthians 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">co2 8:18</span></span>

the brother, whose praise is in the gospel--whose praise is known in
connection with the Gospel: Luke may be meant; not that "the Gospel"
here refers to his written Gospel; but the language implies some one
well known throughout the churches, and at that time with Paul, as Luke
then was ([Act 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#006)). Not a
Macedonian, as appears from [Co2 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#004).
Of all Paul's "companions in travel" ([Co2
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#019); [Act
19:29](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#029)), Luke was the most prominent,
having been his companion in preaching the Gospel at his first entrance
into Europe ([Act 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#010)). The fact
that the person here referred to was "chosen of the churches" as their
trustee to travel with Paul in conveying the contribution to Jerusalem,
implies that he had resided among them some time before: this is true of
Luke, who after parting from Paul at Philippi (as he marks by the change
from "we" to "they," [Act 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#011)) six
years before, is now again found in his company in Macedonia. In the
interim he had probably become so well known that "his praise was
throughout all the churches." Compare [Co2
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#018); [Plm
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#024). He who is faithful in the Gospel
will be faithful also in matters of inferior importance \[BENGEL\].

[2 Corinthians 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">co2 8:19</span></span>

not that only--not only praised in all the churches.

chosen--by vote: so the Greek.

of the churches--therefore these companions of Paul are called
"messengers of the churches" ([Co2
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#023)).

to travel--to Jerusalem.

with this grace--Greek, "in the case of this grace," or "gift."

to the glory of the same Lord--The oldest manuscripts omit "same."

declaration of your ready mind--The oldest manuscripts read, "our," not
your. This and the previous clause, "to the glory of the same Lord," do
not follow "administered by us," but "chosen of the churches to travel,"
&c. The union of the brother with Paul in this affair of the collection
was done to guard against suspicions injurious "to the glory" of the
Lord. It was also done in order to produce a "readiness" on the part of
Paul and the brother to undertake the office which each, by himself,
would have been less ready to undertake, for fear of suspicions arising
([Co2 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#020)) as to their appropriation
of any of the money.

[2 Corinthians 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">co2 8:20</span></span>

Avoiding--taking precautions against this.

in this abundance--in the case of this abundance.

[2 Corinthians 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">co2 8:21</span></span>

The Septuagint ([Pro 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#004); [Rom
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#017)). The oldest manuscripts read,
"For we provide."

honest things--"things honorable."

[2 Corinthians 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">co2 8:22</span></span>

This second brother, BIRKS supposes to be Trophimus: for a Macedonian is
not meant ([Co2 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#004)) probably the same
as was sent before with Titus ([Co2
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#018)); and therefore sent from
Ephesus, and probably an Ephesian: all this is true of Trophimus.

oftentimes . . . in many things--Join and translate as in the Greek,
"many times in many things."

upon the great confidence which I have in you--"through the great
confidence WHICH HE HAS towards you" \[ALFORD\]. BENGEL better supports
English Version, "We have sent . . . through the confidence WHICH WE
FEEL in regard to your liberality."

[2 Corinthians 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">co2 8:23</span></span>

fellow helper concerning you--Greek, "fellow worker towards you."

our brethren--the two mentioned in [Co2
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#018), [Co2
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#022).

messengers--rather, as the Greek, "apostles": in the less strict sense
([Act 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#014)).

of the churches--sent by the churches, as we are by the Lord ([Phi
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#025)). There was in the synagogue an
ecclesiastical officer, called "the angel of the Church," whence the
title seems derived (compare [Rev
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#001)).

[2 Corinthians 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">co2 8:24</span></span>

The oldest manuscripts read "\[continue\] manifesting to them in the
face of the churches the manifestation of your love, and of our boasting
on your behalf."
