### [1 Timothy Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#001)

[1 Timothy 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ti1 3:1</span></span>

RULES AS TO BISHOPS (OVERSEERS) AND DEACONS. THE CHURCH, AND THE GOSPEL
MYSTERY NOW REVEALED TO IT, ARE THE END OF ALL SUCH RULES. (1Ti. 3:1-16)

Translate as Greek, "Faithful is the saying." A needful preface to what
follows: for the office of a bishop or overseer in Paul's day, attended
as it was with hardship and often persecution, would not seem to the
world generally a desirable and "good work."

desire--literally, "stretch one's self forward to grasp"; "aim at": a
distinct Greek verb from that for "desireth." What one does voluntarily
is more esteemed than what he does when asked ([Co1
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#015)). This is utterly distinct from
ambitious desires after office in the Church. ([Jam
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#001)).

bishop--overseer: as yet identical with "presbyter" ([Act
20:17](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#017), [Act
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#028); [Tit
1:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#005)).

good work--literally, "honorable work." Not the honor associated with
it, but the work, is the prominent thought ([Act
15:38](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#038); [Phi
2:30](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#030); compare [Ti2
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#005)). He who aims at the office must
remember the high qualifications needed for the due discharge of its
functions.

[1 Timothy 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ti1 3:2</span></span>

The existence of Church organization and presbyters at Ephesus is
presupposed ([Ti1 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#017), [Ti1
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#019)). The institution of Church
widows (1Ti. 5:3-25) accords with this. The directions here to Timothy,
the president or apostolic delegate, are as to filling up vacancies
among the bishops and deacons, or adding to their number. New churches
in the neighborhood also would require presbyters and deacons.
Episcopacy was adopted in apostolic times as the most expedient form of
government, being most nearly in accordance with Jewish institutions,
and so offering the less obstruction through Jewish prejudices to the
progress of Christianity. The synagogue was governed by presbyters,
"elders" ([Act 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#008); [Act
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#001)), called also bishops or
overseers. Three among them presided as "rulers of the synagogue,"
answering to "bishops" in the modern sense \[LIGHTFOOT, Hebrew and
Talmudic Exercitations\], and one among them took the lead. AMBROSE (in
The Duties of the Clergy \[2.13\], as also BINGHAM \[Ecclesiastical
Antiquities, 2.11\]) says, "They who are now called bishops were
originally called apostles. But those who ruled the Church after the
death of the apostles had not the testimony of miracles, and were in
many respects inferior. Therefore they thought it not decent to assume
to themselves the name of apostles; but dividing the names, they left to
presbyters the name of the presbytery, and they themselves were called
bishops." "Presbyter" refers to the rank; "bishop," to the office or
function. Timothy (though not having the name) exercised the power at
Ephesus then, which bishops in the modern sense more recently exercised.

blameless--"unexceptionable"; giving no just handle for blame.

husband of one wife--confuting the celibacy of Rome's priesthood. Though
the Jews practiced polygamy, yet as he is writing as to a Gentile
Church, and as polygamy was never allowed among even laymen in the
Church, the ancient interpretation that the prohibition here is against
polygamy in a candidate bishop is not correct. It must, therefore, mean
that, though laymen might lawfully marry again, candidates for the
episcopate or presbytery were better to have been married only once. As
in [Ti1 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#009), "wife of one man,"
implies a woman married but once; so "husband of one wife" here must
mean the same. The feeling which prevailed among the Gentiles, as well
as the Jews (compare as to Anna, [Luk
2:36-37](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#036)), against a second marriage
would, on the ground of expediency and conciliation in matters
indifferent and not involving compromise of principle, account for
Paul's prohibition here in the case of one in so prominent a sphere as a
bishop or a deacon. Hence the stress that is laid in the context on the
repute in which the candidate for orders is held among those over whom
he is to preside ([Tit 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#016)). The
Council of Laodicea and the apostolic canons discountenanced second
marriages, especially in the case of candidates for ordination. Of
course second marriage being lawful, the undesirableness of it holds
good only under special circumstances. It is implied here also, that he
who has a wife and virtuous family, is to be preferred to a bachelor;
for he who is himself bound to discharge the domestic duties mentioned
here, is likely to be more attractive to those who have similar ties,
for he teaches them not only by precept, but also by example ([Ti1
3:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#004)). The Jews teach, a priest
should be neither unmarried nor childless, lest he be unmerciful
\[BENGEL\]. So in the synagogue, "no one shall offer up prayer in
public, unless he be married" \[in Colbo, ch. 65; VITRINGA, Synagogue
and Temple\].

vigilant--literally, "sober"; ever on the watch, as sober men alone can
be; keenly alive, so as to foresee what ought to be done ([Th1
5:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#006)).

sober--sober-minded.

of good behaviour--Greek, "orderly." "Sober" refers to the inward mind;
"orderly," to the outward behavior, tone, look, gait, dress. The new man
bears somewhat of a sacred festival character, incompatible with all
confusion, disorder, excess, violence, laxity, assumption, harshness,
and meanness ([Phi 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#008)) \[BENGEL\].

apt to teach-- ([Ti2 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#024)).

[1 Timothy 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ti1 3:3</span></span>

Not given to wine--The Greek includes besides this, not indulging in the
brawling, violent conduct towards others, which proceeds from being
given to wine. The opposite of "patient" or (Greek) "forbearing,"
reasonable to others (see on [Phi
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#005)).

no striker--with either hand or tongue: not as some teachers pretending
a holy zeal ([Co2 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#020)), answering to
"not a brawler" or fighter (compare [Kg1
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#024); [Neh
13:25](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#025); [Isa
58:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#004); [Act
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#002); [Ti2
2:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#024)).

not covetous--Greek, "not a lover of money," whether he have much or
little ([Tit 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#007)).

[1 Timothy 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ti1 3:4</span></span>

ruleth--Greek, "presiding over."

his own house--children and servants, as contrasted with "the church"
(house) of God ([Ti1 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#005), [Ti1
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#015)) which he may be called on to
preside over.

having his children--rather as Greek, "having children (who are) in
subjection" ([Tit 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#006)).

gravity--propriety: reverent modesty on the part of the children
\[ALFORD\]. The fact that he has children who are in subjection to him
in all gravity, is the recommendation in his favor as one likely to rule
well the Church.

[1 Timothy 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ti1 3:5</span></span>

For--Greek, "But."

the church--rather, "a church" or congregation. How shall he who cannot
perform the lesser function, perform the greater and more difficult?

[1 Timothy 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ti1 3:6</span></span>

not a novice--one just converted. This proves the Church of Ephesus was
established now for some time. The absence of this rule in the Epistle
to Titus, accords with the recent planting of the Church at Crete.
Greek, "neophyte," literally, "a young plant"; luxuriantly verdant ([Rom
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#005); [Rom
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#017); [Co1
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#006)). The young convert has not yet
been disciplined and matured by afflictions and temptations. Contrast
[Act 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#016), "an old disciple."

lifted up with pride--Greek, literally, "wrapt in smoke," so that,
inflated with self-conceit and exaggerated ideas of his own importance,
he cannot see himself or others in the true light ([Ti1
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#004); [Ti2
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#004)).

condemnation of the devil--into the same condemnation as Satan fell into
([Ti1 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#007); [Ti2
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#026)). Pride was the cause of Satan's
condemnation ([Job 38:15](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#015); [Isa
14:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#012); [Joh
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#031); [Joh
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#011); [Pe2
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#004); [Jde
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#006)). It cannot mean condemnation or
accusation on the part of the devil. The devil may bring a reproach on
men ([Ti1 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#007)), but he cannot bring
them into condemnation, for he does not judge, but is judged \[BENGEL\].

[1 Timothy 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ti1 3:7</span></span>

a good report--Greek, "testimony." So Paul was influenced by the good
report given of Timothy to choose him as his companion ([Act
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#002)).

of them which are without--from the as yet unconverted Gentiles around
([Co1 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#012); [Col
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#005); [Th1
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#012)), that they may be the more
readily won to the Gospel ([Pe1 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#012)),
and that the name of Christ may be glorified. Not even the former life
of a bishop should be open to reproach \[BENGEL\].

reproach and the snare of the devil--reproach of men ([Ti1
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#014)) proving the occasion of his
falling into the snare of the devil ([Ti1
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#009); [Mat
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#015); [Ti2
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#026)). The reproach continually
surrounding him for former sins might lead him into the snare of
becoming as bad as his reputation. Despair of recovering reputation
might, in a weak moment, lead some into recklessness of living ([Jer
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#012)). The reason why only moral
qualities of a general kind are specified is, he presupposes in
candidates for a bishopric the special gifts of the Spirit ([Ti1
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#014)) and true faith, which he desires
to be evidenced outwardly; also he requires qualifications in a bishop
not so indispensable in others.

[1 Timothy 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ti1 3:8</span></span>

The deacons were chosen by the voice of the people. CYPRIAN \[Epistle,
2.5\] says that good bishops never departed from the old custom of
consulting the people. The deacons answer to the chazzan of the
synagogue: the attendant ministers, or subordinate coadjutors of the
presbyter (as Timothy himself was to Paul, [Ti1
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#006); [Plm
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#013); and John Mark, [Act
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#005)). Their duty was to read the
Scriptures in the Church, to instruct the catechumens in Christian
truths, to assist the presbyters at the sacraments, to receive
oblations, and to preach and instruct. As the "chazzan" covered and
uncovered the ark in the synagogue, containing the law, so the deacon in
the ancient Church put the covering on the communion table. (See
CHRYSOSTOM \[19\], Homily on Acts; THEOPHYLACT on Luke 19; and BALSAMAN
on Canon 22, Council of Laodicea). The appointing of "the seven" in [Act
6:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#001) is perhaps not meant to describe
the first appointment of the deacons of the Church. At least the chazzan
previously suggested the similar order of deacons.

double-tongued--literally, "of double speech"; saying one thing to this
person, and another to that person \[THEODORET\]. The extensive personal
intercourse that deacons would have with the members of the Church might
prove a temptation to such a fault. Others explain it, "Saying one
thing, thinking another" ([Pro 20:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#019);
[Gal 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#013)). I prefer the former.

not greedy of filthy lucre--All gain is filthy (literally, "base") which
is set before a man as a by-end in his work for God \[ALFORD\] ([Pe1
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#002)). The deacon's office of
collecting and distributing alms would render this a necessary
qualification.

[1 Timothy 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ti1 3:9</span></span>

the mystery of the faith--holding the faith, which to the natural man
remains a mystery, but which has been revealed by the Spirit to them
([Rom 16:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#025); [Co1
2:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#007)), in a pure conscience ([Ti1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#005), [Ti1
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#019)). ("Pure," that is, in which
nothing base or foreign is intermixed \[TITTMANN\]). Though deacons were
not ordinarily called on to preach (Stephen and Philip are not
exceptions to this, since it was as evangelists, rather than as deacons,
they preached), yet as being office-bearers in the Church, and having
much intercourse with all the members, they especially needed to have
this characteristic, which every Christian ought to have.

[1 Timothy 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ti1 3:10</span></span>

"And moreover," &c. \[ALFORD\].

be proved--not by a period of probation, but by a searching inquiry,
conducted by Timothy, the ordaining president ([Ti1
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#022)), whether they be "blameless";
then when found so, "let them act as deacons."

blameless--Greek, "unexceptionable"; as the result of public
investigation unaccused \[TITTMANN\].

[1 Timothy 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ti1 3:11</span></span>

their wives--rather, "the women," that is, the deaconesses. For there is
no reason that special rules should be laid down as to the wives of the
deacons, and not also as to the wives of the bishops or overseers.
Moreover, if the wives of the deacons were meant, there seems no reason
for the omission of "their" (not in the Greek). Also the Greek for "even
so" (the same as for "likewise," [Ti1
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#008), and "in like manner," [Ti1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#009)), denotes a transition to another
class of persons. Further, there were doubtless deaconesses at Ephesus,
such as PhÅ“be was at Cenchrea ([Rom
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#001), "servant," Greek, "deaconess"),
yet no mention is made of them in this Epistle if not here; whereas,
supposing them to be meant here, the third chapter embraces in due
proportion all the persons in the service of the Church. Naturally after
specifying the qualifications of the deacon, Paul passes to those of the
kindred office, the deaconess. "Grave" occurs in the case of both. "Not
slanderers" here, answers to "not double-tongued" in the deacons; so
"not false accusers" ([Tit 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#003)).
"Sober" here answers to "not given to much wine," in the case of the
deacons ([Ti1 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#008)). Thus it appears he
requires the same qualifications in female deacons as in deacons, only
with such modifications as the difference of sex suggested. PLINY, in
his celebrated letter to Trajan, calls them "female ministers."

faithful in all things--of life as well as faith. Trustworthy in respect
to the alms committed to them and their other functions, answering to
"not greedy of filthy lucre," [Ti1
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#008), in the case of the deacons.

[1 Timothy 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ti1 3:12</span></span>

husbands of one wife--(See on [Ti1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#002)).

ruling their children--There is no article in the Greek, "ruling
children"; implying that he regarded the having children to rule as a
qualification ([Ti1 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#004); [Tit
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#006)).

their own houses--as distinguished from "the Church of God" (see on [Ti1
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#005)). In the case of the deacons, as
in that of the bishops, he mentions the first condition of receiving
office, rather than the special qualifications for its discharge. The
practical side of Christianity is the one most dwelt on in the Pastoral
Epistles, in opposition to the heretical teachers; moreover, as the
miraculous gifts began to be withdrawn, the safest criterion of
efficiency would be the previous moral character of the candidate, the
disposition and talent for the office being presupposed. So in [Act
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#003), a similar criterion was applied,
"Look ye out among you seven men of honest report." Less stress is laid
on personal dignity in the case of the deacon than in that of the bishop
(compare Notes, see on [Ti1 3:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#002)).

[1 Timothy 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ti1 3:13</span></span>

purchase to themselves a good degree--literally, "are acquiring . . . a
. . . step." Understood by many as "a higher step," that is, promotion
to the higher office of presbyter. But ambition of rising seems hardly
the motive to faithfulness which the apostle would urge; besides, it
would require the comparative, "a better degree." Then the past aorist
participle, "they that used the office of deacon well," implies that the
present verb, "are acquiring to themselves boldness," is the result of
the completed action of using the diaconate well. Also, Paul would not
probably hold out to every deacon the prospect of promotion to the
presbytery in reward of his service. The idea of moving upwards in
Church offices was as yet unknown (compare [Rom
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#007), &c.; [Co1
12:4-11](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#004)). Moreover, there seems little
connection between reference to a higher Church rank and the words
"great boldness." Therefore, what those who have faithfully discharged
the diaconate acquire for themselves is "a good standing-place"
\[ALFORD\] (a well-grounded hope of salvation) against the day of
judgment, [Ti1 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#019); [Co1
3:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#013) (the figurative meaning of
"degree" or "step," being the degree of worth which one has obtained in
the eye of God \[WIESINGER\]); and boldness (resting on that
standing-place"), as well for preaching and admonishing others now ([Eph
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#019); a firm standing forth for the
truth against error), as also especially in relation to God their coming
Judge, before whom they may be boldly confident ([Act
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#016); [Jo1
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#028); [Jo1
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#021); [Jo1
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#017); [Heb
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#016)).

in the faith--rather as Greek, "in faith," that is, boldness resting on
their own faith.

which is in Christ Jesus--resting in Christ Jesus.

[1 Timothy 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ti1 3:14</span></span>

write I . . . hoping--that is, "though I hope to come unto thee shortly"
([Ti1 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#013)). As his hope was not very
confident ([Ti1 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#015)), he provides for
Timothy's lengthened superintendence by giving him the preceding rules
to guide him. He now proceeds to give more general instructions to him
as an evangelist, having a "gift" committed to him ([Ti1
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#014)).

shortly--Greek, "sooner," namely, than is presupposed in the preceding
directions given to him. See my Introduction on this verse. This verse
best suits the theory that this First Epistle was not written after
Paul's visit and departure from Ephesus (Acts 19:1-20:38) when he had
resolved to winter at Corinth after passing the summer in Macedonia
([Co1 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#006)), but after his first
imprisonment at Rome ([Act 28:17-31](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#017));
probably at Corinth, where he might have some thoughts of going on to
Epirus before returning to Ephesus \[BIRKS\].

[1 Timothy 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ti1 3:15</span></span>

But if I tarry long--before coming to thee.

that--that is, I write ([Ti1 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#014))
"that thou mayest know," &c.

behave thyself--in directing the Church at Ephesus ([Ti1
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#011)).

the house of God--the Church ([Heb
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#002), [Heb
3:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#005); [Heb
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#021); [Pe1
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#017); [Co1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#016), "the temple of God"; [Eph
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#022)).

which is--that is, inasmuch as it is.

the church--"the congregation." The fact that the sphere of thy
functions is "the congregation of the living God" (who is the ever
living Master of the house, [Ti2
2:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#019)), is the strongest motive to
faithfulness in this behavior as president of a department of the
house." The living God forms a striking contrast to the lifeless idol,
Diana of Ephesus ([Th1 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#009)). He is the
fountain of "truth," and the foundation of our "trust" ([Ti1
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#010)). Labor directed to a particular
Church is service to the one great house of God, of which each
particular Church is a part, and each Christian a lively stone ([Pe1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005)).

the pillar and ground of the truth--evidently predicated of the Church,
not of "the mystery of godliness" (an interpretation not started till
the sixteenth century; so BENGEL); for after two weighty predicates,
"pillar and ground," and these substantives, the third, a much weaker
one, and that an adjective, "confessedly," or "without controversy
great," would not come. "Pillar" is so used metaphorically of the three
apostles on whom principally the Jewish Christian Church depended ([Gal
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#009); compare [Rev
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#012)). The Church is "the pillar of
the truth," as the continued existence (historically) of the truth rests
on it; for it supports and preserves the word of truth. He who is of the
truth belongs by the very fact to the Church. Christ is the alone ground
of the truth in the highest sense ([Co1
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#011)). The apostles are foundations in
a secondary sense ([Eph 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#020); [Rev
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#014)). The Church rests on the truth
as it is in Christ; not the truth on the Church. But the truth as it is
in itself is to be distinguished from the truth as it is acknowledged in
the world. In the former sense it needs no pillar, but supports itself;
in the latter sense, it needs the Church as its pillar, that is, its
supporter and preserver \[BAUMGARTEN\]. The importance of Timothy's
commission is set forth by reminding him of the excellence of "the
house" in which he serves; and this in opposition to the coming heresies
which Paul presciently forewarns him of immediately after ([Ti1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#001)). The Church is to be the stay of
the truth and its conserver for the world, and God's instrument for
securing its continuance on earth, in opposition to those heresies ([Mat
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018); [Mat
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#020)). The apostle does not recognize
a Church which has not the truth, or has it only in part. Rome falsely
claims the promise for herself. But it is not historical descent that
constitutes a Church, but this only, to those heresies ([Mat
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018); [Mat
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#020)). The apostle does not recognize
a Church which has not the intermediate; the "ground," or "basement"
(similar to "foundation," [Ti2 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#019)),
the final support of the building \[ALFORD\]. It is no objection that,
having called the Church before "the house of God," he now calls it the
"pillar"; for the literal word "Church" immediately precedes the new
metaphors: so the Church, or congregation of believers, which before was
regarded as the habitation of God, is now, from a different point of
view, regarded as the pillar upholding the truth.

[1 Timothy 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ti1 3:16</span></span>

And--following up [Ti1 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#015) : The
pillar of the truth is the Church in which thou art required to
minister; "AND (that thou mayest know how grand is that truth which the
Church so upholds) confessedly (so the Greek for 'without controversy')
great is the mystery of godliness: (namely), HE WHO (so the oldest
manuscripts and versions read for 'God') was manifested in (the) flesh
(He who) was justified in the Spirit," &c. There is set before us the
whole dignity of Christ's person. If He were not essentially superhuman
([Tit 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#013)), how could the apostle
emphatically declare that He was manifested in (the) flesh? \[TREGELLES,
Printed Text of the Greek New Testament\]. ([Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014); [Phi
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007); [Jo1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#002); [Jo1
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#002)). Christ, in all His aspects, is
Himself "the mystery of godliness." He who before was hidden "with God"
was made manifest ([Joh 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001), [Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014); [Rom
16:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#025); [Col
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#026); [Ti2
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#010); [Tit
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#011); [Tit
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#004); [Jo1
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#005), [Jo1
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#008)). "Confessedly," that is, by the
universal confession of the members of "the Church," which is in this
respect the "pillar" or upholder "of the truth."

the mystery--the divine scheme embodied in CHRIST ([Col
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#027)), once hidden from, but now
revealed to, us who believe.

of godliness--rather, "piety"; a different Greek, expresses godliness
([Ti1 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#010)). In opposition to the
ungodliness or impiety inseparable from error (departure from the faith:
"doctrines of devils," "profane fables," [Ti1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#001), [Ti1
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#007); compare [Ti1
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#003)). To the victims of such error,
the "mystery of piety" (that is, Christ Himself) remains a mystery
unrevealed ([Ti1 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#002)). It is
accessible only to "piety" ([Ti1 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#009)):
in relation to the pious it is termed a "mystery," though revealed ([Co1
2:7-14](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#007)), to imply the excellence of
Him who is the surpassing essential subject of it, and who is Himself
"wonderful" ([Isa 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006)), surpassing
knowledge ([Eph 3:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#018)); compare [Eph
5:32](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#032). The apostle now proceeds to
unfold this confessedly great mystery in its details. It is not unlikely
that some formula of confession or hymn existed in the Church and was
generally accepted, to which Paul alludes in the words "confessedly
great is the mystery," &c. (to wit), "He who was manifested," &c. Such
hymns were then used (compare [Eph
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#019); [Col
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#016)). PLINY \[1.10, Epistle, 97\],
"They are wont on a fixed day before dawn to meet and sing a hymn in
alternate responses to Christ, as being God"; and EUSEBIUS
\[Ecclesiastical History, 5.28\]. The short unconnected sentences with
the words similarly arranged, and the number of syllables almost equal,
and the ideas antithetically related, are characteristics of a Christian
hymn. The clauses stand in parallelism; each two are connected as a
pair, and form an antithesis turning on the opposition of heaven to
earth; the order of this antithesis is reversed in each new pair of
clauses: flesh and spirit, angels and Gentiles, world and glory; and
there is a correspondence between the first and the last clause:
"manifested in the flesh, received up into glory" \[WIESINGER\].

justified--that is, approved to be righteous \[ALFORD\]. Christ, while
"in the flesh," seemed to be just such a one as men in the flesh, and in
fact bore their sins; but by having died to sin, and having risen again,
He gained for Himself and His people justifying righteousness ([Isa
50:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#008); [Joh
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#010); [Act
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#014); [Rom
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#025); [Rom
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#007), [Rom
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#010); [Heb
9:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#028); [Pe1
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#018); [Pe1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#001) [Jo1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#001)) \[BENGEL\]; or rather, as the
antithesis to "was manifest in the flesh" requires, He was justified in
the Spirit at the same time that He was manifest in the flesh, that is,
He was vindicated as divine "in His Spirit," that is, in His higher
nature; in contrast to "in the flesh," His visible human nature. This
contrasted opposition requires "in the Spirit" to be thus explained: not
"by the Spirit," as ALFORD explains it. So [Rom
1:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#003), "Made of the seed of David
according to the flesh, and declared to be the Son of God with power,
according to the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead."
So "justified" is used to mean vindicated in one's true character ([Mat
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#019); [Luk
7:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#035); [Rom
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#004)). His manifestation "in the flesh"
exposed him to misapprehension, as though he were nothing more ([Joh
6:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#041); [Joh
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#027)). His justification, or
vindication, in respect to His Spirit or higher being, was effected by
ALL that manifested that higher being, His words ([Mat
7:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#029); [Joh
7:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#046)), His works ([Joh
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#011); [Joh
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#002)), by His Father's testimony at His
baptism ([Mat 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#017)), and at the
transfiguration ([Mat 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#005)), and
especially by His resurrection ([Act
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#033); [Rom
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#004)), though not by this exclusively,
as BENGEL limits it.

seen of angels--answering to "preached unto the Gentiles" (or rather
"among the nations"; including the Jews), on the other hand ([Mat
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#019); [Rom
16:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#025)). "Angels saw the Son of God
with us, not having seen Him before" \[CHRYSOSTOM\].' "not even they had
seen His divine nature, which is not visible to any creature, but they
saw Him incarnate" \[THEODORET\] ([Eph
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#008), [Eph
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#010); [Pe1
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#012); compare [Col
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016), [Col
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#020)). What angels came to know by
seeing, the nations learned by preaching. He is a new message to the one
class as well as to the other; in the wondrous union in His person of
things most opposite, namely, heaven and earth, lies "the mystery"
\[WIESINGER\]. If the English Version, "Gentiles," be retained, the
antithesis will be between the angels who are so near the Son of God,
the Lord of "angels," and the Gentiles who were so utterly "afar off"
([Eph 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#017)).

believed on in the world--which lieth in wickedness ([Jo1
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#015); [Jo1
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#019)). Opposed to "glory" ([Joh
3:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#016)). This followed upon His being
"preached" ([Rom 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#014)).

received up into glory--Greek, "in glory." However, English Version may
be retained thus, "Received up (so as now to be) in glory," that is,
into glory ([Mar 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#019); [Luk
24:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#051); [Act
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#011)). His reception in heaven answers
to His reception on earth by being "believed on."
