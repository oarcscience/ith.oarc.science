### [Psalms Chapter 129](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#001)

[Psalms 129:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 129:1</span></span>

The people of God, often delivered from enemies, are confident of His
favor, by their overthrow in the future. ([Psa
129:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#001))

may Israel now say--or, "oh! let Israel say" ([Psa
124:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#001)). Israel's youth was the sojourn
in Egypt ([Jer 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#002); [Hos
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#015)).

[Psalms 129:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 129:2</span></span>

prevailed--literally, "been able," that is, to accomplish their purpose
against me ([Psa 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#004)).

[Psalms 129:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 129:3</span></span>

The ploughing is a figure of scourging, which most severe physical
infliction aptly represents all kinds.

[Psalms 129:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 129:4</span></span>

the cords--that is, which fasten the plough to the ox; and cutting
denotes God's arresting the persecution;

[Psalms 129:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 129:5</span></span>

The ill-rooted roof grass, which withers before it grows up and procures
for those gathering it no harvest blessing ([Rut
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#004)), sets forth the utter uselessness
and the rejection of the wicked.
