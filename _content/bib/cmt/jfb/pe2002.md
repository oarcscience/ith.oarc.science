### [2 Peter Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#001)

[2 Peter 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pe2 2:1</span></span>

FALSE TEACHERS TO ARISE: THEM BAD PRACTICES AND SURE DESTRUCTION, FROM
WHICH THE GODLY SHALL BE DELIVERED, AS LOT WAS. (2Pe. 2:1-22)

But--in contrast to the prophets "moved by the Holy Ghost" ([Pe2
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#021)).

also--as well as the true prophets ([Pe2
1:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#019)). Paul had already testified
the entrance of false prophets into the same churches.

among the people--Israel: he is writing to believing Israelites
primarily (see on [Pe1 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#001)). Such a
"false prophet" was Balaam ([Pe2
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#015)).

there shall be--Already symptoms of the evil were appearing ([Pe2
2:9-22](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#009); [Jde
1:4-13](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#004)).

false teachers--teachers of falsehood. In contrast to the true teachers,
whom he exhorts his readers to give heed to ([Pe2
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#002)).

who--such as (literally, "the which") shall.

privily--not at first openly and directly, but by the way, bringing in
error by the side of the true doctrine (so the Greek): Rome objects,
Protestants cannot point out the exact date of the beginnings of the
false doctrines superadded to the original truth; we answer, Peter
foretells us it would be so, that the first introduction of them would
be stealthy and unobserved ([Jde 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#004)).

damnable--literally, "of destruction"; entailing destruction ([Phi
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#019)) on all who follow them.

heresies--self-chosen doctrines, not emanating from God (compare
"will-worship," [Col 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#023)).

even--going even to such a length as to deny both in teaching and
practice. Peter knew, by bitter repentance, what a fearful thing it is
to deny the Lord ([Luk 22:61-62](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#061)).

denying--Him whom, above all others, they ought to confess.

Lord--"Master and Owner" (Greek), compare [Jde
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#004), Greek. Whom the true doctrine
teaches to be their OWNER by right of purchase. Literally, "denying Him
who bought them (that He should be thereby), their Master."

bought them--Even the ungodly were bought by His "precious blood." It
shall be their bitterest self-reproach in hell, that, as far as Christ's
redemption was concerned, they might have been saved. The denial of His
propitiatory sacrifice is included in the meaning (compare [Jo1
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#003)).

bring upon themselves--compare "God bringing in the flood upon the
world," [Pe2 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#005). Man brings upon
himself the vengeance which God brings upon him.

swift--swiftly descending: as the Lord's coming shall be swift and
sudden. As the ground swallowed up Korah and Dathan, and "they went down
quick into the pit." Compare [Jde
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#011), which is akin to this passage.

[2 Peter 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pe2 2:2</span></span>

follow--out: so the Greek.

pernicious ways--The oldest manuscripts and Vulgate read,
"licentiousness" ([Jde 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#004)). False
doctrine and immoral practice generally go together ([Pe2
2:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#018)).

by reason of whom--"on account of whom," namely, the followers of the
false teachers.

the way of truth shall be evil spoken of--"blasphemed" by those without,
who shall lay on Christianity itself the blame of its professors' evil
practice. Contrast [Pe1 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#012).

[2 Peter 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pe2 2:3</span></span>

through, &c.--Greek, "IN covetousness" as their element ([Pe2
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#014), end). Contrast [Co2
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#020); [Co2
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#017).

of a long time--in God's eternal purpose. "Before of old ordained to
condemnation" ([Jde 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#004)).

lingereth not--though sinners think it lingers; "is not idle."

damnation--Greek, "destruction" (see on [Pe2
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#001)). Personified.

slumbereth not--though sinners slumber.

[2 Peter 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pe2 2:4</span></span>

if--The apodosis or consequent member of the sentence is not expressed,
but is virtually contained in [Pe2
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#009). If God in past time has punished
the ungodly and saved His people, He will be sure to do so also in our
days (compare end of [Pe2 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#003)).

angels--the highest of intelligent creatures (compare with this verse,
[Jde 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#006)), yet not spared when they
sinned.

hell--Greek, "Tartarus": nowhere else in New Testament or the
Septuagint: equivalent to the usual Greek, "Gehenna." Not inconsistent
with [Pe1 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#008); for though their final
doom is hell, yet for a time they are permitted to roam beyond it in
"the darkness of this world." Slaves of Tartarus (called "the abyss," or
"deep," [Luk 8:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#031); "the bottomless
pit," [Rev 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#011)) may also come upon
earth. Step by step they are given to Tartarus, until at last they shall
be wholly bound to it.

delivered--as the judge delivers the condemned prisoner to the officers
([Rev 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#002)).

into chains-- ([Jde 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#006)). The oldest
manuscripts read, "dens," as ALFORD translates: the Greek, however, may,
in Hellenistic Greek, mean "chains," as Jude expresses it. They are
"reserved" unto hell's "mist of darkness" as their final "judgment" or
doom, and meanwhile their exclusion from the light of heaven is begun.
So the ungodly were considered as virtually "in prison," though at large
on the earth, from the moment that God's sentence went forth, though not
executed till one hundred twenty years after.

[2 Peter 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pe2 2:5</span></span>

eighth--that is, Noah, and seven others. Contrasted with the densely
peopled "world of the ungodly."

preacher--not only "righteous" himself (compare [Pe2
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#008)), but also "a preacher of
righteousness": adduced by Peter against the licentiousness of the false
teachers ([Pe2 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#002)) who have no
prospect before them but destruction, even as it overtook the ungodly
world in Noah's days.

[2 Peter 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pe2 2:6</span></span>

with, &c.--"TO overthrow" \[ALFORD\].

ensample--"of (the fate that should befall) those who in after-time
should live ungodly." Compare [Jde
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#007), "set forth for an example."

[2 Peter 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pe2 2:7</span></span>

just--righteous.

filthy conversation--literally, "behavior in licentiousness" ([Gen
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#005)).

the wicked--Greek, "lawless": who set at defiance the laws of nature, as
well as man and God. The Lord reminds us of Lot's faithfulness, but not
of his sin in the cave: so in Rahab's case.

[2 Peter 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pe2 2:8</span></span>

vexed--Greek, "tormented."

[2 Peter 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pe2 2:9</span></span>

knoweth how--He is at no loss for means, even when men see no escape.

out of--not actually from.

temptations--trials.

to be punished--Greek, "being punished": as the fallen angels ([Pe2
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#004)), actually under sentence, and
awaiting its final execution. Sin is already its own penalty; hell will
be its full development.

[2 Peter 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pe2 2:10</span></span>

chiefly--They especially will be punished ([Jde
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#008)).

after--following after.

lust of uncleanness--defilement: "hankering after polluting and unlawful
use of the flesh" \[ALFORD\].

government--Greek, "lordship," "dominion" ([Jde
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#008)).

Presumptuous--Greek, "Darers." Self-will begets presumption.
Presumptuously daring.

are not afraid--though they are so insignificant in might; Greek,
"tremble not" ([Jde 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#008), end).

speak evil of--Greek, "blaspheme."

dignities--Greek, "glories."

[2 Peter 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pe2 2:11</span></span>

which are--though they are.

greater--than these blasphemers. Jude instances Michael ([Jde
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#009)).

railing accusation--Greek, "blaspheming judgment" ([Jde
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#009)).

against them--against "dignities," as for instance, the fallen angels:
once exalted, and still retaining traces of their former power and
glory.

before the Lord--In the presence of the Lord, the Judge, in reverence,
they abstain from judgment \[BENGEL\]. Judgment belongs to God, not the
angels. How great is the dignity of the saints who, as Christ's
assessors, shall hereafter judge angels! Meanwhile, railing judgments,
though spoken with truth, against dignities, as being uttered
irreverently, are of the nature of "blasphemies" (Greek, [Co1
4:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#004)). If superior angels dare not,
as being in the presence of God, the Judge, speak evil even of the bad
angels, how awful the presumption of those who speak evil blasphemously
of good "dignities." [Sa2 16:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#007),
Shimei; [Num 16:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#002), Korah, &c.,
referred to also in [Jde 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#011); [Num
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#008), "Were ye (Aaron and Miriam) not
afraid to speak evil of My servant Moses?" The angels who sinned still
retain the indelible impress of majesty. Satan is still "a strong man":
"prince of this world"; and under him are "principalities, powers,
rulers of the darkness of this world." We are to avoid irreverence in
regard to them, not on their account, but on account of God. A warning
to those who use Satan's name irreverently and in blasphemy. "When the
ungodly curseth Satan, he curseth his own soul."

[2 Peter 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pe2 2:12</span></span>

([Jde 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#019)).

But--In contrast to the "angels," [Pe2
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#011).

brute--Greek, "irrational." In contrast to angels that "excel in
strength."

beasts--Greek, "animals" (compare [Psa
49:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#020)).

natural--transposed in the oldest manuscripts, "born natural," that is,
born naturally so: being in their very nature (that is, naturally) as
such (irrational animals), born to be taken and destroyed (Greek, "unto
capture and destruction," or corruption, see on [Gal
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#008); compare end of this verse, "shall
perish," literally, "shall be corrupted," in their own corruption. [Jde
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#010), naturally . . . corrupt
themselves," and so destroy themselves; for one and the same Greek word
expresses corruption, the seed, and destruction, the developed fruit).

speak evil of--Greek, "in the case of things which they understand not."
Compare the same presumption, the parent of subsequent Gnostic error,
producing an opposite, though kindred, error, the worshipping of good
angels": [Col 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#018), "intruding into
those things which he hath not seen."

[2 Peter 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pe2 2:13</span></span>

receive--"shall carry off as their due."

reward of--that is, for their "unrighteousness" \[ALFORD\]. Perhaps it
is implied, unrighteousness shall be its own reward or punishment.
"Wages of unrighteousness" ([Pe2 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#015))
has a different sense, namely, the earthly gain to be gotten by
"unrighteousness."

in the daytime--Translate as Greek, "counting the luxury which is in the
daytime (not restricted to night, as ordinary revelling. Or as Vulgate
and CALVIN, "the luxury which is but for a day": so [Heb
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#025), "the pleasures of sin for a
season"; and [Heb 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#016), Esau) to be
pleasure," that is, to be their chief good and highest enjoyment.

Spots--in themselves.

blemishes--disgraces: bringing blame (so the Greek) on the Church and on
Christianity itself.

sporting themselves--Greek, "luxuriating."

with--Greek, "in."

deceivings--or else passively, "deceits": luxuries gotten by deceit.
Compare [Mat 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#022), "Deceitfulness of
riches"; [Eph 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#022), "Deceitful lusts."
While deceiving others, they are deceived themselves. Compare with
English Version, [Phi 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#019), "Whose
glory is in their shame." "Their own" stands in opposition to "you":
"While partaking of the love-feast (compare [Jde
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#012)) with you," they are at the same
time "luxuriating in their own deceivings," or "deceits" (to which
latter clause answers [Jde 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#012), end:
Peter presents the positive side, "they luxuriate in their own
deceivings"; Jude, the negative, "feeding themselves without fear"). But
several of the oldest manuscripts, Vulgate, Syriac, and Sahidic Versions
read (as Jude), "In their own love-feasts": "their own" will then imply
that they pervert the love-feasts so as to make them subserve their own
self-indulgent purposes.

[2 Peter 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pe2 2:14</span></span>

full of adultery--literally, "full of an adulteress," as though they
carried about adulteresses always dwelling in their eyes: the eye being
the avenue of lust \[HORNEIUS\]. BENGEL makes the adulteress who fills
their eyes, to be "alluring desire."

that cannot cease--"that cannot be made to cease from sin."

beguiling--"laying baits for."

unstable--not firmly established in faith and piety.

heart--not only the eyes, which are the channel, but the heart, the
fountain head of lust. [Job 31:7](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#007),
"Mine heart walked after mine eyes."

covetous practices--The oldest manuscripts read singular,
"covetousness."

cursed children--rather as Greek, "children of curse," that is, devoted
to the curse. Cursing and covetousness, as in Balaam's case, often go
together: the curse he designed for Israel fell on Israel's foes and on
himself. True believers bless, and curse not, and so are blessed.

[2 Peter 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pe2 2:15</span></span>

have--Some of the seducers are spoken of as already come, others as yet
to come.

following--out: so the Greek.

the way-- ([Num 22:23](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#023), [Num
22:32](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#032); [Isa
56:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#011)).

son of Bosor--the same as Beor ([Num
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#005)). This word was adopted, perhaps,
because the kindred word Basar means flesh; and Balaam is justly termed
son of carnality, as covetous, and the enticer of Israel to lust.

loved the wages of unrighteousness--and therefore wished (in order to
gain them from Balak) to curse Israel whom God had blessed, and at last
gave the hellish counsel that the only way to bring God's curse on
Israel was to entice them to fleshly lust and idolatry, which often go
together.

[2 Peter 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pe2 2:16</span></span>

was rebuked--Greek, "had a rebuke," or conviction; an exposure of his
specious wickedness on his being tested (the root verb of the Greek noun
means to "convict on testing").

his--Greek, "his own": his own beast convicted him of his own iniquity.

ass--literally, "beast of burden"; the ass was the ordinary animal used
in riding in Palestine.

dumb--Greek, "voiceless-speaking in man's voice"; marking the marvellous
nature of the miracle.

forbade--literally, "hindered." It was not the words of the ass (for it
merely deprecated his beating it), but the miraculous fact of its
speaking at all, which withstood Balaam's perversity in desiring to go
after God had forbidden him in the first instance. Thus indirectly the
ass, and directly the angel, rebuked his worse than asinine obstinacy;
the ass turned aside at the sight of the angel, but Balaam, after God
had plainly said, Thou shalt not go, persevered in wishing to go for
gain; thus the ass, in act, forbade his madness. How awful a contrast--a
dumb beast forbidding an inspired prophet!

[2 Peter 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pe2 2:17</span></span>

([Jde 1:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#012).)

wells--"clouds" in Jude; both promising (compare [Pe2
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#019)) water, but yielding none; so
their "great swelling words" are found on trial to be but "vanity" ([Pe2
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#018)).

clouds--The oldest manuscripts and versions read, "mists," dark, and not
transparent and bright as "clouds" often are, whence the latter term is
applied sometimes to the saints; fit emblem of the children of darkness.
"Clouds" is a transcriber's correction from [Jde
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#012), where it is appropriate, "clouds
. . . without water" (promising what they do not perform); but not here,
"mists driven along by a tempest."

mist--blackness; "the chilling horror accompanying darkness" \[BENGEL\].

[2 Peter 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pe2 2:18</span></span>

allure--Greek, "lay baits for."

through--Greek, "in"; the lusts of the flesh being the element IN which
they lay their baits.

much wantonness--Greek, "by licentiousness"; the bait which they lay.

clean escaped--Greek, "really escaped." But the oldest manuscripts and
Vulgate read, "scarcely," or "for but a little time"; scarcely have they
escaped from them who live in error (the ungodly world), when they are
allured by these seducers into sin again ([Pe2
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#020)).

[2 Peter 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pe2 2:19</span></span>

promise . . . liberty--(Christian)--These promises are instances of
their "great swelling words" ([Pe2
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#018)). The liberty which they propose
is such as fears not Satan, nor loathes the flesh. Pauline language,
adopted by Peter here, and [Pe1 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#016);
see on [Pe1 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#016); (compare [Pe2
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#015); [Rom
6:16-22](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#016); [Rom
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#015), [Rom
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#021); [Gal
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#001), [Gal
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#013); compare [Joh
8:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#034)).

corruption--(See on [Pe2 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#012));
"destroyed . . . perish . . . corruption."

of whom--"by whatever . . . by the same," &c.

[2 Peter 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pe2 2:20</span></span>

after they--the seducers "themselves" have escaped ([Pe2
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#019); see on [Heb
6:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#004)).

pollutions--which bring "corruption" ([Pe2
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#019)).

through--Greek, "in."

knowledge--Greek, "full and accurate knowledge."

the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ--solemnly expressing in full the great
and gracious One from whom they fall.

latter end is worse . . . than the beginning--Peter remembers Christ's
words. "Worse" stands opposed to "better" ([Pe2
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#021)).

[2 Peter 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pe2 2:21</span></span>

the way of righteousness--"the way of truth" ([Pe2
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#002)). Christian doctrine, and "the
knowledge of the Lord and Saviour."

turn--back again; so the Greek.

from the holy commandment--the Gospel which enjoins holiness; in
opposition to their corruption. "Holy," not that it makes holy, but
because it ought to be kept inviolate \[TITTMANN\].

delivered--once for all; admitting no turning back.

[2 Peter 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pe2 2:22</span></span>

But--You need not wonder at the event; for dogs and swine they were
before, and dogs and swine they will continue. They "scarcely" ([Pe2
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#018)) have escaped from their filthy
folly, when they again are entangled in it. Then they seduce others who
have in like manner "for a little time escaped from them that live in
error" ([Pe2 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#018)). Peter often quoted
Proverbs in his First Epistle ([Pe1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#007); [Pe1
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#017); [Pe1
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#008), [Pe1
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#018)); another proof that both
Epistles come from the same writer.
