### [Ezekiel Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#001)

[Ezekiel 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 16:2</span></span>

DETAILED APPLICATION OF THE PARABOLICAL DELINEATION OF THE FIFTEENTH
CHAPTER TO JERUSALEM PERSONIFIED AS A DAUGHTER. (Eze. 16:1-63)

cause Jerusalem to know--Men often are so blind as not to perceive their
guilt which is patent to all. "Jerusalem" represents the whole kingdom
of Judah.

[Ezekiel 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 16:3</span></span>

birth . . . nativity--thy origin and birth; literally, "thy diggings"
(compare [Isa 51:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#001)) "and thy bringings
forth."

of . . . Canaan--in which Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob sojourned before
going to Egypt, and from which thou didst derive far more of thy innate
characteristics than from the virtues of those thy progenitors ([Eze
21:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#030)).

an Amorite . . . an Hittite--These, being the most powerful tribes,
stand for the whole of the Canaanite nations (compare [Jos
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#004); [Amo
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#009)), which were so abominably corrupt
as to have been doomed to utter extermination by God ([Lev
18:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#024), [Lev
18:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#028); [Deu
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#012)). Translate rather, "the Amorite
. . . the Canaanite," that is, these two tribes personified; their
wicked characteristics, respectively, were concentrated in the parentage
of Israel ([Gen 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#016)). "The Hittite"
is made their "mother"; alluding to Esau's wives, daughters of Heth,
whose ways vexed Rebekah ([Gen
26:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#034); [Gen
27:46](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#046)), but pleased the degenerate
descendants of Jacob, so that these are called, in respect of morals,
children of the Hittite (compare [Eze
16:45](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#045)).

[Ezekiel 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 16:4</span></span>

Israel's helplessness in her first struggling into national existence,
under the image of an infant ([Hos
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#003)) cast forth without receiving the
commonest acts of parental regard. Its very life was a miracle ([Exo
1:15-22](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#015)).

navel . . . not cut--Without proper attention to the navel cord, the
infant just born is liable to die.

neither . . . washed in water to supple thee--that is, to make the skin
soft. Rather, "for purification"; from an Arabic root \[MAURER\].
GESENIUS translates as the Margin, "that thou mightest (be presented to
thy parents to) be looked upon," as is customary on the birth of a
child.

salted--Anciently they rubbed infants with salt to make the skin firm.

[Ezekiel 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 16:5</span></span>

cast . . . in . . . open field--The exposure of infants was common in
ancient times.

to the loathing of thy person--referring to the unsightly aspect of the
exposed infant. FAIRBAIRN translates, "With contempt (or disdainful
indifference) of thy life."

[Ezekiel 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 16:6</span></span>

when I passed by--as if a traveller.

polluted in . . . blood--but PISCATOR, "ready to be trodden on."

I said--In contrast to Israel's helplessness stands God's omnipotent
word of grace which bids the outcast little one "live."

in thy blood--Though thou wast foul with blood, I said, "Live"
\[GROTIUS\]. "Live in thy blood," that is, Live, but live a life exposed
to many deaths, as was the case in the beginnings of Israel's national
existence, in order to magnify the grace of God \[CALVIN\]. The former
view is preferable. Spiritually, till the sinner is made sensible of his
abject helplessness, he will not appreciate the provisions of God's
grace.

[Ezekiel 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 16:7</span></span>

caused . . . to multiply--literally, "I . . . made thee a myriad."

bud of . . . field--the produce of the field. In two hundred fifty years
they increased from seventy-five persons to eight hundred thousand ([Act
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#014)) \[CALVIN\]. But see [Exo
12:37-38](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#037).

excellent ornaments--literally, "ornament of ornaments."

naked . . . bare-- ([Hos 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#003)).
Literally, "nakedness . . . bareness" itself; more emphatic.

[Ezekiel 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 16:8</span></span>

thy time of love--literally, "loves" (compare [Sol
2:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#010)). Thou wast of marriageable
age, but none was willing to marry thee, naked as thou wast. I then
regarded thee with a look of grace when the full time of thy deliverance
was come ([Gen 15:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#013); [Act
7:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#006)). It is not she that makes the
advance to God, but God to her; she has nothing to entitle her to such
notice, yet He regards her not with mere benevolence, but with love,
such as one cherishes to the person of his wife ([Sol
1:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#003); [Jer
31:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#003); [Mal
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#002)).

spread my skirt over thee--the mode of espousals ([Rut
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#009)). I betrothed thee ([Deu
4:37](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#037); [Deu
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#015); [Hos
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001)). The cloak is often used as a
bed coverlet in the East. God explains what He means, "I entered into .
. . covenant with thee," that is, at Sinai. So Israel became "the wife
of God's covenant" ([Isa 54:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#005); [Jer
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#014); [Hos
2:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#019); [Mal
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#014)).

thou . . . mine-- ([Exo 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005); [Jer
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#002)).

[Ezekiel 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 16:9</span></span>

washed I thee--as brides used to pass through a preparatory purification
([Est 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#012)). So Israel, before the
giving of the law at Sinai ([Exo
19:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#014)); "Moses sanctified the people,
and they washed their clothes." So believers ([Co1
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#011)).

oil--emblem of the Levitical priesthood, the type of Messiah ([Psa
45:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#007)).

[Ezekiel 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 16:10</span></span>

[Psa 45:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#013), similarly describes the
Church (Israel, the appointed mother of Christendom) adorned as a bride
(so [Isa 61:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#010)). It is Messiah who
provides the wedding garment ([Rev
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#018); [Rev
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#008)).

badgers' skin--tahash; others translate, "seal skins." They formed the
over-covering of the tabernacle, which was, as it were, the nuptial tent
of God and Israel ([Exo 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#014)), and
the material of the shoes worn by the Hebrews on festival days. (See on
[Exo 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#005)).

fine linen--used by the priests ([Lev
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#010)); emblem of purity.

[Ezekiel 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 16:11</span></span>

The marriage gifts to Rebekah ([Gen
24:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#022), [Gen
24:47](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#047)).

[Ezekiel 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 16:12</span></span>

jewel on thy forehead--rather, "a ring in thy nose" ([Isa
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#021)).

a crown--at once the badge of a bride, and of her being made a queen, as
being consort of the King; the very name Israel meaning "a prince of
God." So they are called "a kingdom of priests" ([Exo
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#006); compare [Rev
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006)). Though the external blessings
bestowed on Israel were great, yet not these, but the internal and
spiritual, form the main reference in the kingly marriage to which
Israel was advanced.

[Ezekiel 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 16:13</span></span>

flour . . . honey . . . oil--These three mixed form the sweetest cakes;
not dry bread and leeks as in Egypt. From raiment He passes to food
([Deu 32:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#013)).

exceeding beautiful-- [Psa 48:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#002), the
city; also, [Psa 29:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#002), the temple.

prosper into a kingdom--exercising empire over surrounding nations.

[Ezekiel 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 16:14</span></span>

thy renown . . . among . . . heathen--The theocracy reached its highest
point under Solomon, when distant potentates heard of his "fame" ([Kg1
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#001), &c.), for example, the queen of
Sheba, Hiram, &c. ([Lam 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#015)).

my comeliness--It was not thine own, but imparted by Me.

[Ezekiel 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 16:15</span></span>

Instead of attributing the glory of her privileges and gifts to God,
Israel prided herself on them as her own ([Deu
32:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#015); [Jer
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#004); [Mic
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#011)), and then wantonly devoted them
to her idols ([Hos 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#008); compare [Luk
15:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#012)).

playedst . . . harlot because of thy renown--"didst play the wanton upon
thy name" \[FAIRBAIRN\], namely, by allowing thy renown to lead thee
into idolatry and leagues with idolaters ([Isa
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#021); [Isa
57:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#008); [Jer
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#002), [Jer
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#006)). English Version is better,
"because of thy renown," that is, relying on it; answering to "thou
didst trust in thine own beauty."

his it was--Thy beauty was yielded up to every passer-by Israel's zest
for the worship of foul idols was but an anxiety to have the approbation
of heaven for their carnal lusts, of which the idols were the
personification; hence, too, their tendency to wander from Jehovah, who
was a restraint on corrupt nature.

[Ezekiel 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 16:16</span></span>

deckedst . . . with divers colours--or, "didst make . . . of divers
colors" \[FAIRBAIRN\]; the metaphor and the literal are here mixed. The
high places whereon they sacrificed to Astarte are here compared to
tents of divers colors, which an impudent harlot would spread to show
her house was open to all \[CALVIN\]. Compare as to "woven hangings for
Astarte" (the right translation for "grove") [Kg2
23:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#007).

the like . . . shall not come, neither shall . . . be--rather, "have not
come, nor shall be." These thy doings are unparalleled in the past, and
shall be so in the future.

[Ezekiel 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 16:17</span></span>

my gold . . . my silver-- ([Hag 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#008)).

images of men--rather, "of the phallus," the Hindu lingam, or membrum
virile \[HAVERNICK\], deified as the emblem of fecundity; man making his
lust his god. English Version, however, is appropriate; Israel being
represented as a woman playing the harlot with "male images," that is,
images of male gods, as distinguished from female deities.

[Ezekiel 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 16:18</span></span>

tookest thy . . . garments . . . coveredst them--that is, the idols, as
if an adulteress were to cover her paramours with garments which she had
received from the liberality of her husband.

my oil--the holy anointing oil sacred to God ([Exo
30:22-25](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#022)). Also that used in
sacrifices ([Lev 2:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#001)).

[Ezekiel 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eze 16:19</span></span>

My meat . . . I gave-- ([Hos 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#008)).

set it before them--as a minchah or "meat offering" ([Lev
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#001)).

a sweet savour--literally "a savor of rest," that is, whereby they might
be propitiated, and be at peace ("rest") with you; how ridiculous to
seek to propitiate gods of wood!

thus it was--The fact cannot be denied, for I saw it, and say it was so,
saith Jehovah.

[Ezekiel 16:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 16:20</span></span>

sons and . . . daughters borne unto me--Though "thy children," yet they
belong "unto Me," rather than to thee, for they were born under the
immutable covenant with Israel, which even Israel's sin could not set
aside, and they have received the sign of adoption as Mine, namely,
circumcision. This aggravates the guilt of sacrificing them to Molech.

to be devoured--not merely to pass through the fire, as sometimes
children were made to do ([Lev 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#021))
without hurt, but to pass through so as to be made the food of the flame
in honor of idols (see on [Isa 57:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#005);
[Jer 7:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#031); [Jer
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#005); [Jer
32:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#035)).

Is this of thy whoredoms a small matter, that thou hast slain my
children--rather, "Were thy whoredoms a small matter (that is, not
enough, but) that thou hast slain (that is, must also slay)," &c. As if
thy unchastity was not enough, thou hast added this unnatural and
sacrilegious cruelty ([Mic 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#007)).

[Ezekiel 16:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eze 16:22</span></span>

not remembered . . . youth--Forgetfulness of God's love is the source of
all sins. Israel forgot her deliverance by God in the infancy of her
national life. See [Eze 16:43](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#043), to
which [Eze 16:60](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#060) forms a lovely
contrast ([Jer 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#002); [Hos
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001)).

[Ezekiel 16:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eze 16:23</span></span>

woe, woe unto thee, &c.--This parenthetical exclamation has an awful
effect coming like a lightning flash of judgment amidst the black clouds
of Israel's guilt.

[Ezekiel 16:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">eze 16:24</span></span>

eminent place--rather, "a fornication-chamber," often connected with the
impure rites of idolatry; spiritual fornication, on "an eminent place,"
answering to "fornication-chamber," is mainly meant, with an allusion
also to the literal fornication associated with it ([Jer
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#020); [Jer
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#002)).

[Ezekiel 16:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">eze 16:25</span></span>

at every head of the way--in the most frequented places ([Pro
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#014)).

thy beauty . . . abhorred, . . . opened . . . feet to every one--The
wanton advances were all on Israel's part; the idolatrous nations
yielded to her nothing in return. She had yielded so much that, like a
worn-out prostitute, her tempters became weary of her. When the Church
lowers her testimony for God to the carnal tastes of the world, with a
view to conciliation, she loses everything and gains nothing.

[Ezekiel 16:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">eze 16:26</span></span>

fornication with . . . Egyptians--alliances with Egypt, cemented by
sharing their idolatries.

great of flesh--of powerful virile parts; figuratively for the gross and
lustful religion of Egypt (for example, Isis, &c.), which alone could
satisfy the abominable lust of Israel ([Eze
20:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#007); [Eze
23:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#019)).

to provoke me--wantonly and purposely.

[Ezekiel 16:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">eze 16:27</span></span>

The consequent judgments, which, however, proved of no avail in
reforming the people ([Isa 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#013); [Jer
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#003)).

delivered thee unto . . . Philistines-- ([Kg2
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#006); [Ch2
28:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#018)).

ashamed of thy lewd way--The Philistines were less wanton in idolatry,
in that they did not, like Israel, adopt the idols of every foreign
country but were content with their own ([Eze
16:57](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#057); [Jer
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#011)).

[Ezekiel 16:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">eze 16:28</span></span>

unsatiable--Not satisfied with whoredoms with neighbors, thou hast gone
off to the distant Assyrians, that is, hast sought a league with them,
and with it adopted their idolatries.

[Ezekiel 16:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">eze 16:29</span></span>

multiplied . . . fornication in . . . Canaan unto Chaldea--Thou hast
multiplied thy idolatries "in Canaan" by sending "unto Chaldea" to
borrow from thence the Chaldean rites, to add to the abominations
already practised "in Canaan," before the carrying away of Jehoiachin to
Chaldea. The name "Canaan" is used to imply that they had made Judea as
much the scene of abominations as it was in the days of the corrupt
Canaanites. The land had become utterly Canaanitish ([Eze
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#014), &c.).

[Ezekiel 16:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">eze 16:30</span></span>

weak . . . heart--Sin weakens the intellect ("heart") as, on the
contrary, "the way of the Lord is strength to the upright" ([Pro
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#029)).

[Ezekiel 16:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">eze 16:31</span></span>

Repetition of [Eze 16:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#024).

not . . . as . . . harlot . . . thou scornest hire--Unlike an ordinary
harlot thou dost prostitute thy person gratis, merely to satisfy thy
lust. JEROME translates, "Thou hast not been as a harlot in scorning
(that is, who ordinarily scorns) a hire offered," in order to get a
larger one: nay, thou hast offered hire thyself to thy lovers ([Eze
16:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#033)). But these verses show
English Version to be preferable, for they state that Israel prostituted
herself, not merely for any small reward without demanding more, but for
"no reward."

[Ezekiel 16:32](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">eze 16:32</span></span>

instead of her husband--referring to [Num
5:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#019), [Num
5:29](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#029). FAIRBAIRN translates, "whilst
under her husband."

[Ezekiel 16:33](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">eze 16:33</span></span>

Israel hired her paramours, instead of being, like other harlots, hired
by them; she also followed them without their following her.

[Ezekiel 16:35](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">eze 16:35</span></span>

Here begins the threat of wrath to be poured out on her.

[Ezekiel 16:36](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">eze 16:36</span></span>

filthiness--literally, "brass"; metaphor for the lowest part of the
person \[CALVIN\]. English Version is better: thy filthy lewdness is
poured out without restraint (compare [Jer
13:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#027)). As silver is an emblem of
purity, brass typifies "filthiness," because it easily contracts rust.
HENDERSON explains it, "Because thy money was lavished on thy lovers"
([Eze 16:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#031), [Eze
16:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#033)).

[Jer 2:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#034)).

[Ezekiel 16:37](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">eze 16:37</span></span>

thy lovers--the Chaldeans and the Assyrians. The law of retribution is
the more signally exemplified by God employing, as His instruments of
judgment on Israel, those very nations whose alliance and idols Israel
had so eagerly sought, besides giving her up to those who had been
always her enemies. "God will make him, who leaves God for the world,
disgraced even in the eyes of the world, and indeed the more so the
nearer he formerly stood to Himself" \[HENGSTENBERG\], ([Isa
47:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#003); [Jer
13:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#026); [Hos
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#012); [Nah
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#005)).

all . . . thou hast hated--the Edomites and Philistines; also Moab and
Ammon especially ([Deu 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#003)).

I . . . will discover thy nakedness--punishment in kind, as she had
"discovered her nakedness through whoredoms" ([Eze
16:36](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#036)); the sin and its penalty
corresponded. I will expose thee to public infamy.

[Ezekiel 16:38](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">eze 16:38</span></span>

judge thee, as women that break wedlock-- ([Lev
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#010); compare [Eze
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#002)). In the case of individual
adulteresses, stoning was the penalty ([Joh
8:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#004)). In the case of communities,
the sword. Also apostasy ([Deu 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#010))
and sacrificing children to Molech ([Lev
20:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#001)) incurred stoning. Thus the
penalty was doubly due to Israel; so the other which was decreed against
an apostate city ([Deu 13:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#015)) is
added, "they shall stone thee with stones and thrust thee through with .
. . swords." The Chaldeans hurled stones on Jerusalem at the siege and
slew with the sword on its capture.

shed blood . . . judged-- ([Gen 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#006)).

jealousy--image taken from the fury of a husband in jealousy shedding
the blood of an unfaithful wife, such as Israel had been towards God,
her husband spiritually. Literally, "I will make thee (to become) blood
of fury and jealousy."

[Ezekiel 16:39](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">eze 16:39</span></span>

thine eminent place--literally, "fornication-chamber" (see on [Eze
16:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#024)), the temple which Israel had
converted into a place of spiritual fornication with idols, to please
the Chaldeans ([Eze 23:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#014)).

strip thee of . . . clothes-- ([Eze
23:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#026); [Hos
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#003)). They shall dismantle thy city of
its walls.

fair jewels--literally, "vessels of thy fairness" or beauty; the vessels
of the temple \[GROTIUS\]. All the gifts wherewith God hath adorned thee
\[CALVIN\].

[Ezekiel 16:40](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">eze 16:40</span></span>

([Eze 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#010), [Eze

under Titus, [Luk 19:43-44](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#043).

[Ezekiel 16:41](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#041)

women--the surrounding Gentile nations to whom thou shalt be an object
of mocking ([Psa 137:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#007)).

I will cause thee to cease . . . harlot-- ([Eze
23:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#027)). Thou shalt no longer be able
to play the harlot through My judgments.

thou . . . shall give . . . no hire . . . any more--Thou shalt have none
to give.

[Ezekiel 16:42](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">eze 16:42</span></span>

my fury . . . rest--when My justice has exacted the full penalty
commensurate with thy awful guilt (see on [Eze
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#013)). It is not a mitigation of the
penalty that is here foretold, but such an utter destruction of all the
guilty that there shall be no need of further punishment \[CALVIN\].

[Ezekiel 16:43](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">eze 16:43</span></span>

([Eze 16:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#022); [Psa
78:42](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#042)). In gratitude for God's favors
to her in her early history.

fretted me-- ([Isa 63:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#010); [Eph
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#030)).

thou shalt not commit this lewdness above all thine abominations--that
is, this the wickedness (compare [Zac
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#008)), peculiarly hateful to God,
namely, spiritual unchastity or idolatry, over and "above" (that is,
besides) all thine other abominations. I will put it out of thy power to
commit it by cutting thee off. FAIRBAIRN translates, "I will not do what
is scandalous (namely, encouraging thee in thy sin by letting it pass
with impunity) upon all thine abominations"; referring to [Lev
19:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#029), the conduct of a father who
encouraged his daughter in harlotry. English Version is much better.

[Ezekiel 16:44](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">eze 16:44</span></span>

As . . . mother . . . her daughter--"Is," and "so is," are not in the
original; the ellipsis gives the proverb (but two words in the Hebrew)
epigrammatic brevity. Jerusalem proved herself a true daughter of the
Hittite mother in sin ([Eze 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#003)).

[Ezekiel 16:45](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#045)

[Rom 1:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#030)); therefore the knowledge of
the true God had originally been in Canaan, handed down from Noah (hence
we find Melchisedek, king of Salem, in Canaan, "priest of the most high
God," [Gen 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#018)), but Canaan
apostatized from it; this was what constituted the blackness of the
Canaanites' guilt.

loathed . . . children--whom she put to death in honor of Saturn; a
practice common among the PhÅ“nicians.

sister of thy sisters--Thou art akin in guilt to Samaria and Sodom, to
which thou art akin by birth. Moab and Ammon, the incestuous children of
Lot, nephew of Abraham, Israel's progenitor, had their origin from
Sodom; so Sodom might be called Judah's sister. Samaria, answering to
the ten tribes of Israel, is, of course, sister to Judah.

[Ezekiel 16:46](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#046)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">eze 16:46</span></span>

elder sister . . . Samaria--older than Sodom, to whom Judah was less
nearly related by kindred than she was to Samaria. Sodom is therefore
called her younger sister; Samaria, her "elder sister" \[GROTIUS\].
Samaria is called the "elder," because in a moral respect more nearly
related to Judah \[FAIRBAIRN\]. Samaria had made the calves at Dan and
Beth-el in imitation of the cherubim.

her daughters--the inferior towns subject to Samaria (compare [Num
21:25](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#025), Margin).

left--The Orientals faced the east in marking the directions of the sky;
thus the north was "left," the south "right."

Sodom . . . daughters--Ammon and Moab, offshoots from Sodom; also the
towns subject to it.

[Ezekiel 16:47](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#047)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">eze 16:47</span></span>

their abominations--Milcom and Chemosh, the "abominations of Ammon and
Moab" ([Kg1 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#005), [Kg1
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#007)).

[Ezekiel 16:48](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#048)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">eze 16:48</span></span>

Sodom-- ([Mat 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#024)). Judah's guilt
was not positively, but relatively, greater than Sodom's; because it was
in the midst of such higher privileges, and such solemn warnings; a
fortiori, the guilt of unbelievers in the midst of the highest of all
lights, namely, the Gospel, is the greatest.

[Ezekiel 16:49](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#049)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">eze 16:49</span></span>

pride--inherited by Moab, her offspring ([Isa
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#006); [Jer
48:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#026)), and by Ammon ([Jer
49:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#004)). God, the heart-searcher, here
specifies as Sodom's sin, not merely her notorious lusts, but the secret
spring of them, "pride" flowing from "fullness of bread," caused by the
fertility of the soil ([Gen 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#010)),
and producing "idleness."

abundance of idleness--literally, "the secure carelessness of ease" or
idleness.

neither did she strengthen . . . the poor--Pride is always cruel; it
arrogates to itself all things, and despises brethren, for whose needs
it therefore has no feeling; as Moab had not for the outcast Jews ([Isa
16:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#003); [Jer
48:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#027); [Luk
16:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#019); [Jam

haughty--puffed up with prosperity.

abomination before me--"sinners before the Lord" ([Gen
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#013)); said of those whose sin is so
heinous as to cry out to God for immediate judgments; presumptuous sins,
daring God to the face ([Gen 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#020);
[Gen 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#005)).

I took them away-- ([Gen 19:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#024)).

as I saw good--rather, "according to what I saw"; referring to [Gen
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#021), where God says, "I will go
down, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of
it which is come unto Me."

[Ezekiel 16:51](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#051)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">eze 16:51</span></span>

Samaria--the kingdom of the ten tribes of Israel less guilty than Judah;
for Judah betrayed greater ingratitude, having greater privileges,
namely, the temple, the priesthood, and the regular order of kings.

justified thy sisters--made them appear almost innocent by comparison
with thy guilt ([Jer 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#011); [Mat
12:41-42](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#041)).

[Ezekiel 16:52](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#052)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">eze 16:52</span></span>

Thou . . . which hast judged . . . bear thine own-- ([Mat
7:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#001); [Rom
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#001), [Rom
2:17-23](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#017)). Judah had judged Sodom
(representing "the heathen nations") and Samaria (Israel), saying they
were justly punished, as if she herself was innocent ([Luk
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#002)).

thy shame--ignominious punishment.

[Ezekiel 16:53](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#053)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">eze 16:53</span></span>

Here follows a promise of restoration. Even the sore chastisements
coming on Judah would fail to reform its people; God's returning
goodness alone would effect this, to show how entirely of grace was to
be their restoration. The restoration of her erring sisters is mentioned
before hers, even as their punishment preceded her punishment; so all
self-boasting is excluded \[FAIRBAIRN\]. "Ye shall, indeed, at some time
or other return, but Moab and Ammon shall return with you, and some of
the ten tribes" \[GROTIUS\].

bring again . . . captivity--that is, change the affliction into
prosperity (so [Job 42:10](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#010)). Sodom
itself was not so restored ([Jer
20:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#016)), but Ammon and Moab (her
representatives, as sprung from Lot who dwelt in Sodom) were ([Jer
48:47](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#047); [Jer
49:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#006)); probably most of the ten tribes
and the adjoining nations, Ammon and Moab, &c., were in part restored
under Cyrus; but the full realization of the restoration is yet future;
the heathen nations to be brought to Christ being typified by "Sodom,"
whose sins they now reproduce ([Deu
32:32](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#032)).

captivity of thy captives--literally, "of thy captivities." However, the
gracious promise rather begins with the "nevertheless" ([Eze
16:60](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#060)), not here; for [Eze
16:59](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#059) is a threat, not a promise. The
sense here thus is, Thou shalt be restored when Sodom and Samaria are,
but not till then ([Eze 16:55](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#055)), that
is, never. This applies to the guilty who should be utterly destroyed
([Eze 16:41-42](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#041)); but it does not
contradict the subsequent promise of restoration to their posterity
([Num 14:29-33](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#029)), and to the elect
remnant of grace \[CALVIN\].

[Ezekiel 16:54](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#054)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">eze 16:54</span></span>

bear thine own shame--by being put on a level with those whom thou hast
so much despised.

thou art a comfort unto them--since they see thee as miserable as
themselves. It is a kind of melancholy "comfort" to those chastised to
see others as sorely punished as themselves ([Eze
14:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#022)).

[Ezekiel 16:55](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#055)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_055">eze 16:55</span></span>

(See on [Eze 16:53](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#053)).

[Ezekiel 16:56](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#056)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_056">eze 16:56</span></span>

Sodom was not mentioned--literally, "was not for a report." Thou didst
not deign to mention her name as if her case could possibly apply as a
warning to thee, but it did apply ([Pe2
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#006)).

[Ezekiel 16:57](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#057)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_057">eze 16:57</span></span>

Before thy wickedness was discovered--manifested to all, namely, by the
punishment inflicted on thee.

thy reproach of . . . Syria and . . . Philistines--the indignity and
injuries done thee by Syria and the Philistines ([Kg2

28:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#018); [Isa

borne thy lewdness--that is, the punishment of it ([Eze
23:49](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#049)). I do not treat thee with
excessive rigor. Thy sin and punishment are exactly commensurate.

[Ezekiel 16:59](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#059)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_059">eze 16:59</span></span>

the oath--the covenant between God and Israel ([Deu
29:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#012), [Deu
29:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#014)). As thou hast despised it, so
will I despise thee. No covenant is one-sided; where Israel broke faith,
God's promise of favor ceased.

[Ezekiel 16:60](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#060)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_060">eze 16:60</span></span>

The promise here bursts forth unexpectedly like the sun from the dark
clouds. With all her forgetfulness of God, God still remembers her;
showing that her redemption is altogether of grace. Contrast "I will
remember," with "thou hast not remembered" ([Eze
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#022), [Eze
16:43](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#043)); also "My covenant," with "Thy
covenant" ([Eze 16:61](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#061); [Psa
106:45](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#045)); then the effect produced on
her is ([Eze 16:63](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#063)) "that thou mayest
remember." God's promise was one of promise and of grace. The law, in
its letter, was Israel's (thy) covenant, and in this restricted view was
long subsequent ([Gal 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#017)). Israel
interpreted it as a covenant of works, which she while boasting of,
failed to fulfil, and so fell under its condemnation ([Co2
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#003), [Co2
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#006)). The law, in its spirit, contains
the germ of the Gospel; the New Testament is the full development of the
Old, the husk of the outer form being laid aside when the inner spirit
was fulfilled in Messiah. God's covenant with Israel, in the person of
Abraham, was the reason why, notwithstanding all her guilt, mercy was,
and is, in store for her. Therefore the heathen or Gentile nations must
come to her for blessings, not she to them.

everlasting covenant-- ([Eze 37:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#026);
[Sa2 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#005); [Isa
55:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#003)). The temporary forms of the law
were to be laid aside, that in its permanent and "everlasting" spirit it
might be established ([Jer 31:31-37](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#031);
[Jer 32:40](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#040); [Jer
50:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#004); [Heb
8:8-13](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#008)).

[Ezekiel 16:61](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#061)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_061">eze 16:61</span></span>

thou shalt remember--It is God who first remembers her before she
remembers Him and her own ways before Him ([Eze
16:60](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#060); [Eze
20:43](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#043); [Eze
36:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#031)).

ashamed--the fruit of repentance ([Co2
7:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#010)). None please God unless those
who displease themselves; a foretaste of the Gospel ([Luk
18:9-14](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#009)).

I will give them unto thee for daughters-- ([Isa
54:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#001); [Isa
60:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#003); [Gal
4:26](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#026), &c.). All the heathen nations,
not merely Sodom and Samaria, are meant by "thy sisters, elder and
younger." In Jerusalem first, individual believers were gathered into
the elect Church. From Jerusalem the Gospel went forth to gather in
individuals of the Gentiles; and Judah with Jerusalem shall also be the
first nation which, as such, shall be converted to Christ; and to her
the other nations shall attach themselves as believers in Messiah,
Jerusalem's King ([Psa 110:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#002); [Isa
2:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002)). "The king's daughter" in [Psa
45:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#012) is Judah; her "companions,"
as "the daughter of Tyre," are the nations given to her as converts,
here called "daughters."

not by thy covenant--This does not set aside the Old Testament in its
spirit, but in its mere letter on which the Jews had rested, while they
broke it: the latter ("thy covenant") was to give place to God's
covenant of grace and promise in Christ who "fulfilled" the law. God
means, "not that thou on thy part hast stood to the covenant, but that
'I am the Lord, I change not' ([Mal
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#006)) from My original love to thee in
thy youth" (see [Rom 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#003)).

[Ezekiel 16:62](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#062)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_062">eze 16:62</span></span>

([Hos 2:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#019)).

thou shalt know that I am the Lord--not, as elsewhere, by the judgments
falling on thee, but by My so marvellously restoring thee through grace.

[Ezekiel 16:63](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#063)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_063">eze 16:63</span></span>

never open thy mouth--in vindication, or even palliation, of thyself, or
expostulation with God for His dealings ([Rom
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#019)), when thou seest thine own
exceeding unworthiness, and My superabounding grace which has so
wonderfully overcome with love thy sin ([Rom
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#020)). "If we would judge ourselves,
we should not be judged" ([Co1 11:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#031)).

all that thou hast done--enhancing the grace of God which has pardoned
so many and so great sins. Nothing so melts into love and humility as
the sense of the riches of God's pardoning grace ([Luk
7:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#047)).

The date of the prophecy is between the sixth month of Zedekiah's sixth
year of reign and the fifth month of the seventh year after the carrying
away of Jehoiachin, that is, five years before the destruction of
Jerusalem \[HENDERSON\].
