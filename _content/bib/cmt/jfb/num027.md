### [Numbers Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#001)

[Numbers 27:3](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">num 27:3</span></span>

THE DAUGHTERS OF ZELOPHEHAD ASK FOR AN INHERITANCE. ([Num
27:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#001))

Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not . . . in the company
of . . . Korah--This declaration might be necessary because his death
might have occurred about the time of that rebellion; and especially
because, as the children of these conspirators were involved along with
their fathers in the awful punishment, their plea appeared the more
proper and forcible that their father did not die for any cause that
doomed his family to lose their lives or their inheritance.

died in his own sin--that is, by the common law of mortality to which
men, through sin, are subject.

[Numbers 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">num 27:4</span></span>

Give unto us a possession among the brethren of our father--Those young
women perceived that the males only in families had been registered in
the census. Because there were none in their household, their family was
omitted. So they made known their grievance to Moses, and the
authorities conjoined with him in administering justice. The case was
important; and as the peculiarity of daughters being the sole members of
a family would be no infrequent or uncommon occurrence, the law of
inheritance, under divine authority, was extended not only to meet all
similar cases, but other cases also--such as when there were no children
left by the proprietor, and no brothers to succeed him. A distribution
of the promised land was about to be made; and it is interesting to know
the legal provision made in these comparatively rare cases for
preserving a patrimony from being alienated to another tribe. (See on
[Num 36:5](../../../bib/kjv/num036.htm#005)).

[Numbers 27:12](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">num 27:12</span></span>

MOSES BEING TOLD OF HIS APPROACHING DEATH, ASKS FOR A SUCCESSOR. ([Num
27:12-17](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#012))

The Lord said unto Moses, Get thee up into this mount Abarim, and see
the land--Although the Israelites were now on the confines of the
promised land, Moses was not privileged to cross the Jordan, but died on
one of the Moabitic range of mountains, to which the general name of
Abarim was given ([Num 33:47](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#047)). The
privation of this great honor was owing to the unhappy conduct he had
manifested in the striking of the rock at Meribah \[[Num
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#012)\]; and while the pious leader
submitted with meek acquiescence to the divine decree, he evinced the
spirit of genuine patriotism in his fervent prayers for the appointment
of a worthy and competent successor \[[Num
27:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#015)\].

[Numbers 27:16](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">num 27:16</span></span>

God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over the congregation--The
request was most suitably made to God in this character, as the Author
of all the intellectual gifts and moral graces with which men are
endowed, and who can raise up qualified persons for the most arduous
duties and the most difficult situations.

[Numbers 27:18](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">num 27:18</span></span>

JOSHUA APPOINTED TO SUCCEED HIM. ([Num
27:18-23](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#018))

Take thee Joshua . . . a man in whom is the spirit, and lay thine hand
upon him--A strong testimony is here borne to the personality of the
divine Spirit--the imposition of hands was an ancient ceremony. (See
[Gen 48:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#014); [Lev
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#004); [Ti1
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#014)).

[Numbers 27:20](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">num 27:20</span></span>

Thou shalt put some of thine honour upon him--In the whole history of
Israel there arose no prophet or ruler in all respects like unto Moses
till the Messiah appeared, whose glory eclipsed all. But Joshua was
honored and qualified in an eminent degree, through the special service
of the high priest, who asked counsel for him after the judgment of Urim
before the Lord.
