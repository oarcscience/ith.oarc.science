### [1 Chronicles Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#001)

[1 Chronicles 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 14:1</span></span>

HIRAM'S KINDNESS TO DAVID; DAVID'S FELICITY. ([Ch1
14:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#001))

Now Hiram king of Tyre--\[See on [Sa2
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#011)\]. The alliance with this
neighboring king, and the important advantages derived from it, were
among the most fortunate circumstances in David's reign. The providence
of God appeared concurrent with His promise in smoothing the early
course of his reign. Having conquered the Jebusites and made Zion the
royal residence, he had now, along with internal prosperity, established
an advantageous treaty with a neighboring prince; and hence, in
immediate connection with the mention of this friendly league, it is
said, "David perceived that the Lord had confirmed him king over
Israel."

[1 Chronicles 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch1 14:2</span></span>

his kingdom was lifted up on high, because of his people Israel--This is
an important truth, that sovereigns are invested with royal honor and
authority, not for their own sakes so much as for that of their people.
But while it is true of all kings, it was especially applicable to the
monarchs of Israel, and even David was made to know that all his glory
and greatness were given only to fit him, as the minister of God, to
execute the divine purposes towards the chosen people.

[1 Chronicles 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch1 14:3</span></span>

HIS WIVES. ([Ch1 14:3-7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#003))

David took more wives at Jerusalem--(See on [Sa2
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#005)). His concubines are mentioned
([Ch1 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#009)), where also is given a list
of his children ([Ch1 14:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#005)), and
those born in Jerusalem ([Sa2
5:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#014)). In that, however, the names
of Eliphalet and Nogah do not occur, and Beeliada appears to be the same
as Eliada.

[1 Chronicles 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch1 14:8</span></span>

HIS VICTORIES OVER THE PHILISTINES. ([Ch1
14:8-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#008))

all the Philistines went up to seek David--in the hope of accomplishing
his ruin (for so the phrase is used, [Sa1
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#015); [Sa1
24:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#002)) before his throne was
consolidated. Their hostility arose, both from a belief that his
patriotism would lead him, ere long, to wipe out the national dishonor
at Gilboa, and by fear, that in any invasion of their country, his
thorough knowledge of their weak points would give him superior
advantages. They resolved, therefore, to surprise and crush him before
he was fairly seated on his throne.

[1 Chronicles 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch1 14:11</span></span>

they came up to Baal-perazim; and David smote them there--In an
engagement fought at Mount Perazim ([Isa
28:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#021)), in the valley of Rephaim, a
few miles west of Jerusalem, the Philistines were defeated and put to
flight.

[1 Chronicles 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch1 14:12</span></span>

when they had left their gods--(See on [Sa2
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#021)).

[1 Chronicles 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch1 14:13</span></span>

the Philistines yet again spread themselves--They renewed the campaign
the next season, taking the same route. David, according to divine
directions, did not confront them.

[1 Chronicles 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch1 14:14</span></span>

Go not up after them--The text in [Sa2
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#023), more correctly has, "Go not up."

turn away from them--that is, by stealing round a baca-grove, come upon
their rear.

[1 Chronicles 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch1 14:15</span></span>

for God is gone forth before thee--"a sound of going in the tops of the
mulberry trees," that is, the rustling of the leaves by a strong breeze
suddenly rising, was the sign by which David was divinely apprised of
the precise moment for the attack. The impetuosity of his onset was like
the gush of a pent-up torrent, which sweeps away all in its course; and
in allusion to this incident the place got its name.

[1 Chronicles 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch1 14:16</span></span>

from Gibeon . . . to Gazer--Geba or Gibea ([Sa2
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#025)), now Yefa, in the province of
Judah. The line from this to Gazer was intersected by the roads which
led from Judah to the cities of the Philistines. To recover possession
of it, therefore, as was effected by this decisive battle, was
equivalent to setting free the whole mountain region of Judah as far as
their most westerly slope \[BERTHEAU\].
