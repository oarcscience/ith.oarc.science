### [Psalms Chapter 87](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#001)

[Psalms 87:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 87:1</span></span>

This triumphal song was probably occasioned by the same event as the
forty-sixth \[see on [Psa 46:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#001),
title\]. The writer celebrates the glory of the Church, as the means of
spiritual blessing to the nation. ([Psa
87:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#001))

His--that is, God's

foundation--or, what He has founded, that is, Zion ([Isa
14:32](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#032)).

is in the holy mountains--the location of Zion, in the wide sense, for
the capital, or Jerusalem, being on several hills.

[Psalms 87:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#002)

gates--for the enclosures, or city to which they opened ([Psa
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#014); [Psa
122:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#002); compare [Psa
132:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#013)).

[Psalms 87:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 87:3</span></span>

spoken of thee--or, "in thee," that is, the city of God ([Psa
46:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#004); [Psa
48:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#002)).

[Psalms 87:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 87:4</span></span>

This is what is spoken by God.

to them . . . me--literally, "for My knowers," they are true worshippers
([Psa 36:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#010); [Isa
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#021)). These are mentioned as
specimens.

this--that is, nation

was born there--Of each it is said, "This was born," or is a native of
Zion, spiritually.

[Psalms 87:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 87:5</span></span>

The writer resumes--

This and that man--literally, "man and man," or many ([Gen
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#010); [Exo
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#010), [Exo
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#014)), or all ([Isa
44:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#005); [Gal
3:28](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#028)).

the highest . . . her--God is her protector.

[Psalms 87:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 87:6</span></span>

The same idea is set forth under the figure of a register made by God
(compare [Isa 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#003)).

[Psalms 87:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 87:7</span></span>

As in a great procession of those thus written up, or registered,
seeking Zion ([Isa 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#003); [Jer
50:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#005)), "the singers" and "players," or
pipers, shall precede.

all my springs--So each shall say, "All my sources of spiritual joy are
in Thee" ([Psa 46:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#004); [Psa
84:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#006)).
