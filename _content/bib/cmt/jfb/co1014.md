### [1 Corinthians Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#001)

[1 Corinthians 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co1 14:1</span></span>

SUPERIORITY OF PROPHECY OVER TONGUES. (1Co. 14:1-25)

Follow after charity--as your first and chief aim, seeing that it is
"the greatest" ([Co1 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#013)).

and desire--Translate, "Yet (as a secondary aim) desire zealously (see
on [Co1 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#031)) spiritual gifts."

but rather--"but chiefly that ye may prophesy" (speak and exhort under
inspiration) ([Pro 29:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#018); [Act
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#001); [Th1
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#020)), whether as to future events,
that is, strict prophecy, or explaining obscure parts of Scripture,
especially the prophetical Scriptures or illustrating and setting forth
questions of Christian doctrine and practice. Our modern preaching is
the successor of prophecy, but without the inspiration. Desire zealously
this (prophecy) more than any other spiritual gift; or in preference to
"tongues" ([Co1 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#002), &c.) \[BENGEL\].

[1 Corinthians 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co1 14:2</span></span>

speaketh . . . unto God--who alone understands all languages.

no man understandeth--generally speaking; the few who have the gift of
interpreting tongues are the exception.

in the spirit--as opposed to "the understanding" ([Co1
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#014)).

mysteries--unintelligible to the hearers, exciting their wonder, rather
than instructing them. Corinth, being a mart resorted to by merchants
from Asia, Africa, and Europe, would give scope amidst its mixed
population for the exercise of the gift of tongues; but its legitimate
use was in an audience understanding the tongue of the speaker, not, as
the Corinthians abused it, in mere display.

[1 Corinthians 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co1 14:3</span></span>

But--on the other hand.

edification--of which the two principal species given are "exhortation"
to remove sluggishness, "comfort" or consolation to remove sadness
\[BENGEL\]. Omit "to."

[1 Corinthians 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co1 14:4</span></span>

edifieth himself--as he understands the meaning of what the particular
"tongue" expresses; but "the church," that is, the congregation, does
not.

[1 Corinthians 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co1 14:5</span></span>

Translate, "Now I wish you all to speak with tongues (so far am I from
thus speaking through having any objection to tongues), but rather IN
ORDER THAT (as my ulterior and higher wish for you) ye should prophesy."
Tongues must therefore mean languages, not ecstatic, unintelligible
rhapsodie (as NEANDER fancied): for Paul could never "wish" for the
latter in their behalf.

greater--because more useful.

except he interpret--the unknown tongue which he speaks, "that the
Church may receive edifying (building up)."

[1 Corinthians 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co1 14:6</span></span>

Translate, "But now"; seeing there is no edification without
interpretation.

revelation . . . prophesying--corresponding one to the other;
"revelation" being the supernatural unveiling of divine truths to man,
"prophesying" the enunciation to men of such revelations. So "knowledge"
corresponds to "doctrine," which is the gift of teaching to others our
knowledge. As the former pair refers to specially revealed mysteries, so
the latter pair refers to the general obvious truths of salvation,
brought from the common storehouse of believers.

[1 Corinthians 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co1 14:7</span></span>

Translate, "And things without life-giving sound, whether pipe or harp,
YET (notwithstanding their giving sound) if they give not a distinction
in the tones (that is, notes) how?" &c.

what is piped or harped--that is, what tune is played on the pipe or
harp.

[1 Corinthians 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co1 14:8</span></span>

Translate, "For if also," an additional step in the argument.

uncertain sound--having no definite meaning: whereas it ought to be so
marked that one succession of notes on the trumpet should summon the
soldiers to attack; another, to retreat; another, to some other
evolution.

[1 Corinthians 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co1 14:9</span></span>

So . . . ye--who have life; as opposed to "things without life" ([Co1
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#007)).

by the tongue--the language which ye speak in.

ye shall speak--Ye will be speaking into the air, that is, in vain ([Co1
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#026)).

[1 Corinthians 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co1 14:10</span></span>

it may be--that is, perhaps, speaking by conjecture. "It may chance"
([Co1 15:37](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#037)).

so many--as may be enumerated by investigators of such matters. Compare
"so much," used generally for a definite number left undefined ([Act
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#008); also [Sa2
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#008)).

kinds of voices--kinds of articulate speech.

without signification--without articulate voice (that is, distinct
meaning). None is without its own voice, or mode of speech, distinct
from the rest.

[1 Corinthians 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co1 14:11</span></span>

Therefore--seeing that none is without meaning.

a barbarian--a foreigner ([Act 28:2](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#002)).
Not in the depreciatory sense as the term is now used, but one speaking
a foreign language.

[1 Corinthians 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co1 14:12</span></span>

zealous--emulously desirous.

spiritual gifts--literally, "spirits"; that is, emanations from the one
Spirit.

seek that ye may excel to--Translate, "Seek them, that ye may abound in
them to the edifying," &c.

[1 Corinthians 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co1 14:13</span></span>

Explain, "Let him who speaketh with a tongue \[unknown\] in his prayer
(or, when praying) strive that he may interpret" \[ALFORD\]. This
explanation of "pray" is needed by its logical connection with "prayer
in an unknown tongue" ([Co1 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#014)).
Though his words be unintelligible to his hearers, let him in them pray
that he may obtain the gift of interpreting, which will make them
"edifying" to "the church" ([Co1
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#012)).

[1 Corinthians 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co1 14:14</span></span>

spirit--my higher being, the passive object of the Holy Spirit's
operations, and the instrument of prayer in the unknown tongue,
distinguished from the "understanding," the active instrument of thought
and reasoning; which in this case must be "unfruitful" in edifying
others, since the vehicle of expression is unintelligible to them. On
the distinction of soul or mind and spirit, see [Eph
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#023); [Heb
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#012).

[1 Corinthians 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co1 14:15</span></span>

What is it then?--What is my determination thereupon?

and--rather as Greek, "but"; I will not only pray with my spirit, which
([Co1 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#014)) might leave the
understanding unedified, BUT with the understanding also \[ALFORD and
ELLICOTT\].

pray with the understanding also--and, by inference, I will keep silence
altogether if I cannot pray with the understanding (so as to make myself
understood by others). A prescient warning, mutatis mutandis, against
the Roman and Greek practice of keeping liturgies in dead languages,
which long since have become unintelligible to the masses; though their
forefathers spoke them at a time when those liturgies were framed for
general use.

[1 Corinthians 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co1 14:16</span></span>

Else . . . thou--He changes from the first person, as he had just
expressed his own resolution, "I will pray with the understanding,"
whatever "thou" doest.

bless--the highest kind of prayer.

occupieth the room of the unlearned--one who, whatever other gifts he
may possess, yet, as wanting the gift of interpretation, is reduced by
the speaking in an unknown tongue to the position of one unlearned, or
"a private person."

say Amen--Prayer is not a vicarious duty done by others for us; as in
Rome's liturgies and masses. We must join with the leader of the prayers
and praises of the congregation, and say aloud our responsive "Amen" in
assent, as was the usage of the Jewish ([Deu
27:15-26](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#015); [Neh
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#006)) and Christian primitive churches
\[JUSTIN MARTYR, Apology, 2. 97\].

[1 Corinthians 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">co1 14:17</span></span>

givest thanks--The prayers of the synagogue were called "eulogies,"
because to each prayer was joined a thanksgiving. Hence the prayers of
the Christian Church also were called blessings and giving of thanks.
This illustrates [Col 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#002); [Th1
5:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#017). So the Kaddisch and Keduscha,
the synagogue formulÃ&brvbr; of "hallowing" the divine "name" and of
prayer for the "coming of God's kingdom," answer to the Church's Lord's
Prayer, repeated often and made the foundation on which the other
prayers are built \[TERTULLIAN, Prayer\].

[1 Corinthians 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">co1 14:18</span></span>

tongues--The oldest manuscripts have the singular, "in a tongue
\[foreign\]."

[1 Corinthians 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">co1 14:19</span></span>

I had rather--The Greek verb more literally expresses this meaning, "I
WISH to speak five words with my understanding (rather) than ten
thousand words in an unknown tongue"; even the two thousandth part of
ten thousand. The Greek for "I would rather," would be a different verb.
Paul would NOT wish at all to speak "ten thousand words in an unknown
tongue."

[1 Corinthians 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">co1 14:20</span></span>

Brethren--an appellation calculated to conciliate their favorable
reception of his exhortation.

children in understanding--as preference of gifts abused to
nonedification would make you (compare [Co1
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#001); [Mat
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#016); [Rom
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#019); [Eph
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#014)). The Greek for "understanding"
expresses the will of one's spirit, [Rom
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#006) (it is not found elsewhere); as
the "heart" is the will of the "soul." The same Greek is used for
"minded" in [Rom 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#006).

men--full-grown. Be childlike, not childish.

[1 Corinthians 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">co1 14:21</span></span>

In the law--as the whole Old Testament is called, being all of it the
law of God. Compare the citation of the Psalms as the "law," [Joh
10:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#034). Here the quotation is from [Isa
28:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#011), where God virtually says of
Israel, This people hear Me not, though I speak to. them in the language
with which they are familiar; I will therefore speak to them in other
tongues, namely, those of the foes whom I will send against them; but
even then they will not hearken to Me; which Paul thus applies, Ye see
that it is a penalty to be associated with men of a strange tongue, yet
ye impose this on the Church \[GROTIUS\]; they who speak in foreign
tongues are like "children" just "weaned from the milk" ([Isa
28:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#009)), "with stammering lips" speaking
unintelligibly to the hearers, appearing ridiculous ([Isa
28:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#014)), or as babbling drunkards ([Act
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#013)), or madmen ([Co1
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#023)).

[1 Corinthians 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">co1 14:22</span></span>

Thus from Isaiah it appears, reasons Paul, that "tongues" (unknown and
uninterpreted) are not a sign mainly intended for believers (though at
the conversion of Cornelius and the Gentiles with him, tongues were
vouchsafed to him and them to confirm their faith), but mainly to be a
condemnation to those, the majority, who, like Israel in Isaiah's day,
reject the sign and the accompanying message. Compare "yet . . . will
they not hear Me" ([Co1 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#021)). "Sign"
is often used for a condemnatory sign ([Eze
4:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#003); [Mat
12:39-42](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#039)). Since they will not
understand, they shall not understand.

prophesying . . . not for them that believe not, but . . . believe--that
is, prophesying has no effect on them that are radically and obstinately
like Israel ([Isa 28:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#011)),
unbelievers, but on them that are either in receptivity or in fact
believers; it makes believers of those not wilfully unbelievers ([Co1
14:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#024); [Rom
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#017)), and spiritually nourishes
those that already believe.

[1 Corinthians 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">co1 14:23</span></span>

whole . . . all . . . tongues--The more there are assembled, and the
more that speak in unknown tongues, the more will the impression be
conveyed to strangers "coming in" from curiosity ("unbelievers"), or
even from a better motive ("unlearned"), that the whole body of
worshippers is a mob of fanatical "madmen"; and that "the Church is like
the company of builders of Babel after the confusion of tongues, or like
the cause tried between two deaf men before a deaf judge, celebrated in
the Greek epigram" \[GROTIUS\].

unlearned--having some degree of faith, but not gifts \[BENGEL\].

[1 Corinthians 14:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">co1 14:24</span></span>

all--one by one ([Co1 14:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#031)).

prophesy--speak the truth by the Spirit intelligibly, and not in
unintelligible tongues.

one--"anyone." Here singular; implying that this effect, namely,
conviction by all, would be produced on anyone, who might happen to
enter. In [Co1 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#023) the plural is
used; "unlearned or unbelievers"; implying that however many there might
be, not one would profit by the tongues; yea, their being many would
confirm them in rejecting the sign, as many unbelieving men together
strengthen one another in unbelief; individuals are more easily won
\[BENGEL\].

convinced--convicted in conscience; said of the "one that believeth not"
([Joh 16:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#008)).

judged--His secret character is opened out. "Is searched into"
\[ALFORD\]. Said of the "one unlearned" (compare [Co1
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#015)).

[1 Corinthians 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">co1 14:25</span></span>

And thus--omitted in the oldest manuscripts and versions.

secrets of his heart made manifest--He sees his own inner character
opened out by the sword of the Spirit ([Heb
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#012); [Jam
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#023)), the word of God, in the hand of
him who prophesieth. Compare the same effect produced on Nebuchadnezzar
([Dan 2:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#030) and end of [Dan
2:47](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#047)). No argument is stronger for the
truth of religion than its manifestation of men to themselves in their
true character. Hence hearers even now often think the preacher must
have aimed his sermon particularly at them.

and so--convicted at last, judged, and manifested to himself. Compare
the effect on the woman of Samaria produced by Jesus' unfolding of her
character to herself ([Joh 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#019), [Joh
4:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#029)).

and report--to his friends at home, as the woman of Samaria did. Rather,
as the Greek is, "He will worship God, announcing," that is, openly
avowing then and there, "that God is in you of a truth," and by
implication that the God who is in you is of a truth the God.

[1 Corinthians 14:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">co1 14:26</span></span>

RULES FOR THE EXERCISE OF GIFTS IN THE CONGREGATION. ([Co1
14:26-40](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#026))

How is it then?--rather, "What then is the true rule to be observed as
to the use of gifts?" Compare [Co1
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#015), where the same Greek occurs.

a psalm--extemporary, inspired by the Spirit, as that of Mary,
Zechariah, Simeon, and Anna ([Luk
1:46-55](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#046), [Luk
1:67-79](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#067); [Luk
2:34-38](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#034)).

a doctrine--to impart and set forth to the congregation.

a tongue . . . a revelation--The oldest manuscripts transpose the order:
"revelation . . . tongue"; "interpretation" properly following "tongue"
([Co1 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#013)).

Let all things be done unto edifying--The general rule under which this
particular case fails; an answer to the question at the beginning of
this verse. Each is bound to obey the ordinances of his church not
adverse to Scripture. See Article XXXIV, Church of England Prayer Book.

[1 Corinthians 14:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">co1 14:27</span></span>

let it be by two--at each time, in one assembly; not more than two or
three might speak with tongues at each meeting.

by course--in turns.

let one interpret--one who has the gift of interpreting tongues; and not
more than one.

[1 Corinthians 14:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">co1 14:28</span></span>

let him--the speaker in unknown tongues.

speak to himself, and to God--(compare [Co1
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#002), [Co1
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#004)) --privately and not in the
hearing of others.

[1 Corinthians 14:29](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">co1 14:29</span></span>

two or three--at one meeting (he does not add "at the most," as in [Co1
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#027), lest he should seem to "quench
prophesyings," the most edifying of gifts), and these "one by one," in
turn ([Co1 14:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#027), "by course," and
[Co1 14:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#031)). Paul gives here similar
rules to the prophets, as previously to those speaking in unknown
tongues.

judge--by their power of "discerning spirits" ([Co1
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#010)), whether the person prophesying
was really speaking under the influence of the Spirit (compare [Co1
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#003); [Jo1
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#013)).

[1 Corinthians 14:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">co1 14:30</span></span>

If any thing--Translate, "But if any thing."

another that sitteth by--a hearer.

let the first hold his peace--Let him who heretofore spoke, and who came
to the assembly furnished with a previous ordinary (in those times)
revelation from God ([Co1 14:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#026)), give
place to him who at the assembly is moved to prophesy by a sudden
revelation from the Spirit.

[1 Corinthians 14:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">co1 14:31</span></span>

For ye may--rather, "For ye can \[if ye will\] all prophesy one by one,"
giving way to one another. The "for" justifies the precept ([Co1
14:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#030)), "let the first hold his
peace."

[1 Corinthians 14:32](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">co1 14:32</span></span>

And--following up the assertion in [Co1
14:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#031), "Ye can (if ye will) prophesy
one by one," that is, restrain yourselves from speaking all together;
"and the spirits of the prophets," that is, their own spirits, acted on
by the Holy Spirit, are not so hurried away by His influence, as to
cease to be under their own control; they can if they will hear others,
and not demand that they alone should be heard uttering communications
from God.

[1 Corinthians 14:33](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">co1 14:33</span></span>

In all the churches of the saints God is a God of peace; let Him not
among you be supposed to be a God of confusion \[ALFORD\]. Compare the
same argument in [Co1 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#016). LACHMANN
and others put a full stop at "peace," and connect the following words
thus: "As in all churches of the saints, let your women keep silence in
your churches."

[1 Corinthians 14:34](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">co1 14:34</span></span>

([Ti1 2:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#011)). For women to speak in
public would be an act of independence, as if they were not subject to
their husbands (compare [Co1 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#003);
[Eph 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#022); [Tit
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#005); [Pe1
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#001)). For "under obedience,"

Anticipation of an objection. Women may say, "But if we do not
understand something, may we not 'ask' a question publicly so as to
'learn'? Nay, replies Paul, if you want information, 'ask' not in
public, but 'at home'; ask not other men, but 'your own particular (so
the Greek) husbands.'"

shame--indecorous.

What!--Greek, "Or." Are you about to obey me? Or, if you set up your
judgment above that of other churches. I wish to know, do you pretend
that your church is the first church FROM which the gospel word came,
that you should give the law to all others? Or are you the only persons
In, fro whom it has come?

prophet--the species.

spiritual--the genus: spiritually endowed. The followers of Apollos
prided themselves as "spiritual" ([Co1
3:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#001); compare [Gal
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#001)). Here one capable of discerning
spirits is specially meant.

things that I write . . . commandments of the Lord--a direct assertion
of inspiration. Paul's words as an apostle are Christ's words. Paul
appeals not merely to one or two, but to a body of men, for the reality
of three facts about which no body of men could possibly be mistaken:
(1) that his having converted them was not due to mere eloquence, but to
the "demonstration of the Spirit and of power"; (2) that part of this
demonstration consisted in the communication of miraculous power, which
they were then exercising so generally as to require to be corrected in
the irregular employment of it; (3) that among these miraculous gifts
was one which enabled the "prophet" or "spiritual person" to decide
whether Paul's Epistle was Scripture or not. He could not have written
so, unless the facts were notoriously true: for he takes them for
granted, as consciously known by the whole body of men whom he addresses
\[HINDS, On Inspiration\].

if any man be ignorant--wilfully; not wishing to recognize these
ordinances and my apostolic authority in enjoining them.

let him be ignorant--I leave him to his ignorance: it will be at his own
peril; I feel it a waste of words to speak anything further to convince
him. An argument likely to have weight with the Corinthians, who admired
"knowledge" so much.

covet--earnestly desire. Stronger than "forbid not"; marking how much
higher he esteemed "prophecy" than "tongues."

Let, &c.--The oldest manuscripts read, "But let," &c. This verse is
connected with [Co1 14:39](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#039), "But (while
desiring prophecy, and not forbidding tongues) let all things be done
decently." "Church government is the best security for Christian
liberty" \[J. NEWTON\]. (Compare [Co1
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#023), [Co1
14:26-33](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#026)).
