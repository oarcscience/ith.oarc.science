### [Ecclesiastes Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#001)

[Ecclesiastes 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ecc 6:1</span></span>

([Ecc 6:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#001))

common--or else more literally,--"great upon man," falls heavily upon
man.

[Ecclesiastes 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ecc 6:2</span></span>

for his soul--that is, his enjoyment.

God giveth him not power to eat--This distinguishes him from the "rich"
man in [Ecc 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#019). "God hath given"
distinguishes him also from the man who got his wealth by "oppression"
([Ecc 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#008), [Ecc
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#010)).

stranger--those not akin, nay, even hostile to him ([Jer
51:51](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#051); [Lam
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#002); [Hos
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#009)). He seems to have it in his
"power" to do as he will with his wealth, but an unseen power gives him
up to his own avarice: God wills that he should toil for "a stranger"
([Ecc 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#026)), who has found favor in
God's sight.

[Ecclesiastes 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ecc 6:3</span></span>

Even if a man (of this character) have very many (equivalent to "a
hundred," [Kg2 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#001)) children, and not
have a "stranger" as his heir ([Ecc
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#002)), and live long ("days of years"
express the brevity of life at its best, [Gen
47:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#009)), yet enjoy no real "good" in
life, and lie unhonored, without "burial," at death ([Kg2
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#026), [Kg2
9:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#035)), the embryo is better than he.
In the East to be without burial is the greatest degradation. "Better
the fruit that drops from the tree before it is ripe than that left to
hang on till rotten" \[HENRY\].

[Ecclesiastes 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ecc 6:4</span></span>

he--rather "it," "the untimely birth." So "its," not "his name."

with vanity--to no purpose; a type of the driftless existence of him who
makes riches the chief good.

darkness--of the abortive; a type of the unhonored death and dark future
beyond the grave of the avaricious.

[Ecclesiastes 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ecc 6:5</span></span>

this--yet "it has more rest than" the toiling, gloomy miser.

[Ecclesiastes 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ecc 6:6</span></span>

If the miser's length of "life" be thought to raise him above the
abortive, Solomon answers that long life, without enjoying real good, is
but lengthened misery, and riches cannot exempt him from going whither
"all go." He is fit neither for life, nor death, nor eternity.

[Ecclesiastes 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ecc 6:7</span></span>

man--rather, "the man," namely, the miser ([Ecc
6:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#003)). For not all men labor for the
mouth, that is, for selfish gratification.

appetite--Hebrew, "the soul." The insatiability of the desire prevents
that which is the only end proposed in toils, namely,
self-gratification; "the man" thus gets no "good" out of his wealth
([Ecc 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#003)).

[Ecclesiastes 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ecc 6:8</span></span>

For--"However" \[MAURER\]. The "for" means (in contrast to the
insatiability of the miser), For what else is the advantage which the
wise man hath above the fool?"

What--advantage, that is, superiority, above him who knows not how to
walk uprightly

hath the poor who knoweth to walk before the living?--that is, to use
and enjoy life aright ([Ecc 5:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#018)),
a cheerful, thankful, godly "walk" ([Psa
116:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#009)).

[Ecclesiastes 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ecc 6:9</span></span>

Answer to the question in [Ecc 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#008).
This is the advantage:

Better is the sight of the eyes--the wise man's godly enjoyment of
present seen blessings

than the (fool's) wandering--literally, walking ([Psa
73:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#009)), of the desire, that is, vague,
insatiable desires for what he has not ([Ecc
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#007); [Heb
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#005)).

this--restless wandering of desire, and not enjoying contentedly the
present ([Ti1 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#006), [Ti1
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#008)).

[Ecclesiastes 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ecc 6:10</span></span>

Part II begins here. Since man's toils are vain, what is the chief good?
([Ecc 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#012)). The answer is contained
in the rest of the book.

That which hath been--man's various circumstances

is named already--not only has existed, [Ecc
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#009); [Ecc
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#015), but has received its just name,
"vanity," long ago,

and it is known that it--vanity

is man--Hebrew, "Adam," equivalent to man "of red dust," as his Creator
appropriately named him from his frailty.

neither may he contend, &c.-- ([Rom
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#020)).

[Ecclesiastes 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ecc 6:11</span></span>

"Seeing" that man cannot escape from the "vanity," which by God's
"mighty" will is inherent in earthly things, and cannot call in question
God's wisdom in these dispensations (equivalent to "contend," &c.),

what is man the better--of these vain things as regards the chief good?
None whatever.

[Ecclesiastes 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ecc 6:12</span></span>

For who knoweth, &c.--The ungodly know not what is really "good" during
life, nor "what shall be after them," that is, what will be the event of
their undertakings ([Ecc 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#022); [Ecc
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#007)). The godly might be tempted to
"contend with God" ([Ecc 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#010)) as to
His dispensations; but they cannot fully know the wise purposes served
by them now and hereafter. Their sufferings from the oppressors are more
really good for them than cloudless prosperity; sinners are being
allowed to fill up their measure of guilt. Retribution in part
vindicates God's ways even now. The judgment shall make all clear. In
Ecc. 7:1-29, he states what is good, in answer to this verse.
