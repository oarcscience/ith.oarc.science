### [Psalms Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

[Psalms 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 1:1</span></span>

The character and condition, and the present and future destiny, of the
pious and the wicked are described and contrasted, teaching that true
piety is the source of ultimate happiness, and sin of misery. As this is
a summary of the teachings of the whole book, this Psalm, whether
designedly so placed or not, forms a suitable preface. ([Psa
1:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001))

Blessed--literally, "oh, the happiness"--an exclamation of strong
emotion, as if resulting from reflecting on the subject. The use of the
plural may denote fulness and variety ([Ch2
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#007)).

counsel . . . way . . . seat--With their corresponding verbs, mark
gradations of evil, as acting on the principles, cultivating the
society, and permanently conforming to the conduct of the wicked, who
are described by three terms, of which the last is indicative of the
boldest impiety (compare [Psa 26:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#004);
[Jer 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#017)).

[Psalms 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 1:2</span></span>

law--all of God's word then written, especially the books of Moses
(compare [Psa 119:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#001), [Psa
119:55](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#055), [Psa
119:97](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#097), &c.).

[Psalms 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 1:3</span></span>

like a tree-- ([Jer 17:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#007)).

planted--settled, fast.

by--or, "over."

the rivers--canals for irrigation.

shall prosper--literally, "make prosper," brings to perfection. The
basis of this condition and character is given ([Psa
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001)).

[Psalms 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 1:4</span></span>

not so--either as to conduct or happiness.

like the chaff--which, by Eastern modes of winnowing against the wind,
was utterly blown away.

[Psalms 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 1:5</span></span>

stand in the judgment--be acquitted. They shall be driven from among the
good ([Mat 25:45-46](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#045)).

[Psalms 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 1:6</span></span>

knoweth the way--attends to and provides for them ([Psa
101:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#006); [Pro
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#010); [Hos
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#005)).

way of the wicked--All their plans will end in disappointment and ruin
([Psa 37:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#013); [Psa
146:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#008); [Pro
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#019)).
