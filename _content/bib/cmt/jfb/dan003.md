### [Daniel Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#001)

[Daniel 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">dan 3:1</span></span>

NEBUCHADNEZZAR'S IDOLATROUS IMAGE; SHADRACH, MESHACH, AND ABED-NEGO ARE
DELIVERED FROM THE FURNACE. (Dan. 3:1-30)

image--Nebuchadnezzar's confession of God did not prevent him being a
worshipper of idols, besides. Ancient idolaters thought that each nation
had its own gods, and that, in addition to these, foreign gods might be
worshipped. The Jewish religion was the only exclusive one that claimed
all homage for Jehovah as the only true God. Men will in times of
trouble confess God, if they are allowed to retain their favorite
heart-idols. The image was that of Bel, the Babylonian tutelary god; or
rather, Nebuchadnezzar himself the personification and representative of
the Babylonian empire, as suggested to him by the dream ([Dan
2:38](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#038)), "Thou art this head of gold."
The interval between the dream and the event here was about nineteen
years. Nebuchadnezzar had just returned from finishing the Jewish and
Syrian wars, the spoils of which would furnish the means of rearing such
a colossal statue \[PRIDEAUX\]. The colossal size makes it likely that
the frame was wood, overlaid with gold. The "height," sixty cubits, is
so out of proportion with the "breadth," exceeding it ten times, that it
seems best to suppose the thickness from breast to back to be intended,
which is exactly the right proportion of a well-formed man \[AUGUSTINE,
The City of God, 15.20\]. PRIDEAUX thinks the sixty cubits refer to the
image and pedestal together, the image being twenty-seven cubits high,
or forty feet, the pedestal thirty-three cubits, or fifty feet.
HERODOTUS \[1.183\] confirms this by mentioning a similar image, forty
feet high, in the temple of Belus at Babylon. It was not the same image,
for the one here was on the plain of Dura, not in the city.

[Daniel 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">dan 3:2</span></span>

princes--"satraps" of provinces \[GESENIUS\].

captains--rulers, not exclusively military.

sheriffs--men learned in the law, like the Arab mufti \[GESENIUS\].

[Daniel 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">dan 3:3</span></span>

stood before the image--in an attitude of devotion. Whatever the king
approved of, they all approve of. There is no stability of principle in
the ungodly.

[Daniel 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">dan 3:4</span></span>

The arguments of the persecutor are in brief, Turn or burn.

[Daniel 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">dan 3:5</span></span>

cornet--A wind instrument, like the French horn, is meant.

flute--a pipe or pipes, not blown transversely as our "flute," but by
mouthpieces at the end.

sackbut--a triangular stringed instrument, having short strings, the
sound being on a high sharp key.

psaltery--a kind of harp.

dulcimer--a bagpipe consisting of two pipes, thrust through a leathern
bag, emitting a sweet plaintive sound. Chaldee sumponya, the modern
Italian zampogna, Asiatic zambonja.

fall down--that the recusants might be the more readily detected.

[Daniel 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">dan 3:6</span></span>

No other nation but the Jews would feel this edict oppressive; for it
did not prevent them worshipping their own gods besides. It was
evidently aimed at the Jews by those jealous of their high position in
the king's court, who therefore induced the king to pass an edict as to
all recusants, representing such refusal of homage as an act of treason
to Nebuchadnezzar as civil and religious "head" of the empire. So the
edict under Darius ([Dan 6:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#007)) was
aimed against the Jews by those jealous of Daniel's influence. The
literal image of Nebuchadnezzar is a typical prophecy of "the image of
the beast," connected with mystical Babylon, in [Rev
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#014). The second mystical beast there
causeth the earth, and them that dwell therein, to worship the first
beast, and that as many as would not, should be killed ([Rev
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#012), [Rev
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#015)).

furnace--a common mode of punishment in Babylon ([Jer
29:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#022)). It is not necessary to suppose
that the furnace was made for the occasion. Compare "brick-kiln," [Sa2
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#031). Any furnace for common purposes
in the vicinity of Dura would serve. CHARDIN, in his travels (A.D.
1671-1677), mentions that in Persia, to terrify those who took advantage
of scarcity to sell provisions at exorbitant prices, the cooks were
roasted over a slow fire, and the bakers cast into a burning oven.

[Daniel 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">dan 3:7</span></span>

None of the Jews seem to have been present, except the officers,
summoned specially.

[Daniel 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">dan 3:8</span></span>

accused the Jews--literally, "ate the rent limbs," or flesh of the Jews
(compare [Job 31:31](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#031); [Psa
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#004); [Psa
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#002); [Jer
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#025)). Not probably in general, but
as [Dan 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#012) states, Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abed-nego. Why Daniel was not summoned does not appear.
Probably he was in some distant part of the empire on state business,
and the general summons ([Dan 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#002)) had
not time to reach him before the dedication. Also, the Jews enemies
found it more politic to begin by attacking Shadrach, Meshach, and
Abed-nego, who were nearer at hand, and had less influence, before they
proceeded to attack Daniel.

[Daniel 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">dan 3:9</span></span>

live for ever--A preface of flattery is closely akin to the cruelty that
follows. So [Act 24:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#002), &c.,
Tertullus in accusing Paul before Felix.

[Daniel 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">dan 3:12</span></span>

serve not thy gods--not only not the golden image, but also not any of
Nebuchadnezzar's gods.

[Daniel 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">dan 3:13</span></span>

bring--Instead of commanding their immediate execution, as in the case
of the Magi ([Dan 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#012)), Providence
inclined him to command the recusants to be brought before him, so that
their noble "testimony" for God might be given before the world powers
"against them" ([Mat 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#018)), to the
edification of the Church in all ages.

[Daniel 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">dan 3:14</span></span>

Is it true--rather, as the Margin \[THEODOTION\], "Is it purposely
that?" &c. Compare the Hebrew, [Num
35:20](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#020), [Num
35:22](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#022). Notwithstanding his "fury," his
past favor for them disposes him to give them the opportunity of
excusing themselves on the ground that their disobedience had not been
intentional; so he gives them another trial to see whether they would
still worship the image.

[Daniel 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">dan 3:15</span></span>

who is that God--so Sennacherib's taunt ([Kg2
18:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#035)), and Pharaoh's ([Exo
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#002)).

[Daniel 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">dan 3:16</span></span>

not careful to answer thee--rather, "We have no need to answer thee";
thou art determined on thy side, and our mind is made up not to worship
the image: there is therefore no use in our arguing as if we could be
shaken from our principles. Hesitation, or parleying with sin, is fatal;
unhesitating decision is the only safety, where the path of duty is
clear ([Mat 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#019), [Mat
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#028)).

[Daniel 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">dan 3:17</span></span>

If it be so--VATABLUS translates, "Assuredly." English Version agrees
better with the original. The sense is, If it be our lot to be cast into
the furnace, our God (quoted from [Deu
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#004)) is able to deliver us (a reply to
Nebuchadnezzar's challenge, "Who is that God that shall deliver you?");
and He will deliver us (either from death, or in death, [Ti2
4:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#017)). He will, we trust, literally
deliver us, but certainly He will do so spiritually.

[Daniel 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">dan 3:18</span></span>

But if not, &c.--connected with [Dan
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#018). "Whether our God deliver us, as
He is able, or do not, we will not serve thy gods." Their service of God
is not mercenary in its motive. Though He slay them, they will still
trust in Him ([Job 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#015)). Their
deliverance from sinful compliance was as great a miracle in the kingdom
of grace, as that from the furnace was in the kingdom of nature. Their
youth, and position as captives and friendless exiles, before the
absolute world potentate and the horrid death awaiting them if they
should persevere in their faith, all enhance the grace of God, which
carried them through such an ordeal.

[Daniel 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">dan 3:19</span></span>

visage . . . changed--He had shown forbearance ([Dan
3:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#014)) as a favor to them, but now
that they despise even his forbearance, anger "fills" him, and is
betrayed in his whole countenance.

seven times more than it was wont--literally, "than it was (ever) seen
to be heated." Seven is the perfect number; that is, it was made as hot
as possible. Passion overdoes and defeats its own end, for the hotter
the fire, the sooner were they likely to be put out of pain.

[Daniel 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">dan 3:21</span></span>

coats . . . hosen . . . hats--HERODOTUS \[1.195\] says that the
Babylonian costume consisted of three parts: (1) wide, long pantaloons;
(2) a woollen shirt; (3) an outer mantle with a girdle round it. So
these are specified \[GESENIUS\], "their pantaloons, inner tunics
(hosen, or stockings, are not commonly worn in the East), and outer
mantles." Their being cast in so hurriedly, with all their garments on,
enhanced the miracle in that not even the smell of fire passed on their
clothes, though of delicate, inflammable material.

[Daniel 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">dan 3:22</span></span>

flame . . . slew those men-- ([Dan
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#024); [Psa
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#016)).

[Daniel 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">dan 3:23</span></span>

fell down--not cast down; for those who brought the three youths to the
furnace, perished by the flames themselves, and so could not cast them
in. Here follows an addition in the Septuagint, Syrian, Arabic, and
Vulgate versions. "The Prayer of Azarias," and "The Song of the Three
Holy Children." It is not in the Chaldee. The hymn was sung throughout
the whole Church in their liturgies, from the earliest times \[RUFINUS
in Commentary on the Apostles Creed, and ATHANASIUS\]. The
"astonishment" of Nebuchadnezzar in [Dan
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#024) is made an argument for its
genuineness, as if it explained the cause of his astonishment, namely,
"they walked in the midst of the fire praising God, but the angel of the
Lord came down into the oven" (vs. 1 and vs. 27 of the Apocryphal
addition). But [Dan 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#025) of English
Version explains his astonishment, without need of any addition.

[Daniel 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">dan 3:24</span></span>

True, O king--God extorted this confession from His enemies' own mouths.

[Daniel 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">dan 3:25</span></span>

four--whereas but three had been cast in.

loose--whereas they had been cast in "bound." Nebuchadnezzar's question,
in [Dan 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#024), is as if he can scarcely
trust his own memory as to a fact so recent, now that he sees through an
aperture in the furnace what seems to contradict it.

walking in . . . midst of . . . fire--image of the godly unhurt, and at
large ([Joh 8:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#036)), "in the midst of
trouble" ([Psa 138:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#007); compare [Psa
23:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#003)). They walked up and down in
the fire, not leaving it, but waiting for God's time to bring them out,
just as Jesus waited in the tomb as God's prisoner, till God should let
Him out ([Act 2:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#026)). So Paul ([Co2
12:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#008)). So Noah waited in the ark,
after the flood, till God brought him forth ([Gen
8:12-18](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#012)).

like the Son of God--Unconsciously, like Saul, Caiaphas ([Joh
11:49-52](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#049)), and Pilate, he is made to
utter divine truths. "Son of God" in his mouth means only an "angel"
from heaven, as [Dan 3:28](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#028) proves.
Compare [Job 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#006); [Job
38:7](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#007); [Psa
34:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#007); and the probably heathen
centurion's exclamation ([Mat 27:54](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#054)).
The Chaldeans believed in families of gods: Bel, the supreme god,
accompanied by the goddess Mylitta, being the father of the gods; thus
the expression he meant: one sprung from and sent by the gods. Really it
was the "messenger of the covenant," who herein gave a prelude to His
incarnation.

[Daniel 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">dan 3:26</span></span>

the most high God--He acknowledges Jehovah to be supreme above other
gods (not that he ceased to believe in these); so he returns to his
original confession, "your God is a God of gods" ([Dan
2:47](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#047)), from which he had swerved in
the interim, perhaps intoxicated by his success in taking Jerusalem,
whose God he therefore thought unable to defend it.

[Daniel 3:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">dan 3:27</span></span>

nor . . . an hair-- ([Luk 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#007); [Luk
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#018)).

fire had no power--fulfilling [Isa
43:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#002); compare [Heb
11:34](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#034). God alone is a "consuming fire"
([Heb 12:29](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#029)).

nor . . . smell of fire--compare spiritually, [Th1
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#022).

[Daniel 3:28](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">dan 3:28</span></span>

In giving some better traits in Nebuchadnezzar's character, Daniel
agrees with [Jer 39:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#011); [Jer
42:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#012).

changed the king's word--have made the king's attempt to coerce into
obedience vain. Have set aside his word (so "alter . . . word," [Ezr
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#011)) from regard to God.
Nebuchadnezzar now admits that God's law should be obeyed, rather than
his ([Act 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#029)).

yielded . . . bodies--namely, to the fire.

not serve--by sacrificing.

nor worship--by prostration of the body. Decision for God at last gains
the respect even of the worldly ([Pro
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#007)).

[Daniel 3:29](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">dan 3:29</span></span>

This decree promulgated throughout the vast empire of Nebuchadnezzar
must have tended much to keep the Jews from idolatry in the captivity
and thenceforth ([Psa 76:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#010)).

Punished with insanity for his haughtiness, he sinks to the level of the
beasts (illustrating [Psa 49:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#006), [Psa
49:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#012)). The opposition between bestial
and human life, set forth here, is a key to interpret the symbolism in
the seventh chapter concerning the beasts and the Son of man. After his
conquests, and his building in fifteen days a new palace, according to
the heathen historian, ABYDENUS (268 B.C.), whose account confirms
Daniel, he ascended upon his palace roof ([Dan
4:29](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#029), Margin), whence he could see the
surrounding city which he had built, and seized by some deity, he
predicted the Persian conquest of Babylon, adding a prayer that the
Persian leader might on his return be borne where there is no path of
men, and where the wild beasts graze (language evidently derived by
tradition from [Dan 4:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#032), though
the application is different). In his insanity, his excited mind would
naturally think of the coming conquest of Babylon by the Medo-Persians,
already foretold to him in the second chapter.
