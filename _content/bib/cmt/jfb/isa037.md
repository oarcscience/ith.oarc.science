### [Isaiah Chapter 37](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#001)

[Isaiah 37:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 37:1</span></span>

CONTINUATION OF THE NARRATIVE IN THE THIRTY-SIXTH CHAPTER. (Isa.
37:1-38)

sackcloth--(See on [Isa 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#002)).

house of the Lord--the sure resort of God's people in distress ([Psa
73:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#016); [Psa
77:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#013)).

[Isaiah 37:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 37:2</span></span>

unto Isaiah--implying the importance of the prophet's position at the
time; the chief officers of the court are deputed to wait on him
(compare [Kg2 22:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#012)).

[Isaiah 37:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 37:3</span></span>

rebuke--that is, the Lord's rebuke for His people's sins ([Psa
149:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#007); [Hos
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#009)).

blasphemy--blasphemous railing of Rab-shakeh.

the children, &c.--a proverbial expression for, We are in the most
extreme danger and have no power to avert it (compare [Hos
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#013)).

[Isaiah 37:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 37:4</span></span>

hear--take cognizance of ([Sa2 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#012)).

reprove--will punish him for the words, &c. ([Psa
50:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#021)).

remnant--the two tribes of the kingdom of Judah, Israel being already
captive. Isaiah is entreated to act as intercessor with God.

[Isaiah 37:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 37:6</span></span>

servants--literally, "youths," mere lads, implying disparagement, not an
embassy of venerable elders. The Hebrew is different from that for
"servants" in [Isa 37:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#005).

blasphemed me-- ([Isa 36:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#020)).

[Isaiah 37:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 37:7</span></span>

blast--rather, "I will put a spirit ([Isa
28:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#006); [Kg1
22:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#023)) into him," that is, so
influence his judgment that when he hears the report ([Isa
37:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#009), concerning Tirhakah), he shall
return \[GESENIUS\]; the "report" also of the destruction of his army at
Jerusalem, reaching Sennacherib, while he was in the southwest of
Palestine on the borders of Egypt, led him to retreat.

by the sword-- ([Isa 37:38](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#038)).

[Isaiah 37:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 37:8</span></span>

returned--to the camp of his master.

Libnah--meaning "whiteness," the Blanche-garde of the Crusaders
\[STANLEY\]. EUSEBIUS and JEROME place it more south, in the district of
Eleutheropolis, ten miles northwest of Lachish, which Sennacherib had
captured (see on [Isa 36:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#002)). Libnah
was in Judea and given to the priests ([Ch1
6:54](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#054), [Ch1
6:57](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#057)).

[Isaiah 37:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 37:9</span></span>

Tirhakah--(See on [Isa 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#012); [Isa
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#006)). Egypt was in part governed by
three successive Ethiopian monarchs, for forty or fifty years: Sabacho,
Sevechus, and Tirhakah. Sevechus retired from Lower Egypt owing to the
resistance of the priests, whereupon Sethos, a prince-priest, obtained
supreme power with Tanis (Zoan in Scripture), or Memphis, as his
capital. The Ethiopians retained Upper Egypt under Tirhakah, with Thebes
as the capital. Tirhakah's fame as a conqueror rivalled that of
Sesostris; he, and one at least, of the Pharaohs of Lower Egypt, were
Hezekiah's allies against Assyria. The tidings of his approach made
Sennacherib the more anxious to get possession of Jerusalem before his
arrival.

sent-- [Kg2 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#009) more fully expresses
Sennacherib's eagerness by adding "again."

[Isaiah 37:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 37:10</span></span>

He tries to influence Hezekiah himself, as Rab-shakeh had addressed the
people.

God . . . deceive--(Compare [Num
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#019)).

[Isaiah 37:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 37:11</span></span>

all lands-- ([Isa 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#017)). He does not
dare to enumerate Egypt in the list.

[Isaiah 37:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 37:12</span></span>

Gozan--in Mesopotamia, on the Chabour ([Kg2
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#006); [Kg2
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#011)). Gozan is the name of the
district, Chabour of the river.

Haran--more to the west. Abraham removed to it from Ur ([Gen
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#031)); the Carroe of the Romans.

Rezeph--farther west, in Syria.

Eden--There is an ancient village, Adna, north of Baghdad. Some think
Eden to be the name of a region (of Mesopotamia or its vicinity) in
which was Paradise; Paradise was not Eden itself ([Gen
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#008)). "A garden in Eden."

Telassar--now Tel-afer, west of Mosul \[LAYARD\]. Tel means a "hill" in
Arabic and Assyrian names.

[Isaiah 37:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 37:13</span></span>

Hena . . . Ivah--in Babylonia. From Ava colonists had been brought to
Samaria ([Kg2 17:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#024)).

[Isaiah 37:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 37:14</span></span>

spread--unrolled the scroll of writing. God "knows our necessities
before we ask Him," but He delights in our unfolding them to Him with
filial confidence ([Ch2 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#003), [Ch2
20:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#011)).

[Isaiah 37:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 37:16</span></span>

dwellest--the Shekinah, or fiery symbol of God's presence, dwelling in
the temple with His people, is from shachan, "to dwell" ([Exo
25:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#022); [Psa
80:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#001); [Psa
99:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#001)).

cherubim--derived by transposition from either a Hebrew root, rachab, to
"ride"; or rather, barach, to "bless." They were formed out of the same
mass of pure gold as the mercy seat itself ([Exo
25:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#019), Margin). The phrase, "dwellest
between the cherubim," arose from their position at each end of the
mercy seat, while the Shekinah, and the awful name, JEHOVAH, in written
letters, were in the intervening space. They are so inseparably
associated with the manifestation of God's glory, that whether the Lord
is at rest or in motion, they always are mentioned with Him ([Num
7:89](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#089); [Psa
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#010)). (1) They are first mentioned
([Gen 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#024)) "on the edge of" (as "on
the east" may be translated) Eden; the Hebrew for "placed" is properly
to "place in a tabernacle," which implies that this was a local
tabernacle in which the symbols of God's presence were manifested
suitably to the altered circumstances in which man, after the fall, came
before God. It was here that Cain and Abel, and the patriarchs down to
the flood, presented their offerings: and it is called "the presence of
the Lord" ([Gen 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#016)). When those
symbols were removed at the close of that early patriarchal
dispensation, small models of them were made for domestic use, called,
in Chaldee, "seraphim" or "teraphim." (2) The cherubim, in the Mosaic
tabernacle and Solomon's temple, were the same in form as those at the
outskirts of Eden: compound figures, combining the distinguishing
properties of several creatures: the ox, chief among the tame and useful
animals; the lion among the wild ones; the eagle among birds; and man,
the head of all (the original headship of man over the animal kingdom,
about to be restored in Jesus Christ, [Psa
8:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#004), is also implied in this
combination). They are, throughout Scripture, represented as distinct
from God; they could not be likenesses of Him which He forbade in any
shape. (3) They are introduced in the third or gospel dispensation ([Rev
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#006)) as "living creatures" (not so
well translated "beasts" in English Version), not angels, but beings
closely connected with the redeemed Church. So also in Eze. 1:5-25;
10:1-22. Thus, throughout the three dispensations, they seem to be
symbols of those who in every age should officially study and proclaim
the manifold wisdom of God.

thou alone--literally, "Thou art He who alone art God of all the
kingdoms"; whereas Sennacherib had classed Jehovah with the heathen
gods, he asserts the nothingness of the latter and the sole lordship of
the former.

[Isaiah 37:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 37:17</span></span>

ear . . . eyes--singular, plural. When we wish to hear a thing we lend
one ear; when we wish to see a thing we open both eyes.

[Isaiah 37:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 37:18</span></span>

have laid waste--conceding the truth of the Assyrian's allegation ([Isa
36:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#018)), but adding the reason, "For
they were no gods."

[Isaiah 37:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 37:19</span></span>

cast . . . gods into . . . fire--The policy of the Assyrians in order to
alienate the conquered peoples from their own countries was, both to
deport them elsewhere, and to destroy the tutelary idols of their
nation, the strongest tie which bound them to their native land. The
Roman policy was just the reverse.

[Isaiah 37:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 37:20</span></span>

The strongest argument to plead before God in prayer, the honor of God
([Exo 32:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#012); [Psa
83:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#018); [Dan
9:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#018)).

[Isaiah 37:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 37:21</span></span>

Whereas thou hast prayed to me--that is, hast not relied on thy own
strength but on Me (compare [Kg2
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#020)). "That which thou hast prayed
to Me against Sennacherib, I have heard" ([Psa
65:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#002)).

[Isaiah 37:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 37:22</span></span>

Transition to poetry: in parallelism.

virgin . . . daughter--honorable terms. "Virgin" implies that the city
is, as yet, inviolate. "Daughter" is an abstract collective feminine
personification of the population, the child of the place denoted (see
on [Isa 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#010); [Isa
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#008)). Zion and her inhabitants.

shaken . . . head--in scorn ([Psa
22:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#007); [Psa
109:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#025); [Mat
27:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#039)). With us to shake the head is a
sign of denial or displeasure; but gestures have different meanings in
different countries ([Isa 58:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#009); [Eze
25:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#006); [Zep
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#015)).

[Isaiah 37:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">isa 37:23</span></span>

Whom--not an idol.

[Isaiah 37:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">isa 37:24</span></span>

said--virtually. Hast thou within thyself?

height--imagery from the Assyrian felling of trees in Lebanon ([Isa
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#008); [Isa
33:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#009)); figuratively for, "I have
carried my victorious army through the regions most difficult of access,
to the most remote lands."

sides--rather, "recesses" \[G. V. SMITH\].

fir trees--not cypresses, as some translate; pine foliage and cedars are
still found on the northwest side of Lebanon \[STANLEY\].

height of . . . border--In [Kg2 19:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#023),
"the lodgings of his borders." Perhaps on the ascent to the top there
was a place of repose or caravansary, which bounded the usual attempts
of persons to ascend \[BARNES\]. Here, simply, "its extreme height."

forest of . . . Carmel--rather, "its thickest forest." "Carmel"
expresses thick luxuriance (see on [Isa
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#018); [Isa
29:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#017)).

[Isaiah 37:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">isa 37:25</span></span>

digged, and drunk water--In [Kg2
19:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#024), it is "strange waters." I have
marched into foreign lands where I had to dig wells for the supply of my
armies; even the natural destitution of water there did not impede my
march.

rivers of . . . besieged places--rather, "the streams (artificial canals
from the Nile) of Egypt." "With the sole of my foot," expresses that as
soon as his vast armies marched into a region, the streams were drunk up
by them; or rather, that the rivers proved no obstruction to the onward
march of his armies. So [Isa 19:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#004),
referring to Egypt, "the river--brooks of defense--shall be dried up."
HORSLEY, translates the Hebrew for "besieged places," "rocks."

[Isaiah 37:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">isa 37:26</span></span>

Reply of God to Sennacherib.

long ago--join, rather, with "I have done it." Thou dost boast that it
is all by thy counsel and might: but it is I who, long ago, have ordered
it so ([Isa 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#011)); thou wert but the
instrument in My hands ([Isa 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005),
[Isa 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#015)). This was the reason why
"the inhabitants were of small power before thee" ([Isa
37:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#027)), namely, that I ordered it so;
yet thou art in My hands, and I know thy ways ([Isa
37:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#028)), and I will check thee ([Isa
37:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#029)). Connect also, "I from ancient
times have arranged ('formed') it." However, English Version is
supported by [Isa 33:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#013); [Isa
45:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#006), [Isa
45:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#021); [Isa
48:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#005).

[Isaiah 37:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">isa 37:27</span></span>

Therefore--not because of thy power, but because I made them unable to
withstand thee.

grass--which easily withers ([Isa
40:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#006); [Psa
37:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#002)).

on . . . housetops--which having little earth to nourish it fades
soonest ([Psa 129:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#006)).

corn blasted before it be grown up--SMITH translates, "The cornfield
(frail and tender), before the corn is grown."

[Isaiah 37:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">isa 37:28</span></span>

abode--rather, "sitting down" ([Psa
139:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#002)). The expressions here describe
a man's whole course of life ([Deu
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#007); [Deu
28:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#006); [Kg1
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#007); [Psa
121:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#008)). There is also a special
reference to Sennacherib's first being at home, then going forth against
Judah and Egypt, and raging against Jehovah ([Isa
37:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#004)).

[Isaiah 37:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">isa 37:29</span></span>

tumult--insolence.

hook in . . . nose--Like a wild beast led by a ring through the nose, he
shall be forced back to his own country (compare [Job
41:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#001); [Eze
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#004); [Eze
29:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#004); [Eze
38:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#004)). In a bas-relief of Khorsabad,
captives are led before the king by a cord attached to a hook, or ring,
passing through the under lip or the upper lip, and nose.

[Isaiah 37:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">isa 37:30</span></span>

Addressed to Hezekiah.

sign--a token which, when fulfilled, would assure him of the truth of
the whole prophecy as to the enemy's overthrow. The two years, in which
they were sustained by the spontaneous growth of the earth, were the two
in which Judea had been already ravaged by Sennacherib ([Isa
32:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#010)). Thus translate: "Ye did eat
(the first year) such as groweth of itself, and in the second year that
. . . but in this third year sow ye," &c., for in this year the land
shall be delivered from the foe. The fact that Sennacherib moved his
camp away immediately after shows that the first two years refer to the
past, not to the future \[ROSENMULLER\]. Others, referring the first two
years to the future, get over the difficulty of Sennacherib's speedy
departure, by supposing that year to have been the sabbatical year, and
the second year the jubilee; no indication of this appears in the
context.

[Isaiah 37:31](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">isa 37:31</span></span>

remnant--Judah remained after the ten tribes were carried away; also
those of Judah who should survive Sennacherib's invasion are meant.

[Isaiah 37:33](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">isa 37:33</span></span>

with shields--He did come near it, but was not allowed to conduct a
proper siege.

bank--a mound to defend the assailants in attacking the walls.

[Isaiah 37:34](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">isa 37:34</span></span>

(See [Isa 37:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#029), [Isa
37:37](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#037); [Isa
29:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#005)).

[Isaiah 37:35](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">isa 37:35</span></span>

I will defend--Notwithstanding Hezekiah's measures of defense ([Ch2
32:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#003)), Jehovah was its true
defender.

mine own sake--since Jehovah's name was blasphemed by Sennacherib ([Isa
37:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#023)).

David's sake--on account of His promise to David ([Psa
132:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#017)), and to Messiah, the heir
of David's throne ([Isa 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#007); [Isa
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001)).

[Isaiah 37:36](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">isa 37:36</span></span>

Some attribute the destruction to the agency of the plague (see on [Isa
33:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#024)), which may have caused
Hezekiah's sickness, narrated immediately after; but [Isa
33:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#001), [Isa
33:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#004), proves that the Jews spoiled the
corpses, which they would not have dared to do, had there been on them
infection of a plague. The secondary agency seems, from [Isa
29:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#006); [Isa
30:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#030), to have been a storm of hail,
thunder, and lightning (compare [Exo
9:22-25](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#022)). The simoon belongs rather to
Africa and Arabia than Palestine, and ordinarily could not produce such
a destructive effect. Some few of the army, as [Ch2
32:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#021) seems to imply, survived and
accompanied Sennacherib home. HERODOTUS (2.141) gives an account
confirming Scripture in so far as the sudden discomfiture of the
Assyrian army is concerned. The Egyptian priests told him that
Sennacherib was forced to retreat from Pelusium owing to a multitude of
field mice, sent by one of their gods, having gnawed the Assyrians'
bow-strings and shield-straps. Compare the language ([Isa
37:33](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#033)), "He shall not shoot an arrow
there, nor come before it with shields," which the Egyptians corrupted
into their version of the story. Sennacherib was as the time with a part
of his army, not at Jerusalem, but on the Egyptian frontier, southwest
of Palestine. The sudden destruction of the host near Jerusalem, a
considerable part of his whole army, as well as the advance of the
Ethiopian Tirhakah, induced him to retreat, which the Egyptians
accounted for in a way honoring to their own gods. The mouse was the
Egyptian emblem of destruction. The Greek Apollo was called Sminthian,
from a Cretan word for "a mouse," as a tutelary god of agriculture, he
was represented with one foot upon a mouse, since field mice hurt corn.
The Assyrian inscriptions, of course, suppress their own defeat, but
nowhere boast of having taken Jerusalem; and the only reason to be given
for Sennacherib not having, amidst his many subsequent expeditions
recorded in the monuments, returned to Judah, is the terrible calamity
he had sustained there, which convinced him that Hezekiah was under the
divine protection. RAWLINSON says, In Sennacherib's account of his wars
with Hezekiah, inscribed with cuneiform characters in the hall of the
palace of Koyunjik, built by him (a hundred forty feet long by a hundred
twenty broad), wherein even the Jewish physiognomy of the captives is
portrayed, there occurs a remarkable passage; after his mentioning his
taking two hundred thousand captive Jews, he adds, "Then I prayed unto
God"; the only instance of an inscription wherein the name of GOD occurs
without a heathen adjunct. The forty-sixth Psalm probably commemorates
Judah's deliverance. It occurred in one "night," according to [Kg2
19:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#035), with which Isaiah's words,
"when they arose early in the morning," &c., are in undesigned
coincidence.

dwelt at Nineveh--for about twenty years after his disaster, according
to the inscriptions. The word, "dwelt," is consistent with any
indefinite length of time. "Nineveh," so called from Ninus, that is,
Nimrod, its founder; his name means "exceedingly impious rebel"; he
subverted the existing patriarchal order of society, by setting up a
system of chieftainship, founded on conquest; the hunting field was his
training school for war; he was of the race of Ham, and transgressed the
limits marked by God ([Gen 10:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#008),
[Gen 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#025)), encroaching on Shem's
portion; he abandoned Babel for a time, after the miraculous confusion
of tongues and went and founded Nineveh; he was, after death, worshipped
as Orion, the constellation (see on [Job
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#009); [Job
38:31](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#031)).

Nisroch--Nisr, in Semitic, means "eagle;" the termination och, means
"great." The eagle-headed human figure in Assyrian sculptures is no
doubt Nisroch, the same as Asshur, the chief Assyrian god; the
corresponding goddess was Asheera, or Astarte; this means a "grove," or
sacred tree, often found as the symbol of the heavenly hosts (Saba) in
the sculptures, as Asshur the Eponymus hero of Assyria ([Gen
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#011)) answered to the sun or Baal,
Belus, the title of office, "Lord." This explains "image of the grove"
([Kg2 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#007)). The eagle was worshipper
by the ancient Persians and Arabs.

Esar-haddon--In [Ezr 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#002) he is
mentioned as having brought colonists into Samaria. He is also thought
to have been the king who carried Manasseh captive to Babylon ([Ch2
33:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#011)). He built the palace on the
mound Nebbiyunus, and that called the southwest palace of Nimroud. The
latter was destroyed by fire, but his name and wars are recorded on the
great bulls taken from the building. He obtained his building materials
from the northwest palaces of the ancient dynasty, ending in Pul.
