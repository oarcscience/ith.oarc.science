### [2 Corinthians Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#001)

[2 Corinthians 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co2 11:1</span></span>

THROUGH JEALOUSY OVER THE CORINTHIANS, WHO MADE MORE ACCOUNT OF THE
FALSE APOSTLES THAN OF HIM, HE IS OBLIGED TO COMMEND HIMSELF AS IN MANY
RESPECTS SUPERIOR. (2Co. 11:1-33)

Would to God--Translate as Greek, "I would that."

bear with me--I may ask not unreasonably to be borne with; not so the
false apostles ([Co2 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#004), [Co2
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#020)).

my--not in the oldest manuscripts.

folly--The Greek is a milder term than that for "foolishness" in [Co1
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#019); [Mat
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#022); [Mat
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#002). The Greek for "folly" here
implies imprudence; the Greek for "foolishness" includes the idea of
perversity and wickedness.

and indeed bear--A request (so [Co2
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#016)). But the Greek and the sense
favor the translation, "But indeed (I need not wish it, for) ye do bear
with me"; still I wish you to bear with me further, while I enter at
large into self-commendations.

[2 Corinthians 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co2 11:2</span></span>

For I am jealous--The justification of his self-commendations lies in
his zealous care lest they should fall from Christ, to whom he, as "the
friend of the Bridegroom" ([Joh 3:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#029)),
has espoused them; in order to lead them back from the false apostles to
Christ, he is obliged to boast as an apostle of Christ, in a way which,
but for the motive, would be "folly."

godly jealousy--literally, "jealousy of God" (compare [Co2
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#012), "godly sincerity," literally,
"sincerity of God"). "If I am immoderate, I am immoderate to God"
\[BENGEL\]. A jealousy which has God's honor at heart ([Kg1
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#010)).

I . . . espoused you--Paul uses a Greek term applied properly to the
bridegroom, just as he ascribes to himself "jealousy," a feeling
properly belonging to the husband; so entirely does he identify himself
with Christ.

present you as a chaste virgin to Christ--at His coming, when the
heavenly marriage shall take place ([Mat
25:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#006); [Rev
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#007), [Rev
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#009)). What Paul here says he desires
to do, namely, "present" the Church as "a chaste virgin" to Christ,
Christ Himself is said to do in the fuller sense. Whatever ministers do
effectively, is really done by Christ ([Eph
5:27-32](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#027)). The espousals are going on
now. He does not say "chaste virgins"; for not individual members, but
the whole body of believers conjointly constitute the Bride.

[2 Corinthians 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co2 11:3</span></span>

I fear-- ([Co2 12:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#020)); not
inconsistent with love. His source of fear was their yielding character.

subtilty--the utter foe of the "simplicity" which is intent on ONE
object, Jesus, and seeks none "other," and no "other" and different
Spirit ([Co2 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#004)); but loves him with
tender SINGLENESS OF AFFECTION. Where Eve first gave way, was in
mentally harboring for a moment the possibility insinuated by the
serpent, of GOD not having her truest interests at heart, and of this
"other" professing friend being more concerned for her than God.

corrupted--so as to lose their virgin purity through seducers ([Co2
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#004)). The same Greek stands for
"minds" as for "thoughts" ([Co2 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#005),
also see on [Co2 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#005)); intents of the
will, or mind. The oldest manuscripts after "simplicity," add, "and the
purity" or "chastity."

in Christ--rather, "that is towards Christ."

[2 Corinthians 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co2 11:4</span></span>

if, &c.--which in fact is impossible. However, if it were possible, ye
might then bear with them (see on [Co2
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#001)). But there can be no new Gospel;
there is but the one which I first preached; therefore it ought not to
be "borne" by you, that the false teachers should attempt to supersede
me.

he that cometh--the high-sounding title assumed by the false teachers,
who arrogated Christ's own peculiar title (Greek, [Mat
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#003), and [Heb
10:37](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#037)), "He that is coming." Perhaps
he was leader of the party which assumed peculiarly to be "Christ's"
([Co2 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#007); [Co1
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#012)); hence his assumption of the
title.

preacheth . . . receive--is preaching . . . ye are receiving.

Jesus--the "Jesus" of Gospel history. He therefore does not say
"Christ," which refers to the office.

another . . . another--Greek, "another Jesus . . . a different Spirit .
. . a different Gospel." Another implies a distinct individual of the
same kind; different implies one quite distinct in kind.

which ye have not received--from us.

spirit . . . received . . . gospel . . . accepted--The will of man is
passive in RECEIVING the "Spirit"; but it is actively concurrent with
the will of God (which goes before to give the good will) in ACCEPTING
the "Gospel."

ye might well bear with him--There would be an excuse for your conduct,
though a bad one (for ye ought to give heed to no Gospel other than what
ye have already heard from me, [Gal
1:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#006)); but the false teachers do not
even pretend they have "another Jesus" and a "different Gospel" to bring
before you; they merely try to supplant me, your accredited Teacher. Yet
ye not only "bear with" them, but prefer them.

[2 Corinthians 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co2 11:5</span></span>

For--My claim is superior to that of the false teachers, "For," &c.

I suppose--I reckon \[ALFORD\].

I was not--Greek, "That I have not been, and am not."

the very chiefest apostles--James, Peter, and John, the witnesses of
Christ's transfiguration and agony in Gethsemane. Rather, "those
overmuch apostles," those surpassers of the apostles in their own
esteem. This sense is proved by the fact that the context contains no
comparison between him and the apostles, but only between him and the
false teachers; [Co2 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#006) also alludes
to these, and not to the apostles; compare also the parallel phrase,
"false apostles" (see on [Co2 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#013)
and [Co2 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#011)) \[ALFORD\].

[2 Corinthians 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co2 11:6</span></span>

rude--Greek, "a common man"; a "laic"; not rhetorically trained;
unskilled in finish of diction. [Co1
2:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#001), [Co1
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#013); [Co2
10:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#010), shows his words were not
without weight, though his "speech" was deficient in oratorical
artifice. "Yet I am not so in my knowledge" ([Co2
12:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#001); [Eph
3:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#001)).

have been . . . made manifest--Read with the oldest manuscripts, "We
have made things (Gospel truths) manifest," thus showing our
"knowledge." English Version would mean, I leave it to yourselves to
decide whether I be rude in speech . . . : for we have been thoroughly
(literally, "in everything") made manifest among you (literally, "in
respect to you"; "in relation to you"). He had not by reserve kept back
his "knowledge" in divine mysteries from them ([Co2
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#017); [Co2
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#002); [Act
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#020), [Act
20:27](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#027)).

in all things--The Greek rather favors the translation, "among all men";
the sense then is, we have manifested the whole truth among all men with
a view to your benefit \[ALFORD\]. But the Greek in [Phi
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#012), "In each thing and in all
things," sanctions English Version, which gives a clearer sense.

[2 Corinthians 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co2 11:7</span></span>

Have I--literally, "OR have I?" Connected with [Co2
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#006), "Or will any of you make it an
objection that I have preached to you gratuitously?" He leaves their
good feeling to give the answer, that this, so far from being an
objection, was a decided superiority in him above the false apostles
([Co1 9:6-15](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#006)).

abasing myself--in my mode of living, waiving my right of maintenance,
and earning it by manual labor; perhaps with slaves as his fellow
laborers ([Act 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#003); [Phi
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#012)).

ye . . . exalted--spiritually, by your admission to Gospel privileges.

because--"in that."

gospel of God--"of God" implies its divine glory to which they were
admitted.

freely--"without charge."

[2 Corinthians 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co2 11:8</span></span>

I robbed--that is, took from them in order to spare you more than what
was their fair share of contribution to my maintenance, for example, the
Philippian Church ([Phi 4:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#015)).

wages--"subsidy."

to do you service--Greek, "with a view to ministration to you"; compare
"supplied" (Greek, "in addition"), [Co2
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#009), implying, he brought with him
from the Macedonians, supplies towards his maintenance at Corinth; and
([Co2 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#009)) when those resources
failed ("when I wanted") he received a new supply, while there, from the
same source.

[2 Corinthians 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co2 11:9</span></span>

wanted--"was in want."

chargeable--Greek, "burdensome," literally, "to torpify," and so to
oppress. JEROME says it is a Cilician word ([Co2
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#014), [Co2
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#016)).

the brethren which came--rather, as Greek, "the brethren when they
came." Perhaps Timotheus and Silas ([Act
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#001), [Act
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#005)). Compare [Phi
4:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#015), which refers to donations
received from the Philippians (who were in Macedonia) at two distinct
periods ("once and again"), one at Thessalonica, the other after his
departure from Macedonia, that is, when he came into Achaia to Corinth
(from the church in which city he would receive no help); and this "in
the beginning of the Gospel," that is, at its first preaching in these
parts. Thus all three, the two Epistles and history, mutually, and no
doubt undesignedly, coincide; a sure test of genuineness.

supplied--Greek, "supplied in addition," namely, in addition to their
former contributions; or as BENGEL, in addition to the supply obtained
by my own manual labor.

[2 Corinthians 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co2 11:10</span></span>

Greek, "There is (the) truth of Christ in me that," &c. ([Rom
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#001)).

no man shall stop me of--The oldest manuscripts read, "This boasting
shall not be shut (that is, stopped) as regards me." "Boasting is as it
were personified . . . shall not have its mouth stopped as regards me"
\[ALFORD\].

[2 Corinthians 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co2 11:11</span></span>

Love is often offended at its favors being not accepted, as though the
party to whom they are offered wished to be under no obligation to the
offerer.

[2 Corinthians 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co2 11:12</span></span>

I will do--I will continue to decline help.

occasion--Greek, "the occasion," namely, of misrepresenting my motives,
which would be afforded to my detractors, if I accepted help.

that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we--BENGEL joins this
clause with "the occasion," namely, of glorying or boasting; the
occasion "that they may be found (a point wherein they glory) even as
we," that is, quite as disinterested, or virtually, quite as
gain-seeking and self-seeking. It cannot mean that the false teachers
taught gratuitously even as Paul (compare [Co2
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#020); [Co1
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#012)). ALFORD less clearly explains by
reference to [Co2 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#018), &c., where
the "glorying" here is taken up and described as "glorying after the
flesh"; thus it means, that in the matters of which they beast they may
be found even as we, that is, we may been a fair and equal footing; that
there may be no adventitious comparisons made between us, arising out of
misrepresentations of my course of procedure, but that in every matter
of boasting we may be fairly compared and judged by facts; FOR ([Co2
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#013)) realities they have none, no
weapons but misrepresentation, being false apostles.

[2 Corinthians 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co2 11:13</span></span>

For--reason why he is unwilling they should be thought like him
\[BENGEL\].

such--they and those like them.

false apostles--those "overmuch apostles" (see on [Co2
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#005)) are no apostles at all.

deceitful workers--pretending to be "workmen" for the Lord, and really
seeking their own gain.

[2 Corinthians 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co2 11:14</span></span>

is transformed--rather, "transforms himself" (compare [Job
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#006)); habitually; the first occasion
of his doing so was in tempting Eve. "Himself" is emphatical: If their
master himself, who is the "prince of darkness," the most alien to
light, does so, it is less marvellous in the case of them who are his
servants ([Luk 22:54](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#054); [Eph
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#012)).

[2 Corinthians 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co2 11:15</span></span>

no great thing--no difficult matter.

if his ministers also--as well as himself.

righteousness--answering to "light" ([Co2
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#014)); the manifestation wherewith
God reveals Himself in Christ ([Mat
6:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#033); [Rom
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#017)).

end--The test of things is the end which strips off every specious form
into which Satan's agents may now "transform" themselves (compare [Phi
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#019), [Phi
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#021)).

according to their works--not according to their pretensions.

[2 Corinthians 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co2 11:16</span></span>

I say again--again taking up from [Co2
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#001) the anticipatory apology for his
boasting.

if otherwise--but if ye will not grant this; if ye will think me a fool.

yet as a fool--"yet even as a fool receive me"; grant me the indulgent
hearing conceded even to one suspected of folly. The Greek denotes one
who does not rightly use his mental powers; not having the idea of blame
necessarily attached to it; one deceived by foolish vanities, yet
boasting himself \[TITTMANN\], ([Co2
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#017), [Co2
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#019)).

that I--The oldest manuscripts read, "that I, too," namely, as well as
they, may boast myself.

[2 Corinthians 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">co2 11:17</span></span>

not after the Lord--By inspired guidance he excepts this "glorying" or
"boasting" from the inspired authoritativeness which belongs to all else
that he wrote; even this boasting, though undesirable in itself, was
permitted by the Spirit, taking into account its aim, namely, to draw
off the Corinthians from their false teachers to the apostle. Therefore
this passage gives no proof that any portion of Scripture is uninspired.
It merely guards against his boasting being made a justification of
boasting in general, which is not ordinarily "after the Lord," that is,
consistent with Christian humility.

foolishly--Greek, "in foolishness."

confidence of boasting-- ([Co2 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#004)).

[2 Corinthians 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">co2 11:18</span></span>

many--including the "false teachers."

after the flesh--as fleshly men are wont to boast, namely, of external
advantages, as their birth, doings, &c. (compare [Co2
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#022)).

I will glory also--that is, I also will boast of such fleshly
advantages, to show you that even in these I am not their inferiors, and
therefore ought not to be supplanted by them in your esteem; though
these are not what I desire to glory in ([Co2
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#017)).

[2 Corinthians 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">co2 11:19</span></span>

gladly--willingly. Irony. A plea why they should "bear with" ([Co2
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#001)) him in his folly, that is,
boasting; ye are, in sooth, so "wise" ([Co1
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#008), [Co1
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#010); Paul's real view of their wisdom
was very different, [Co1 3:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#001))
yourselves that ye can "bear with" the folly of others more
complacently. Not only can ye do so, but ye are actually doing this and
more.

[2 Corinthians 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">co2 11:20</span></span>

For--Ye may well "bear with" fools; for ye even "bear with" oppressors.
Translate, "Ye bear with them."

a man--as the false apostles do.

bring you into bondage--to himself. Translate "brings," not "bring"; for
the case is not merely a supposed case, but a case actually then
occurring. Also "devours" (namely, by exactions, [Mat
23:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#024); [Psa
53:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#004)), "takes," "exalts," "smites."

take of you--So the Greek for "take" is used for "take away from" ([Rev
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#004)). ALFORD translates, as in [Co2
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#016), "catches you."

exalt himself--under the pretext of apostolic dignity.

smite you on the face--under the pretext of divine zeal. The height of
insolence on their part, and of servile endurance on yours ([Kg1
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#024); [Neh
13:25](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#025); [Luk
22:64](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#064); [Act
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#002); [Ti1
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#003)).

[2 Corinthians 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">co2 11:21</span></span>

as concerning reproach--rather, "by way of dishonor (that is,
self-disparagement) I say it."

as though we . . . weak--in not similarly ([Co2
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#020)) showing our power over you. "An
ironical reminiscence of his own abstinence when among them from all
these acts of self-exaltation at their expense" (as if such abstinence
was weakness) \[ALFORD\]. The "we" is emphatically contrasted with the
false teachers who so oppressively displayed their power. I speak so as
though WE had been weak when with you, because we did not show our power
this way. Howbeit (we are not really weak; for), whereinsoever any is
bold . . . I am bold also.

[2 Corinthians 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">co2 11:22</span></span>

Hebrews . . . Israelites . . . the seed of Abraham--A climax. "Hebrews,"
referring to the language and nationality; "Israelites," to the
theocracy and descent from Israel, the "prince who prevailed with God"
([Rom 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#004)); "the seed of Abraham," to
the claim to a share in the Messiah ([Rom
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#001); [Rom
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#007)). Compare [Phi
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#005), "An Hebrew of the Hebrews," not
an Hellenist or Greek-speaking Jew, but a Hebrew in tongue, and sprung
from Hebrews.

[2 Corinthians 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">co2 11:23</span></span>

I speak as a fool--rather, as Greek, "I speak as if beside myself";
stronger than "as a fool."

I am more--namely, in respect to the credentials and manifestations of
my ministry, more faithful and self-denying; and richer in tokens of
God's recognition of my ministry. Old authorities read the order thus,
"In prisons above measures, in stripes more abundantly" (English
Version, less accurately, "more frequent"). Acts 16:23-40 records one
case of his imprisonment with stripes. CLEMENT OF ROME \[First Epistle
to the Corinthians\] describes him as having suffered bonds seven times.

in death oft-- ([Co2 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#010); [Act
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#023); [Act
13:50](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#050); [Act
14:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#005), [Act
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#019); [Act
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#005), [Act

[Deu 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#003) ordained that not more than
forty stripes should be inflicted To avoid exceeding this number, they
gave one short of it: thirteen strokes with a treble lash \[BENGEL\].
This is one of those minute agreements with Jewish usage, which a forger
would have not been likely to observe.

The beating by Roman magistrates at Philippi ([Act
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#023)) is the only one recorded in
Acts, which does not profess to give a complete journal of his life, but
only a sketch of it in connection with the design of the book, namely,
to give an outline of the history of the Gospel Church from its
foundation at Jerusalem, to the period of its reaching Rome, the capital
of the Gentile world.

once was I stoned-- ([Act 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#019)).

thrice . . . shipwreck--before the shipwreck at Melita ([Act
27:44](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#044)). Probably in some of his
voyages from Tarsus, where he stayed for some time after his conversion,
and from which, as being a seafaring place, he was likely to make
missionary voyages to adjoining places ([Act
9:30](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#030); [Act
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#025); [Gal
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#021)).

a night and a day . . . in the deep--probably in part swimming or in an
open boat.

[2 Corinthians 11:26](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">co2 11:26</span></span>

In--rather, "By": connected with [Co2
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#023), but now not with "in," as
there, and as in [Co2 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#027), where
again he passes to the idea of surrounding circumstances or environments
\[ALFORD, ELLICOTT and others\].

waters--rather, as Greek, "rivers," namely, perils by the flooding of
rivers, as on the road often traversed by Paul between Jerusalem and
Antioch, crossed as it is by the torrents rushing down from Lebanon. So
the traveller Sport lost his life.

robbers--perhaps in his journey from Perga to Antioch in Pisidia.
Pisidia was notorious for robbers; as indeed were all the mountains that
divided the high land of Asia from the sea.

the heathen--Gentiles.

in the city--Damascus, [Act 9:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#024);
Jerusalem, [Act 9:29](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#029); Ephesus, [Act
19:23](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#023).

false brethren-- ([Gal 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#004)).

[2 Corinthians 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">co2 11:27</span></span>

fastings--voluntary, in order to kindle devotions ([Act
13:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#002); [Act
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#023); [Co1
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#027)); for they are distinguished from
"hunger and thirst," which were involuntary \[GROTIUS\]. However, see on
[Co2 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#005). The context refers solely to
hardships, not to self-imposed devotional mortification. "Hunger and
thirst" are not synonymous with "foodlessness" (as the Greek of
"fasting" means), but are its consequences.

cold . . . nakedness--"cold" resulting from "nakedness," or insufficient
clothing, as the Greek often means: as "hunger and thirst" result from
"foodlessness." (Compare [Act 28:2](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#002);
[Rom 8:35](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#035)). "When we remember that he
who endured all this was a man constantly suffering from infirm health
([Co2 4:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#007); [Co2
12:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#007); [Gal
4:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#013)), such heroic self-devotion
seems almost superhuman" \[CONYBEARE and HOWSON\].

[2 Corinthians 11:28](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">co2 11:28</span></span>

without--"Beside" trials falling on me externally, just recounted, there
is "that which cometh upon me (literally, the impetuous concourse to me
of business; properly, a crowd rising up against one again and again,
and ready to bear him down), the care of all the churches" (including
those not yet seen in the flesh, [Col
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#001)): an internal and more weighty
anxiety. But the oldest manuscripts for "that which cometh," read, "the
pressure": "the pressing care-taking" or "inspection that is upon me
daily." ALFORD translates, "Omitting what is BESIDES"; namely, those
other trials besides those recounted. But the Vulgate, ESTIUS, and
BENGEL, support English Version.

the care--The Greek implies, "my anxious solicitude for all the
churches."

[2 Corinthians 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">co2 11:29</span></span>

I . . . weak--in condescending sympathy with the weak ([Co1
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#022)). "Care generates sympathy, which
causes the minister of Christ personally to enter into the feelings of
all his people, as if he stood in their position, so as to accommodate
himself to all" \[CALVIN\].

offended--by some stumbling-block put in his way by others: the "weak"
is most liable to be "offended."

I burn not--The "I" in the Greek is emphatic, which it is not in the
former clause, "I am not weak." I not only enter into the feeling of the
party offended, but I burn with indignation at the offender, I myself
taking up his cause as my own. "Who meets with a stumbling-block and I
am not disturbed even more than himself" \[NEANDER\].

[2 Corinthians 11:30](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">co2 11:30</span></span>

glory of . . . infirmities--A striking contrast! Glorying or boasting of
what others make matter of shame, namely, infirmities; for instance, his
humbling mode of escape in a basket ([Co2
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#033)). A character utterly
incompatible with that of an enthusiast (compare [Co2
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#005), [Co2
12:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#009)).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">co2 11:31</span></span>

This solemn asseveration refers to what follows. The persecution at
Damascus was one of the first and greatest, and having no human witness
of it to adduce to the Corinthians, as being a fact that happened long
before and was known to few, he appeals to God for its truth. Luke ([Act
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#025)) afterwards recorded it (compare
[Gal 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#020)), \[BENGEL\]. It may ALSO
refer to the revelation in [Co2 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#001),
standing in beautiful contrast to his humiliating escape from Damascus.

[2 Corinthians 11:32](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">co2 11:32</span></span>

governor--Greek, "Ethnarch": a Jewish officer to whom heathen rulers
gave authority over Jews in large cities where they were numerous. He
was in this case under Aretas, king of Arabia. Damascus was in a Roman
province. But at this time, A.D. 38 or 39, three years after Paul's
conversion, A.D. 36, Aretas, against whom the Emperor Tiberius as the
ally of Herod Agrippa had sent an army under Vitellius, had got
possession of Damascus on the death of the emperor, and the consequent
interruption of Vitellius' operations. His possession of it was put an
end to immediately after by the Romans \[NEANDER\]. Rather, it was
granted by Caligula (A.D. 38) to Aretas, whose predecessors had
possessed it. This is proved by our having no Damascus coins of Caligula
or Claudius, though we do have of their immediate imperial predecessors
and successors \[ALFORD\].
