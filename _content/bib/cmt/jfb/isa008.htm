<p>
<p>great--suitable, for letters large enough to be read by all. 
<p>
<p>roll--rather, tablet of wood, metal, or stone (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#008">Isa 30:8</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#002">Hab 2:2</A>); sometimes coated with wax, upon which characters were traced with a pointed instrument, or iron stylus; skins and papyrus were also used (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#007">Isa 19:7</A>). 
<p>
<p>man's pen--that is, in ordinary characters which the humblest can read (so <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#002">Hab 2:2</A>). Hebrew, enosh means a "common man," is contrasted with the upper ranks (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#017">Rev 21:17</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#005">Rom 3:5</A>). Not in hieroglyphics. The object was that, after the event, all might see that it had been predicted by Isaiah. 
<p>
<p>concerning--the title and subject of the prophecy. 
<p>
<p>Maher-shalal-hash-baz--"They (that is, the Assyrians) hasten to the spoil (namely, to spoil Syria and Samaria), they speed to the prey" [GESENIUS]. Otherwise, "The spoil (that is, spoiler) hastens, the rapine speeds forward" [MAURER].

<p>
<p>Uriah--an accomplice of Ahaz in idolatry, and therefore a witness not likely to assist the prophet of God in getting up a prophecy after the event (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#010">Kg2 16:10</A>). The witnesses were in order that when the event should come, they might testify that the tablet containing the prophecy had been inscribed with it at the time that it professed. 
<p>
<p>Zechariah-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#013">Ch2 29:13</A>).

Immanuel is even in this sense distinct from Maher-shalal-hash-baz. Thus nineteen months at least intervene from the prophecy (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014">Isa 7:14</A>), nine before the birth of Immanuel, and ten from that time to the birth of Maher-shalal-hash-baz: adding eleven or twelve months before the latter could cry, "Father" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#004">Isa 8:4</A>), we have about three years in all, agreeing with <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#015">Isa 7:15-16</A>.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">isa 8:6</A></FONT></span></p>waters of Shiloah . . . softly--Their source is on the southeast of Zion and east of Jerusalem. It means "sent," the water being sent through an aqueduct (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#007">Joh 9:7</A>). Figurative for the mild, though now weak, sway of the house of David; in the highest sense Shiloah expresses the benignant sway of Jehovah in the theocracy, administered through David. Contrast to the violent Euphrates, "the river" that typifies Assyria (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#007">Isa 8:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#015">Rev 17:15</A>). "This people" refers both to Israel, which preferred an alliance with Rezin of Syria to one with the kings of Judah, and to Judah, a party in which seems to have favored the pretentions of the son of Tabeal against David's line (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#006">Isa 7:6</A>); also to Judah's desire to seek an Assyrian alliance is included in the censure (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#017">Isa 7:17</A>). <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#014">Isa 8:14</A> shows that both nations are meant; both alike rejected the divine Shiloah. Not "My people," as elsewhere, when God expresses favor, but "this people" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#009">Isa 6:9</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#007">Isaiah 8:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">isa 8:7</A></FONT></span></p>therefore--for the reason given in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#006">Isa 8:6</A>, the Assyrian flood, which is first to overflood Syria and Samaria, shall rise high enough to reach rebel Judah also (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#008">Isa 8:8</A>). 
<p>
<p>the river--Euphrates swollen in spring by the melting of the snow of the Armenian mountains (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#006">Isa 8:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#020">Isa 7:20</A>). 
<p>
<p>all his glory--Eastern kings travel with a gorgeous retinue. 
<p>
<p>channels--natural and artificial in the level region, Mesopotamia.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#008">Isaiah 8:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">isa 8:8</A></FONT></span></p>pass through--The flood shall not stop at Syria and Samaria, but shall penetrate into Judea. 
<p>
<p>the neck--When the waters reach to the neck, a man is near drowning; still the head is not said to be overflowed. Jerusalem, elevated on hills, is the head. The danger shall be so imminent as to reach near it at Sennacherib's invasion in Hezekiah's reign; but it shall be spared (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#028">Isa 30:28</A>). 
<p>
<p>wings--the extreme bands of the Assyrian armies, fulfilled (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#001">Isa 36:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#025">Isa 37:25</A>). 
<p>
<p>thy land, O Immanuel--Though temporarily applied to Isaiah's son, in the full sense this is applicable only to Messiah, that Judea is His, was, and still is, a pledge that, however sorely overwhelmed, it shall be saved at last; the "head" is safe even now, waiting for the times of restoration (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#006">Act 1:6</A>); at the same time these words imply that, notwithstanding the temporary deliverance from Syria and Israel, implied in "Immanuel," the greatest calamities are to follow to Judah.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#009">Isaiah 8:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">isa 8:9</A></FONT></span></p>Associate yourselves--rather, "Raise tumults," or, Rage, that is, Do your worst [MAURER], referring perhaps to the attack of Rezin and Pekah on Jerusalem. 
<p>
<p>and . . . be broken in pieces--rather, "yet ye shall be thrown into consternation." Imperative in the Hebrew, according to the idiom whereby the second of two imperatives implies the future, namely, the consequence of the action contained in the first (so <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#009">Isa 6:9</A>). The name "Immanuel" in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#008">Isa 8:8</A> (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#010">Isa 8:10</A>) suggests the thought of the ultimate safety of Immanuel's land, both from its present two invaders, and even from the Assyrians, notwithstanding the grievous flood, wherewith the previous verses foretell they shall deluge it. The succession of the house of David cannot be set aside in Judah, for Immanuel Messiah is to be born in it as heir of David, of whom Isaiah's son is but a type (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#004">Isa 9:4</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006">Isa 9:6</A>). 
<p>
<p>give ear . . . far countries--witness the discomfiture of Judah's enemies. The prophecy probably looks on also to the final conspiracy of Antichrist and his supporters against the Heir of David's throne in the latter days and their utter overthrow [HORSLEY]. 
<p>
<p>gird yourselves . . . gird yourselves--The repetition expresses vehemently the certainty of their being thrown into consternation (not as English Version, "broken in pieces").

MAURER, as English Version, "with the impetus of His hand," that is, the felt impulse of His inspiration in my mind (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#017">Jer 15:17</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#003">Eze 1:3</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#014">Eze 3:14</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#022">Eze 3:22</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#001">Eze 37:1</A>).

<p>
<p>both . . . houses--Israel and Judah. Here again the prophecy expands beyond the temporary application in Ahaz' time. The very stone, Immanuel, which would have been a sanctuary on belief, becomes a fatal stumbling-block through unbelief. Jesus Christ refers to this in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#044">Mat 21:44</A>. (Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#004">Deu 32:4</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#015">Deu 32:15</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#018">Deu 32:18</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#030">Deu 32:30-31</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#037">Deu 32:37</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#034">Dan 2:34</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#033">Rom 9:33</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#008">Pe1 2:8</A>).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">isa 8:16</A></FONT></span></p>Bind up . . . seal--What Isaiah had before briefly noted by inscribing Maher-shalal-hash-baz in a tablet, fixed up in some public place, he afterwards wrote out more in detail in a parchment roll (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#008">Isa 30:8</A>); this he is now to seal up, not merely in order that nothing may be added to, or taken from it, as being complete, but to imply that it relates to distant events, and is therefore to be a sealed and not understood testimony (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#009">Isa 6:9-10</A>), except in part among God's "disciples," that is, those who "sanctify the Lord" by obedient trust (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#014">Psa 25:14</A>). Subsequent revelations would afterwards clear up what now was dark. So the Apocalypse explains what in Daniel was left unexplained (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#026">Dan 8:26</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#009">Dan 12:9</A>).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">isa 8:18</A></FONT></span></p>I and the children--Isaiah means "salvation of Jehovah"; His children's names, also (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#003">Isa 7:3</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014">Isa 7:14</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#003">Isa 8:3</A>), were "signs" suggestive of the coming and final deliverance. 
<p>
<p>wonders--that is, symbols of the future (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#003">Isa 20:3</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#008">Zac 3:8</A>). "Behold I . . . me" is quoted in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#013">Heb 2:13</A> to prove the manhood of the Messiah. This is the main and ultimate fulfilment of the prophecy; its temporary meaning is applied to Ahaz' time. Isaiah typically, in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#017">Isa 8:17-18</A>, personates Messiah, who is at once "Father" and "Son," Isaiah and Immanuel, "Child" and "Mighty God," and is therefore called here a "wonder," as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006">Isa 9:6</A>, "Wonderful." Hence in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#013">Heb 2:13</A>, believers are called His "children"; but in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#011">Isa 8:11-12</A>, His "brethren." On "the Lord hath given me," see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#037">Joh 6:37</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#039">Joh 6:39</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#029">Joh 10:29</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#012">Joh 17:12</A>.

<p>them . . . familiar spirits--necromancers, spirit charmers. So Saul, when he had forsaken God (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#007">Sa1 28:7</A>, &amp;c.), consulted the witch of En-dor in his difficulties. These follow in the wake of idolatry, which prevailed under Ahaz (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#003">Kg2 16:3-4</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#010">Kg2 16:10</A>). He copied the soothsaying as he did the idolatrous "altar" of Damascus (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#006">Lev 20:6</A>, which forbids it, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#003">Isa 19:3</A>). 
<p>
<p>wizards--men claiming supernatural knowledge; from the old English, "to wit," that is, know. 
<p>
<p>peep--rather "chirp faintly," as young birds do; this sound was generally ascribed to departed spirits; by ventriloquism the soothsayers caused a low sound to proceed as from a grave, or dead person. Hence the Septuagint renders the Hebrew for "necromancers" here "ventriloquists" (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#004">Isa 29:4</A>).

<p>
<p>if they speak not . . . it is because--English Version understands "they" as the necromancers. But the Hebrew rendered "because" is not this but "who"; and "if not," ought rather to be "shall they not"; or, truly they shall speak according to this word, who have no morning light (so the Hebrew, that is, prosperity after the night of sorrows) dawning on them [MAURER and G. V. SMITH]. They who are in the dark night of trial, without a dawn of hope, shall surely say so, Do not seek, as we did, to necromancy, but to the law," &amp;c. The law perhaps includes here the law of Moses, which was the "Magna Charta" on which prophetism commented [KITTO].

(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#031">Deu 32:31</A>). But now they are given over to despair. Therefore, while seeing the truth of God, they only "curse their King and God"; foreshadowing the future, like conduct of those belonging to the "kingdom of the beast," when they shall be visited with divine plagues (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#011">Rev 16:11</A>; compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#012">Jer 18:12</A>). 
<p>
<p>through it--namely, the land. 
<p>
<p>hardly bestead--oppressed with anxiety. 
<p>
<p>hungry--a more grievous famine than the temporary one in Ahaz' time, owing to Assyria; then there was some food, but none now (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#015">Isa 7:15</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#022">Isa 7:22</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#003">Lev 26:3-5</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#014">Lev 26:14-16</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#020">Lev 26:20</A>). 
<p>
<p>their king . . . God--Jehovah, King of the Jews (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#002">Psa 5:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#024">Psa 68:24</A>). 
<p>
<p>look upward . . . unto the earth--Whether they look up to heaven, or down towards the land of Judea, nothing but despair shall present itself. 
<p>
<p>dimness of anguish--darkness of distress (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#027">Pro 1:27</A>). 
<p>
<p>driven to darkness--rather, "thick darkness" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#012">Jer 23:12</A>). Driven onward, as by a sweeping storm. The Jewish rejection of "their King and God," Messiah, was followed by all these awful calamities.
