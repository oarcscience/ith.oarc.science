### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#001)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 23:1</span></span>

DAVID RESCUES KEILAH. ([Sa1 23:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#001))

Then they told David--rather, "now they had told"; for this information
had reached him previous to his hearing ([Sa1
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#006)) of the Nob tragedy.

Keilah--a city in the west of Judah ([Jos
15:44](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#044)), not far from the forest of
Hareth.

and they rob the threshing-floors--These were commonly situated on the
fields and were open to the wind ([Jdg
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#011); [Rut
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#002)).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 23:2</span></span>

David inquired of the Lord--most probably through Gad ([Sa2
24:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#011); [Ch1
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#009)), who was present in David's camp
([Sa1 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#005)), probably by the
recommendation of Samuel. To repel unprovoked assaults on unoffending
people who were engaged in their harvest operations, was a humane and
benevolent service. But it was doubtful how far it was David's duty to
go against a public enemy without the royal commission; and on that
account he asked, and obtained, the divine counsel. A demur on the part
of his men led David to renew the consultation for their satisfaction;
after which, being fully assured of his duty, he encountered the
aggressors and, by a signal victory, delivered the people of Keilah from
further molestation.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 23:6</span></span>

an ephod--in which was the Urim and Thummim ([Exo
28:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#030)). It had, probably, been
committed to his care, while Ahimelech and the other priests repaired to
Gibeah, in obedience to the summons of Saul.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa1 23:7</span></span>

SAUL'S COMING, AND TREACHERY OF THE KEILITES. ([Sa1
23:7-13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#007))

it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah--Saul imagined himself
now certain of his victim, who would be hemmed within a fortified town.
The wish was father to the thought. How wonderfully slow and unwilling
to be convinced by all his experience, that the special protection of
Providence shielded David from all his snares!

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa1 23:8</span></span>

Saul called all the people together to war--not the united tribes of
Israel, but the inhabitants of the adjoining districts. This force was
raised, probably, on the ostensible pretext of opposing the Philistines,
while, in reality, it was secretly to arouse mischief against David.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa1 23:9</span></span>

he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod--The consultation
was made, and the prayer uttered, by means of the priest. The
alternative conditions here described have often been referred to as
illustrating the doctrine of God's foreknowledge and preordination of
events.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa1 23:14</span></span>

DAVID ESCAPES TO ZIPH. ([Sa1 23:14-18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#014))

David abode in the wilderness . . . of Ziph--A mountainous and
sequestered region was generally called a wilderness, and took its name
from some large town in the district. Two miles southeast of Hebron, and
in the midst of a level plain, is Tell-ziph, an isolated and conical
hillock, about a hundred feet high, probably the acropolis \[VAN DE
VELDE\], or the ruins \[ROBINSON\] of the ancient city of Ziph, from
which the surrounding wilderness was called. It seems, anciently, to
have been covered by an extensive woods. The country has for centuries
lost its woods and forests, owing to the devastations caused by man.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa1 23:16</span></span>

Jonathan went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in
God--by the recollection of their mutual covenant. What a victory over
natural feelings and lower considerations must the faith of Jonathan
have won, before he could seek such an interview and give utterance to
such sentiments! To talk with calm and assured confidence of himself and
family being superseded by the man who was his friend by the bonds of a
holy and solemn covenant, could only have been done by one who, superior
to all views of worldly policy, looked at the course of things in the
spirit and through the principles of that theocracy which acknowledged
God as the only and supreme Sovereign of Israel. Neither history nor
fiction depicts the movements of a friendship purer, nobler, and more
self-denying than Jonathan's!

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa1 23:19</span></span>

SAUL PURSUES HIM. ([Sa1 23:19-29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#019))

Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide
himself with us?--From the tell of Ziph a panorama of the whole
surrounding district is to be seen. No wonder, then, that the Ziphites
saw David and his men passing to and fro in the mountains of the
wilderness. Spying him at a distance when he ventured to show himself on
the hill of Hachilah, "on the right hand of the wilderness," that is,
the south side of Ziph, they sent in haste to Saul, to tell him of the
lurking place of his enemy \[VAN DE VELDE\].

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">sa1 23:25</span></span>

David . . . came down into a rock, and abode in the wilderness of
Maon--Tell Main, the hillock on which was situated the ancient Maon
([Jos 15:55](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#055)), and from which the
adjoining wilderness took its name, is one mile north, ten east from
Carmel. The mountain plateau seems here to end. It is true the summit
ridge of the southern hills runs out a long way further towards the
southwest; but towards the southeast the ground sinks more and more down
to a tableland of a lower level, which is called "the plain to the right
hand \[that is, to the south\] of the wilderness" \[VAN DE VELDE\].

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">sa1 23:29</span></span>

David went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds at En-gedi--that
is, "the spring of the wild goats or gazelles"--a name given to it from
the vast number of ibexes or Syrian chamois which inhabit these cliffs
on the western shore of the Dead Sea ([Jos
15:62](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#062)). It is now called Ain Jiddy. On
all sides the country is full of caverns, which might then serve as
lurking places for David and his men, as they do for outlaws at the
present day \[ROBINSON\].
