### [Psalms Chapter 72](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#001)

[Psalms 72:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 72:1</span></span>

For, or literally, "of Solomon." The closing verse rather relates to the
second book of Psalms, of which this is the last, and was perhaps added
by some collector, to intimate that the collection, to which, as chief
author, David's name was appended, was closed. In this view, these may
consistently be the productions of others included, as of Asaph, sons of
Korah, and Solomon; and a few of David's may be placed in the latter
series. The fact that here the usual mode of denoting authorship is
used, is strongly conclusive that Solomon was the author, especially as
no stronger objection appears than what has been now set aside. The
Psalm, in highly wrought figurative style, describes the reign of a king
as "righteous, universal, beneficent, and perpetual." By the older
Jewish and most modern Christian interpreters, it has been referred to
Christ, whose reign, present and prospective, alone corresponds with its
statements. As the imagery of the second Psalm was drawn from the
martial character of David's reign, that of this is from the peaceful
and prosperous state of Solomon's. (Psa. 72:1-19)

Give the king, &c.--a prayer which is equivalent to a prediction.

judgments--the acts, and (figuratively) the principles of a right
government ([Joh 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#022); [Joh
9:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#039)).

righteousness--qualifications for conducting such a government.

king's son--same person as a king--a very proper title for Christ, as
such in both natures.

[Psalms 72:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 72:2</span></span>

The effects of such a government by one thus endowed are detailed.

thy people . . . and thy poor--or, "meek," the pious subjects of his
government.

[Psalms 72:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 72:3</span></span>

As mountains and hills are not usually productive, they are here
selected to show the abundance of peace, being represented as

bringing--or, literally, "bearing" it as a produce.

by righteousness--that is, by means of his eminently just and good
methods of ruling.

[Psalms 72:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 72:4</span></span>

That peace, including prosperity, as an eminent characteristic of
Christ's reign ([Isa 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#004); [Isa
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006); [Isa
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#009)), will be illustrated in the
security provided for the helpless and needy, and the punishment
inflicted on oppressors, whose power to injure or mar the peace of
others will be destroyed (compare [Isa
65:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#025); [Zac
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#010)).

children of the needy--for the needy (compare sons of strangers, [Psa
18:45](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#045) \[Margin\]).

[Psalms 72:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 72:5</span></span>

as long as . . . endure--literally, "with the sun," coeval with its
existence, and before, or, in presence of the moon, while it lasts
(compare [Gen 11:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#028), "before Terah,"
literally, "in presence of," while he lived).

[Psalms 72:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 72:6</span></span>

A beautiful figure expresses the grateful nature of His influence;

[Psalms 72:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 72:7</span></span>

and, carrying out the figure, the results are described in an abundant
production

[Psalms 72:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 72:8</span></span>

The foreign nations mentioned ([Psa
72:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#009)) could not be included in the
limits, if designed to indicate the boundaries of Solomon's kingdom. The
terms, though derived from those used ([Exo
23:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#031); [Deu
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#024)) to denote the possessions of
Israel, must have a wider sense. Thus, "ends of the earth" is never used
of Palestine, but always of the world (compare Margin).

[Psalms 72:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 72:9</span></span>

The extent of the conquests.

They that dwell in the wilderness--the wild, untutored tribes of
deserts.

bow . . . dust--in profound submission. The remotest and wealthiest
nations shall acknowledge Him (compare [Psa
45:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#012)).

[Psalms 72:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 72:12</span></span>

They are not the conquests of arms, but the influences of humane and
peaceful principles (compare [Isa 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#007);
[Isa 11:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001); [Zac
9:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#009)).

[Psalms 72:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 72:15</span></span>

In his prolonged life he will continue to receive the honorable gifts of
the rich, and the prayers of his people shall be made for him, and their
praises given to him.

[Psalms 72:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 72:16</span></span>

The spiritual blessings, as often in Scripture, are set forth by
material, the abundance of which is described by a figure, in which a
"handful" (or literally, "a piece," or small portion) of corn in the
most unpropitious locality, shall produce a crop, waving in the wind in
its luxuriant growth, like the forests of Lebanon.

they of the city . . . earth--This clause denotes the rapid and abundant
increase of population--

of--or, "from"

the city--Jerusalem, the center and seat of the typical kingdom.

flourish--or, glitter as new grass--that is, bloom. This increase
corresponds with the increased productiveness. So, as the gospel
blessings are diffused, there shall arise increasing recipients of them,
out of the Church in which Christ resides as head.

[Psalms 72:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 72:17</span></span>

His name--or, "glorious perfections."

as long as the sun--(Compare [Psa
72:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#005)).

men shall be blessed-- ([Gen 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#003);
[Gen 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#018)).

[Psalms 72:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 72:18</span></span>

These words close the Psalm in terms consistent with the style of the
context, while [Psa 72:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#020) is
evidently, from its prosaic style, an addition for the purpose above
explained \[see on [Psa 72:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#001)\].

[Psalms 72:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 72:20</span></span>

ended--literally, "finished," or completed; the word never denotes
fulfilment, except in a very late usage, as in [Ezr
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001); [Dan
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#007).
