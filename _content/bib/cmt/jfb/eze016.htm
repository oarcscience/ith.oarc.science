<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">eze 16:2</A></FONT></span></p>DETAILED APPLICATION OF THE PARABOLICAL DELINEATION OF THE FIFTEENTH CHAPTER TO JERUSALEM PERSONIFIED AS A DAUGHTER. (Eze. 16:1-63)
<p>
<p>cause Jerusalem to know--Men often are so blind as not to perceive their guilt which is patent to all. "Jerusalem" represents the whole kingdom of Judah.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#003">Ezekiel 16:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">eze 16:3</A></FONT></span></p>birth . . . nativity--thy origin and birth; literally, "thy diggings" (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#001">Isa 51:1</A>) "and thy bringings forth." 
<p>
<p>of . . . Canaan--in which Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob sojourned before going to Egypt, and from which thou didst derive far more of thy innate characteristics than from the virtues of those thy progenitors (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#030">Eze 21:30</A>). 
<p>
<p>an Amorite . . . an Hittite--These, being the most powerful tribes, stand for the whole of the Canaanite nations (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#004">Jos 1:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#009">Amo 2:9</A>), which were so abominably corrupt as to have been doomed to utter extermination by God (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#024">Lev 18:24-25</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#028">Lev 18:28</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#012">Deu 18:12</A>). Translate rather, "the Amorite . . . the Canaanite," that is, these two tribes personified; their wicked characteristics, respectively, were concentrated in the parentage of Israel (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#016">Gen 15:16</A>). "The Hittite" is made their "mother"; alluding to Esau's wives, daughters of Heth, whose ways vexed Rebekah (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#034">Gen 26:34-35</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#046">Gen 27:46</A>), but pleased the degenerate descendants of Jacob, so that these are called, in respect of morals, children of the Hittite (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#045">Eze 16:45</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#004">Ezekiel 16:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">eze 16:4</A></FONT></span></p>Israel's helplessness in her first struggling into national existence, under the image of an infant (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#003">Hos 2:3</A>) cast forth without receiving the commonest acts of parental regard. Its very life was a miracle (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#015">Exo 1:15-22</A>). 
<p>
<p>navel . . . not cut--Without proper attention to the navel cord, the infant just born is liable to die. 
<p>
<p>neither . . . washed in water to supple thee--that is, to make the skin soft. Rather, "for purification"; from an Arabic root [MAURER]. GESENIUS translates as the Margin, "that thou mightest (be presented to thy parents to) be looked upon," as is customary on the birth of a child. 
<p>
<p>salted--Anciently they rubbed infants with salt to make the skin firm.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#005">Ezekiel 16:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">eze 16:5</A></FONT></span></p>cast . . . in . . . open field--The exposure of infants was common in ancient times. 
<p>
<p>to the loathing of thy person--referring to the unsightly aspect of the exposed infant. FAIRBAIRN translates, "With contempt (or disdainful indifference) of thy life."
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#006">Ezekiel 16:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">eze 16:6</A></FONT></span></p>when I passed by--as if a traveller. 
<p>
<p>polluted in . . . blood--but PISCATOR, "ready to be trodden on." 
<p>
<p>I said--In contrast to Israel's helplessness stands God's omnipotent word of grace which bids the outcast little one "live." 
<p>
<p>in thy blood--Though thou wast foul with blood, I said, "Live" [GROTIUS]. "Live in thy blood," that is, Live, but live a life exposed to many deaths, as was the case in the beginnings of Israel's national existence, in order to magnify the grace of God [CALVIN]. The former view is preferable. Spiritually, till the sinner is made sensible of his abject helplessness, he will not appreciate the provisions of God's grace.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#007">Ezekiel 16:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">eze 16:7</A></FONT></span></p>caused . . . to multiply--literally, "I . . . made thee a myriad." 
<p>
<p>bud of . . . field--the produce of the field. In two hundred fifty years they increased from seventy-five persons to eight hundred thousand (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#014">Act 7:14</A>) [CALVIN]. But see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#037">Exo 12:37-38</A>. 
<p>
<p>excellent ornaments--literally, "ornament of ornaments." 
<p>
<p>naked . . . bare-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#003">Hos 2:3</A>). Literally, "nakedness . . . bareness" itself; more emphatic.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#008">Ezekiel 16:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">eze 16:8</A></FONT></span></p>thy time of love--literally, "loves" (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#010">Sol 2:10-13</A>). Thou wast of marriageable age, but none was willing to marry thee, naked as thou wast. I then regarded thee with a look of grace when the full time of thy deliverance was come (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#013">Gen 15:13-14</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#006">Act 7:6-7</A>). It is not she that makes the advance to God, but God to her; she has nothing to entitle her to such notice, yet He regards her not with mere benevolence, but with love, such as one cherishes to the person of his wife (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#003">Sol 1:3-6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#003">Jer 31:3</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#002">Mal 1:2</A>). 
<p>
<p>spread my skirt over thee--the mode of espousals (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#009">Rut 3:9</A>). I betrothed thee (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#037">Deu 4:37</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#015">Deu 10:15</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001">Hos 11:1</A>). The cloak is often used as a bed coverlet in the East. God explains what He means, "I entered into . . . covenant with thee," that is, at Sinai. So Israel became "the wife of God's covenant" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#005">Isa 54:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#014">Jer 3:14</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#019">Hos 2:19-20</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#014">Mal 2:14</A>). 
<p>
<p>thou . . . mine-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005">Exo 19:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#002">Jer 2:2</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#009">Ezekiel 16:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">eze 16:9</A></FONT></span></p>washed I thee--as brides used to pass through a preparatory purification (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#012">Est 2:12</A>). So Israel, before the giving of the law at Sinai (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#014">Exo 19:14</A>); "Moses sanctified the people, and they washed their clothes." So believers (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#011">Co1 6:11</A>). 
<p>
<p>oil--emblem of the Levitical priesthood, the type of Messiah (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#007">Psa 45:7</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#010">Ezekiel 16:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">eze 16:10</A></FONT></span></p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#013">Psa 45:13-14</A>, similarly describes the Church (Israel, the appointed mother of Christendom) adorned as a bride (so <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#010">Isa 61:10</A>). It is Messiah who provides the wedding garment (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#018">Rev 3:18</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#008">Rev 19:8</A>). 
<p>
<p>badgers' skin--tahash; others translate, "seal skins." They formed the over-covering of the tabernacle, which was, as it were, the nuptial tent of God and Israel (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#014">Exo 26:14</A>), and the material of the shoes worn by the Hebrews on festival days. (See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#005">Exo 25:5</A>). 
<p>
<p>fine linen--used by the priests (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#010">Lev 6:10</A>); emblem of purity.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#011">Ezekiel 16:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">eze 16:11</A></FONT></span></p>The marriage gifts to Rebekah (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#022">Gen 24:22</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#047">Gen 24:47</A>).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">eze 16:12</A></FONT></span></p>jewel on thy forehead--rather, "a ring in thy nose" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#021">Isa 3:21</A>). 
<p>
<p>a crown--at once the badge of a bride, and of her being made a queen, as being consort of the King; the very name Israel meaning "a prince of God." So they are called "a kingdom of priests" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#006">Exo 19:6</A>; compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006">Rev 1:6</A>). Though the external blessings bestowed on Israel were great, yet not these, but the internal and spiritual, form the main reference in the kingly marriage to which Israel was advanced.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#013">Ezekiel 16:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">eze 16:13</A></FONT></span></p>flour . . . honey . . . oil--These three mixed form the sweetest cakes; not dry bread and leeks as in Egypt. From raiment He passes to food (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#013">Deu 32:13-14</A>). 
<p>
<p>exceeding beautiful-- <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#002">Psa 48:2</A>, the city; also, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#002">Psa 29:2</A>, the temple.

<p>prosper into a kingdom--exercising empire over surrounding nations.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">eze 16:14</A></FONT></span></p>thy renown . . . among . . . heathen--The theocracy reached its highest point under Solomon, when distant potentates heard of his "fame" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#001">Kg1 10:1</A>, &amp;c.), for example, the queen of Sheba, Hiram, &amp;c. (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#015">Lam 2:15</A>). 
<p>
<p>my comeliness--It was not thine own, but imparted by Me.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#015">Ezekiel 16:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">eze 16:15</A></FONT></span></p>Instead of attributing the glory of her privileges and gifts to God, Israel prided herself on them as her own (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#015">Deu 32:15</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#004">Jer 7:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#011">Mic 3:11</A>), and then wantonly devoted them to her idols (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#008">Hos 2:8</A>; compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#012">Luk 15:12-13</A>). 
<p>
<p>playedst . . . harlot because of thy renown--"didst play the wanton upon thy name" [FAIRBAIRN], namely, by allowing thy renown to lead thee into idolatry and leagues with idolaters (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#021">Isa 1:21</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#008">Isa 57:8</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#002">Jer 3:2</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#006">Jer 3:6</A>). English Version is better, "because of thy renown," that is, relying on it; answering to "thou didst trust in thine own beauty." 
<p>
<p>his it was--Thy beauty was yielded up to every passer-by Israel's zest for the worship of foul idols was but an anxiety to have the approbation of heaven for their carnal lusts, of which the idols were the personification; hence, too, their tendency to wander from Jehovah, who was a restraint on corrupt nature.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#016">Ezekiel 16:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">eze 16:16</A></FONT></span></p>deckedst . . . with divers colours--or, "didst make . . . of divers colors" [FAIRBAIRN]; the metaphor and the literal are here mixed. The high places whereon they sacrificed to Astarte are here compared to tents of divers colors, which an impudent harlot would spread to show her house was open to all [CALVIN]. Compare as to "woven hangings for Astarte" (the right translation for "grove") <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#007">Kg2 23:7</A>. 
<p>
<p>the like . . . shall not come, neither shall . . . be--rather, "have not come, nor shall be." These thy doings are unparalleled in the past, and shall be so in the future.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#017">Ezekiel 16:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">eze 16:17</A></FONT></span></p>my gold . . . my silver-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#008">Hag 2:8</A>). 
<p>
<p>images of men--rather, "of the phallus," the Hindu lingam, or membrum virile [HAVERNICK], deified as the emblem of fecundity; man making his lust his god. English Version, however, is appropriate; Israel being represented as a woman playing the harlot with "male images," that is, images of male gods, as distinguished from female deities.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#018">Ezekiel 16:18</A></p>

<p>
<p>my oil--the holy anointing oil sacred to God (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#022">Exo 30:22-25</A>). Also that used in sacrifices (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#001">Lev 2:1-2</A>).

<p>
<p>set it before them--as a minchah or "meat offering" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#001">Lev 2:1</A>). 
<p>
<p>a sweet savour--literally "a savor of rest," that is, whereby they might be propitiated, and be at peace ("rest") with you; how ridiculous to seek to propitiate gods of wood! 
<p>
<p>thus it was--The fact cannot be denied, for I saw it, and say it was so, saith Jehovah.

This aggravates the guilt of sacrificing them to Molech. 
<p>
<p>to be devoured--not merely to pass through the fire, as sometimes children were made to do (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#021">Lev 18:21</A>) without hurt, but to pass through so as to be made the food of the flame in honor of idols (see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#005">Isa 57:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#031">Jer 7:31</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#005">Jer 19:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#035">Jer 32:35</A>). 
<p>
<p>Is this of thy whoredoms a small matter, that thou hast slain my children--rather, "Were thy whoredoms a small matter (that is, not enough, but) that thou hast slain (that is, must also slay)," &amp;c. As if thy unchastity was not enough, thou hast added this unnatural and sacrilegious cruelty (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#007">Mic 6:7</A>).

Israel forgot her deliverance by God in the infancy of her national life. See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#043">Eze 16:43</A>, to which <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#060">Eze 16:60</A> forms a lovely contrast (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#002">Jer 2:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001">Hos 11:1</A>).

<p>thy beauty . . . abhorred, . . . opened . . . feet to every one--The wanton advances were all on Israel's part; the idolatrous nations yielded to her nothing in return. She had yielded so much that, like a worn-out prostitute, her tempters became weary of her. When the Church lowers her testimony for God to the carnal tastes of the world, with a view to conciliation, she loses everything and gains nothing.

This applies to the guilty who should be utterly destroyed (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#041">Eze 16:41-42</A>); but it does not contradict the subsequent promise of restoration to their posterity (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#029">Num 14:29-33</A>), and to the elect remnant of grace [CALVIN].

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_060">eze 16:60</A></FONT></span></p>The promise here bursts forth unexpectedly like the sun from the dark clouds. With all her forgetfulness of God, God still remembers her; showing that her redemption is altogether of grace. Contrast "I will remember," with "thou hast not remembered" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#022">Eze 16:22</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#043">Eze 16:43</A>); also "My covenant," with "Thy covenant" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#061">Eze 16:61</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#045">Psa 106:45</A>); then the effect produced on her is (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#063">Eze 16:63</A>) "that thou mayest remember." God's promise was one of promise and of grace. The law, in its letter, was Israel's (thy) covenant, and in this restricted view was long subsequent (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#017">Gal 3:17</A>). Israel interpreted it as a covenant of works, which she while boasting of, failed to fulfil, and so fell under its condemnation (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#003">Co2 3:3</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#006">Co2 3:6</A>). The law, in its spirit, contains the germ of the Gospel; the New Testament is the full development of the Old, the husk of the outer form being laid aside when the inner spirit was fulfilled in Messiah. God's covenant with Israel, in the person of Abraham, was the reason why, notwithstanding all her guilt, mercy was, and is, in store for her. Therefore the heathen or Gentile nations must come to her for blessings, not she to them. 
<p>
<p>everlasting covenant-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#026">Eze 37:26</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#005">Sa2 23:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#003">Isa 55:3</A>). The temporary forms of the law were to be laid aside, that in its permanent and "everlasting" spirit it might be established (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#031">Jer 31:31-37</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#040">Jer 32:40</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#004">Jer 50:4-5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#008">Heb 8:8-13</A>).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_061">eze 16:61</A></FONT></span></p>thou shalt remember--It is God who first remembers her before she remembers Him and her own ways before Him (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#060">Eze 16:60</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#043">Eze 20:43</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#031">Eze 36:31</A>). 
<p>
<p>ashamed--the fruit of repentance (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#010">Co2 7:10-11</A>). None please God unless those who displease themselves; a foretaste of the Gospel (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#009">Luk 18:9-14</A>). 
<p>
<p>I will give them unto thee for daughters-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#001">Isa 54:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#003">Isa 60:3-4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#026">Gal 4:26</A>, &amp;c.). All the heathen nations, not merely Sodom and Samaria, are meant by "thy sisters, elder and younger." In Jerusalem first, individual believers were gathered into the elect Church. From Jerusalem the Gospel went forth to gather in individuals of the Gentiles; and Judah with Jerusalem shall also be the first nation which, as such, shall be converted to Christ; and to her the other nations shall attach themselves as believers in Messiah, Jerusalem's King (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#002">Psa 110:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002">Isa 2:2-3</A>). "The king's daughter" in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#012">Psa 45:12-14</A> is Judah; her "companions," as "the daughter of Tyre," are the nations given to her as converts, here called "daughters." 
<p>
<p>not by thy covenant--This does not set aside the Old Testament in its spirit, but in its mere letter on which the Jews had rested, while they broke it: the latter ("thy covenant") was to give place to God's covenant of grace and promise in Christ who "fulfilled" the law. God means, "not that thou on thy part hast stood to the covenant, but that 'I am the Lord, I change not' (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#006">Mal 3:6</A>) from My original love to thee in thy youth" (see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#003">Rom 3:3</A>).

<p>
<p>thou shalt know that I am the Lord--not, as elsewhere, by the judgments falling on thee, but by My so marvellously restoring thee through grace.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#063">Ezekiel 16:63</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_063">eze 16:63</A></FONT></span></p>never open thy mouth--in vindication, or even palliation, of thyself, or expostulation with God for His dealings (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#019">Rom 3:19</A>), when thou seest thine own exceeding unworthiness, and My superabounding grace which has so wonderfully overcome with love thy sin (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#020">Rom 5:20</A>). "If we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#031">Co1 11:31</A>). 
<p>
<p>all that thou hast done--enhancing the grace of God which has pardoned so many and so great sins. Nothing so melts into love and humility as the sense of the riches of God's pardoning grace (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#047">Luk 7:47</A>).
<p>
<p>The date of the prophecy is between the sixth month of Zedekiah's sixth year of reign and the fifth month of the seventh year after the carrying away of Jehoiachin, that is, five years before the destruction of Jerusalem [HENDERSON].
