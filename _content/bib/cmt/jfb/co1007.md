### [1 Corinthians Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#001)

[1 Corinthians 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co1 7:1</span></span>

REPLY TO THEIR INQUIRIES AS TO MARRIAGE; THE GENERAL PRINCIPLE IN OTHER
THINGS IS, ABIDE IN YOUR STATION, FOR THE TIME IS SHORT. (1Co. 7:1-40)

The Corinthians in their letter had probably asked questions which
tended to disparage marriage, and had implied that it was better to
break it off when contracted with an unbeliever.

good--that is, "expedient," because of "the present distress"; that is,
the unsettled state of the world, and the likelihood of persecutions
tearing rudely asunder those bound by marriage ties. [Heb
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#004), in opposition to ascetic and
Romish notions of superior sanctity in celibacy, declares, "Marriage is
HONORABLE IN ALL." Another reason why in some cases celibacy may be a
matter of Christian expediency is stated in [Co1
7:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#034), "that ye may attend upon the
Lord without distraction." But these are exceptional cases, and in
exceptional times, such as those of Paul.

[1 Corinthians 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co1 7:2</span></span>

Here the general rule is given

to avoid fornication--More literally, "on account of fornications," to
which as being very prevalent at Corinth, and not even counted sins
among the heathen, unmarried persons might be tempted. The plural,
"fornications," marks irregular lusts, as contrasted with the unity of
the marriage relation \[BENGEL\].

let every man have--a positive command to all who have not the gift of
continency, in fact to the great majority of the world ([Co1
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#005)). The dignity of marriage is set
forth by Paul ([Eph 5:25-32](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#025)), in the
fact that it signifies the mystical union between Christ and the Church.

[1 Corinthians 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co1 7:3</span></span>

The duty of cohabitation on the part of the married.

due benevolence--The oldest manuscripts read simply, "her due"; that is,
the conjugal cohabitation due by the marriage contract (compare [Co1
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#004)).

[1 Corinthians 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co1 7:4</span></span>

A paradox. She hath not power over her body, and yet it is her own. The
oneness of body in which marriage places husband and wife explains this.
The one complements the other. Neither without the other realizes the
perfect ideal of man.

[1 Corinthians 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co1 7:5</span></span>

Defraud . . . not--namely, of the conjugal duty "due" ([Co1
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#003); compare the Septuagint, [Exo
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#010)).

except it be--"unless perchance" \[ALFORD\].

give yourselves to--literally, "be at leisure for"; be free from
interruptions for; namely, on some special "season," as the Greek for
"time" means (compare [Exo 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#015); [Joe
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#016); [Zac
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#003)).

fasting and prayer--The oldest manuscripts omit "fasting and"; an
interpolation, evidently, of ascetics.

come together--The oldest manuscripts read, "be together," namely, in
the regular state of the married.

Satan--who often thrusts in his temptations to unholy thoughts amidst
the holiest exercises.

for your incontinency--because of your inability to "contain" ([Co1
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#009)) your natural propensities, which
Satan would take advantage of.

[1 Corinthians 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co1 7:6</span></span>

by permission . . . not of commandment--not by God's permission to me to
say it: but, "by way of permission to you, not as a commandment." "This"
refers to the directions, [Co1 7:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#002).

[1 Corinthians 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co1 7:7</span></span>

even as I--having tile gift of continence ([Mat
19:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#011)). This wish does not hold
good absolutely, else the extension of mankind and of the Church would
cease; but relatively to "the present distress" ([Co1
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#026)).

[1 Corinthians 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co1 7:8</span></span>

to the unmarried--in general, of both sexes ([Co1
7:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#010)).

and widows--in particular.

even as I--unmarried ([Co1 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#005)).

[1 Corinthians 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co1 7:9</span></span>

if they cannot contain--that is, "have not continency."

burn--with the secret flame of lust, which lays waste the whole inner
man. (Compare AUGUSTINE \[Holy Virginity\]). The dew of God's grace is
needed to stifle the flame, which otherwise would thrust men at last
into hell-fire.

[1 Corinthians 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co1 7:10</span></span>

not I, but the Lord--(Compare [Co1
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#012), [Co1
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#025), [Co1
7:40](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#040)). In ordinary cases he writes on
inspired apostolic authority ([Co1
14:37](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#037)); but here on the direct
authority of the Lord Himself ([Mar
10:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#011)). In both cases alike the
things written are inspired by the Spirit of God "but not all for all
time, nor all on the primary truths of the faith" \[ALFORD\].

Let not the wife depart--literally, "be separated from." Probably the
separation on either side, whether owing to the husband or to the wife,
is forbidden.

[1 Corinthians 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co1 7:11</span></span>

But and if she depart--or "be separated." If the sin of separation has
been committed, that of a new marriage is not to be added ([Mat
5:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#032)).

be reconciled--by appeasing her husband's displeasure, and recovering
his good will.

let not . . . husband put away . . . wife--In [Mat
5:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#032) the only exception allowed is,
"saving for the cause of fornication."

[1 Corinthians 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co1 7:12</span></span>

to the rest--the other classes (besides "the married," [Co1
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#010), where both husband and wife are
believers) about whom the Corinthians had inquired, namely, those
involved in mixed marriages with unbelievers.

not the Lord--by any direct command spoken by Him.

she be pleased--Greek, "consents": implying his wish in the first
instance, with which hers concurs.

[1 Corinthians 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co1 7:13</span></span>

the woman--a believer.

let her not leave him--"her husband," instead of "him," is the reading
of the oldest manuscripts The Greek for "leave" is the same as in [Co1
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#012), "put away"; translate, "Let her
not put away \[that is, part with\] her husband." The wife had the power
of effecting a divorce by Greek and Roman law.

[1 Corinthians 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co1 7:14</span></span>

sanctified--Those inseparably connected with the people of God are
hallowed thereby, so that the latter may retain the connection without
impairing their own sanctity (compare [Ti1
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#005)); nay, rather imparting to the
former externally some degree of their own hallowed character, and so
preparing the way for the unbeliever becoming at last sanctified
inwardly by faith.

by . . . by--rather, "in . . . in"; that is, in virtue of the marriage
tie between them.

by the husband--The oldest manuscripts read, "by the brother." It is the
fact of the husband being a "brother," that is, a Christian, though the
wife is not so, that sanctifies or hallows the union.

else . . . children unclean--that is, beyond the hallowed pale of God's
people: in contrast to "holy," that is, all that is within the
consecrated limits \[CONYBEARE and HOWSON\]. The phraseology accords
with that of the Jews, who regarded the heathen as "unclean," and all of
the elect nation as "holy," that is, partakers of the holy covenant.
Children were included in the covenant, as God made it not only with
Abraham, but with his "seed after" him ([Gen
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#007)). So the faith of one Christian
parent gives to the children a near relationship to the Church, just as
if both parents were Christians (compare [Rom
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#016)). Timothy, the bearer of this
Epistle, is an instance in point ([Act
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#001)). Paul appeals to the Corinthians
as recognizing the principle, that the infants of heathen parents would
not be admissible to Christian baptism, because there is no faith on the
part of the parents; but where one parent is a believer, the children
are regarded as not aliens from, but admissible even in infancy as
sharers in, the Christian covenant: for the Church presumes that the
believing parent will rear the child in the Christian faith. Infant
baptism tacitly superseded infant circumcision, just as the Christian
Lord's day gradually superseded the Jewish sabbath, without our having
any express command for, or record of, transference. The setting aside
of circumcision and of sabbaths in the case of the Gentiles was indeed
expressly commanded by the apostles and Paul, but the substitution of
infant baptism and of the Lord's day were tacitly adopted, not expressly
enacted. No explicit mention of it occurs till IRENÃ†US in the third
century; but no society of Christians that we read of disputed its
propriety till fifteen hundred years after Christ. Anabaptists would
have us defer baptism till maturity as the child cannot understand the
nature of it. But a child may be made heir of an estate: it is his,
though incapable at the time of using or comprehending its advantage; he
is not hereafter to acquire the title and claim to it: he will hereafter
understand his claim, and be capable of employing his wealth: he will
then, moreover, become responsible for the use he makes of it
\[ARCHBISHOP WHATELY\].

[1 Corinthians 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co1 7:15</span></span>

if . . . depart--that is, wishes for separation. Translate, "separateth
himself": offended with her Christianity, and refusing to live with her
unless she renounce it.

brother or a sister is not under bondage--is not bound to renounce the
faith for the sake of retaining her unbelieving husband \[HAMMOND\]. So
[Deu 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#006); [Mat
10:35-37](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#035); [Luk
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#026). The believer does not lie under
the same obligation in the case of a union with an unbeliever, as in the
case of one with a believer. In the former case he is not bound not to
separate, if the unbeliever separate or "depart," in the latter nothing
but "fornication" justifies separation \[PHOTIUS in Ã†cumenius\].

but God hath called us to peace--Our Christian calling is one that tends
to "peace" ([Rom 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#018)), not
quarrelling; therefore the believer should not ordinarily depart from
the unbelieving consort ([Co1
7:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#012)), on the one hand; and on the
other, in the exceptional case of the unbeliever desiring to depart, the
believer is not bound to force the other party to stay in a state of
continual discord ([Mat 5:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#032)). Better
still it would be not to enter into such unequal alliances at all ([Co1
7:40](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#040); [Co2
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#014)).

[1 Corinthians 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co1 7:16</span></span>

What knowest thou but that by staying with thy unbelieving partner thou
mayest save him or her? Enforcing the precept to stay with the
unbelieving consort ([Co1 7:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#012)). So
Ruth the Moabitess became a convert to her husband's faith: and Joseph
and Moses probably gained over their wives. So conversely the
unbelieving husband may be won by the believing wife ([Pe1
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#001)) \[CALVIN\]. Or else ([Co1
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#015)), if thy unbelieving consort
wishes to depart, let him go, so that thou mayest live "in peace": for
thou canst not be sure of converting him, so as to make it obligatory on
thee at all costs to stay with him against his will \[MENOCHIUS and
ALFORD\].

save--be the instrument of salvation to ([Jam
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#020)).

[1 Corinthians 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">co1 7:17</span></span>

But--Greek, "If not." "Only." Caution that believers should not make
this direction ([Co1 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#016); as ALFORD
explains it) a ground for separating "of themselves" ([Co1
7:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#012)). Or, But if there be no hope
of gaining over the unbeliever, still let the general principle be
maintained, "As the Lord hath allotted to each, as God hath called each,
so let him walk" (so the Greek in the oldest reading); let him walk in
the path allotted to him and wherein he was called. The heavenly calling
does not set aside our earthly callings.

so ordain I in all churches--Ye also therefore should obey.

[1 Corinthians 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">co1 7:18</span></span>

not become uncircumcised--by surgical operation (1 Maccabees 1:15;
JOSEPHUS \[Antiquities, 12.5.1\]). Some Christians in excess of
anti-Jewish feeling might be tempted to this.

let him not be circumcised--as the Judaizing Christians would have him
([Act 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#001), [Act
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#005), [Act
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#024); [Gal
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#002)).

[1 Corinthians 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">co1 7:19</span></span>

Circumcision . . . nothing, but . . . keeping of . . . commandments of
God--namely, is all in all. In [Gal
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#006) this "keeping of the commandments
of God" is defined to be "faith which worketh by love"; and in [Gal
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#015), "a new creature." Circumcision
was a commandment of God: but not for ever, as "love."

[1 Corinthians 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">co1 7:20</span></span>

the same calling--that is, the condition from which he is called a Jew,
a Greek, a slave, or a freeman.

[1 Corinthians 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">co1 7:21</span></span>

care not for it--Let it not be a trouble to thee that thou art a servant
or slave.

use it rather--Continue rather in thy state as a servant ([Co1
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#020); [Gal
3:28](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#028); [Ti1
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#002)). The Greek, "But if even thou
mayest be made free, use it," and the context ([Co1
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#020), [Co1
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#022)) favors this view \[CHRYSOSTOM,
BENGEL, and ALFORD\]. This advice (if this translation be right) is not
absolute, as the spirit of the Gospel is against slavery. What is
advised here is, contentment under one's existing condition ([Co1
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#024)), though an undesirable one,
since in our union with Christ all outward disparities of condition are
compensated ([Co1 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#022)). Be not unduly
impatient to cast off "even" thy condition as a servant by unlawful
means ([Pe1 2:13-18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#013)); as, for example,
Onesimus did by fleeing ([Plm
1:10-18](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#010)). The precept ([Co1
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#023)), "Become not (so the Greek) the
servants of men," implies plainly that slavery is abnormal (compare [Lev
25:42](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#042)). "Men stealers," or slave
dealers, are classed in [Ti1 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#010),
with "murderers" and "perjurers." NEANDER, GROTIUS, &c., explain, "If
called, being a slave, to Christianity, be content--but yet, if also
thou canst be free (as a still additional good, which if thou canst not
attain, be satisfied without it; but which, if offered to thee, is not
to be despised), make use of the opportunity of becoming free, rather
than by neglecting it to remain a slave." I prefer this latter view, as
more according to the tenor of the Gospel, and fully justified by the
Greek.

[1 Corinthians 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">co1 7:22</span></span>

the Lord's freeman-- ([Plm 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#016))
--rather, "freedman." Though a slave externally, spiritually made free
by the Lord: from sin, [Joh 8:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#036); from
the law, [Rom 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#002); from
"circumcision," [Co1 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#019); [Gal
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#001).

Christ's servant-- ([Co1 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#021)). Love
makes Christ's service perfect freedom ([Mat
11:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#029); [Gal
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#013); [Pe1
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#016)).

[1 Corinthians 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">co1 7:23</span></span>

be not ye--Greek, "become not ye." Paul here changes from "thou" ([Co1
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#021)) to "ye." YE ALL are "bought"
with the blood of Christ, whatever be your earthly state ([Co1
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#020)). "Become not servants to men,"
either externally, or spiritually; the former sense applying to the free
alone: the latter to Christian freemen and slaves alike, that they
should not be servile adherents to their party leaders at Corinth ([Co1
3:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#021); [Mat
23:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#008); [Co2
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#020)); nor indeed slaves to men
generally, so far as their condition admits. The external and internal
conditions, so far as is attainable, should correspond, and the former
be subservient to the latter (compare [Co1
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#021), [Co1
7:32-35](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#032)).

[1 Corinthians 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">co1 7:24</span></span>

abide with God--being chiefly careful of the footing on which he stands
towards God rather than that towards men. This clause, "with God,"
limits the similar precept in [Co1
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#020). A man may cease to "abide in the
calling wherein he was called," and yet not violate the precept here. If
a man's calling be not favorable to his "abiding with God" (retaining
holy fellowship with Him), he may use lawful means to change from it
(compare Note, see on [Co1 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#021)).

[1 Corinthians 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">co1 7:25</span></span>

no commandment of the Lord: yet . . . my judgment--I have no express
revelation from the Lord commanding it, but I give my judgment
(opinion); namely, under the ordinary inspiration which accompanied the
apostles in all their canonical writings (compare [Co1
7:40](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#040); [Co1
14:37](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#037); [Th1
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#015)). The Lord inspires me in this
case to give you only a recommendation, which you are free to adopt or
reject--not a positive command. In the second case ([Co1
7:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#010)) it was a positive command;
for the Lord had already made known His will ([Mal
2:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#014); [Mat
5:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#031)). In the third case ([Co1
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#012)), the Old Testament commandment
of God to put away strange wives ([Ezr
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#003)), Paul by the Spirit revokes.

mercy of the Lord-- ([Ti1 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#013)). He
attributes his apostleship and the gifts accompanying it (including
inspiration) to God's grace alone.

faithful--in dispensing to you the inspired directions received by me
from the Lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">co1 7:26</span></span>

I suppose--"I consider."

this--namely, "for a man so to be," that is, in the same state in which
he is ([Co1 7:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#027)).

for--by reason of.

the present distress--the distresses to which believers were then
beginning to be subjected, making the married state less desirable than
the single; and which would prevail throughout the world before the
destruction of Jerusalem, according to Christ's prophecy ([Mat
24:8-21](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#008); compare [Act
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#028)).

[1 Corinthians 7:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">co1 7:27</span></span>

Illustrating the meaning of "so to be," [Co1
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#026). Neither the married (those
"bound to a wife") nor the unmarried (those "loosed from a wife") are to
"seek" a change of state (compare [Co1
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#020), [Co1
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#024)).

trouble in the flesh--Those who marry, he says, shall incur "trouble in
the flesh" (that is, in their outward state, by reason of the present
distress), not sin, which is the trouble of the spirit.

but I spare you--The emphasis in the Greek is on "I." My motive in
advising you so is, to "spare you" such trouble in the flesh. So ALFORD
after CALVIN, BENGEL, and others. ESTIUS from AUGUSTINE explains it, "I
spare you further details of the inconveniences of matrimony, lest even
the incontinent may at the peril of lust be deterred from matrimony:
thus I have regard for your infirmity." The antithesis in the Greek of
"I . . . you" and "such" favors the former.

[1 Corinthians 7:29](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">co1 7:29</span></span>

this I say--A summing up of the whole, wherein he draws the practical
inference from what precedes ([Co1
15:50](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#050)).

the time--the season (so the Greek) of this present dispensation up to
the coming of the Lord ([Rom 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#011)).
He uses the Greek expression which the Lord used in [Luk
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#008); [Mar
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#033).

short--literally, "contracted."

it remaineth--The oldest manuscripts read, "The time (season) is
shortened as to what remains, in order that both they," &c.; that is,
the effect which the shortening of the time ought to have is, "that for
the remaining time (henceforth), both they," &c. The clause, "as to what
remains," though in construction belonging to the previous clause, in
sense belongs to the following. However, CYPRIAN and Vulgate support
English Version.

as though they had none--We ought to consider nothing as our own in real
or permanent possession.

[1 Corinthians 7:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">co1 7:30</span></span>

they that weep . . . wept not--(Compare [Co2
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#010)).

they that buy . . . possessed not--(Compare [Isa
24:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#001)). Christ specifies as the
condemning sin of the men of Sodom not merely their open profligacy, but
that "they bought, they sold," &c., as men whose all was in this world
([Luk 17:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#028)). "Possessed" in the Greek
implies a holding fast of a possession; this the Christian will not do,
for his "enduring substance" is elsewhere ([Heb
10:34](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#034)).

[1 Corinthians 7:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">co1 7:31</span></span>

not abusing it--not abusing it by an overmuch using of it. The meaning
of "abusing" here is, not so much perverting, as using it to the full
\[BENGEL\]. We are to use it, "not to take our fill" of its pursuits as
our chief aim (compare [Luk 10:40-42](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#040)).
As the planets while turning on their own axis, yet revolve round the
sun; so while we do our part in our own worldly sphere, God is to be the
center of all our desires.

fashion--the present fleeting form. Compare [Psa
39:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#006), "vain show"; [Psa
73:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#020), "a dream"; [Jam
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#014), "a vapor."

passeth away--not merely shall pass away, but is now actually passing
away. The image is drawn from a shifting scene in a play represented on
the stage ([Jo1 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#017)). Paul inculcates
not so much the outward denial of earthly things, as the inward spirit
whereby the married and the rich, as well as the unmarried and the poor,
would be ready to sacrifice all for Christ's sake.

[1 Corinthians 7:32](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">co1 7:32</span></span>

without carefulness--I would have you to be not merely "without
trouble," but "without distracting cares" (so the Greek).

careth--if he uses aright the advantages of his condition.

[1 Corinthians 7:34](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">co1 7:34</span></span>

difference also--Not merely the unmarried and the married man differ in
their respective duties, but also the wife and the virgin. Indeed a
woman undergoes a greater change of condition than a man in contracting
marriage.

[1 Corinthians 7:35](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">co1 7:35</span></span>

for your own profit--not to display my apostolic authority.

not . . . cast a snare upon you--image from throwing a noose over an
animal in hunting. Not that by hard injunctions I may entangle you with
the fear of committing sin where there is no sin.

comely--befitting under present circumstances.

attend upon--literally, "assiduously wait on"; sitting down to the duty.
Compare [Luk 10:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#039), Mary; [Luk
2:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#037), "Anna . . . a widow, who
departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers
night and day" ([Ti1 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#005)).

distraction--the same Greek as "cumbered" ([Luk
10:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#040), Martha).

[1 Corinthians 7:36](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">co1 7:36</span></span>

behaveth . . . uncomely--is not treating his daughter well in leaving
her unmarried beyond the flower of her age, and thus debarring her from
the lawful gratification of her natural feeling as a marriageable woman.

need so require--if the exigencies of the case require it; namely,
regard to the feelings and welfare of his daughter. Opposed to "having
no necessity" ([Co1 7:37](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#037)).

let them marry--the daughter and her suitor.

[1 Corinthians 7:37](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">co1 7:37</span></span>

steadfast--not to be turned from his purpose by the obloquy of the
world.

having no necessity--arising from the natural inclinations of the
daughter.

power over his . . . will--when, owing to his daughter's will not
opposing his will, he has power to carry into effect his will or wish.

decreed--determined.

[1 Corinthians 7:38](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">co1 7:38</span></span>

her--The oldest manuscripts have "his own virgin daughter."

but--The oldest manuscripts have "and."

[1 Corinthians 7:39](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">co1 7:39</span></span>

bound by the law--The oldest manuscripts omit "by the law."

only in the Lord--Let her marry only a Christian ([Co2
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#014)).

[1 Corinthians 7:40](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">co1 7:40</span></span>

happier-- ([Co1 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#001), [Co1
7:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#028), [Co1
7:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#034)).

I think also--"I also think"; just as you Corinthians and your teachers
think much of your opinions, so I also give my opinion by inspiration;
so in [Co1 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#025), "my judgment" or
opinion. Think does not imply doubt, but often a matter of well-grounded
assurance ([Joh 5:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#039)).
