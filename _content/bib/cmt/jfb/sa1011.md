### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#001)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 11:1</span></span>

NAHASH OFFERS THEM OF JABESH-GILEAD A REPROACHFUL CONDITION. ([Sa1
11:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#001))

Then Nahash the Ammonite came up--Nahash ("serpent"); (see [Jdg
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#003)). The Ammonites had long claimed
the right of original possession in Gilead. Though repressed by Jephthah
([Jdg 11:33](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#033)), they now, after ninety
years, renew their pretensions; and it was the report of their
threatened invasion that hastened the appointment of a king ([Sa1
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#012)).

Make a covenant with us, and we will serve thee--They saw no prospect of
aid from the western Israelites, who were not only remote, but scarcely
able to repel the incursions of the Philistines from themselves.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 11:2</span></span>

thrust out all your right eyes--literally, "scoop" or "hollow out" the
ball. This barbarous mutilation is the usual punishment of usurpers in
the East, inflicted on chiefs; sometimes, also, even in modern history,
on the whole male population of a town. Nahash meant to keep the
Jabeshites useful as tributaries, whence he did not wish to render them
wholly blind, but only to deprive them of their right eye, which would
disqualify them for war. Besides, his object was, through the people of
Jabesh-gilead, to insult the Israelitish nation.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 11:3</span></span>

send messengers unto all the coasts of Israel--a curious proof of the
general dissatisfaction that prevailed as to the appointment of Saul.
Those Gileadites deemed him capable neither of advising nor succoring
them; and even in his own town the appeal was made to the people--not to
the prince.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa1 11:7</span></span>

THEY SEND TO SAUL, AND ARE DELIVERED. ([Sa1
11:5-11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#005))

he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces--(see [Jdg
19:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#029)). This particular form of
war-summons was suited to the character and habits of an agricultural
and pastoral people. Solemn in itself, the denunciation that accompanied
it carried a terrible threat to those that neglected to obey it. Saul
conjoins the name of Samuel with his own, to lend the greater influence
to the measure, and to strike greater terror unto all contemners of the
order. The small contingent furnished by Judah suggests that the
disaffection to Saul was strongest in that tribe.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa1 11:8</span></span>

Bezek--This place of general muster was not far from Shechem, on the
road to Beth-shan, and nearly opposite the ford for crossing to
Jabesh-gilead. The great number on the muster-roll showed the effect of
Saul's wisdom and promptitude.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa1 11:11</span></span>

on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three companies--Crossing the
Jordan in the evening, Saul marched his army all night, and came at
daybreak on the camp of the Ammonites, who were surprised in three
different parts, and totally routed. This happened before the seven
days' truce expired.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa1 11:12</span></span>

SAUL CONFIRMED KING. ([Sa1 11:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#012))

the people said . . ., Who is he that said, Shall Saul reign over
us?--The enthusiastic admiration of the people, under the impulse of
grateful and generous feelings, would have dealt summary vengeance on
the minority who opposed Saul, had not he, either from principle or
policy, shown himself as great in clemency as in valor. The calm and
sagacious counsel of Samuel directed the popular feelings into a right
channel, by appointing a general assembly of the militia, the really
effective force of the nation, at Gilgal, where, amid great pomp and
religious solemnities, the victorious leader was confirmed in his
kingdom \[[Sa1 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#015)\].
