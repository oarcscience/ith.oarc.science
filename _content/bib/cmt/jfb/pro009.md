### [Proverbs Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#001)

[Proverbs 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 9:1</span></span>

The commendation of wisdom is continued, under the figure of a liberal
host, and its provisions under that of a feast (compare [Luk
14:16-24](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#016)). The character of those who
are invited is followed by a contrasted description of the rejectors of
good counsel; and with the invitations of wisdom are contrasted the
allurement of the wicked woman. (Pro. 9:1-18)

6:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#031)).

[Proverbs 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 9:2</span></span>

mingled--to enhance the flavor ([Pro
23:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#030); [Isa
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#022)).

maidens--servants to invite (compare [Psa
68:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#011); [Isa
40:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#009)).

highest places--ridges of heights, conspicuous places.

[Proverbs 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 9:4</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#004); [Pro

[Proverbs 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 9:9</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 3:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#016); [Pro
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#010)).

[Proverbs 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 9:12</span></span>

You are mainly concerned in your own conduct.

to allure those who are right-minded, and who are addressed as in [Pro
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#004), as

and unsettled, though willing to do right.

[Proverbs 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 9:17</span></span>

The language of a proverb, meaning that forbidden delights are sweet and
pleasant, as fruits of risk and danger.
