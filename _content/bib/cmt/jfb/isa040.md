### [Isaiah Chapter 40](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#001)

[Isaiah 40:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 40:1</span></span>

SECOND PART OF THE PROPHECIES OF ISAIAH. (Isa. 40:1-31)

Comfort ye, comfort ye--twice repeated to give double assurance. Having
announced the coming captivity of the Jews in Babylon, God now desires
His servants, the prophets ([Isa
52:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#007)), to comfort them. The scene is
laid in Babylon; the time, near the close of the captivity; the ground
of comfort is the speedy ending of the captivity, the Lord Himself being
their leader.

my people . . . your God--correlatives ([Jer
31:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#033); [Hos
1:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#009)). It is God's covenant relation
with His people, and His "word" of promise ([Isa
40:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#008)) to their forefathers, which is
the ground of His interposition in their behalf, after having for a time
chastised them ([Isa 54:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#008)).

[Isaiah 40:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 40:2</span></span>

comfortably--literally, "to the heart"; not merely to the intellect.

Jerusalem--Jerusalem though then in ruins, regarded by God as about to
be rebuilt; her people are chiefly meant, but the city is personified.

cry--publicly and emphatically as a herald cries aloud ([Isa
40:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#003)).

warfare--or, the appointed time of her misery ([Job
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#001), Margin; [Job
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#014); [Dan
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#001)). The ulterior and Messianic
reference probably is the definite time when the legal economy of
burdensome rites is at an end ([Gal
4:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#003)).

pardoned--The Hebrew expresses that her iniquity is so expiated that God
now delights in restoring her.

double for all her sins--This can only, in a very restricted sense, hold
good of Judah's restoration after the first captivity. For how can it be
said her "warfare was accomplished," when as yet the galling yoke of
Antiochus and also of Rome was before them? The "double for her sins"
must refer to the twofold captivity, the Assyrian and the Roman; at the
coming close of this latter dispersion, and then only, can her
"iniquity" be said to be "pardoned," or fully expiated \[HOUBIGANT\]. It
does not mean double as much as she deserved, but ample punishment in
her twofold captivity. Messiah is the antitypical Israel (compare [Mat
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#015), with [Hos
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001)). He indeed has "received" of
sufferings amply more than enough to expiate "for our sins" ([Rom
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#015), [Rom
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#017)). Otherwise (cry unto her) "that
she shall receive (blessings) of the Lord's hand double to the
punishment of all her sins" (so "sin" is used, [Zac
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#019), Margin) \[LOWTH\]. The English
Version is simpler.

[Isaiah 40:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 40:3</span></span>

crieth in the wilderness--So the Septuagint and [Mat
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#003) connect the words. The Hebrew
accents, however, connect them thus: "In the wilderness prepare ye,"
&c., and the parallelism also requires this, "Prepare ye in the
wilderness," answering to "make straight in the desert." Matthew was
entitled, as under inspiration, to vary the connection, so as to bring
out another sense, included in the Holy Spirit's intention; in [Mat
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#001), "John the Baptist, preaching in
the wilderness," answers thus to "The voice of one crying in the
wilderness." MAURER takes the participle as put for the finite verb (so
in [Isa 40:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#006)), "A voice crieth." The
clause, "in the wilderness," alludes to Israel's passage through it from
Egypt to Canaan ([Psa 68:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#007)), Jehovah
being their leader; so it shall be at the coming restoration of Israel,
of which the restoration from Babylon was but a type (not the full
realization; for their way from it was not through the "wilderness").
Where John preached (namely, in the wilderness; the type of this earth,
a moral wilderness), there were the hearers who are ordered to prepare
the way of the Lord, and there was to be the coming of the Lord
\[BENGEL\]. John, though he was immediately followed by the suffering
Messiah, is rather the herald of the coming reigning Messiah, as [Mal
4:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#005) ("before the great and dreadful
day of the Lord"), proves. [Mat 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#011)
(compare [Act 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#021)) implies that John
is not exclusively meant; and that though in one sense Elias has come,
in another he is yet to come. John was the figurative Elias, coming "in
the spirit and power of Elias" ([Luk
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#017)); [Joh
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#021), where John the Baptist denies
that he was the actual Elias, accords with this view. [Mal
4:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#005) cannot have received its
exhaustive fulfilment in John; the Jews always understood it of the
literal Elijah. As there is another consummating advent of Messiah
Himself, so perhaps there is to be of his forerunner Elias, who also was
present at the transfiguration.

the Lord--Hebrew, Jehovah; as this is applied to Jesus, He must be
Jehovah ([Mat 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#003)).

[Isaiah 40:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 40:4</span></span>

Eastern monarchs send heralds before them in a journey to clear away
obstacles, make causeways over valleys, and level hills. So John's duty
was to bring back the people to obedience to the law and to remove all
self-confidence, pride in national privileges, hypocrisy, and
irreligion, so that they should be ready for His coming ([Mal
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#006); [Luk
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#017)).

crooked--declivities.

[Isaiah 40:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 40:5</span></span>

see it--The Septuagint for "it," has "the salvation of God." So [Luk
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#006) (compare [Luk
2:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#030), that is, Messiah); but the
Evangelist probably took these words from [Isa
52:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#010).

for--rather, "All flesh shall see that the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken
it" \[BENGEL\].

[Isaiah 40:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 40:6</span></span>

The voice--the same divine herald as in [Isa
40:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#003).

he--one of those ministers or prophets (see on [Isa
40:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#001)) whose duty it was, by direction
of "the voice," to "comfort the Lord's afflicted people with the
promises of brighter days."

All flesh is grass--The connection is, "All human things, however
goodly, are transitory: God's promises alone steadfast" ([Isa
40:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#008), [Isa
40:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#015), [Isa
40:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#017), [Isa
40:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#023)); this contrast was already
suggested in [Isa 40:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#005), "All flesh . .
. the mouth of the Lord." [Pe1 1:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#024)
applies this passage distinctly to the gospel word of Messiah (compare
[Joh 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#024); [Jam
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#010)).

[Isaiah 40:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 40:7</span></span>

spirit of the Lord--rather, "wind of Jehovah" ([Psa
103:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#016)). The withering east wind of
those countries sent by Jehovah ([Jon
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#008)).

the people--rather, "this people" \[LOWTH\], which may refer to the
Babylonians \[ROSENMULLER\]; but better, mankind in general, as in [Isa
42:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#005), so [Isa
40:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#006), "all flesh"; this whole race,
that is, man.

[Isaiah 40:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 40:9</span></span>

Rather, "Oh, thou that bringest good things to Zion; thou that bringest
good tidings to Jerusalem." "Thou" is thus the collective
personification of the messengers who announce God's gracious purpose to
Zion (see on [Isa 40:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#001)); [Isa
52:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#007) confirms this \[Vulgate and
GESENIUS\]. If English Version be retained, the sense will be the glad
message was first to be proclaimed to Jerusalem, and then from it as the
center to all "Judea, Samaria, and the uttermost parts of the earth"
([Luk 24:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#047), [Luk
24:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#049); [Act
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#008)) \[VITRINGA and HENGSTENBERG\].

mountain--It was customary for those who were about to promulgate any
great thing, to ascend a hill from which they could be seen and heard by
all ([Jdg 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#007); [Mat
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#001)).

be not afraid--to announce to the exiles that their coming return home
is attended with danger in the midst of the Babylonians. The gospel
minister must "open his mouth boldly" ([Pro
29:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#025); [Eph
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#019)).

Behold--especially at His second coming ([Zac
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010); [Zac
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#005)).

[Isaiah 40:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 40:10</span></span>

with strong hand--or, "against the strong"; rather, "as a strong one"
\[MAURER\]. Or, against the strong one, namely, Satan ([Mat
12:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#029); [Rev
20:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#002), [Rev
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#010)) \[VITRINGA\].

arm--power ([Psa 89:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#013); [Psa
98:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#001)).

for him--that is, He needs not to seek help for Himself from any
external source, but by His own inherent power He gains rule for Himself
(so [Isa 40:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#014)).

work--or, "recompense for his work"; rather, "recompense which He gives
for work" ([Isa 62:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#011); [Rev
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#012)).

[Isaiah 40:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 40:11</span></span>

feed--including all a shepherd's care--"tend" ([Eze
34:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#023); [Psa
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#001); [Heb
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#020); [Pe1
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#025)).

carry--applicable to Messiah's restoration of Israel, as sheep scattered
in all lands, and unable to move of themselves to their own land ([Psa
80:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#001); [Jer
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#003)). As Israel was "carried from the
womb" (that is, in its earliest days) ([Isa
63:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#009), [Isa
63:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#011); [Psa
77:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#020)), so it shall be in "old age"
(that is, its latter days) ([Isa
46:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#003)).

gently lead--as a thoughtful shepherd does the ewes "giving suck"
(Margin) ([Gen 33:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#013)).

[Isaiah 40:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 40:12</span></span>

Lest the Jews should suppose that He who was just before described as a
"shepherd" is a mere man, He is now described as GOD.

Who--Who else but GOD could do so? Therefore, though the redemption and
restoration of His people, foretold here, was a work beyond man's power,
they should not doubt its fulfilment since all things are possible to
Him who can accurately regulate the proportion of the waters as if He
had measured them with His hand (compare [Isa
40:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#015)). But MAURER translates: "Who
can measure," &c., that is, How immeasurable are the works of God? The
former is a better explanation ([Job
28:25](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#025); [Pro
30:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#004)).

span--the space from the end of the thumb to the end of the middle
finger extended; God measures the vast heavens as one would measure a
small object with his span.

dust of the earth--All the earth is to Him but as a few grains of dust
contained in a small measure (literally, "the third part of a larger
measure").

hills in a balance--adjusted in their right proportions and places, as
exactly as if He had weighed them out.

[Isaiah 40:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 40:13</span></span>

Quoted in [Rom 11:34](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#034); [Co1
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#016). The Hebrew here for "directed"
is the same as in [Isa 40:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#012) for
"meted out"; thus the sense is, "Jehovah measures out heaven with His
span"; but who can measure Him? that is, Who can search out His Spirit
(mind) wherewith He searches out and accurately adjusts all things?
MAURER rightly takes the Hebrew in the same sense as in [Isa
40:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#012) (so [Pro
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#002); [Pro
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#002)), "weigh," "ponder." "Direct," as
in English Version, answers, however, better to "taught" in the parallel
clause.

[Isaiah 40:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 40:14</span></span>

path of judgment--His wisdom, whereby He so beautifully adjusts the
places and proportions of all created things.

[Isaiah 40:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 40:15</span></span>

of--rather, (hanging) from a bucket \[MAURER\].

he taketh up . . . as a very little thing--rather, "are as a mere grain
of dust which is taken up," namely, by the wind; literally, "one taketh
up," impersonally ([Exo 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#014))
\[MAURER\].

isles--rather, "lands" in general, answering to "the nations" in the
parallel clause; perhaps lands, like Mesopotamia, enclosed by rivers
\[JEROME\] (so [Isa 42:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#015)). However,
English Version, "isles" answers well to "mountains" ([Isa
40:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#012)), both alike being lifted up by
the power of God; in fact, "isles" are mountains upheaved from the bed
of the sea by volcanic agency; only that he seems here to have passed
from unintelligent creatures ([Isa
40:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#012)) to intelligent, as nations and
lands, that is, their inhabitants.

[Isaiah 40:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 40:16</span></span>

All Lebanon's forest would not supply fuel enough to burn sacrifices
worthy of the glory of God ([Isa 66:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#001);
[Kg1 8:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#027); [Psa
50:8-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#008)).

beasts--which abounded in Lebanon.

[Isaiah 40:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 40:17</span></span>

([Psa 62:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#009); [Dan
4:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#035)).

less than nothing--MAURER translates, as in [Isa
41:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#024), "of nothing" (partitively; or
expressive of the nature of a thing), a mere nothing.

vanity--emptiness.

[Isaiah 40:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 40:18</span></span>

Which of the heathen idols, then, is to be compared to this Almighty
God? This passage, if not written (as BARNES thinks) so late as the
idolatrous times of Manasseh, has at least a prospective warning
reference to them and subsequent reigns; the result of the chastisement
of Jewish idolatry in the Babylonish captivity was that thenceforth
after the restoration the Jews never fell into it. Perhaps these
prophecies here may have tended to that result (see [Kg2
23:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#026)).

[Isaiah 40:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 40:19</span></span>

graven--rather, an image in general; for it is incongruous to say
"melteth" (that is, casts out of metal) a graven image (that is, one of
carved wood); so [Jer 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#014), "molten
image."

spreadeth it over--(See on [Isa
30:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#022)).

chains--an ornament lavishly worn by rich Orientals ([Isa
3:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#018)), and so transferred to their
idols. Egyptian relics show that idols were suspended in houses by
chains.

[Isaiah 40:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 40:20</span></span>

impoverished--literally, "sunk" in circumstances.

no oblation--he who cannot afford to overlay his idol with gold and
silver ([Isa 40:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#019)).

tree . . . not rot--the cedar, cypress, oak, or ash ([Isa
44:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#014)).

graven--of wood; not a molten one of metal.

not be moved--that shall be durable.

[Isaiah 40:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 40:21</span></span>

ye--who worship idols. The question emphatically implies, they had
known.

from the beginning-- ([Isa 41:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#004), [Isa
41:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#026); [Isa
48:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#016)). God is the beginning ([Rev
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#008)). The tradition handed down from
the very first, of the creation of all things by God at the beginning,
ought to convince you of His omnipotence and of the folly of idolatry.

[Isaiah 40:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 40:22</span></span>

It is he--rather, connected with last verse, "Have ye not known?"--have
ye not understood Him that sitteth . . .? ([Isa
40:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#026)) \[MAURER\].

circle--applicable to the globular form of the earth, above which, and
the vault of sky around it, He sits. For "upon" translate "above."

as grasshoppers--or locusts in His sight ([Num
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#033)), as He looks down from on high
([Psa 33:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#013); [Psa
113:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#004)).

curtain--referring to the awning which the Orientals draw over the open
court in the center of their houses as a shelter in rain or hot weather.

[Isaiah 40:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">isa 40:23</span></span>

([Psa 107:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#004); [Dan
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#021)).

judges--that is, rulers; for these exercised judicial authority ([Psa
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#010)). The Hebrew, shophtee, answers
to the Carthaginian chief magistrates, suffetes.

[Isaiah 40:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">isa 40:24</span></span>

they--the "princes and judges" ([Isa
40:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#023)) who oppose God's purposes and
God's people. Often compared to tall trees ([Psa
37:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#035); [Dan
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#010)).

not . . . sown--the seed, that is, race shall become extinct ([Nah
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#014)).

stock--not even shall any shoots spring up from the stump when the tree
has been cut down: no descendants whatever ([Job
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#007); see on [Isa
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001)).

and . . . also--so the Septuagint. But MAURER translates, "They are
hardly (literally, 'not yet', as in [Kg2
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#004)) planted (&c.) when He (God)
blows upon them."

blow--The image is from the hot east wind (simoon) that "withers"
vegetation.

whirlwind . . . stubble-- ([Psa
83:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#013)), where, "like a wheel," refers
to the rotatory action of the whirlwind on the stubble.

[Isaiah 40:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">isa 40:25</span></span>

(Compare [Isa 40:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#018)).

[Isaiah 40:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">isa 40:26</span></span>

bringeth out . . . host--image from a general reviewing his army: He is
Lord of Sabaoth, the heavenly hosts ([Job
38:32](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#032)).

calleth . . . by names--numerous as the stars are. God knows each in all
its distinguishing characteristics--a sense which "name" often bears in
Scripture; so in [Gen 2:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#019), Adam,
as God's vicegerent, called the beasts by name, that is, characterized
them by their several qualities, which, indeed, He has imparted.

by the greatness . . . faileth--rather, "by reason of abundance of
(their inner essential) force and firmness of strength, not one of them
is driven astray"; referring to the sufficiency of the physical forces
with which He has endowed the heavenly bodies, to prevent all disorder
in their motions \[HORSLEY\]. In English Version the sense is, "He has
endowed them with their peculiar attributes ('names') by the greatness
of His might," and the power of His strength (the better rendering,
instead of, "for that He is strong").

[Isaiah 40:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">isa 40:27</span></span>

Since these things are so, thou hast no reason to think that thine
interest ("way," that is, condition, [Psa
37:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#005); [Jer
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#001)) is disregarded by God.

judgment is passed over from--rather, "My cause is neglected by my God;
He passes by my case in my bondage and distress without noticing it."

my God--who especially might be expected to care for me.

known--by thine own observation and reading of Scripture.

heard--from tradition of the fathers.

everlasting, &c.--These attributes of Jehovah ought to inspire His
afflicted people with confidence.

no searching of his understanding--therefore thy cause cannot, as thou
sayest, escape His notice; though much in His ways is unsearchable, He
cannot err ([Job 11:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#007)). He is never
"faint" or "weary" with having the countless wants of His people ever
before Him to attend to.

[Isaiah 40:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">isa 40:29</span></span>

Not only does He "not faint" ([Isa
40:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#028)) but He gives power to them who
do faint.

no might . . . increaseth strength--a seeming paradox. They "have no
might" in themselves; but in Him they have strength, and He "increases"
that strength ([Co2 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#009)).

[Isaiah 40:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#030)

young men--literally, "those selected"; men picked out on account of
their youthful vigor for an enterprise.

[Isaiah 40:31](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">isa 40:31</span></span>

mount up-- ([Sa2 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#023)). Rather, "They
shall put forth fresh feathers as eagles" are said to renovate
themselves; the parallel clause, "renew their strength," confirms this.
The eagle was thought to moult and renew his feathers, and with them his
strength, in old age (so the Septuagint, Vulgate, [Psa
103:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#005)). However, English Version is
favored by the descending climax, mount up--run--walk; in every attitude
the praying, waiting child of God is "strong in the Lord" ([Psa
84:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#007); [Mic
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#005); [Heb
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#001)).
