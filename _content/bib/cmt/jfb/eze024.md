### [Ezekiel Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#001)

[Ezekiel 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 24:1</span></span>

VISION OF THE BOILING CALDRON, AND OF THE DEATH OF EZEKIEL'S WIFE. (Eze.
24:1-27)

Ezekiel proves his divine mission by announcing the very day, ("this
same day") of the beginning of the investment of the city by
Nebuchadnezzar; "the ninth year," namely, of Jehoiachin's captivity,
"the tenth day of the tenth month"; though he was three hundred miles
away from Jerusalem among the captives at the Chebar ([Kg2
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#001); [Jer
39:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#001)).

[Ezekiel 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 24:2</span></span>

set himself--laid siege; "lay against."

[Ezekiel 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 24:3</span></span>

pot--caldron. Alluding to the self-confident proverb used among the
people, [Eze 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#003) (see on [Eze
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#003)), "This city is the caldron and
we be the flesh"; your proverb shall prove awfully true, but in a
different sense from what you intend. So far from the city proving an
iron, caldron-like defense from the fire, it shall be as a caldron set
on the fire, and the people as so many pieces of meat subjected to
boiling heat. See [Jer 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#013).

[Ezekiel 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 24:4</span></span>

pieces thereof--those which properly belong to it, as its own.

every good piece . . . choice bones--that is the most distinguished of
the people. The "choice bones" in the pot have flesh adhering to them.
The bones under the pot ([Eze 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#005))
are those having no flesh and used as fuel, answering to the poorest who
suffer first, and are put out of pain sooner than the rich who endure
what answers to the slower process of boiling.

[Ezekiel 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 24:5</span></span>

burn . . . bones--rather, "pile the bones." Literally, "Let there be a
round pile of the bones."

therein--literally, "in the midst of it."

[Ezekiel 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 24:6</span></span>

scum--not ordinary, but poisonous scum, that is, the people's
all-pervading wickedness.

bring it out piece by piece--"it," the contents of the pot; its flesh,
that is, "I will destroy the people of the city, not all at the same
time, but by a series of successive attacks." Not as FAIRBAIRN, "on its
every piece let it (the poisonous scum) go forth."

let no lot fall upon it--that is, no lot, such as is sometimes cast, to
decide who are to be destroyed and who saved ([Sa2
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#002); [Joe
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#003); [Oba
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#011); [Nah
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#010)). In former carryings away of
captives, lots were cast to settle who were to go, and who to stay, but
now all alike are to be cast out without distinction of rank, age, or
sex.

[Ezekiel 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 24:7</span></span>

upon the top of a rock--or, "the dry, bare, exposed rock," so as to be
conspicuous to all. Blood poured on a rock is not so soon absorbed as
blood poured on the earth. The law ordered the blood even of a beast or
fowl to be "covered with the dust" ([Lev
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#013)); but Jerusalem was so shameless
as to be at no pains to cover up the blood of innocent men slain in her.
Blood, as the consummation of all sin, presupposes every other form of
guilt.

[Ezekiel 24:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 24:8</span></span>

That it might cause--God purposely let her so shamelessly pour the blood
on the bare rock, "that it might" the more loudly and openly cry for
vengeance from on high; and that the connection between the guilt and
the punishment might be the more palpable. The blood of Abel, though the
ground received it, still cries to heaven for vengeance ([Gen
4:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#010)); much more blood shamelessly
exposed on the bare rock.

set her blood--She shall be paid back in kind ([Mat
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#002)). She openly shed blood, and her
blood shall openly be shed.

[Ezekiel 24:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 24:9</span></span>

the pile for fire--the hostile materials for the city's destruction.

[Ezekiel 24:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 24:10</span></span>

spice it well--that the meat may be the more palatable, that is, I will
make the foe delight in its destruction as much as one delights in
well-seasoned, savory meat. GROTIUS, needlessly departing from the
obvious sense, translates, "Let it be boiled down to a compound."

[Ezekiel 24:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 24:11</span></span>

set it empty . . . that . . . brass . . . may burn, . . . that . . .
scum . . . may be consumed--Even the consumption of the contents is not
enough; the caldron itself which is infected by the poisonous scum must
be destroyed, that is, the city itself must be destroyed, not merely the
inhabitants, just as the very house infected with leprosy was to be
destroyed ([Lev 14:34-45](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#034)).

[Ezekiel 24:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 24:12</span></span>

herself--rather, "she hath wearied Me out with lies"; or rather, "with
vain labors" on My part to purify her without being obliged to have
recourse to judgments (compare [Isa
43:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#024); [Mal
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#017)) \[MAURER\]. However, English
Version gives a good sense (compare [Isa
47:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#013); [Isa
57:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#010)).

[Ezekiel 24:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 24:13</span></span>

lewdness--determined, deliberate wickedness; from a Hebrew root, "to
purpose."

I have purged thee--that is, I have left nothing untried which would
tend towards purging thee, by sending prophets to invite thee to
repentance, by giving thee the law with all its promises, privileges,
and threats.

thou shalt not be purged . . . any more--that is, by My gracious
interpositions; thou shalt be left to thine own course to take its fatal
consequences.

[Ezekiel 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 24:14</span></span>

go back--desist; relax \[FAIRBAIRN\].

[Ezekiel 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 24:15</span></span>

Second part of the vision; announcement of the death of Ezekiel's wife,
and prohibition of the usual signs of mourning.

[Ezekiel 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 24:16</span></span>

desire of . . . eyes--his wife: representing the sanctuary ([Eze
24:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#021)) in which the Jews so much
gloried. The energy and subordination of Ezekiel's whole life to his
prophetic office is strikingly displayed in this narrative of his wife's
death. It is the only memorable event of his personal history which he
records, and this only in reference to his soul-absorbing work. His
natural tenderness is shown by that graphic touch, "the desire of thine
eyes." What amazing subjection, then, of his individual feeling to his
prophetic duty is manifested in the simple statement ([Eze
24:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#018)), "So I spake . . . in the
morning; and at even my wife died; and I did in the morning as I was
commanded."

stroke--a sudden visitation. The suddenness of it enhances the
self-control of Ezekiel in so entirely merging individual feeling, which
must have been especially acute under such trying circumstances, in the
higher claims of duty to God.

[Ezekiel 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 24:17</span></span>

Forbear to cry--or, "Lament in silence"; not forbidding sorrow, but the
loud expression of it \[GROTIUS\].

no mourning--typical of the universality of the ruin of Jerusalem, which
would preclude mourning, such as is usual where calamity is but partial.
"The dead" is purposely put in the plural, as referring ultimately to
the dead who should perish at the taking of Jerusalem; though the
singular might have been expected, as Ezekiel's wife was the immediate
subject referred to: "make no mourning," such as is usual, "for the
dead, and such as shall be hereafter in Jerusalem" ([Jer
16:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#005)).

tire of thine head--thy headdress \[FAIRBAIRN\]. JEROME explains, "Thou
shalt retain the hair which is usually cut in mourning." The fillet,
binding the hair about the temples like a chaplet, was laid aside at
such times. Uncovering the head was an ordinary sign of mourning in
priests; whereas others covered their heads in mourning ([Sa2
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#030)). The reason was, the priests
had their headdress of fine twined linen given them for ornament, and as
a badge of office. The high priest, as having on his head the holy
anointing oil, was forbidden in any case to lay aside his headdress. But
the priests might do so in the case of the death of the nearest
relatives ([Lev 21:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#002), [Lev
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#010)). They then put on inferior
attire, sprinkling also on their heads dust and ashes (compare [Lev
10:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#006)).

shoes upon thy feet--whereas mourners went "barefoot" ([Sa2
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#030)).

cover not . . . lips--rather, the "upper lip," with the moustache ([Lev
13:45](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#045); [Mic
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#007)).

bread of men--the bread usually brought to mourners by friends in token
of sympathy. So the "cup of consolation" brought ([Jer
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#007)). "Of men" means such as is
usually furnished by men. So [Isa 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#001),
"a man's pen"; [Rev 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#017), "the
measure of a man."

[Ezekiel 24:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eze 24:19</span></span>

what these things are to us--The people perceive that Ezekiel's strange
conduct has a symbolical meaning as to themselves; they ask, "What is
that meaning?"

[Ezekiel 24:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eze 24:21</span></span>

excellency of your strength--(compare [Amo
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#008)). The object of your pride and
confidence ([Jer 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#004), [Jer
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#010), [Jer
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#014)).

desire of . . . eyes-- ([Psa 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#004)).
The antitype to Ezekiel's wife ([Eze
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#016)).

pitieth--loveth, as pity is akin to love: "yearned over."

Profane--an appropriate word. They had profaned the temple with
idolatry; God, in just retribution, will profane it with the Chaldean
sword, that is, lay it in the dust, as Ezekiel's wife.

sons . . . daughters . . . left--the children left behind in Judea, when
the parents were carried away.

[Ezekiel 24:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eze 24:22</span></span>

([Jer 16:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#006)). So general shall be the
calamity, that all ordinary usages of mourning shall be suspended.

[Ezekiel 24:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eze 24:23</span></span>

ye shall not mourn . . . but . . . pine away for your iniquities--The
Jews' not mourning was to be not the result of insensibility, any more
than Ezekiel's not mourning for his wife was not from want of feeling.
They could not in their exile manifest publicly their lamentation, but
they would privately "mourn one to another." Their "iniquities" would
then be their chief sorrow ("pining away"), as feeling that these were
the cause of their sufferings (compare [Lev
26:39](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#039); [Lam
3:39](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#039)). The fullest fulfilment is still
future ([Zac 12:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010)).

[Ezekiel 24:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">eze 24:24</span></span>

sign--a typical representative in his own person of what was to befall
them ([Isa 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#003)).

when this cometh--alluding probably to their taunt, as if God's word
spoken by His prophets would never come to pass. "Where is the word of
the Lord? Let it come now" ([Jer
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#015)). When the prophecy is
fulfilled, "ye shall know (to your cost) that I am the Lord," who
thereby show My power and fulfil My word spoken by My prophet ([Joh
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#019); [Joh
14:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#029)).

[Ezekiel 24:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">eze 24:25</span></span>

"The day" referred to in these verses is the day of the overthrow of the
temple, when the fugitive "escapes." But "that day," in [Eze
24:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#027), is the day on which the
fugitive brings the sad news to Ezekiel, at the Chebar. In the interval
the prophet suspended his prophecies as to the Jews, as was foretold.
Afterwards his mouth was "opened," and no more "dumb" ([Eze
3:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#026); compare [Eze
24:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#027); [Eze
33:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#021)).

If Israel was not spared, much less the heathen utterly corrupt, and
having no mixture of truth, such as Israel in its worst state possessed
([Pe1 4:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#017)). Their ruin was to be
utter: Israel's but temporary ([Jer
46:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#028)). The nations denounced are
seven, the perfect number; implying that God's judgments would visit,
not merely these, but the whole round of the heathen foes of God.
Babylon is excepted, because she is now for the present viewed as the
rod of God's retributive justice, a view too much then lost sight of by
those who fretted against her universal supremacy.
