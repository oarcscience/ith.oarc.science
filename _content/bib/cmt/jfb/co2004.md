### [2 Corinthians Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#001)

[2 Corinthians 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co2 4:1</span></span>

HIS PREACHING IS OPEN AND SINCERE, THOUGH TO MANY THE GOSPEL IS HIDDEN.
(2Co. 4:1-18)

Therefore--Greek, "For this cause": Because we have the liberty-giving
Spirit of the Lord, and with unveiled face behold His glory ([Co2
3:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#017)).

seeing we have this ministry--"The ministration of the Spirit" ([Co2
3:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#008)): the ministry of such a
spiritual, liberty-giving Gospel: resuming [Co2
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#006), [Co2
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#008).

received mercy--from God, in having had this ministry conferred on us
([Co2 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#005)). The sense of "mercy"
received from God, makes men active for God ([Ti1
1:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#011)).

we faint not--in boldness of speech and action, and patience in
suffering ([Co2 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#002), [Co2
4:8-16](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#008), &c.).

[2 Corinthians 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co2 4:2</span></span>

renounced--literally, "bid farewell to."

of dishonesty--rather, "of shame." "I am not ashamed of the Gospel of
Christ" ([Rom 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#016)). Shame would lead
to hiding ([Co2 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#003)); whereas "we use
great plainness of speech" ([Co2
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#012)); "by manifestation of the
truth." Compare [Co2 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#003), "manifestly
declared." He refers to the disingenuous artifices of "many" teachers at
Corinth ([Co2 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#017); [Co2
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#001); [Co2
11:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#013)).

handling . . . deceitfully--so "corrupt" or adulterate "the word of God"
([Co2 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#017); compare [Th1
2:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#003)).

commending--recommending ourselves: recurring to [Co2
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#001).

to--to the verdict of.

every man's conscience-- ([Co2 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#011)).
Not to men's carnal judgment, as those alluded to ([Co2
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#001)).

in the sight of God-- ([Co2 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#017); [Gal
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#010)).

[2 Corinthians 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co2 4:3</span></span>

But if--Yea, even if (as I grant is the case).

hid--rather (in reference to [Co2
3:13-18](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#013)), "veiled." "Hid" (Greek, [Col
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#003)) is said of that withdrawn from
view altogether. "Veiled," of a thing within reach of the eye, but
covered over so as not to be seen. So it was in the case of Moses' face.

to them--in the case only of them: for in itself the Gospel is quite
plain.

that are lost--rather, "that are perishing" ([Co1
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#018)). So the same cloud that was
"light" to the people of God, was "darkness" to the Egyptian foes of God
([Exo 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#020)).

[2 Corinthians 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co2 4:4</span></span>

In whom--Translate, "In whose case."

god of this world--The worldly make him their God ([Phi
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#019)). He is, in fact, "the prince of
the power of the air, the spirit that ruleth in the children of
disobedience" ([Eph 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#002)).

minds--"understandings": "mental perceptions," as in [Co2
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#014).

them which believe not--the same as "them that are lost" (or "are
perishing"). Compare [Th2 2:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#010).
SOUTH quaintly says, "when the malefactor's eyes are covered, he is not
far from his execution" ([Est 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/est007.htm#008)).
Those perishing unbelievers are not merely veiled, but blinded ([Co2
3:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#014)): Greek, not "blinded," but
"hardened."

light of the glorious gospel of Christ--Translate, "The illumination
(enlightening: the propagation from those already enlightened, to others
of the light) of the Gospel of the glory of Christ." "The glory of
Christ" is not a mere quality (as "glorious" would express) of the
Gospel; it is its very essence and subject matter.

image of God--implying identity of nature and essence ([Joh
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018); [Col
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015); [Heb
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003)). He who desires to see "the glory
of God," may see it "in the face of Jesus Christ" ([Co2
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#006); [Ti1
6:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#014)). Paul here recurs to [Co2
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#018). Christ is "the image of God,"
into which "same image" we, looking on it in the mirror of the Gospel,
are changed by the Spirit; but this image is not visible to those
blinded by Satan \[ALFORD\].

[2 Corinthians 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co2 4:5</span></span>

For--Their blindness is not our fault, as if we had self-seeking aims in
our preaching.

preach . . . Christ . . . the Lord--rather, "Christ as Lord," and
ourselves as your servants, &c. "Lord," or "Master," is the correlative
term to "servants."

[2 Corinthians 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co2 4:6</span></span>

For--proof that we are true servants of Jesus unto you.

commanded the light--Greek, "By speaking the word, commanded light"
([Gen 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#003)).

hath shined--rather, as Greek, "is He who shined." (It is God) who
commanded light, &c., that shined, &c., ([Job
37:15](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#015)): Himself our Light and Sun, as
well as the Creator of light ([Mal
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#002); [Joh
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#012)). The physical world answers to
the spiritual.

in our hearts--in themselves dark.

to give the light--that is, to propagate to others the light, &c., which
is in us (compare Note, see on [Co2
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#004)).

the glory of God--answering to "the glory of Christ" (see on [Co2
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#004)).

in the face of Jesus Christ--Some of the oldest manuscripts retain
"Jesus." Others omit it. Christ is the manifestation of the glory of
God, as His image ([Joh 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#009)). The
allusion is still to the brightness on Moses' "face." The only true and
full manifestation of God's brightness and glory is "in the face of
Jesus" ([Heb 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003)).

[2 Corinthians 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co2 4:7</span></span>

"Lest any should say, How then is it that we continue to enjoy such
unspeakable glory in a mortal body? Paul replies, this very fact is one
of the most marvellous proofs of God's power, that an earthen vessel
could bear such splendor and keep such a treasure" \[CHRYSOSTOM,
Homilies, 8.496, A\]. The treasure or "the light of the knowledge of the
glory of God." The fragile "earthen vessel" is the body, the "outward
man" ([Co2 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#016); compare [Co2
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#010)), liable to afflictions and
death. So the light in Gideon's pitchers, the type ([Jdg
7:16-20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#016), [Jdg
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#022)). The ancients often kept their
treasures in jars or vessels of earthenware. "There are earthen vessels
which yet may be clean; whereas a golden vessel may be filthy"
\[BENGEL\].

that the excellency of the power, &c.--that the power of the ministry
(the Holy Spirit), in respect to its surpassing "excellency," exhibited
in winning souls ([Co1 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#004)) and in
sustaining us ministers, might be ascribed solely to God, we being weak
as earthen vessels. God often allows the vessel to be chipped and
broken, that the excellency of the treasure contained, and of the power
which that treasure has, may be all His ([Co2
4:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#010); [Joh
3:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#030)).

may be of God . . . not of us--rather, as Greek, "may be God's (may be
seen and be thankfully \[[Co2 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#015)\]
acknowledged to belong to God), and not (to come) from us." The power
not merely comes from God, but belongs to Him continually, and is to be
ascribed to him.

[2 Corinthians 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co2 4:8</span></span>

Greek, "BEING hard pressed, yet not inextricably straitened; reduced to
inextricable straits" (nominative to "we have," [Co2
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#007)).

on every side--Greek, "in every respect" (compare [Co2
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#010), "always"; [Co2
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#005)). This verse expresses inward
distresses; [Co2 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#009), outward
distresses ([Co2 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#005)). "Without were
fightings; within were fears." The first clause in each member of the
series of contrasted participles, implies the earthiness of the vessels;
the second clause, the excellency of the power.

perplexed, but not in despair--Greek, "not utterly perplexed." As
perplexity refers to the future, so "troubled" or "hard pressed" refers
to the present.

[2 Corinthians 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co2 4:9</span></span>

not forsaken--by God and man. Jesus was forsaken by both; so much do His
sufferings exceed those of His people ([Mat
27:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#046)).

cast down--or "struck down"; not only "persecuted," that is, chased as a
deer or bird ([Sa1 26:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#020)), but
actually struck down as with a dart in the chase ([Heb
11:35-38](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#035)). The Greek "always" in this
verse means, "throughout the whole time"; in [Co2
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#011) the Greek is different, and
means, "at every time," "in every case when the occasion occurs."

[2 Corinthians 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co2 4:10</span></span>

bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus--that is, having
my body exposed to being put to death in the cause of Jesus (the oldest
manuscripts omit "the Lord"), and having in it the marks of such
sufferings, I thus bear about wheresoever I go, an image of the
suffering Saviour in my own person ([Co2
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#011); [Co2
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#005); compare [Co1
15:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#031)). Doubtless, Paul was exposed to
more dangers than are recorded in Acts (compare [Co2
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#005); [Co2
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#026)). The Greek for "the dying" is
literally, "the being made a corpse," such Paul regarded his body, yet a
corpse which shares in the life-giving power of Christ's resurrection,
as it has shared in His dying and death.

that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body--rather,
"may be." The name "Jesus," by itself is often repeated here as Paul
seems, amidst sufferings, peculiarly to have felt its sweetness. In [Co2
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#011) the same words occur with the
variation, "in our mortal flesh. The fact of a dying, corpse-like body
being sustained amidst such trials, manifests that "the (resurrection)
life also," as well as the dying, "of Jesus," exerts its power in us. I
thus bear about in my own person an image of the risen and living, as
well as of the suffering, Saviour. The "our" is added here to "body,"
though not in the beginning of the verse. "For the body is ours not so
much in death, as in life" \[BENGEL\].

[2 Corinthians 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co2 4:11</span></span>

we which live--in the power of Christ's "life" manifested in us, in our
whole man body as well as spirit ([Rom
8:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#010); see on [Co2
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#010); compare [Co2
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#015)). Paul regards his preservation
amidst so many exposures to "death," by which Stephen and James were cut
off, as a standing miracle ([Co2
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#023)).

delivered unto--not by chance; by the ordering of Providence, who shows
"the excellency of His power" ([Co2
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#007)), in delivering unto DEATH His
living saints, that He may manifest LIFE also in their dying flesh.
"Flesh," the very element of decay (not merely their "body"), is by Him
made to manifest life.

[2 Corinthians 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co2 4:12</span></span>

The "death" of Christ manifested in the continual "perishing of our
outward man" ([Co2 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#016)), works
peculiarly in us, and is the means of working spiritual "life" in you.
The life whereof we witness in our bodily dying, extends beyond
ourselves, and is brought by our very dying to you.

[2 Corinthians 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co2 4:13</span></span>

Translate as Greek, "BUT having," &c., that is, not withstanding the
trials just mentioned, we having, &c.

the same spirit of faith, according as it, &c.--Compare [Rom
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#015), on the usage of "spirit of
faith." The Holy Spirit acting on our spirit. Though "death worketh in
us, and life in you" ([Co2 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#012)), yet
as we have the same spirit of faith as you, we therefore \[believingly\]
look for the same immortal life as you \[ESTIUS\], and speak as we
believe. ALFORD not so well translates, "The same . . . faith with that
described in the Scriptures" ([Psa
116:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#010)). The balance of the sentence
requires the parallelism to be this, "According to that which is
written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and
therefore speak," namely, without fear, amidst "afflictions" and
"deaths" ([Co2 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#017)).

[2 Corinthians 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co2 4:14</span></span>

Knowing--by faith ([Co2 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#001)).

shall raise up us also--at the resurrection ([Co1
6:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#013)).

by Jesus--The oldest manuscripts have "with Jesus."

present us--vividly picturing the scene before the eyes ([Jde
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#024)).

with you-- ([Co2 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#014); [Th1
2:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#019); [Th1
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#013)).

[2 Corinthians 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co2 4:15</span></span>

For--Confirming his assertion "with you" ([Co2
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#014)), and "life . . . worketh in you"
([Co2 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#012)).

all things--whether the afflictions and labors of us ministers ([Co2
4:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#008)), or your prosperity ([Co2
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#012); [Co1
3:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#021); [Co1
4:8-13](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#008)).

for your sakes-- ([Ti2 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#010)).

abundant grace, &c.--rather, "That grace (the grace which preserves us
in trials and works life in you), being made the greater (multiplied),
by means of the greater number (of its recipients), may cause the
thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God." \[CHRYSOSTOM\] ([Co2
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#011); [Co2
9:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#011)). The Greek is susceptible
also of this translation, "That grace, being made the greater
(multiplied) on account of the thanksgiving of the greater number (for
grace already received), may abound (abundantly redound) to," &c. Thus
the Greek for "abound" has not to be taken in an active sense, but in
its ordinary neuter sense, and so the other Greek words. Thanksgiving
invites more abundant grace ([Ch2
20:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#019); [Psa
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#003); [Psa
50:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#023)).

[2 Corinthians 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co2 4:16</span></span>

we faint not--notwithstanding our sufferings. Resuming [Co2
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#001).

outward man--the body, the flesh.

perish--"is wearing away"; "is wasted away" by afflictions.

inward man--our spiritual and true being, the "life" which even in our
mortal bodies ([Co2 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#011)) "manifests
the life of Jesus."

is renewed--"is being renewed," namely, with fresh "grace" ([Co2
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#015)), and "faith" ([Co2
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#013)), and hope ([Co2
4:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#017)).

[2 Corinthians 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">co2 4:17</span></span>

which is but for a moment--"Our PRESENT light (burden of) affliction"
(so the Greek; compare [Mat 11:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#030)),
\[ALFORD\]. Compare "now for a season . . . in heaviness" ([Pe1
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#006)). The contrast, however, between
this and the "ETERNAL weight of glory" requires, I think, the
translation, "Which is but for the present passing moment." So WAHL.
"The lightness of affliction" (he does not express "burden" after
"light"; the Greek is "the light of affliction") contrasts beautifully
with the "weight of the glory."

worketh--rather, "worketh out."

a far more exceeding and--rather, "in a surpassing and still more
surpassing manner" \[ALFORD\]; "more and more exceedingly" \[ELLICOTT,
TRENCH, and others\]. Greek, "in excess and to excess." The glory
exceeds beyond all measure the affliction.

[2 Corinthians 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">co2 4:18</span></span>

look not at--as our aim.

things . . . seen--"earthly things" ([Phi
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#019)). We mind not the things seen,
whether affliction or refreshment come, so as to be seduced by the
latter, or deterred by the former \[CHRYSOSTOM\].

things . . . not seen--not "the invisible things" of [Rom
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#020), but the things which, though not
seen now, shall be so hereafter.

temporal--rather, "for a time"; in contrast to eternal. English Version
uses "temporal" for temporary. The Greek is rightly translated in the
similar passage, "the pleasures of sin for a season."
