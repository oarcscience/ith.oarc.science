### [Mark Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#001)

[Mark 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mar 11:11</span></span>

THE BARREN FIG TREE CURSED WITH LESSONS FROM IT--SECOND CLEANSING OF THE
TEMPLE, ON THE SECOND AND THIRD DAYS OF THE WEEK. ( = [Mat
21:12-22](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#012); [Luk
19:45-48](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#045)). (Mark 11:11-26)

And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and when he had
looked round about upon--surveyed.

all things, and now the eventide was come, he went out into Bethany with
the twelve--Thus briefly does our Evangelist dispose of this His first
day in Jerusalem, after the triumphal entry. Nor do the Third and Fourth
Gospels give us more light. But from Matthew ([Mat
21:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#010), [Mat
21:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#014)) we learn some additional and
precious particulars, for which see on [Luk
19:45-48](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#045). It was not now safe for the
Lord to sleep in the city, nor, from the day of His Triumphal Entry, did
He pass one night in it, save the last fatal one.

The Barren Fig Tree Cursed ([Mar
11:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#012)).

[Mark 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mar 11:12</span></span>

And on the morrow--The Triumphal Entry being on the first day of the
week, this following day was Monday.

when they were come from Bethany--"in the morning" ([Mat
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#018)).

he was hungry--How was that? Had he stolen forth from that dear roof at
Bethany to the "mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to
God?" ([Luk 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#012)); or, "in the
morning," as on a former occasion, "risen up a great while before day,
and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed" ([Mar
1:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#035)); not breaking His fast
thereafter, but bending His steps straight for the city, that He might
"work the works of Him that sent Him while it was day?" ([Joh
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#004)). We know not, though one lingers
upon and loves to trace out the every movement of that life of wonders.
One thing, however we are sure of--it was real bodily hunger which He
now sought to allay by the fruit of this fig tree, "if haply He might
find any thing thereon"; not a mere scene for the purpose of teaching a
lesson, as some early heretics maintained, and some still seem virtually
to hold.

[Mark 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mar 11:13</span></span>

And seeing a fig tree--(In [Mat 21:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#019),
it is "one fig tree," but the sense is the same as here, "a certain fig
tree," as in [Mat 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#019), &c.).
Bethphage, which adjoined Bethany, derives his name from its being a fig
region--"House of figs."

afar off having leaves--and therefore promising fruit, which in the case
of figs come before the leaves.

he came, if haply he might find any thing thereon: and when he came to
it, he found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not yet--What
the precise import of this explanation is, interpreters are not agreed.
Perhaps all that is meant is, that as the proper fig season had not
arrived, no fruit would have been expected even of this tree but for the
leaves which it had, which were in this case prematurely and unnaturally
developed.

[Mark 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mar 11:14</span></span>

And Jesus answered and said unto it, No man eat fruit of thee hereafter
for ever--That word did not make the tree barren, but sealed it up in
its own barrenness. See on [Mat
13:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#013).

And his disciples heard it--and marked the saying. This is introduced as
a connecting link, to explain what was afterwards to be said on the
subject, as the narrative has to proceed to the other transactions of
this day.

Second Cleansing of the Temple ([Mar
11:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#015)).

For the exposition of this portion, see on [Luk
19:45-48](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#045).

Lessons from the Cursing of the Fig Tree ([Mar
11:20-26](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#020)).

[Mark 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mar 11:20</span></span>

And in the morning--of Tuesday, the third day of the week: He had slept,
as during all this week, at Bethany.

as they passed by--going into Jerusalem again.

they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots--no partial blight,
leaving life in the root; but it was now dead, root and branch. In [Mat
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#019) it is said it withered away as
soon as it was cursed. But the full blight had not appeared probably at
once; and in the dusk perhaps, as they returned to Bethany, they had not
observed it. The precision with which Mark distinguishes the days is not
observed by Matthew, intent only on holding up the truths which the
incident was designed to teach. In Matthew the whole is represented as
taking place at once, just as the two stages of Jairus' daughter--dying
and dead--are represented by him as one. The only difference is between
a mere summary and a more detailed narrative, each of which only
confirms the other.

[Mark 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mar 11:21</span></span>

And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him--satisfied that a
miracle so very peculiar--a miracle, not of blessing, as all His other
miracles, but of cursing--could not have been wrought but with some
higher reference, and fully expecting to hear something weighty on the
subject.

Master, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away--so
connecting the two things as to show that he traced the death of the
tree entirely to the curse of his Lord. Matthew ([Mat
21:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#020)) gives this simply as a general
exclamation of surprise by the disciples "how soon" the blight had taken
effect.

[Mark 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mar 11:22</span></span>

And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God.

[Mark 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mar 11:23</span></span>

For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain,
Be thou removed . . . he shall have whatsoever he saith--Here is the
lesson now. From the nature of the case supposed--that they might wish a
mountain removed and cast into the sea, a thing far removed from
anything which they could be thought actually to desire--it is plain
that not physical but moral obstacles to the progress of His kingdom
were in the Redeemer's view, and that what He designed to teach was the
great lesson, that no obstacle should be able to stand before a
confiding faith in God.

[Mark 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mar 11:24</span></span>

Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray,
believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them--This verse only
generalizes the assurance of [Mar
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#023); which seems to show that it was
designed for the special encouragement of evangelistic and missionary
efforts, while this is a directory for prevailing prayer in general.

[Mark 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mar 11:25</span></span>

And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have aught against any; that
your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses,
&c.--This is repeated from the Sermon on the Mount (see on [Mat
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#012)); to remind them that if this was
necessary to the acceptableness of all prayer, much more when great
things were to be asked and confidently expected.
