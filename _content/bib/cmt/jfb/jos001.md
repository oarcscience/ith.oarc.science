### [Joshua Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001)

[Joshua 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 1:1</span></span>

THE LORD APPOINTS JOSHUA TO SUCCEED MOSES. (Jos. 1:1-18)

Now after the death of Moses--Joshua, having been already appointed and
designated leader of Israel ([Num
27:18-23](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#018)), in all probability assumed
the reins of government immediately "after the death of Moses."

the servant of the Lord--This was the official title of Moses as
invested with a special mission to make known the will of God; and it
conferred great honor and authority.

the Lord spake unto Joshua--probably during the period of public
mourning, and either by a direct revelation to the mind of Joshua, or by
means of Urim and Thummim ([Num
27:21](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#021)). This first communication gave
a pledge that the divine instructions which, according to the provisions
of the theocracy, had been imparted to Moses, would be continued to the
new leader, though God might not perhaps speak to him "mouth to mouth"
([Num 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#008)).

Joshua--The original name, Oshea, ([Num
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#008)), which had been, according to
Eastern usage, changed like those of Abram and Sarai ([Gen
17:5-15](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#005)) into Jehoshua or Joshua (that
is, "God's salvation") was significant of the services he was to render,
and typified those of a greater Saviour ([Heb
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#008)).

Moses' minister--that is, his official attendant, who, from being
constantly employed in important services and early initiated into the
principles of the government, would be well trained for undertaking the
leadership of Israel.

[Joshua 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jos 1:2</span></span>

now therefore arise, go over this Jordan--Joshua's mission was that of a
military leader. This passage records his call to begin the work, and
the address contains a literal repetition of the promise made to Moses
([Deu 11:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#024); [Deu
31:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#006), [Deu
31:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#023)).

[Joshua 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jos 1:3</span></span>

Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon that have I
given you--meaning, of course, not universal dominion, but only the
territory comprised within the boundaries here specified (see on [Deu
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#008)).

[Joshua 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jos 1:4</span></span>

all the land of the Hittites--These occupied the southern extremities
and were the dominant tribe of Canaan. Their superior power and the
extent of their dominions are attested by the mention of them under the
name of Khita, on the Assyrian inscriptions, and still more frequently
on the Egyptian inscriptions of the eighteenth and nineteenth Dynasties.
What life and encouragement must have been imparted to Joshua by the
assurance that his people, who had been overwhelmed with fear of that
gigantic race, were to possess "all the land of the Hittites"!

[Joshua 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jos 1:5</span></span>

There shall not any man be able to stand before thee--Canaan was theirs
by a divine grant; and the renewed confirmation of that grant to Joshua
when about to lead the people into it, intimated not only a certain but
an easy conquest. It is remarkable, however, that his courage and hope
of victory were made to depend (see on [Deu
17:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#018)) on his firm and inflexible
adherence to the law of God, not only that regarding the extirpation of
the Canaanites, but the whole divine code.

[Joshua 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jos 1:10</span></span>

Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people--These were the
Shoterim (see on [Exo 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#006); [Deu
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#005)).

[Joshua 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jos 1:11</span></span>

command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals--not manna, which,
though it still fell, would not keep; but corn, sheep, and articles of
food procurable in the conquered countries.

for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan--that is, the third
day, according to Hebrew idiom--the time allotted for getting ready
before the encampment in Abel-Shittim broke up and they removed to the
desert bank of the river where no victuals were available. At the same
time Joshua himself convened the two and a half tribes which had settled
east of Jordan, to remind them of their promise (Num. 32:1-42) to assist
their brethren in the conquest of western Canaan. Their readiness to
redeem their pledge and the terms in which they answered the appeal of
Joshua displayed to great advantage their patriotic and pious feelings
at so interesting a crisis.

[Joshua 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jos 1:14</span></span>

ye shall pass . . . armed--that is, officered or marshalled under five
leaders in the old and approved caravan order (see on [Exo
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#018)).

all the mighty men of valour--The words are not to be interpreted
strictly as meaning the whole, but only the flower or choice of the
fighting men (see on [Jos 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#012)).
