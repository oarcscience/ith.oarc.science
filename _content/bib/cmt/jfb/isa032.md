### [Isaiah Chapter 32](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#001)

[Isaiah 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 32:1</span></span>

MESSIAH'S KINGDOM; DESOLATIONS, TO BE SUCCEEDED BY LASTING PEACE, THE
SPIRIT HAVING BEEN POURED OUT. (Isa. 32:1-20)

king--not Hezekiah, who was already on the throne, whereas a future time
is contemplated. If he be meant at all, it can only be as a type of
Messiah the King, to whom alone the language is fully applicable ([Hos
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#005); [Zac
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#009); see on [Isa
11:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#003)). The kingdom shall be
transferred from the world kings, who have exercised their power against
God, instead of for God, to the rightful King of kings ([Eze
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#027); [Dan
7:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#013)).

princes--subordinate; referring to all in authority under Christ in the
coming kingdom on earth, for example, the apostles, &c. ([Luk
22:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#030); [Co1
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#002); [Ti2
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#012); [Rev
2:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#026); [Rev
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#021)).

[Isaiah 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 32:2</span></span>

a man--rather, the man Christ \[LOWTH\]; it is as "the Son of man" He is
to reign, as it was as Son of man He suffered ([Mat
26:64](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#064); [Joh
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#027); [Joh
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#005)). Not as MAURER explains, "every
one of the princes shall be," &c.

rivers--as refreshing as water and the cool shade are to the heated
traveller ([Isa 35:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#006); [Isa
41:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#018)).

[Isaiah 32:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 32:3</span></span>

them that see--the seers or prophets.

them that hear--the people under instruction ([Isa
35:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#005)).

[Isaiah 32:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 32:4</span></span>

rash--rather, "the hasty"; contrast "shall not make haste" ([Isa
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#016)); the reckless who will not take
time to weigh religious truth aright. Or else, the well-instructed
\[HORSLEY\].

stammers--those who speak confusedly on divine things (compare [Exo
4:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#010); [Jer
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#006); [Mat
10:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#019)). Or, rather, those drunken
scorners who in stammering style imitated Isaiah's warnings to mock them
\[MAURER\] ([Isa 28:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#007), [Isa
28:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#013), [Isa
28:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#022); [Isa
29:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#020)); in this view, translate,
"speak uprightly" (agreeably to the divine law); not as English Version,
referring to the distinctness of articulation, "plainly."

[Isaiah 32:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 32:5</span></span>

vile--rather, "fool" \[LOWTH\]; that is, ungodly ([Psa
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001); [Psa
74:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#018)).

liberal--rather, "noble-minded."

churl--rather, "fraudulent" \[GESENIUS\].

bountiful--religiously. The atheistic churl, who envies the believer his
hope "full of immortality," shall no longer be held as a patriot
struggling for the emancipation of mankind from superstition
\[HORSLEY\].

[Isaiah 32:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 32:6</span></span>

vile . . . villainy--rather, "the (irreligious) fool . . . (his) folly."

will speak--rather, "present"; for (so far is the "fool" from deserving
the epithet "noble-minded") the fool "speaketh" folly and "worketh," &c.

hypocrisy--rather, "profligacy" \[HORSLEY\].

error--impiety, perverse arguments.

hungry--spiritually ([Mat 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#006)).

[Isaiah 32:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 32:7</span></span>

churl--"the fraudulent"; this verse refers to the last clause of [Isa
32:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#005); as [Isa
32:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#006) referred to its first clause.

speaketh right--pleadeth a just cause ([Isa
29:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#021)); spiritually, "the poor man's
cause" is the divine doctrine, his rule of faith and practice.

[Isaiah 32:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 32:8</span></span>

liberal--rather, "noble-minded."

stand--shall be approved under the government of the righteous King.

[Isaiah 32:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 32:9</span></span>

Address to the women of Jerusalem who troubled themselves little about
the political signs of the times, but lived a life of self-indulgence
([Isa 3:16-23](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#016)); the failure of food
through the devastations of the enemy is here foretold, being what was
most likely to affect them as mothers of families, heretofore accustomed
to every luxury. VITRINGA understands "women--daughters" as the cities
and villages of Judea (Eze. 16:1-63). See [Amo
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#001).

[Isaiah 32:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 32:10</span></span>

Many days and years--rather, "In little more than a year" \[MAURER\];
literally, "days upon a year" (so [Isa
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#001)).

vintage shall fail--through the arrival of the Assyrian invader. As the
wheat harvest is omitted, Isaiah must look for the invasion in the
summer or autumn of 714 B.C., when the wheat would have been secured
already, and the later fruit "gathering," and vintage would be still in
danger.

[Isaiah 32:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 32:11</span></span>

strip you--of your gay clothing. (See [Isa
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#019), [Isa
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#021)).

[Isaiah 32:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 32:12</span></span>

lament for . . . teats--rather, shall smite on their breasts in
lamentation "for thy pleasant fields" ([Nah
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#007)) \[MAURER\]. "Teats" in English
Version is used for fertile lands, which, like breasts, nourish life.
The transition from "ye" to "they" ([Isa
32:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#011)) is frequent.

[Isaiah 32:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 32:13</span></span>

([Isa 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#006); [Isa
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#023)).

houses of joy--pleasure-houses outside of Jerusalem, not Jerusalem
itself, but other cities destroyed by Sennacherib in his march ([Isa
7:20-25](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#020)). However, the prophecy, in
its full accomplishment, refers to the utter desolation of Judea and its
capital by Rome, and subsequently, previous to the second coming of the
King ([Psa 118:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#026); [Luk
13:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#035); [Luk
19:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#038)); "the joyous city" is in this
view, Jerusalem ([Isa 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#002)).

[Isaiah 32:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 32:14</span></span>

palaces--most applicable to Jerusalem (see on [Isa
32:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#013)).

multitude . . . left--the noisy din of the city, that is, the city with
its noisy multitude shall lie forsaken \[MAURER\].

forts--rather, "Ophel" (that is, the mound), the term applied specially
to the declivity on the east of Zion, surrounded with its own wall ([Ch2
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#003); [Ch2
33:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#014); [Kg2
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#024)), and furnished with "towers" (or
watchtowers), perhaps referred to here ([Neh
3:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#026)).

for ever--limited by thee, "until," &c., [Isa
32:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#015), for a long time.

[Isaiah 32:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 32:15</span></span>

This can only partially apply to the spiritual revival in Hezekiah's
time; its full accomplishment belongs to the Christian dispensation,
first at Pentecost ([Joe 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#028); [Act
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#017)), perfectly in coming times ([Psa
104:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#030); [Eze
36:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#026); [Eze
39:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#029); [Zac
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010)), when the Spirit shall be
poured on Israel, and through it on the Gentiles ([Mic
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#007)).

wilderness . . . fruitful field . . . forest--when Judea, so long waste,
shall be populous and fruitful, and the land of the enemies of God shall
be desolate. Or, "the field, now fruitful, shall be but as a barren
forest in comparison with what it shall be then" ([Isa
29:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#017)). The barren shall become
fruitful by regeneration; those already regenerate shall bring forth
fruits in such abundance that their former life shall seem but as a
wilderness where no fruits were.

[Isaiah 32:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 32:16</span></span>

judgment--justice.

wilderness--then reclaimed.

fruitful field--then become more fruitful ([Isa
32:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#015)); thus "wilderness" and
"fruitful field" include the whole land of Judea.

[Isaiah 32:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 32:17</span></span>

work--the effect ([Pro 14:34](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#034); [Jam
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#018)).

peace--internal and external.

[Isaiah 32:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 32:18</span></span>

sure . . . quiet--free from fear of invasion.

[Isaiah 32:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 32:19</span></span>

Literally, "But it shall hail with coming down of the forest, and in
lowness shall the city (Nineveh) be brought low; that is, humbled." The
"hail" is Jehovah's wrathful visitation ([Isa
30:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#030); [Isa
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#002), [Isa
28:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#017)). The "forest" is the Assyrian
host, dense as the trees of a forest ([Isa
10:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#018), [Isa
10:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#033); [Zac
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#002)).

[Isaiah 32:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 32:20</span></span>

While the enemy shall be brought "low," the Jews shall cultivate their
land in undisturbed prosperity.

all waters--well-watered places ([Isa
30:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#025)). The Hebrew translation,
"beside," ought rather to be translated, "upon" ([Ecc
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#001)), where the meaning is, "Cast thy
seed upon the waters when the river overflows its banks; the seed will
sink into the mud and will spring up when the waters subside, and you
will find it after many days in a rich harvest." Before sowing, they
send oxen, &c., into the water to tread the ground for sowing. CASTALIO
thinks there is an allusion to the Mosaic precept, not to plough with an
ox and ass together, mystically implying that the Jew was to have no
intercourse with Gentiles; the Gospel abolishes this distinction ([Col
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#011)); thus the sense here is, Blessed
are ye that sow the gospel seed without distinction of race in the
teachers or the taught. But there is no need of supposing that the ox
and ass here are yoked together; they are probably "sent forth"
separately, as in [Isa 30:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#024).
