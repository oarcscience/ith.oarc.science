Testaments*, by Robert Jamieson, A.R. Fausset and David Brown \[1882\]

### [Exodus Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#001)

[Exodus 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 23:1</span></span>

LAWS CONCERNING SLANDER, &c. (Exo. 23:1-33)

put not thine hand--join not hands.

[Exodus 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">exo 23:2</span></span>

decline--depart, deviate from the straight path of rectitude.

[Exodus 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">exo 23:3</span></span>

countenance--adorn, embellish--thou shalt not varnish the cause even of
a poor man to give it a better coloring than it merits.

[Exodus 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">exo 23:10</span></span>

six years thou shalt sow thy land--intermitting the cultivation of the
land every seventh year. But it appears that even then there was a
spontaneous produce which the poor were permitted freely to gather for
their use, and the beasts driven out fed on the remainder, the owners of
fields not being allowed to reap or collect the fruits of the vineyard
or oliveyard during the course of this sabbatical year. This was a
regulation subservient to many excellent purposes; for, besides
inculcating the general lesson of dependence on Providence, and of
confidence in His faithfulness to His promise respecting the triple
increase on the sixth year ([Lev
25:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#020)), it gave the Israelites a
practical proof that they held their properties of the Lord as His
tenants, and must conform to His rules on pain of forfeiting the lease
of them.

[Exodus 23:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">exo 23:12</span></span>

Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou shalt
rest--This law is repeated \[[Exo
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#009)\] lest any might suppose there
was a relaxation of its observance during the sabbatical year.

[Exodus 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">exo 23:13</span></span>

make no mention of the name of other gods, &c.--that is, in common
conversation, for a familiar use of them would tend to lessen horror of
idolatry.

[Exodus 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">exo 23:14</span></span>

Three times . . . keep a feast . . . in the year--This was the
institution of the great religious festivals--"The feast of unleavened
bread," or the passover--"the feast of harvest," or pentecost--"the
feast of ingathering," or the feast of tabernacles, which was a memorial
of the dwelling in booths in the wilderness, and which was observed in
the seventh month ([Exo 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#002)). All the
males were enjoined to repair to the tabernacle and afterwards the
temple, and the women frequently went. The institution of this national
custom was of the greatest importance in many ways: by keeping up a
national sense of religion and a public uniformity in worship, by
creating a bond of unity, and also by promoting internal commerce among
the people. Though the absence of all the males at these three festivals
left the country defenseless, a special promise was given of divine
protection, and no incursion of enemies was ever permitted to happen on
those occasions.

[Exodus 23:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">exo 23:19</span></span>

Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk--A prohibition against
imitating the superstitious rites of the idolaters in Egypt, who, at the
end of their harvest, seethed a kid in its mother's milk and sprinkled
the broth as a magical charm on their gardens and fields, to render them
more productive the following season. \[See on [Deu
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#021)\].

[Exodus 23:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">exo 23:20</span></span>

Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way--The
communication of these laws, made to Moses and by him rehearsed to the
people, was concluded by the addition of many animating promises,
intermingled with several solemn warnings that lapses into sin and
idolatry would not be tolerated or passed with impunity.

[Exodus 23:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">exo 23:21</span></span>

my name is in him--This angel is frequently called Jehovah and Elohim,
that is, God.

[Exodus 23:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">exo 23:28</span></span>

I will send hornets before thee, &c. (See on [Jos
24:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#012)) --Some instrument of divine
judgment, but variously interpreted: as hornets in a literal sense
\[BOCHART\]; as a pestilential disease \[ROSENMULLER\]; as a terror of
the Lord, an extraordinary dejection \[JUNIUS\].

[Exodus 23:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">exo 23:29</span></span>

I will not drive . . . out . . . in one year; lest the land become
desolate--Many reasons recommend a gradual extirpation of the former
inhabitants of Canaan. But only one is here specified--the danger lest,
in the unoccupied grounds, wild beasts should inconveniently multiply; a
clear proof that the promised land was more than sufficient to contain
the actual population of the Israelites.
