### [Lamentations Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#001)

[Lamentations 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lam 2:1</span></span>

(Lam. 2:1-22)

How--The title of the collection repeated here, and in [Lam
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#001).

covered . . . with a cloud--that is, with the darkness of ignominy.

cast down from heaven unto . . . earth-- ([Mat
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#023)); dashed down from the highest
prosperity to the lowest misery.

beauty of Israel--the beautiful temple ([Psa
29:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#002); [Psa
74:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#007); [Psa
96:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#009), Margin; [Isa
60:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#007); [Isa
64:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#011)).

his footstool--the ark (compare [Ch1
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#002), with [Psa
99:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#005); [Psa
132:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#007)). They once had gloried more in
the ark than in the God whose symbol it was; they now feel it was but
His "footstool," yet that it had been a great glory to them that God
deigned to use it as such.

[Lamentations 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lam 2:2</span></span>

polluted--by delivering it into the hands of the profane foe. Compare
[Psa 89:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#039), "profaned . . . crown."

[Lamentations 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lam 2:3</span></span>

horn--worn in the East as an ornament on the forehead, and an emblem of
power and majesty ([Sa1 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#010); [Psa
132:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#017); see on [Jer
48:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#025)).

drawn back . . . fight hand-- ([Psa
74:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#011)). God has withdrawn the help
which He before gave them. Not as HENDERSON, "He has turned back his
(Israel's) right hand" ([Psa 89:43](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#043)).

[Lamentations 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lam 2:4</span></span>

([Isa 63:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#010)).

stood with . . . right hand--He took His stand so as to use His right
hand as an adversary. HENDERSON makes the image to be that of an archer
steadying his right hand to take aim. Not only did He withdraw His help,
but also took arms against Israel.

all . . . pleasant to . . . eye-- ([Eze
24:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#025)). All that were conspicuous for
youth, beauty, and rank.

in . . . tabernacle--the dwellings of Jerusalem.

[Lamentations 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">lam 2:5</span></span>

an enemy-- ([Jer 30:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#014)).

mourning and lamentation--There is a play of similar sounds in the
original, "sorrow and sadness," to heighten the effect ([Job
30:3](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#003), Hebrew; [Eze
35:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#003), Margin).

[Lamentations 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">lam 2:6</span></span>

tabernacle--rather, "He hath violently taken away His hedge (the hedge
of the place sacred to Him, [Psa
80:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#012); [Psa
89:40](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#040); [Isa
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#005)), as that of a garden" \[MAURER\].
CALVIN supports English Version, "His tabernacle (that is, temple) as
(one would take away the temporary cottage or booth) of a garden." [Isa
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#008) accords with this ([Job
27:18](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#018)).

places of . . . assembly--the temple and synagogues ([Psa
74:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#007)).

solemn feasts-- ([Lam 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#004)).

[Lamentations 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">lam 2:7</span></span>

they . . . made a noise in . . . house of . . . Lord, as in . . .
feast--The foe's shout of triumph in the captured temple bore a
resemblance (but oh, how sad a contrast as to the occasion of it!) to
the joyous thanksgivings we used to offer in the same place at our
"solemn feasts" (compare [Lam 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#022)).

[Lamentations 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">lam 2:8</span></span>

stretched . . . a line--The Easterns used a measuring-line not merely in
building, but in destroying edifices ([Kg2
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#013); [Isa
34:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#011)); implying here the unsparing
rigidness with which He would exact punishment.

[Lamentations 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">lam 2:9</span></span>

Her gates cannot oppose the entrance of the foe into the city, for they
are sunk under a mass of rubbish and earth.

broken . . . bars-- ([Jer 51:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#030)).

her king . . . among . . . Gentiles-- ([Deu
28:36](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#036)).

law . . . no more-- ([Ch2 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#003)). The
civil and religious laws were one under the theocracy. "All the legal
ordinances (prophetical as well as priestly) of the theocracy, are no
more" ([Psa 74:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#009); [Eze
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#026)).

[Lamentations 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">lam 2:10</span></span>

([Job 2:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#012)). The "elders," by their
example, would draw the others to violent grief.

the virgins--who usually are so anxious to set off their personal
appearances to advantage.

[Lamentations 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">lam 2:11</span></span>

liver is poured, &c.--that is, as the liver was thought to be the seat
of the passions, "all my feelings are poured out and prostrated for,"
&c. The "liver," is here put for the bile ("gall," [Job
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#013); "bowels," [Psa
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#014)) in a bladder on the surface of
the liver, copiously discharged when the passions are agitated.

swoon--through faintness from the effects of hunger.

[Lamentations 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">lam 2:12</span></span>

as the wounded--famine being as deadly as the sword ([Jer
52:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#006)).

soul . . . poured . . . into . . . mothers bosom--Instinctively turning
to their mother's bosom, but finding no milk there, they breathe out
their life as it were "into her bosom."

[Lamentations 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">lam 2:13</span></span>

What thing shall I take to witness--What can I bring forward as a
witness, or instance, to prove that others have sustained as grievous
ills as thou? I cannot console thee as mourners are often consoled by
showing that thy lot is only what others, too, suffer. The "sea" affords
the only suitable emblem of thy woes, by its boundless extent and depth
([Lam 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#012); [Dan
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#012)).

[Lamentations 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lam 2:14</span></span>

Thy prophets--not God's ([Jer 23:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#026)).

vain . . . for thee--to gratify thy appetite, not for truth, but for
false things.

not discovered thine iniquity--in opposition to God's command to the
true prophets ([Isa 58:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#001)). Literally,
"They have not taken off (the veil) which was on thine iniquity, so as
to set it before thee."

burdens--Their prophecies were soothing and flattering; but the result
of them was heavy calamities to the people, worse than even what the
prophecies of Jeremiah, which they in derision called "burdens,"
threatened. Hence he terms their pretended prophecies "false burdens,"
which proved to the Jews "causes of their banishment" \[CALVIN\].

[Lamentations 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">lam 2:15</span></span>

clap . . . hands--in derision ([Job
27:23](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#023); [Job
34:37](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#037)).

wag . . . head-- ([Kg2 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#021); [Psa
44:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#014)).

perfection of beauty . . . joy of . . . earth-- ([Psa
48:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#002); [Psa
50:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#002)). The Jews' enemies quote their
very words in scorn.

[Lamentations 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">lam 2:16</span></span>

For the transposition of Hebrew letters (Pe and Ain, [Lam
2:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#016)) in the order of verses, see
Introduction.

opened . . . mouth--as ravening, roaring wild beasts ([Job
16:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#009); [Psa
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#013)). Herein Jerusalem was a type of
Messiah.

gnash . . . teeth--in vindictive malice.

we have seen it-- ([Psa 35:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#021)).

[Lamentations 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">lam 2:17</span></span>

Lord--Let not the foe exult as if it was their doing. It was "the Lord"
who thus fulfilled the threats uttered by His prophets for the guilt of
Judea ([Lev 26:16-25](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#016); [Deu
28:36-48](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#036), [Deu
28:53](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#053); [Jer
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#009)).

[Lamentations 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">lam 2:18</span></span>

wall-- ([Lam 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#008)). Personified. "Their
heart," that is, the Jews'; while their heart is lifted up to the Lord
in prayer, their speech is addressed to the "wall" (the part being put
for the whole city).

let tears, &c.-- ([Jer 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#017)). The
wall is called on to weep for its own ruin and that of the city. Compare
the similar personification ([Lam
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#004)).

apple--the pupil of the eye ([Psa
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#008)).

[Lamentations 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">lam 2:19</span></span>

cry . . . in . . . night-- ([Psa
119:147](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#147)).

beginning of . . . watches--that is, the first of the three equal
divisions (four hours each) into which the ancient Jews divided the
night; namely, from sunset to ten o'clock. The second was called "the
middle watch" ([Jdg 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#019)), from ten
till two o'clock. The third, "the morning watch," from two to sunrise
([Exo 14:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#024); [Sa1
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#011)). Afterwards, under the Romans,
they had four watches ([Mat 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#025);
[Luk 12:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#038)).

for . . . thy . . . children--that God, if He will not spare thee, may
at least preserve "thy young children."

top of . . . street-- ([Isa 51:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#020);
[Nah 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#010)).

[Lamentations 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">lam 2:20</span></span>

women eat . . . fruit--as threatened ([Lev
26:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#029); [Deu
28:53](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#053), [Deu
28:56-57](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#056); [Jer
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#009)).

children . . . span long--or else, "children whom they carry in their
arms" \[MAURER\].

[Lamentations 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">lam 2:21</span></span>

([Ch2 36:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#017)).

[Lamentations 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">lam 2:22</span></span>

Thou hast called as in . . . solemn day . . . terrors--Thou hast
summoned my enemies against me from all quarters, just as multitudes
used to be convened to Jerusalem, on the solemn feast days. The objects,
for which the enemies and the festal multitude respectively met, formed
a sad contrast. Compare [Lam 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#015) :
"called an assembly against me."

Jeremiah proposes his own experience under afflictions, as an example as
to how the Jews should behave under theirs, so as to have hope of a
restoration; hence the change from singular to plural ([Lam
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#022), [Lam
3:40-47](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#040)). The stanzas consist of three
lines, each of which begins with the same Hebrew letter.
