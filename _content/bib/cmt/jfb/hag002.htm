The people, discouraged at the inferiority of this temple to Solomon's, are encouraged nevertheless to persevere, because God is with them, and this house by its connection with Messiah's kingdom shall have a glory far above that of gold and silver. (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#001">Hag 2:1-9</A>)
<p>
<p>seventh month--of the Hebrew year; in the second year of Darius reign (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#001">Hag 1:1</A>); not quite a month after they had begun the work (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#015">Hag 1:15</A>). This prophecy was very shortly before that of Zechariah.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#003">Haggai 2:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">hag 2:3</A></FONT></span></p>Who is left . . . that saw . . . first glory--Many elders present at the laying of the foundation of the second temple who had seen the first temple (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#012">Ezr 3:12-13</A>) in all its glory, wept at the contrast presented by the rough and unpromising appearance of the former in its beginnings. From the destruction of the first temple to the second year of Darius Hystaspes, the date of Haggai's prophecy, was a space of seventy years (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#012">Zac 1:12</A>); and to the first year of Cyrus, or the end of the captivity, fifty-two years; so that the elders might easily remember the first temple. The Jews note five points of inferiority: The absence from the second temple of (1) the sacred fire; (2) the Shekinah; (3) the ark and cherubim; (4) the Urim and Thummim; (5) the spirit of prophecy. The connection of it with Messiah more than counterbalanced all these; for He is the antitype to all the five (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#009">Hag 2:9</A>). 
<p>
<p>how do ye see it now?--God's estimate of things is very different from man's (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#006">Zac 8:6</A>; compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#007">Sa1 16:7</A>). However low their estimate of the present temple ("it") from its outward inferiority, God holds it superior (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#010">Zac 4:10</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#027">Co1 1:27-28</A>).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">hag 2:4</A></FONT></span></p>be strong . . . for I am with you--The greatest strength is to have Jehovah with us as our strength. Not in man's "might," but in that of God's Spirit (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#006">Zac 4:6</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#005">Haggai 2:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">hag 2:5</A></FONT></span></p>According to the word that--literally, "(I am with you) the word (or thing) which I covenanted"; that is, I am with you as I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005">Exo 19:5-6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#010">Exo 34:10-11</A>). The covenant promise of God to the elect people at Sinai is an additional motive for their persevering. The Hebrew for to "covenant" is literally "to cut," alluding to the sacrificial victims cut in ratification of a covenant. 
<p>
<p>so--or, "and." 
<p>
<p>my Spirit remaineth among you--to strengthen you for the work (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#014">Hag 1:14</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#006">Zac 4:6</A>). The inspiration of Haggai and Zechariah at this time was a specimen of the presence of God's Spirit remaining still with His people, as He had been with Moses and Israel of old (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#001">Ezr 5:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#011">Isa 63:11</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#006">Haggai 2:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">hag 2:6</A></FONT></span></p>Yet once, it is a little while--or, "(it is) yet a little while." The Hebrew for "once" expresses the indefinite article "a" [MAURER]. Or, "it is yet only a little while"; literally, "one little," that is, a single brief space till a series of movements is to begin; namely, the shakings of nations soon to begin which are to end in the advent of Messiah, "the desire of all nations" [MOORE]. The shaking of nations implies judgments of wrath on the foes of God's people, to precede the reign of the Prince of peace (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#013">Isa 13:13</A>). The kingdoms of the world are but the scaffolding for God's spiritual temple, to be thrown down when their purpose is accomplished. The transitoriness of all that is earthly should lead men to seek "peace" in Messiah's everlasting kingdom (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#009">Hag 2:9</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#027">Heb 12:27-28</A>) [MOORE]. The Jews in Haggai's times hesitated about going forward with the work, through dread of the world power, Medo-Persia, influenced by the craft of Samaria. The prophet assures them this and all other world powers are to fall before Messiah, who is to be associated with this temple; therefore they need fear naught. So <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#026">Heb 12:26</A>, which quotes this passage; the apostle compares the heavier punishment which awaits the disobedient under the New Testament with that which met such under the Old Testament. At the establishment of the Sinaitic covenant, only the earth was shaken to introduce it, but now heaven and earth and all things are to be shaken, that is, along with prodigies in the world of nature, all kingdoms that stand in the way of Messiah's kingdom, "which cannot be shaken," are to be upturned (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#035">Dan 2:35</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#044">Dan 2:44</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#044">Mat 21:44</A>). <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#027">Heb 12:27</A>, "Yet once more," favors English Version. Paul condenses together the two verses of Haggai (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#006">Hag 2:6-7</A>, and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#021">Hag 2:21-22</A>), implying that it was one and the same shaking, of which the former verses of Haggai denote the beginning, the latter the end. The shaking began introductory to the first advent; it will be finished at the second. Concerning the former, compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#017">Mat 3:17</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#051">Mat 27:51</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#002">Mat 28:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#002">Act 2:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#031">Act 4:31</A>; concerning the latter, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#007">Mat 24:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#020">Rev 16:20</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#020">Rev 18:20</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#011">Rev 20:11</A> [BENGEL]. There is scarcely a prophecy of Messiah in the Old Testament which does not, to some extent at least, refer to His second coming [SIR ISAAC NEWTON]. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#008">Psa 68:8</A> mentions the heavens dropping near the mountain (Sinai); but Haggai speaks of the whole created heavens: "Wait only a little while, though the promised event is not apparent yet; for soon will God change things for the better: do not stop short with these preludes and fix your eyes on the present state of the temple [CALVIN]. God shook the heavens by the lightnings at Sinai; the earth, that it should give forth waters; the sea, that it should be divided asunder. In Christ's time God shook the heaven, when He spake from it; the earth, when it quaked; the sea, when He commanded the winds and waves [GROTIUS]. CICERO records at the time of Christ the silencing of the heathen oracles; and DIO, the fall of the idols in the Roman capitol.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#007">Haggai 2:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">hag 2:7</A></FONT></span></p>shake--not convert; but cause that agitation which is to precede Messiah's coming as the healer of the nations' agitations. The previous shaking shall cause the yearning "desire" for the Prince of peace. MOORE and others translate "the beauty," or "the desirable things (the precious gifts) of all nations shall come" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#005">Isa 60:5</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#011">Isa 60:11</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#006">Isa 61:6</A>). He brings these objections to applying "the desire of all nations" to Messiah: (1) The Hebrew means the quality, not the thing desired, namely, its desirableness or beauty, But the abstract is often put for the concrete. So "a man of desires," that is, one desired or desirable (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#023">Dan 9:23</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#011">Dan 10:11</A>, Margin; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#003">Dan 10:3</A>, Margin). (2) Messiah was not desired by all nations, but "a root out of a dry ground," having "no beauty that we should desire Him" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#002">Isa 53:2</A>). But what is implied is not that the nations definitely desired Him, but that He was the only one to satisfy the yearning desires which all felt unconsciously for a Saviour, shown in their painful rites and bloody sacrifices. Moreover, while the Jews as a nation desired Him not (to which people <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#002">Isa 53:2</A> refers), the Gentiles, who are plainly pointed out by "all nations," accepted Him; and so to them He was peculiarly desirable. (3) The verb, "shall come," is plural, which requires the noun to be understood in the plural, whereas if Messiah be intended, the noun is singular. But when two nouns stand together, of which one is governed by the other, the verb agrees sometimes in number with the latter, though it really has the former as its nominative, that is, the Hebrew "come" is made in number to agree with "nations," though really agreeing with "the desire." Besides, Messiah may be described as realizing in Himself at His coming "the desires (the noun expressing collectively the plural) of all nations"; whence the verb is plural. So in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#016">Sol 5:16</A>, "He is altogether lovely," in the Hebrew the same word as here, "all desires," that is, altogether desirable, or the object of desires. (4) <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#008">Hag 2:8</A>, "The silver is mine," &amp;c.; accords with the translation, "the choice things of all nations" shall be brought in. But <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#008">Hag 2:8</A> harmonizes quite as well with English Version of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#007">Hag 2:7</A>, as the note on eighth verse will show; see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#008">Hag 2:8</A>. (5) the Septuagint and Syriac versions agree with MOORE'S translation. But Vulgate confirms English Version. So also early Jewish Rabbis before JEROME'S time. PLATO [Alcibiades, 2] shows the yearning of the Gentiles after a spiritual deliverer: "It is therefore necessary," says Alcibiades on the subject of acceptable worship, "to wait until One teach us how we ought to behave towards the gods and men." Alcibiades replies, "When shall that time arrive, and who shall that Teacher be? For most glad would I be to see such a man." The "good tidings of great joy" were "to all people" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#010">Luk 2:10</A>). The Jews, and those in the adjoining nations instructed by them, looked for Shiloh to come unto whom the gathering of the people was to be, from Jacob's prophecy (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010">Gen 49:10</A>). The early patriarchs, Job (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#025">Job 19:25-27</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#023">Job 33:23-26</A>) and Abraham (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#056">Joh 8:56</A>), desired Him. 
<p>
<p>fill this house with glory-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#009">Hag 2:9</A>). As the first temple was filled with the cloud of glory, the symbol of God (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#011">Kg1 8:11</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#014">Ch2 5:14</A>), so this second temple was filled with the "glory" of God (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014">Joh 1:14</A>) veiled in the flesh (as it were in the cloud) at Christ's first coming, when He entered it and performed miracles there (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#012">Mat 21:12-14</A>); but that "glory" is to be revealed at His second coming, as this prophecy in its ulterior reference foretells (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001">Mal 3:1</A>). The Jews before the destruction of Jerusalem all expected Messiah would appear in the second temple. Since that time they invent various forced and false interpretations of such plain Messianic prophecies.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#008">Haggai 2:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">hag 2:8</A></FONT></span></p>The silver is mine-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#011">Job 41:11</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#012">Psa 50:12</A>). Ye are disappointed at the absence of these precious metals in the adorning of this temple, as compared with the first temple: If I pleased I could adorn this temple with them, but I will adorn it with a "glory" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#007">Hag 2:7</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#009">Hag 2:9</A>) far more precious; namely, with the presence of My divine Son in His veiled glory first, and at His second coming with His revealed glory, accompanied with outward adornment of gold and silver, of which the golden covering within and without put on by Herod is the type. Then shall the nations bring offerings of those precious metals which ye now miss so much (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#003">Isa 2:3</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#003">Isa 60:3</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#006">Isa 60:6-7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#002">Eze 43:2</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#004">Eze 43:4-5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#004">Eze 44:4</A>). The heavenly Jerusalem shall be similarly adorned, but shall need "no temple" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#010">Rev 21:10-22</A>). Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#012">Co1 3:12</A>, where gold and silver represent the most precious things (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#005">Zac 2:5</A>). The inward glory of New Testament redemption far exceeds the outward glory of the Old Testament dispensation. So, in the case of the individual poor believer, God, if He pleased, could bestow gold and silver, but He bestows far better treasures, the possession of which might be endangered by that of the former (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#005">Jam 2:5</A>).

<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#009">Haggai 2:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">hag 2:9</A></FONT></span></p>The glory of this latter house . . . greater than of the former--namely, through the presence of Messiah, in (whose) face is given the light of the knowledge of the glory of God (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#006">Co2 4:6</A>; compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002">Heb 1:2</A>), and who said of Himself, "in this place is one greater than the temple" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#006">Mat 12:6</A>), and who "sat daily teaching in it" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#055">Mat 26:55</A>). Though Zerubbabel's temple was taken down to the foundations when Herod rebuilt the temple, the latter was considered, in a religious point of view, as not a third temple, but virtually the second temple. 
<p>
<p>in this place . . . peace--namely, at Jerusalem, the metropolis of the kingdom of God, whose seat was the temple: where Messiah "made peace through the blood of His cross" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#020">Col 1:20</A>). Thus the "glory" consists in this "peace." This peace begins by the removal of the difficulty in the way of the just God accepting the guilty (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#008">Psa 85:8</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#010">Psa 85:10</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006">Isa 9:6-7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#005">Isa 53:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#013">Zac 6:13</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#018">Co2 5:18-19</A>); then it creates peace in the sinner's own heart (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#019">Isa 57:19</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#036">Act 10:36</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#001">Rom 5:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#017">Rom 14:17</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#013">Eph 2:13-17</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#007">Phi 4:7</A>); then peace in the whole earth (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#005">Mic 5:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#014">Luk 2:14</A>).

As "Shiloh" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010">Gen 49:10</A>) means peace, this verse confirms the view that <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#007">Hag 2:7</A>, "the desire of all nations," refers to Shiloh or Messiah, foretold in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010">Gen 49:10</A>.

(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#027">Lev 6:27</A>). This is cited to illustrate the principle, that a sacrifice, holy, as enveloping divine things (just as the "skirt" is "holy" which envelops "holy" flesh), cannot by its inherent or opus operatum efficacy make holy a person whose disobedience, as that of the Jew while neglecting God's house, made him unholy.

<p>so is this people--heretofore not in such an obedient state of mind as to deserve to be called My people (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#015">Tit 1:15</A>). Here he applies the two cases just stated. By the first case, "this people" is not made "holy" by their offerings "there" (namely, on the altar built in the open air, under Cyrus, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#003">Ezr 3:3</A>); though the ritual sacrifice can ordinarily sanctify outwardly so far as it reaches (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#013">Heb 9:13</A>), as the "holy flesh" sanctified the "skirt," yet it cannot make the offerers in their persons and all their works acceptable to God, because lacking the spirit of obedience (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#022">Sa1 15:22</A>) so long as they neglected to build the Lord's house. On the contrary, by the second case, they made "unclean" their very offerings by being unclean through "dead works" (disobedience), just as the person unclean by contact with a dead body imparted his uncleanness to all that he touched (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#014">Heb 9:14</A>). This all applies to them as they had been, not as they are now that they have begun to obey; the design is to guard them against falling back again. The "there" points to the altar, probably in view of the audience which the prophet addressed.

Ponder earnestly, retracing the past "upward" (that is, backward), comparing what evils heretofore befell you before ye set about this work, with the present time when you have again commenced it, and when in consequence I now engage to "bless you." Hence ye may perceive the evils of disobedience and the blessing of obedience.

<p>fifty vessels out of the press--As the Septuagint translates "measure," and Vulgate "a flagon," and as we should rather expect vat than press. MAURER translates (omitting vessels, which is not in the original), "purahs," or "wine-measures."

God's displeasure. Compare "(let him come) unto Me!" Moses in excitement omitting the bracketed words (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#026">Exo 32:26</A>). "Blasting" results from excessive drought; "mildew, from excessive moisture.

<p>even from the day that the foundation of . . . temple was laid--The first foundation beneath the earth had been long ago laid in the second year of Cyrus, 535 B.C. (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#010">Ezr 3:10-11</A>); the foundation now laid was the secondary one, which, above the earth, was laid on the previous work [TIRINUS]. Or, translate, "From this day on which the temple is being begun," namely, on the foundations long ago laid [GROTIUS]. MAURER translates, "Consider . . . from the four and twentieth day . . . to (the time which has elapsed) from the day on which the foundation . . . was laid." The Hebrew supports English Version.

It has been already sown this month, and there are no more signs of its bearing a good crop, much less of its being safely stored in the barn, than there were in the past season, when there was such a failure; yet I promise to you from this day (emphatically marking by the repetition the connection of the blessing with the day of their obedience) a blessing in an abundant harvest. So also the vine, &amp;c., which heretofore have borne little or nothing, shall be blessed with productiveness. Thus it will be made evident that the blessing is due to Me, not to nature.

This is the reply: The Jews had been led to fear that these convulsions would destroy their national existence. Zerubbabel, therefore, as their civil leader and representative is addressed, not Joshua, their religious leader. Messiah is the antitypical Zerubbabel, their national Representative and King, with whom God the Father makes the covenant wherein they, as identified with Him, are assured of safety in God's electing love (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#023">Hag 2:23</A>, "will make thee as a signet"; "I have chosen thee").

A ring with a seal on it; the legal representative of the owner; generally of precious stones and gold, &amp;c., and much valued. Being worn on the finger, it was an object of constant regard. In all which points of view the theocratic people, and their representative, Zerubbabel the type, and Messiah his descendant the Antitype, are regarded by God. The safety of Israel to the end is guaranteed in Messiah, in whom God hath chosen them as His own (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001">Isa 42:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#010">Isa 43:10</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#001">Isa 44:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#003">Isa 49:3</A>). So the spiritual Israel is sealed in their covenant head by His Spirit (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#020">Co2 1:20</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#022">Co2 1:22</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#004">Eph 1:4</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#013">Eph 1:13-14</A>). All is ascribed, not to the merits of Zerubbabel, but to God's gratuitous choice. Christ is the "signet" on God's hand: always in the Father's presence, ever pleasing in his sight. The signet of an Eastern monarch was the sign of delegated authority; so Christ (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#018">Mat 28:18</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#022">Joh 5:22-23</A>).
