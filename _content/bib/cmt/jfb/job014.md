### [Job Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#001)

[Job 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 14:1</span></span>

JOB PASSES FROM HIS OWN TO THE COMMON MISERY OF MANKIND. (Job 14:1-22)

woman--feeble, and in the East looked down upon ([Gen
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#021)). Man being born of one so frail
must be frail himself ([Mat 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#011)).

few days-- ([Gen 47:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#009); [Psa
90:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#010)). Literally, "short of days."
Man is the reverse of full of days and short of trouble.

[Job 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 14:2</span></span>

([Psa 90:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#006); see on [Job
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#009)).

[Job 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 14:3</span></span>

open . . . eyes upon--Not in graciousness; but, "Dost Thou sharply fix
Thine eyes upon?" (See on [Job 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#020);
also see on [Job 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#007)). Is one so frail
as man worthy of such constant watching on the part of God? ([Zac
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#004)).

me--so frail.

thee--so almighty.

[Job 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 14:4</span></span>

A plea in mitigation. The doctrine of original sin was held from the
first. "Man is unclean from his birth, how then can God expect perfect
cleanness from such a one and deal so severely with me?"

[Job 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 14:5</span></span>

determined-- ([Job 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#001); [Isa
10:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#023); [Dan
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027); [Dan
11:36](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#036)).

[Job 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 14:6</span></span>

Turn--namely, Thine eyes from watching him so jealously ([Job
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#003)).

hireling-- ([Job 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#001)).

accomplish--rather, "enjoy." That he may at least enjoy the measure of
rest of the hireling who though hard worked reconciles himself to his
lot by the hope of his rest and reward \[UMBREIT\].

[Job 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 14:7</span></span>

Man may the more claim a peaceful life, since, when separated from it by
death, he never returns to it. This does not deny a future life, but a
return to the present condition of life. Job plainly hopes for a future
state ([Job 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#013); [Job
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#002)). Still, it is but vague and
trembling hope, not assurance; excepting the one bright glimpse in [Job
19:25](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#025). The Gospel revelation was
needed to change fears, hopes, and glimpses into clear and definite
certainties.

[Job 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 14:9</span></span>

scent--exhalation, which, rather than the humidity of water, causes the
tree to germinate. In the antithesis to man the tree is personified, and
volition is poetically ascribed to it.

like a plant--"as if newly planted" \[UMBREIT\]; not as if trees and
plants were a different species.

[Job 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 14:10</span></span>

man . . . man--Two distinct Hebrew words are here used; Geber, a mighty
man: though mighty, he dies. Adam, a man of earth: because earthly, he
gives up the ghost.

wasteth--is reduced to nothing: he cannot revive in the present state,
as the tree does. The cypress and pine, which when cut down do not
revive, were the symbols of death among the Romans.

[Job 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 14:11</span></span>

sea--that is, a lake, or pool formed from the outspreading of a river.
Job lived near the Euphrates: and "sea" is applied to it ([Jer
51:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#036); [Isa
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#001)). So of the Nile ([Isa
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#005)).

fail--utterly disappeared by drying up. The rugged channel of the once
flowing water answers to the outstretched corpse ("lieth down," [Job
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#012)) of the once living man.

[Job 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 14:12</span></span>

heavens be no more--This only implies that Job had no hope of living
again in the present order of the world, not that he had no hope of life
again in a new order of things. [Psa
102:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#026) proves that early under the Old
Testament the dissolution of the present earth and heavens was expected
(compare [Gen 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#022)). Enoch before Job
had implied that the "saints shall live again" ([Jde
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#014); [Heb
11:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#013)). Even if, by this phrase,
Job meant "never" ([Psa 89:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#029)) in his
gloomier state of feelings, yet the Holy Ghost has made him
unconsciously ([Pe1 1:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#011)) use
language expressing the truth, that the resurrection is to be preceded
by the dissolution of the heavens. In [Job
14:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#013) he plainly passes to brighter
hopes of a world to come.

[Job 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 14:13</span></span>

Job wishes to be kept hidden in the grave until God's wrath against him
shall have passed away. So while God's wrath is visiting the earth for
the abounding apostasy which is to precede the second coming, God's
people shall be hidden against the resurrection glory ([Isa
26:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#019)).

set time--a decreed time ([Act 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#007)).

[Job 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 14:14</span></span>

shall he live?--The answer implied is, There is a hope that he shall,
though not in the present order of life, as is shown by the words
following. Job had denied ([Job
14:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#010)) that man shall live again in
this present world. But hoping for a "set time," when God shall remember
and raise him out of the hiding-place of the grave ([Job
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#013)), he declares himself willing to
"wait all the days of his appointed time" of continuance in the grave,
however long and hard that may be.

appointed time--literally, "warfare, hard service"; imlying the hardship
of being shut out from the realms of life, light, and God for the time
he shall be in the grave ([Job 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#001)).

change--my release, as a soldier at his post released from duty by the
relieving guard (see on [Job 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#017))
\[UMBREIT and GESENIUS\], but elsewhere GESENIUS explains it,
"renovation," as of plants in spring ([Job
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#007)), but this does not accord so
well with the metaphor in "appointed time" or "warfare."

[Job 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 14:15</span></span>

namely, at the resurrection ([Joh
5:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#028); [Psa
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#015)).

have a desire to--literally, "become pale with anxious desire:" the same
word is translated "sore longedst after" ([Gen
31:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#030); [Psa
84:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#002)), implying the utter unlikelihood
that God would leave in oblivion the "creature of His own hands so
fearfully and wonderfully made." It is objected that if Job knew of a
future retribution, he would make it the leading topic in solving the
problem of the permitted afflictions of the righteous. But, (1) He did
not intend to exceed the limits of what was clearly revealed; the
doctrine was then in a vague form only; (2) The doctrine of God's moral
government in this life, even independently of the future, needed
vindication.

[Job 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 14:16</span></span>

Rather, "Yea, thou wilt number my steps, and wilt not (as now) jealously
watch over my sin." Thenceforward, instead of severe watching for every
sin of Job, God will guard him against every sin.

number . . . steps--that is, minutely attend to them, that they may not
wander \[UMBREIT\] ([Sa1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#009); [Psa
37:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#023)).

[Job 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 14:17</span></span>

sealed up-- ([Job 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#007)). Is shut up in
eternal oblivion, that is, God thenceforth will think no more of my
former sins. To cover sins is to completely forgive them ([Psa
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001); [Psa
85:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#002)). Purses of money in the East are
usually sealed.

sewest up--rather, "coverest"; akin to an Arabic word, "to color over,"
to forget wholly.

[Job 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 14:18</span></span>

cometh to naught--literally, "fadeth"; a poetical image from a leaf
([Isa 34:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#004)). Here Job falls back into
his gloomy bodings as to the grave. Instead of "and surely," translate
"yet"; marking the transition from his brighter hopes. Even the solid
mountain falls and crumbles away; man therefore cannot "hope" to escape
decay or to live again in the present world ([Job
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#019)).

out of his place--so man ([Psa
103:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#016)).

[Job 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 14:19</span></span>

The Hebrew order is more forcible: "Stones themselves are worn away by
water."

things which grow out of--rather, "floods wash away the dust of the
earth." There is a gradation from "mountains" to "rocks" ([Job
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#018)), then "stones," then last "dust
of the earth"; thus the solid mountain at last disappears utterly.

[Job 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 14:20</span></span>

prevailest--dost overpower by superior strength.

passeth--dieth.

changest countenance--the change in the visage at death. Differently
([Dan 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#009)).

[Job 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 14:21</span></span>

One striking trait is selected from the sad picture of the severance of
the dead from all that passes in the world ([Ecc
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#005)), namely, the utter separation of
parents and children.

[Job 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 14:22</span></span>

"Flesh" and "soul" describe the whole man. Scripture rests the hope of a
future life, not on the inherent immortality of the soul, but on the
restoration of the body with the soul. In the unseen world, Job in a
gloomy frame anticipates, man shall be limited to the thought of his own
misery. "Pain is by personification, from our feelings while alive,
attributed to the flesh and soul, as if the man could feel in his body
when dead. It is the dead in general, not the wicked, who are meant
here."
