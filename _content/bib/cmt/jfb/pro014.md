### [Proverbs Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#001)

[Proverbs 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 14:1</span></span>

(Pro. 14:1-35)

Every wise, &c.--literally, "The wisdoms" (compare [Pro
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#001)) "of women," plural, a
distributive form of speech.

buildeth . . . house--increases wealth, which the foolish, by
mismanagement, lessen.

[Proverbs 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 14:2</span></span>

uprightness--is the fruit of fearing God, as falsehood and ill-nature
([Pro 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#015); [Pro
3:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#032)) of despising Him and His law.

[Proverbs 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 14:3</span></span>

rod of pride--that is, the punishment of pride, which they evince by
their words. The words of the wise procure good to them.

[Proverbs 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 14:4</span></span>

crib is clean--empty; so "cleanness of teeth" denotes want of food
(compare [Amo 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#006)). Men get the proper
fruit of their doings ([Gal 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#007)).

[Proverbs 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 14:5</span></span>

A faithful witness, &c.--one tested to be such.

utter lies--or, "breathe out lies"--that is, habitually lies ([Pro
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#019); compare [Act
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#001)). Or the sense is, that habitual
truthfulness, or lying, will be evinced in witness-bearing.

[Proverbs 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 14:6</span></span>

8:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#009); [Joh
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#017); [Jam
1:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#005)).

[Proverbs 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 14:7</span></span>

Avoid the society of those who cannot teach you.

[Proverbs 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 14:8</span></span>

Appearances deceive the thoughtless, but the prudent discriminate.

[Proverbs 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 14:9</span></span>

Fools make a mock at sin--or, "Sin deludes fools."

righteous . . . favour--that is, of God, instead of the punishment of
sin.

[Proverbs 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 14:11</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#007)). The contrast of

5:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#004)).

ways of death--leading to it.

[Proverbs 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 14:13</span></span>

or untimely joy.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 14:14</span></span>

filled . . . ways--receive retribution ([Pro
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#031)).

a good man . . . himself--literally, "is away from such," will not
associate with him.

[Proverbs 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 14:15</span></span>

rash.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 14:24</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#016)).

foolishness . . . folly--Folly remains, or produces folly; it has no
benefit.

[Proverbs 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">pro 14:25</span></span>
