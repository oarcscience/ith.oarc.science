### [Ezekiel Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#001)

[Ezekiel 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 8:1</span></span>

(Eze. 8:1-18)

sixth year--namely, of the captivity of Jehoiachin, as in [Eze
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#002), the "fifth year" is specified.
The lying on his sides three hundred ninety and forty days ([Eze
4:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#005)) had by this time been
completed, at least in vision. That event was naturally a memorable
epoch to the exiles; and the computation of years from it was to humble
the Jews, as well as to show their perversity in not having repented,
though so long and severely chastised.

elders--namely, those carried away with Jehoiachin, and now at the
Chebar.

sat before me--to hear the word of God from me, in the absence of the
temple and other public places of Sabbath worship, during the exile
([Eze 33:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#030)). It was so ordered
that they were present at the giving of the prophecy, and so left
without excuse.

hand of . . . Lord God fell . . . upon me--God's mighty operation fell,
like a thunderbolt, upon me (in [Eze
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#003), it is less forcible, "was upon
him"); whatever, therefore, he is to utter is not his own, for he has
put off the mere man, while the power of God reigns in him \[CALVIN\].

[Ezekiel 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 8:2</span></span>

likeness--understand, "of a man," that is, of Messiah, the Angel of the
covenant, in the person of whom alone God manifests Himself ([Eze
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#026); [Joh
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018)). The "fire," from "His loins
downward," betokens the vengeance of God kindled against the wicked
Jews, while searching and purifying the remnant to be spared. The
"brightness . . . upward" betokens His unapproachable majesty ([Ti1
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#016)). For Hebrew, eesh, "fire," the
Septuagint, &c., read ish, "a man."

colour of amber--the glitter of chasmal \[FAIRBAIRN\], (see on [Eze
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#004), "polished brass").

[Ezekiel 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 8:3</span></span>

Instead of prompting him to address directly the elders before him, the
Spirit carried him away in vision (not in person bodily) to the temple
at Jerusalem; he proceeds to report to them what he witnessed: his
message thus falls into two parts: (1) The abominations reported in Eze.
8:1-18. (2) The dealings of judgment and mercy to be adopted towards the
impenitent and penitent Israelites respectively (Eze. 9:1-11:25). The
exiles looked hopefully towards Jerusalem and, so far from believing
things there to be on the verge of ruin, expected a return in peace;
while those left in Jerusalem eyed the exiles with contempt, as if cast
away from the Lord, whereas they themselves were near God and ensured in
the possessions of the land ([Eze
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#015)). Hence the vision here of what
affected those in Jerusalem immediately was a seasonable communication
to the exiles away from it.

door of the inner gate--facing the north, the direction in which he came
from Chebar, called the "altar-gate" ([Eze
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#005)); it opened into the inner court,
wherein stood the altar of burnt offering; the inner court ([Kg1
6:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#036)) was that of the priests; the
outer court ([Eze 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#005)), that of the
people, where they assembled.

seat--the pedestal of the image.

image of jealousy--Astarte, or Asheera (as the Hebrew for "grove" ought
to be translated, [Kg2 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#003), [Kg2
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#007); [Kg2
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#004), [Kg2
23:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#007)), set up by Manasseh as a rival
to Jehovah in His temple, and arresting the attention of all worshippers
as they entered; it was the Syrian Venus, worshipped with licentious
rites; the "queen of heaven," wife of PhÅ“nician Baal. HAVERNICK thinks
all the scenes of idolatry in the chapter are successive portions of the
festival held in honor of Tammuz or Adonis ([Eze
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#014)). Probably, however, the scenes
are separate proofs of Jewish idolatry, rather than restricted to one
idol.

provoketh to jealousy--calleth for a visitation in wrath of the "jealous
God," who will not give His honor to another (compare the second
commandment, [Exo 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#005)). JEROME refers
this verse to a statue of Baal, which Josiah had overthrown and his
successors had replaced.

[Ezekiel 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 8:4</span></span>

The Shekinah cloud of Jehovah's glory, notwithstanding the provocation
of the idol, still remains in the temple, like that which Ezekiel saw
"in the plain" ([Eze 3:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#022)); not
till [Eze 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#004), [Eze
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#018) did it leave the temple at
Jerusalem, showing the long-suffering of God, which ought to move the
Jews to repentance.

[Ezekiel 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 8:5</span></span>

gate of . . . altar--the principal avenue to the altar of burnt
offering; as to the northern position, see [Kg2
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#014). Ahaz had removed the brazen
altar from the front of the Lord's house to the north of the altar which
he had himself erected. The locality of the idol before God's own altar
enhances the heinousness of the sin.

[Ezekiel 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 8:6</span></span>

that I should go far off from my sanctuary--"that I should (be compelled
by their sin to) go far off from my sanctuary"-- ([Eze
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#018)); the sure precursor of its
destruction.

[Ezekiel 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 8:7</span></span>

door of the court--that is, of the inner court ([Eze
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#003)); the court of the priests and
Levites, into which now others were admitted in violation of the law
\[GROTIUS\].

hole in . . . wall--that is, an aperture or window in the wall of the
priests' chambers, through which he could see into the various
apartments, wherein was the idolatrous shrine.

[Ezekiel 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 8:8</span></span>

dig--for it had been blocked up during Josiah's reformation. Or rather,
the vision is not of an actual scene, but an ideal pictorial
representation of the Egyptian idolatries into which the covenant-people
had relapsed, practising them in secret places where they shrank from
the light of day \[FAIRBAIRN\], ([Joh
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#020)). But compare, as to the literal
introduction of idolatries into the temple, [Eze
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#011); [Jer
7:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#030); [Jer
32:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#034).

[Ezekiel 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 8:10</span></span>

creeping things . . . beasts--worshipped in Egypt; still found portrayed
on their chamber walls; so among the TroglodytÃ&brvbr;.

round about--On every side they surrounded themselves with incentives to
superstition.

[Ezekiel 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 8:11</span></span>

seventy men--the seventy members composing the Sanhedrim, or great
council of the nation, the origination of which we find in the seventy
elders, representatives of the congregation, who went up with Moses to
the mount to behold the glory of Jehovah, and to witness the secret
transactions relating to the establishment of the covenant; also, in the
seventy elders appointed to share the burden of the people with Moses.
How awfully it aggravates the national sin, that the seventy, once
admitted to the Lord's secret council ([Psa
25:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#014)), should now, "in the dark,"
enter "the secret" of the wicked ([Gen
49:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#006)), those judicially bound to
suppress idolatry being the ringleaders of it!

Jaazaniah--perhaps chief of the seventy: son of Shaphan, the scribe who
read to Josiah the book of the law; the spiritual privileges of the son
([Kg2 22:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#010)) increased his guilt.
The very name means, "Jehovah hears," giving the lie to the unbelief
which virtually said ([Eze 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#009)), "The
Lord seeth us not," &c. (compare [Psa
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#011), [Psa
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#014); [Psa
50:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#021); [Psa
94:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#007), [Psa
94:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#009)). The offering of incense
belonged not to the elders, but to the priests; this usurpation added to
the guilt of the former.

cloud of incense--They spared no expense for their idols. Oh, that there
were the same liberality toward the cause of God!

[Ezekiel 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 8:12</span></span>

every man in . . . chambers of . . . imagery--The elders ("ancients")
are here the representatives of the people, rather than to be regarded
literally. Mostly, the leaders of heathen superstitions laughed at them
secretly, while publicly professing them in order to keep the people in
subjection. Here what is meant is that the people generally addicted
themselves to secret idolatry, led on by their elders; there is no
doubt, also, allusion to the mysteries, as in the worship of Isis in
Egypt, the Eleusinian in Greece, &c., to which the initiated alone were
admitted. "The chambers of imagery" are their own perverse imaginations,
answering to the priests' chambers in the vision, whereon the pictures
were portrayed ([Eze 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#010)).

Lord . . . forsaken . . . earth--They infer this because God has left
them to their miseries, without succoring them, so that they seek help
from other gods. Instead of repenting, as they ought, they bite the curb
\[CALVIN\].

[Ezekiel 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 8:14</span></span>

From the secret abominations of the chambers of imagery, the prophet's
eye is turned to the outer court at the north door; within the outer
court women were not admitted, but only to the door.

sat--the attitude of mourners ([Job
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#013); [Isa
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#026)).

Tammuz--from a Hebrew root, "to melt down." Instead of weeping for the
national sins, they wept for the idol. Tammuz (the Syrian for Adonis),
the paramour of Venus, and of the same name as the river flowing from
Lebanon; killed by a wild boar, and, according to the fable, permitted
to spend half the year on earth, and obliged to spend the other half in
the lower world. An annual feast was celebrated to him in June (hence
called Tammuz in the Jewish calendar) at Byblos, when the Syrian women,
in wild grief, tore off their hair and yielded their persons to
prostitution, consecrating the hire of their infamy to Venus; next
followed days of rejoicing for his return to the earth; the former feast
being called "the disappearance of Adonis," the latter, "the finding of
Adonis." This PhÅ“nician feast answered to the similar Egyptian one in
honor of Osiris. The idea thus fabled was that of the waters of the
river and the beauties of spring destroyed by the summer during the half
year when the sun is in the upper heat. Or else, the earth being clothed
with beauty, hemisphere, and losing it when he departs to the lower. The
name Adonis is not here used, as Adon is the appropriated title of
Jehovah.

[Ezekiel 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 8:15</span></span>

The next are "greater abominations," not in respect to the idolatry, but
in respect to the place and persons committing it. In "the inner court,"
immediately before the door of the temple of Jehovah, between the porch
and the altar, where the priests advanced only on extraordinary
occasions ([Joe 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#017)), twenty-five men
(the leaders of the twenty-four courses or orders of the priests, [Ch1
24:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#018), with the high priest, "the
princes of the sanctuary," [Isa
43:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#028)), representing the whole
priesthood, as the seventy elders represented the people, stood with
their backs turned on the temple, and their faces towards the east,
making obeisance to the rising sun (contrast [Kg1
8:44](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#044)). Sun-worship came from the
Persians, who made the sun the eye of their god Ormuzd. It existed as
early as Job ([Job 31:26](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#026); compare [Deu
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#019)). Josiah could only suspend it
for the time of his reign ([Kg2 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#005),
[Kg2 23:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#011)); it revived under his
successors.

[Ezekiel 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 8:16</span></span>

worshipped--In the Hebrew a corrupt form is used to express Ezekiel's
sense of the foul corruption of such worship.

[Ezekiel 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 8:17</span></span>

put . . . branch to . . . nose--proverbial, for "they turn up the nose
in scorn," expressing their insolent security \[Septuagint\]. Not
content with outraging "with their violence" the second table of the
law, namely, that of duty towards one's neighbor, "they have returned"
(that is, they turn back afresh) to provoke Me by violations of the
first table \[CALVIN\]. Rather, they held up a branch or bundle of
tamarisk (called barsom) to their nose at daybreak, while singing hymns
to the rising sun \[STRABO, 1.15, p. 733\]. Sacred trees were frequent
symbols in idol-worship. CALVIN translates, "to their own ruin,"
literally, "to their nose," that is, with the effect of rousing My anger
(of which the Hebrew is "nose") to their ruin.

[Ezekiel 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 8:18</span></span>

though they cry . . . yet will I not hear-- ([Pro
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#028); [Isa
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#015)).
