### [Jeremiah Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 23:1</span></span>

THE WICKED RULERS TO BE SUPERSEDED BY THE KING, WHO SHOULD REIGN OVER
THE AGAIN UNITED PEOPLES, ISRAEL AND JUDAH. (Jer. 23:1-40)

pastors--Shallum, Jehoiakim, Jeconiah, and Zedekiah ([Eze
34:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#002)).

[Jeremiah 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 23:2</span></span>

Ye have not . . . visited them . . . I will visit upon you--just
retribution. Play upon the double sense of "visit." "Visit upon,"
namely, in wrath ([Exo 32:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#034)).

[Jeremiah 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 23:3</span></span>

Restoration of Judah from Babylon foretold in language which in its
fulness can only apply to the final restoration of both "Judah" and
"Israel" (compare [Jer 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#006)); also
"out of all countries," in this verse and [Jer
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#008); also, "neither shall they be
lacking," that is, none shall be missing or detached from the rest: a
prophecy never yet fully accomplished. It holds good also of the
spiritual Israel, the elect of both Jews and Gentiles ([Mal
3:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#016); [Joh
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#028); [Joh
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#012)). As to the literal Israel also,
see [Jer 32:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#037); [Isa
54:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#013); [Isa
60:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#021); [Eze
34:11-16](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#011).

shepherds . . . shall feed them-- ([Jer
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#015); [Eze
34:23-31](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#023)). Zerubbabel, Ezra, Nehemiah,
and the Maccabees were but typical of the consummating fulfilment of
these prophecies under Messiah.

[Jeremiah 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 23:5</span></span>

As Messianic prophecy extended over many years in which many political
changes took place in harmony with these, it displayed its riches by a
variety more effective than if it had been manifested all at once. As
the moral condition of the Jews required in each instance, so Messiah
was exhibited in a corresponding phase, thus becoming more and more the
soul of the nation's life: so that He is represented as the antitypical
Israel ([Isa 49:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#003)).

unto David--HENGSTENBERG observes that Isaiah dwells more on His
prophetical and priestly office, which had already been partly set forth
([Deu 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#018); [Psa
110:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#004)). Other prophets dwell more on
His kingly office. Therefore here He is associated with "David" the
king: but in [Isa 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001) with the then
poor and unknown "Jesse."

righteous Branch--"the Branch of righteousness" ([Jer
33:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#015)); "The Branch" simply ([Zac
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#008); [Zac
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#012)); "The Branch of the Lord" ([Isa
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#002)).

prosper--the very term applied to Messiah's undertaking ([Isa
52:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#013), Margin; [Isa
53:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#010)). Righteousness or justice is
the characteristic of Messiah elsewhere, too, in connection with our
salvation or justification ([Isa
53:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#011); [Dan
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024); [Zac
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#009)). So in the New Testament He is
not merely "righteous" Himself, but "righteousness to us" ([Co1
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#030)), so that we become "the
righteousness of God in Him" ([Rom
10:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#003); [Co2
5:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#019); [Phi
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#009)).

execute judgment and justice in the earth-- ([Psa
72:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#002); [Isa
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#007); [Isa
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#001), [Isa
32:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#018)). Not merely a spiritual reign
in the sense in which He is "our righteousness," but a righteous reign
"in the earth" ([Jer 3:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#017)). In some
passages He is said to come to judge, in others to reign. In [Mat
25:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#034), He is called "the King." [Psa
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#007) unites them. Compare [Dan
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#022), [Dan
7:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#026).

[Jeremiah 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 23:6</span></span>

Judah . . . Israel . . . dwell safely--Compare [Jer
33:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#016), where "Jerusalem" is
substituted for "Israel" here. Only Judah, and that only in part, has as
yet returned. So far are the Jews from having enjoyed, as yet, the
temporal blessings here foretold as the result of Messiah's reign, that
their lot has been, for eighteen centuries, worse than ever before. The
accomplishment must, therefore, be still future, when both Judah and
Israel in their own land shall dwell safely under a Christocracy, far
more privileged than even the old theocracy ([Jer
32:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#037); [Deu
33:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#028); Isa. 54:1-17; 60:1-22; [Isa
65:17-25](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#017); [Zac
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#011)).

shall be called, the Lord--that is, shall be ([Isa
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006)) "Jehovah," God's incommunicable
name. Though when applied to created things, it expresses only some
peculiar connection they have with Jehovah ([Gen
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#014); [Exo
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#015)), yet when applied to Messiah it
must express His Godhead manifested in justifying power towards us ([Ti1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016)).

our--marks His manhood, which is also implied in His being a Branch
raised unto David, whence His human title, "Son of David" (compare [Mat
22:42-45](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#042)).

Righteousness--marks His Godhead, for God alone can justify the ungodly
(compare [Rom 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#005); [Isa
45:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#017), [Isa
45:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#024)).

[Jeremiah 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 23:7</span></span>

Repeated from [Jer 16:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#014). The
prophet said the same things often, in order that his sayings might make
the more impression. The same promise as in [Jer
23:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#003). The wide dispersion of the
Jews at the Babylonish captivity prefigures their present wider
dispersion ([Isa 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#011); [Joe
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#006)). Their second deliverance is to
exceed far the former one from Egypt. But the deliverance from Babylon
was inferior to that from Egypt in respect to the miracles performed and
the numbers delivered. The final deliverance under Messiah must,
therefore, be meant, of which that from Babylon was the earnest.

[Jeremiah 23:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 23:9</span></span>

because of the prophets--so the Masorites and Targum. But Vulgate,
Septuagint, &c., make this the inscription of the prophecy, CONCERNING
THE PROPHETS: as in [Jer 46:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#002); [Jer
48:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#001); [Jer
49:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#001). Jeremiah expresses his horror at
the so-called "prophets" not warning the people, though iniquity so
fearfully abounded, soon to be followed by awful judgments.

bones shake-- ([Hab 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#016)).

drunken--God's judgments are represented as stupefying like wine. The
effects of the Holy Spirit also are compared to those of wine ([Act
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#017)). In both cases ecstasy was
produced. This accounts for the denial of wine to those likely to be
inspired, Nazarites, &c. ([Luk 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#015)).
It was necessary to put it out of men's power to ascribe inspired
ecstasy to the effects of wine.

because of . . . words of . . . holiness--because of Jehovah's holy
words, wherewith He threatened severe penalties, soon to be inflicted,
against the breakers of His law.

[Jeremiah 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 23:10</span></span>

adulterers--spiritual, that is, forsakers of God, Israel's true Husband
([Isa 54:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#005)) for idols, at the
instigation of the false "prophets" ([Jer
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#009), [Jer
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#015)). Literal adultery and
fornication, the usual concomitants of idolatry, are also meant.

swearing--MAURER, &c., translate, "Because of the curse (of God on it),
the land mourneth" ([Deu 27:15-26](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#015);
Deu. 28:15-68; [Isa 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#006)). More than
usual notoriety had been given to the curses of the law, by the finding
and reading of it in Josiah's time ([Kg2
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#011), &c.). But [Hos
4:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#002), favors English Version (compare
[Jer 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#004)). A drought was sent by God
on the pastures ("pleasant places," oases) in the desert, on account of
the "profaneness" of the priests, prophets, and people ([Jer
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#011)).

course . . . evil--They (both prophets and people) rush into wickedness
([Jer 23:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#021); [Isa
59:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#007)).

force . . . not right--Their powers are used not on the side of
rectitude, but on that of falsehood.

[Jeremiah 23:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 23:11</span></span>

profane-- ([Eze 23:39](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#039); [Zep
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#004)).

in my house-- ([Jer 7:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#030)). They built
altars to idols in the very temple ([Kg2
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#012); [Eze
8:3-16](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#003)). Compare as to covetousness
under the roof of the sanctuary, [Mat
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#013); [Joh
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#016).

[Jeremiah 23:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 23:12</span></span>

slippery ways in . . . darkness--Their "way" is their false doctrine
which proves fatal to them ([Jer
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#016); [Psa
35:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#006); [Pro
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#019)).

I will bring evil . . . visitation--still more calamities than those
already inflicted. See on [Jer 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#023);
"visitation," namely, in wrath.

[Jeremiah 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 23:13</span></span>

folly--literally, "insipidity," "unsavouriness" ([Job
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#006)), not having the salt of godliness
([Col 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#006)).

in Baal--in the name of Baal; in connection with his worship (see [Jer
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#008)).

caused . . . to err-- ([Isa 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#016)).

[Jeremiah 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 23:14</span></span>

"Jerusalem" and Judah were even worse than "Samaria" and the ten tribes;
the greater were the privileges of the former, the greater was their
guilt. They had the temple in their midst, which the ten tribes had not;
yet in the temple itself they practised idolatry.

strengthen . . . hands of evildoers-- ([Eze
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#022)).

as Sodom-- ([Deu 32:32](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#032); [Isa
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#010)).

[Jeremiah 23:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 23:15</span></span>

gall--poison (see on [Jer 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#014); [Jer
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#015)).

[Jeremiah 23:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 23:16</span></span>

make you vain--They seduce you to vanity, that is, idolatry, which will
prove a vain trust to you ([Jer 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#005);
[Kg2 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#015); [Jon
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jon002.htm#008)), \[GESENIUS\]. Rather, "they
delude you with vain promises of security" ([Jer
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#017); compare [Psa
62:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#010)) \[MAURER\].

of their own heart--of their own invention ([Jer
23:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#021); [Jer
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#014)).

[Jeremiah 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 23:17</span></span>

say still--Hebrew, "say in saying," that is, say incessantly.

peace-- ([Jer 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#014); [Eze
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#010); [Zac
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#002)).

imagination--Hebrew, "obstinacy."

no evil-- ([Mic 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#011)).

[Jeremiah 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 23:18</span></span>

A reason is given why the false prophets should not be heeded: They have
not stood in the counsels of Jehovah (an image from ministers present in
a standing posture at councils of Eastern kings) (compare [Jer
23:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#022); [Job
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#008)). The spiritual man alone has the
privilege ([Gen 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#017); [Psa
25:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#014); [Amo
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#007); [Joh
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#015); [Co1
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#016)).

[Jeremiah 23:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 23:19</span></span>

So far from all prosperity awaiting the people as the false prophets say
([Jer 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#017)), wrath is in store for
them.

grievous--literally, "eddying," whirling itself about, a tornado. In
[Jer 30:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#023), "continuing" is
substituted for "grievous."

fall grievously--it shall be hurled on.

[Jeremiah 23:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 23:20</span></span>

in . . . latter days--that is, "the year of their visitation" ([Jer
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#012)). Primarily the meaning is: the
Jews will not "consider" now God's warnings ([Deu
32:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#029)); but when the prophecies shall
be fulfilled in their Babylonish exile, they will consider and see, by
bitter experience, their sinful folly. The ultimate scope of the
prophecy is: the Jews, in their final dispersion, shall at last
"consider" their sin and turn to Messiah "perfectly" ([Hos
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#005); [Zac
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#005), [Zac
12:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010); [Luk
13:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#035)).

[Jeremiah 23:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 23:21</span></span>

sent . . . spoken--sent" refers to the primary call: "spoken" to the
subsequent charges given to be executed. A call is required, not only
external, on the part of men, but also internal from God, that one
should undertake a pastor's office \[CALVIN\].

[Jeremiah 23:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 23:22</span></span>

stood in . . . counsel-- ([Jer 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#018)).

they should have turned them from their evil way--They would have given
such counsels to the people as would have turned them from their sins
([Jer 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#005); [Isa
55:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#011)), and so would have averted
punishment. Their not teaching the law in which God's counsel is set
forth proves they are not His prophets, though they boast of being so
([Mat 7:15-20](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#015)).

[Jeremiah 23:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 23:23</span></span>

Let not the false prophets fancy that their devices ([Jer
23:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#025)) are unknown to Me. Are ye so
ignorant as to suppose that I can only see things near Me, namely,
things in heaven, and not earthly things as being too remote?

[Jeremiah 23:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jer 23:24</span></span>

([Psa 139:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#007), &c.; [Amo
9:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#002)).

fill heaven and earth--with My omniscience providence, power, and
essential being ([Kg1 8:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#027)).

[Jeremiah 23:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jer 23:25</span></span>

dreamed--I have received a prophetic communication by dream ([Num
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#006); [Deu
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#001), &c. [Joe
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#028)).

[Jeremiah 23:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jer 23:26</span></span>

prophets--a different Hebrew form from the usual one, "prophesiers."
"How long," cries Jeremiah, impatient of their impious audacity, "shall
these prophecy-mongers go on prophesying lies?" The answer is given in
[Jer 23:29-34](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#029).

[Jeremiah 23:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jer 23:27</span></span>

They "think" to make My people utterly to forget Me. But I will oppose
to those dreamers my true prophets.

fathers . . . for Baal-- ([Jdg 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#007);
[Jdg 8:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#033)).

[Jeremiah 23:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jer 23:28</span></span>

God answers the objection which might be stated, "What, then, must we
do, when lies are spoken as truths, and prophets oppose prophets?" Do
the same as when wheat is mixed with chaff: do not reject the wheat
because of the chaff mixed with it, but discriminate between the false
and the true revelations. The test is adherence to, or forgetfulness of,
Me and My law ([Jer 23:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#027)).

that hath a dream--that pretends to have a divine communication by
dream, let him tell it "faithfully," that it may be compared with "my
word" ([Co2 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#002)). The result will be
the former (both the prophets and their fictions) will soon be seen to
be chaff; the latter (the true prophets and the word of God in their
mouth) wheat ([Psa 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#004); [Hos
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#003)).

[Jeremiah 23:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jer 23:29</span></span>

As the "fire" consumes the "chaff" ([Jer
23:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#028)), so "My word" will consume the
false prophets ([Mat 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#012); [Heb
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#012)). "My word" which is "wheat"
([Jer 23:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#028)), that is, food to the
true prophet and his hearers, is a consuming "fire," and a crushing
"hammer" ([Mat 21:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#044)) to false
prophets and their followers ([Co2
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#016)). The Word of the false prophets
may be known by its promising men peace in sin. "My word," on the
contrary, burns and breaks the hard-hearted ([Jer
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#009)). The "hammer" symbolizes
destructive power ([Jer 50:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#023); [Nah
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#001), Margin).

[Jeremiah 23:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">jer 23:30</span></span>

steal my words--a twofold plagiarism; one steals from the other, and all
steal words from Jehovah's true prophets, but misapply them (see [Jer
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#002); [Joh
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#001); [Rev
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#019)).

[Jeremiah 23:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">jer 23:31</span></span>

use--rather, "take" their tongue: a second class (compare [Jer
23:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#030)) require, in order to bring
forth a revelation, nothing more than their tongues, wherewith they say,
He (Jehovah) saith: they bungle in the very formula instead of the usual
"Jehovah saith," being only able to say "(He) saith."

[Jeremiah 23:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">jer 23:32</span></span>

Third class: inventors of lies: the climax, and worst of the three.

lightness--wanton inventions ([Zep
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#004)).

not profit--that is, greatly injure.

[Jeremiah 23:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">jer 23:33</span></span>

What is the burden--play on the double sense of the Hebrew: an oracle
and a burden. They scoffingly ask, Has he got any new burden (burdensome
oracle: for all his prophecies are disasters) to announce ([Mal
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#001))? Jeremiah indignantly repeats
their own question, Do you ask, What burden? This, then, it is, "I will
forsake you." My word is burdensome in your eyes, and you long to be rid
if it. You shall get your wish. There will be no more prophecy: I will
forsake you, and that will be a far worse "burden" to you.

[Jeremiah 23:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">jer 23:34</span></span>

The burden--Whoever shall in mockery call the Lord's word "a burden,"
shall be visited (Margin) in wrath.

[Jeremiah 23:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">jer 23:35</span></span>

The result of My judgments shall be, ye shall address the prophet more
reverentially hereafter, no longer calling his message a burden, but a
divine response or word. "What hath the LORD answered?"

[Jeremiah 23:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">jer 23:36</span></span>

every man's word . . . his burden--As they mockingly call all prophecies
burdens, as if calamities were the sole subject of prophecy, so it shall
prove to them. God will take them at their own word.

living God--not lifeless as their dumb idols, ever living so as to be
able to punish.

[Jeremiah 23:39](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">jer 23:39</span></span>

I will . . . forget you--just retribution for their forgetting Him ([Hos
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#006)). But God cannot possibly forget
His children ([Isa 49:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#015)). Rather for
"forget" translate, "I will altogether lift you up (like a 'burden,'
alluding to their mocking term for God's messages) and cast you off."
God makes their wicked language fall on their own head \[CALVIN\].
Compare [Jer 23:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#036) : "every man's word
shall be his burden."

[Jeremiah 23:40](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">jer 23:40</span></span>

not be forgotten--If we translate [Jer
23:39](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#039) as English Version, the
antithesis is, though I forget you, your shame shall not be forgotten.
