<p>
<p>Elihu maintains that afflictions are to the godly disciplinary, in order to lead them to attain a higher moral worth, and that the reason for their continuance is not, as the friends asserted, on account of the sufferer's extraordinary guilt, but because the discipline has not yet attained its object, namely, to lend him to humble himself penitently before God (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#013">Isa 9:13</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#003">Jer 5:3</A>). This is Elihu's fourth speech. He thus exceeds the ternary number of the others. Hence his formula of politeness (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#002">Job 36:2</A>). Literally, "Wait yet but a little for me." Bear with me a little farther. I have yet (much, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#018">Job 32:18-20</A>). There are Chaldeisms in this verse, agreeably to the view that the scene of the book is near the Euphrates and the Chaldees.

<p>
<p>ascribe righteousness--whereas Job ascribed unrighteousness (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#010">Job 34:10</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#012">Job 34:12</A>). A man, in enquiring into God's ways, should at the outset presume they are all just, be willing to find them so, and expect that the result of investigation will prove them to be so; such a one will never be disappointed [BARNES].
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#004">Job 36:4</A></p>

<p>
<p>he that is perfect, &amp;c.--Rather, as the parallelism requires, "a man of integrity in sentiments is with thee" (is he with whom thou hast to do). Elihu means himself, as opposed to the dishonest reasonings of the friends (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#034">Job 21:34</A>).

Elihu confirms his exhortation (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#014">Job 35:14</A>).

God does not forsake the godly, as Job implied, but "establishes," or makes them sit on the throne as kings (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#008">Sa1 2:8</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#007">Psa 113:7-8</A>).

<p>hypocrites--or, the ungodly [MAURER]; but "hypocrites" is perhaps a distinct class from the openly wicked (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#012">Job 36:12</A>). 
<p>
<p>heap up wrath--of God against themselves (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#005">Rom 2:5</A>). UMBREIT translates, "nourish their wrath against God," instead of "crying" unto Him. This suits well the parallelism and the Hebrew. But the English Version gives a good parallelism, "hypocrites" answering to "cry not" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#008">Job 27:8</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#010">Job 27:10</A>); "heap up wrath" against themselves, to "He bindeth them" with fetters of affliction (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#008">Job 36:8</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#014">Job 36:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">job 36:14</A></FONT></span></p>Rather (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#017">Deu 23:17</A>), Their life is (ended) as that of (literally, "among") the unclean, prematurely and dishonorably. So the second clause answers to the first. A warning that Job make not common cause with the wicked (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#036">Job 34:36</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#015">Job 36:15</A></p>

<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#018">Job 36:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">job 36:18</A></FONT></span></p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#045">Num 16:45</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#006">Psa 49:6-7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#026">Mat 16:26</A>). Even the "ransom" by Jesus Christ (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#024">Job 33:24</A>) will be of no avail to wilful despisers (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#026">Heb 10:26-29</A>). 
<p>
<p>with his stroke-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#026">Job 34:26</A>). UMBREIT translates, "Beware lest the wrath of God (thy severe calamity) lead thee to scorn" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#007">Job 34:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#023">Job 27:23</A>). This accords better with the verb in the parallel clause, which ought to be translated, "Let not the great ransom (of money, which thou canst give) seduce thee (Margin, turn thee aside, as if thou couldst deliver thyself from "wrath" by it). As the "scorn" in the first clause answers to the "judgment of the wicked" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#017">Job 36:17</A>), so "ransom" ("seduce") to "will he esteem riches" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#019">Job 36:19</A>). Thus, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#018">Job 36:18</A> is the transition between <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#017">Job 36:17</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#019">Job 36:19</A>.

<p>
<p>cut off--literally, "ascend," as the corn cut and lifted upon the wagon or stack (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#026">Job 36:26</A>); so "cut off," "disappear." 
<p>
<p>in their place--literally, "under themselves"; so, without moving from their place, on the spot, suddenly (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#012">Job 40:12</A>) [MAURER]. UMBREIT'S translation: "To ascend (which is really, as thou wilt find to thy cost, to descend) to the people below" (literally, "under themselves"), answers better to the parallelism and the Hebrew. Thou pantest for death as desirable, but it is a "night" or region of darkness; thy fancied ascent (amelioration) will prove a descent (deterioration) (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#022">Job 10:22</A>); therefore desire it not.

<p>
<p>rather than--to bear "affliction" with pious patience. Men think it an alleviation to complain against God, but this is adding sin to sorrow; it is sin, not sorrow, which can really hurt us (contrast <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#025">Heb 11:25</A>).

<p>
<p>teacheth-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#012">Psa 94:12</A>, &amp;c.). The connection is, returning to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#005">Job 36:5</A>, God's "might" is shown in His "wisdom"; He alone can teach; yet, because He, as a sovereign, explains not all His dealings, forsooth Job must presume to teach Him (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#013">Isa 40:13-14</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#034">Rom 11:34</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#016">Co1 2:16</A>). So the transition to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#023">Job 36:23</A> is natural. UMBREIT with the Septuagint translates, "Who is Lord," wrongly, as this meaning belongs to later Hebrew.

<p>
<p>the noise--"crashing"; namely, thunder.

<p>of his tabernacle--God being poetically said to have His pavilion amid dark clouds (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#011">Psa 18:11</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#022">Isa 40:22</A>).

<p>
<p>it--His tabernacle (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#029">Job 36:29</A>). The light, in an instant spread over the vast mass of dark clouds, forms a striking picture. 
<p>
<p>spread--is repeated from <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#029">Job 36:29</A> to form an antithesis. "He spreads not only clouds, but light." 
<p>
<p>covereth the bottom--roots. 
<p>
<p>of the sea--namely, with the light. In the storm the depths of ocean are laid bare; and the light "covers" them, at the same moment that it "spreads" across the dark sky. So in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#014">Psa 18:14-15</A>, the discovering of "the channels of waters" follows the "lightnings." UMBREIT translates: "He spreadeth His light upon Himself, and covereth Himself with the roots of the sea" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#002">Psa 104:2</A>). God's garment is woven of celestial light and of the watery depths, raised to the sky to form His cloudy canopy. The phrase, "cover Himself with the roots of the sea," is harsh; but the image is grand.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_031">job 36:31</A></FONT></span></p>These (rain and lightnings) are marvellous and not to be understood (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#029">Job 36:29</A>), yet necessary. "For by them He judgeth (chastiseth on the one hand), &amp;c. (and on the other, by them) He giveth meat" (food), &amp;c. (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#013">Job 37:13</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#023">Job 38:23</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#027">Job 38:27</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#017">Act 14:17</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#032">Job 36:32</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_032">job 36:32</A></FONT></span></p>Rather, "He covereth (both) His hands with light (lightning, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#003">Job 37:3</A>, Margin), and giveth it a command against his adversary" (literally, the one "assailing" Him, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#002">Psa 8:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#020">Psa 139:20</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#019">Job 21:19</A>). Thus, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#031">Job 36:31</A>, the twofold effects of His waters are set forth, so here, of His light; in the one hand, destructive lightning against the wicked; in the other, the genial light for good to His friends, &amp;c. (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#033">Job 36:33</A>) [UMBREIT].

As the genial effect of "water" in the growth of food, is mentioned, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#031">Job 36:31</A>, so here that of "light" in cherishing cattle and plants [UMBREIT]. If English Version, "noise" be retained, translate, "His noise (thunder) announces concerning Him (His coming in the tempest), the cattle (to announce) concerning Him when He is in the act of rising up" (in the storm). Some animals give various intimations that they are sensible of the approach of a storm [VIRGIL, Georgics, I.373, &amp;c.].
