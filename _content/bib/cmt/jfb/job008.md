### [Job Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#001)

[Job 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 8:2</span></span>

THE ADDRESS OF BILDAD. (Job 8:1-22)

like a . . . wind?--disregarding restraints, and daring against God.

[Job 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 8:3</span></span>

The repetition of "pervert" gives an emphasis galling to Job ([Job
34:12](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#012)). "Wouldst thou have God," as
thy words imply, "pervert judgment," by letting thy sins go unpunished?
He assumes Job's guilt from his sufferings.

[Job 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 8:4</span></span>

If--Rather, "Since thy children have sinned against Him, and (since) He
has cast them away (Hebrew, by the hand of) for their transgressions,
(yet) if thou wouldst seek unto God, &c., if thou wert pure, &c., surely
\[even\] now He would awake for thee." UMBREIT makes the apodosis to,
"since thy children," &c., begin at "He has cast them away." Also,
instead of "for," "He gave them up to (literally, into the hand of)
their own guilt." Bildad expresses the justice of God, which Job had
arraigned. Thy children have sinned; God leaves them to the consequence
of their sin; most cutting to the heart of the bereaved father.

[Job 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 8:5</span></span>

seek unto God betimes--early. Make it the first and chief anxiety ([Psa
78:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#034); [Hos
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#015); [Isa
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#009); [Pro
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#017); [Pro
13:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#024)).

[Job 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 8:6</span></span>

He would awake for thee--that is, arise to thy help. God seemed to be
asleep toward the sufferer ([Psa
35:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#023); [Psa
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#006); [Isa
51:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#009)).

make . . . prosperous--restore to prosperity thy (their) righteous
habitation. Bildad assumes it to have been heretofore the habitation of
guilt.

[Job 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 8:7</span></span>

thy beginning--the beginning of thy new happiness after restoration.

latter end-- ([Job 42:12](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#012); [Pro
23:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#018)).

[Job 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 8:8</span></span>

The sages of the olden time reached an age beyond those of Job's time
(see on [Job 42:16](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#016)), and therefore
could give the testimony of a fuller experience.

[Job 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 8:9</span></span>

of yesterday--that is, a recent race. We know nothing as compared with
them because of the brevity of our lives; so even Jacob ([Gen
47:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#009)). Knowledge consisted then in the
results of observation, embodied in poetical proverbs, and handed down
by tradition. Longevity gave the opportunity of wider observation.

a shadow-- ([Psa 144:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#004); [Ch1
29:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#015)).

[Job 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 8:10</span></span>

teach thee-- [Job 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#024) had said,
"Teach me." Bildad, therefore, says, "Since you want teaching, inquire
of the fathers. They will teach thee."

utter words--more than mere speaking; "put forth well-considered words."

out of their heart--from observation and reflection; not merely, from
their mouth: such, as Bildad insinuates, were Job's words. [Job
8:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#011) embody in poetic and
sententious form (probably the fragment of an old poem) the observation
of the elders. The double point of comparison between the ungodly and
the paper-reed is: 1. the luxuriant prosperity at first; and, 2. the
sudden destruction.

[Job 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 8:11</span></span>

rush--rather, "paper-reed": The papyrus of Egypt, which was used to make
garments, shoes, baskets, boats, and paper (a word derived from it). It
and the flag, or bulrush, grow only in marshy places (such as are along
the Nile). So the godless thrives only in external prosperity; there is
in the hypocrite no inward stability; his prosperity is like the rapid
growth of water plants.

[Job 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 8:12</span></span>

not cut down--Before it has ripened for the scythe, it withers more
suddenly than any herb, having no self-sustaining power, once that the
moisture is gone, which other herbs do not need in the same degree. So
ruin seizes on the godless in the zenith of prosperity, more suddenly
than on others who appear less firmly seated in their possessions
\[UMBREIT\] ([Psa 112:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#010)).

[Job 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 8:13</span></span>

paths--so "ways" ([Pro 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#019)).

all that forget God--the distinguishing trait of the godless ([Psa
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#017); [Psa
50:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#022)).

[Job 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 8:14</span></span>

cut off--so GESENIUS; or, to accord with the metaphor of the spider's
"house," "The confidence (on which he builds) shall be laid in ruins"
([Isa 59:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#005)).

[Job 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 8:15</span></span>

he shall hold it fast--implying his eager grasp, when the storm of trial
comes: as the spider "holds fast" by its web; but with this difference:
the light spider is sustained by that on which it rests; the godless is
not by the thin web on which he rests. The expression, "Hold fast,"
properly applies to the spider holding his web, but is transferred to
the man. Hypocrisy, like the spider's web, is fine-spun, flimsy, and
woven out of its own inventions, as the spider's web out of its own
bowels. An Arab proverb says, "Time destroys the well-built house, as
well as the spider's web."

[Job 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 8:16</span></span>

before the sun--that is, he (the godless) is green only before the sun
rises; but he cannot bear its heat, and withers. So succulent plants
like the gourd ([Jon 4:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#007)). But the
widespreading in the garden does not quite accord with this. Better, "in
sunshine"; the sun representing the smiling fortune of the hypocrite,
during which he wondrously progresses \[UMBREIT\]. The image is that of
weeds growing in rank luxuriance and spreading over even heaps of stones
and walls, and then being speedily torn away.

[Job 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 8:17</span></span>

seeth the place of stones--Hebrew, "the house of stones"; that is, the
wall surrounding the garden. The parasite plant, in creeping towards and
over the wall--the utmost bound of the garden--is said figuratively to
"see" or regard it.

[Job 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 8:18</span></span>

If He (God) tear him away (properly, "to tear away rapidly and
violently") from his place, "then it \[the place personified\] shall
deny him" ([Psa 103:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#016)). The very soil
is ashamed of the weeds lying withered on its surface, as though it
never had been connected with them. So, when the godless falls from
prosperity, his nearest friends disown him.

[Job 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 8:19</span></span>

Bitter irony. The hypocrite boasts of joy. This then is his "joy" at the
last.

and out of the earth--others immediately, who take the place of the man
thus punished; not godly men ([Mat
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#009)). For the place of the weeds is
among stones, where the gardener wishes no plants. But, ungodly; a fresh
crop of weeds always springs up in the place of those torn up: there is
no end of hypocrites on earth \[UMBREIT\].

[Job 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 8:20</span></span>

Bildad regards Job as a righteous man, who has fallen into sin.

God will not cast away a perfect man--(or godly man, such as Job was),
if he will only repent. Those alone who persevere in sin God will not
help (Hebrew, "take by the hand," [Psa
73:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#023); [Isa
41:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#013); [Isa
42:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#006)) when fallen.

[Job 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 8:21</span></span>

Till--literally, "to the point that"; God's blessing on thee, when
repentant, will go on increasing to the point that, or until, &c.

[Job 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 8:22</span></span>

The haters of Job are the wicked. They shall be clothed with shame ([Jer
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#025); [Psa
35:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#026); [Psa
109:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#029)), at the failure of their hope
that Job would utterly perish, and because they, instead of him, come to
naught.
