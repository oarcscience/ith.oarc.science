### [Zechariah Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#001)

[Zechariah 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">zac 13:1</span></span>

CLEANSING OF THE JEWS FROM SIN; ABOLITION OF IDOLATRY; THE SHEPHERD
SMITTEN; THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND CUT OFF, EXCEPT A THIRD PART REFINED BY
TRIALS. ([Zac 13:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#001))

Connected with the close of the twelfth chapter. The mourning penitents
are here comforted.

fountain opened--It has been long opened, but then first it shall be so
"to the house of David," &c. (representing all Israel) after their long
and weary wanderings. Like Hagar in the wilderness they remain ignorant
of the refreshment near them, until God "opens their eyes" ([Gen
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#019)) \[MOORE\]. It is not the
fountain, but their eyes that need to be opened. It shall be a
"fountain" ever flowing; not a laver needing constantly to be
replenished with water, such as stood between the tabernacle and altar
([Exo 30:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#018)).

for sin . . . uncleanness--that is, judicial guilt and moral impurity.
Thus justification and sanctification are implied in this verse as both
flowing from the blood of Christ, not from ceremonial sacrifices ([Co1
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#030); [Heb
9:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#013); [Jo1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#007); compare [Eze
36:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#025)). Sin in Hebrew is literally a
missing the mark or way.

[Zechariah 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">zac 13:2</span></span>

Consequences of pardon; not indolence, but the extirpation of sin.

names of . . . idols--Their very names were not to be mentioned; thus
the Jews, instead of Mephibaal, said Mephibosheth (Bosheth meaning a
contemptible thing) ([Exo 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#013); [Deu
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#003); [Psa
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#004)).

out of the land--Judea's two great sins, idolatry and false prophecy,
have long since ceased. But these are types of all sin (for example,
covetousness, [Eph 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#005), a besetting
sin of the Jews now). Idolatry, combined with the "spirit" of "Satan,"
is again to be incarnated in "the man of sin," who is to arise in Judea
([Th2 2:3-12](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#003)), and is to be "consumed
with the Spirit of the Lord's mouth." Compare as to Antichrist's papal
precursor, "seducing spirits . . . doctrines of devils," &c., [Ti1
4:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#001); [Pe2
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#001).

the unclean spirit--Hebrew, spirit of uncleanness (compare [Rev
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#013)); opposed to "the Spirit of
holiness" ([Rom 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#004)), "spirit of
error" ([Jo1 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#006)). One assuming to be
divinely inspired, but in league with Satan.

[Zechariah 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">zac 13:3</span></span>

The form of phraseology here is drawn from [Deu
13:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#006); [Deu
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#020). The substantial truth expressed
is that false prophecy shall be utterly abolished. If it were possible
for it again to start up, the very parents of the false prophet would
not let parental affection interfere, but would be the first to thrust
him through. Love to Christ must be paramount to the tenderest of
natural ties ([Mat 10:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#037)). Much as the
godly love their children, they love God and His honor more.

[Zechariah 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">zac 13:4</span></span>

prophets . . . ashamed--of the false prophecies which they have uttered
in times past, and which the event has confuted.

rough garment--sackcloth. The badge of a prophet ([Kg2
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#008); [Isa
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#002)), to mark their frugality alike
in food and attire ([Mat 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#004)); also,
to be consonant to the mournful warnings which they delivered. It is not
the dress that is here condemned, but the purpose for which it was worn,
namely, to conceal wolves under sheep's clothing \[CALVIN\]. The monkish
hair-shirt of Popery, worn to inspire the multitude with the impression
of superior sanctity, shall be then cast aside.

[Zechariah 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">zac 13:5</span></span>

The detection of one of the false prophets dramatically represented. He
is seized by some zealous vindicator of the law, and in fear cries out,
"I am no prophet."

man--that is, one.

taught me to keep cattle--As "keeping cattle" is not the same as to be
"an husbandman," translate rather, "Has used (or 'appropriated') me as a
servant," namely, in husbandry \[MAURER\]. However, husbandry and
keeping cattle might be regarded as jointly the occupation of the person
questioned: then [Amo 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#014), "herdman,"
will accord with English Version. A Hebrew kindred word means "cattle."
Both occupations, the respondent replies, are inconsistent with my being
a "prophet."

[Zechariah 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">zac 13:6</span></span>

wounds in thine hand--The interrogator still suspects him: "If so, if
you have never pretended to be a prophet, whence come those wounds?" The
Hebrew is literally, "between thine hands." The hands were naturally
held up to ward off the blows, and so were "thrust through" ([Zac
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#003)) "between" the bones of the hand.
Stoning was the usual punishment; "thrusting through" was also a fit
retribution on one who tried to "thrust Israel away" from the Lord ([Deu
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#010)); and perfects the type of
Messiah, condemned as a false prophet, and pierced with "wounds between
His hands." Thus the transition to the direct prophecy of Him ([Zac
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#007)) is natural, which it would not
be if He were not indirectly and in type alluded to.

wounded in . . . house of my friends--an implied admission that he had
pretended to prophecy, and that his friends had wounded him for it in
zeal for God ([Zac 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#003)). The Holy
Spirit in Zechariah alludes indirectly to Messiah, the Antitype, wounded
by those whom He came to befriend, who ought to have been His "friends,"
who were His kinsmen (compare [Zac
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#003), as to the false prophet's
friends, with [Mar 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#021), "His
friends," Margin, "kinsmen"; [Joh 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#005);
"His own," [Joh 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#011); the Jews, "of
whom as concerning the flesh He came," [Rom
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#005)), but who wounded Him by the
agency of the Romans ([Zac 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010)).

[Zechariah 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">zac 13:7</span></span>

Expounded by Christ as referring to Himself ([Mat
26:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#031)). Thus it is a resumption of
the prophecy of His betrayal ([Zac
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#004), [Zac
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#010), [Zac
11:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#013)), and the subsequent
punishment of the Jews. It explains the mystery why He, who came to be a
blessing, was cut off while bestowing the blessing. God regards sin in
such a fearful light that He spared not His own co-equal Son in the one
Godhead, when that Son bore the sinner's guilt.

Awake--Compare a similar address to the sword of justice personified
([Jer 46:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#006)). For "smite"
(imperative), [Mat 26:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#031) has "I will
smite." The act of the sword, it is thus implied, is GOD'S act. So the
prophecy in [Isa 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#009), "Hear ye," is
imperative; the fulfilment as declared by Jesus is future ([Mat
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#014)), "ye shall hear."

sword--the symbol of judicial power, the highest exercise of which is to
take away the life of the condemned ([Psa
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#013); [Rom
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#004)). Not merely a show, or
expression, of justice (as Socinians think) is distinctly implied here,
but an actual execution of it on Messiah the shepherd, the substitute
for the sheep, by God as judge. Yet God in this shows His love as
gloriously as His justice. For God calls Messiah "My shepherd," that is,
provided ([Rev 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#008)) for sinners by My
love to them, and ever the object of My love, though judicially smitten
([Isa 53:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#004)) for their sins ([Isa
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001); [Isa
59:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#016)).

man that is my fellow--literally, "the man of my union." The Hebrew for
"man" is "a mighty man," one peculiarly man in his noblest ideal. "My
fellow," that is, "my associate." "My equal" (\[DE WETTE\]; a remarkable
admission from a Rationalist). "My nearest kinsman" \[HENGSTENBERG\],
([Joh 10:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#030); [Joh
14:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#010); [Phi
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006)).

sheep shall be scattered--The scattering of Christ's disciples on His
apprehension was the partial fulfilment ([Mat
26:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#031)), a pledge of the dispersion of
the Jewish nation (once the Lord's sheep, [Psa
100:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa100.htm#003)) consequent on their crucifixion
of Him. The Jews, though "scattered," are still the Lord's "sheep,"
awaiting their being "gathered" by Him ([Isa
40:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#009), [Isa
40:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#011)).

I will turn . . . hand upon . . . little ones--that is, I will interpose
in favor of (compare the phrase in a good sense, [Isa
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#025)) "the little ones," namely, the
humble followers of Christ from the Jewish Church, despised by the
world: "the poor of the flock" ([Zac
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#007), [Zac
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#011)); comforted after His
crucifixion at the resurrection ([Joh
20:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#017)); saved again by a special
interposition from the destruction of Jerusalem, having retired to Pella
when Cestius Gallus so unaccountably withdrew from Jerusalem. Ever since
there has been a Jewish "remnant" of "the little ones . . . according to
the election of grace." The hand of Jehovah was laid in wrath on the
Shepherd that His hand might be turned in grace upon the little ones.

[Zechariah 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">zac 13:8</span></span>

Two-thirds of the Jewish nation were to perish in the Roman wars, and a
third to survive. Probably from the context ([Zac
14:2-9](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#002)), which has never yet been
fulfilled, the destruction of the two-thirds (literally, "the proportion
of two," or "portion of two") and the saving of the remnant, the
one-third, are still future, and to be fulfilled under Antichrist.

[Zechariah 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">zac 13:9</span></span>

through . . . fire--of trial ([Psa
66:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#010); [Amo
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#011); [Co1
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#015); [Pe1
1:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#006)). It hence appears that the
Jews' conversion is not to precede, but to follow, their external
deliverance by the special interposition of Jehovah; which latter shall
be the main cause of their conversion, combined with a preparatory
inward shedding abroad in their hearts of the Holy Spirit ([Zac
12:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010)); and here, "they shall call
on My name," in their trouble, which brings Jehovah to their help ([Psa
50:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#015)).

my people-- ([Jer 30:18-22](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#018); [Eze
11:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#019); [Hos
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#023)).
