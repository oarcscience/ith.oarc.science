### [Haggai Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#001)

[Haggai 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hag 1:1</span></span>

HAGGAI CALLS THE PEOPLE TO CONSIDER THEIR WAYS IN NEGLECTING TO BUILD
GOD'S HOUSE: THE EVIL OF THIS NEGLECT TO THEMSELVES: THE HONOR TO GOD OF
ATTENDING TO IT: THE PEOPLE'S PENITENT OBEDIENCE UNDER ZERUBBABEL
FOLLOWED BY GOD'S GRACIOUS ASSURANCE. ([Hag
1:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#001))

second year of Darius--Hystaspes, the king of Medo-Persia, the second of
the world empires, Babylon having been overthrown by the Persian Cyrus.
The Jews having no king of their own, dated by the reign of the world
kings to whom they were subject. Darius was a common name of the Persian
kings, as Pharaoh of those of Egypt, and CÃ&brvbr;sar of those of Rome.
The name in the cuneiform inscriptions at Persepolis is written
Daryawus, from the root Darh, "to preserve," the Conservator \[LASSEN\].
HERODOTUS \[6.98\] explains it Coercer. Often opposite attributes are
assigned to the same god; in which light the Persians viewed their king.
[Ezr 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#024) harmonizes with Haggai in
making this year the date of the resumption of the building.

sixth month--of the Hebrew year, not of Darius' reign (compare [Zac
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#007); [Zac
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#001), [Zac
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#003); [Zac
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#019)). Two months later ("the eighth
month," [Zac 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#001)) Zechariah began to
prophesy, seconding Haggai.

the Lord--Hebrew, JEHOVAH: God's covenant title, implying His
unchangeableness, the guarantee of His faithfulness in keeping His
promises to His people.

by Haggai--Hebrew, "in the hand of Haggai"; God being the real speaker,
His prophet but the instrument (compare [Act
7:35](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#035); [Gal
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#019)).

Zerubbabel--called also Shesh-bazzar in [Ezr
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#008); [Ezr
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#014), [Ezr
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#016), where the same work is
attributed to Shesh-bazzar that in [Ezr
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#008) is attributed to Zerubbabel.
Shesh-bazzar is probably his Chaldean name; as Belteshazzar was that of
Daniel. Zerubbabel, his Hebrew name, means "one born in Babylon."

son of Shealtiel--or Salathiel. But [Ch1
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#017), [Ch1
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#019) makes Pedaiah his father.
Probably he was adopted by his uncle Salathiel, or Shealtiel, at the
death of his father (compare [Mat
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#012); [Luk
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#027)).

governor of Judah--to which office Cyrus had appointed him. The Hebrew
Pechah is akin to the original of the modern Turkish Pasha; one ruling a
region of the Persian empire of less extent than that under a satrap.

Joshua--called Jeshua ([Ezr 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#002)); so
the son of Nun in [Neh 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#017).

Josedech--or Jehozadak ([Ch1 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#015)),
one of those carried captive by Nebuchadnezzar. Haggai addresses the
civil and the religious representatives of the people, so as to have
them as his associates in giving God's commands; thus priest, prophet,
and ruler jointly testify in God's name.

[Haggai 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">hag 1:2</span></span>

the Lord of hosts--Jehovah, Lord of the powers of heaven and earth, and
therefore requiring implicit obedience.

This people--"This" sluggish and selfish "people." He does not say, My
people, since they had neglected the service of God.

The time--the proper time for building the temple. Two out of the
seventy predicted years of captivity (dating from the destruction of the
temple, 558 B.C., [Kg2 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#009)) were yet
unexpired; this they make their plea for delay \[HENDERSON\]. The
seventy years of captivity were completed long ago in the first year of
Cyrus, 536 B.C. ([Jer 29:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#010)); dating
from 606 B.C., Jehoiakim's captivity ([Ch2
36:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#006)). The seventy years to the
completion of the temple ([Jer 25:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#012))
were completed this very year, the second of Darius \[VATABLUS\].
Ingenious in excuses, they pretended that the interruption in the work
caused by their enemies proved it was not yet the proper time; whereas
their real motive was selfish dislike of the trouble, expense, and
danger from enemies. "God," say they, "hath interposed many difficulties
to punish our rash haste" \[CALVIN\]. Smerdis' interdict was no longer
in force, now that Darius the rightful king was on the throne; therefore
they had no real excuse for not beginning at once to build. AUBERLEN
denies that by "Artaxerxes" in Ezra 4:7-22 is meant Smerdis. Whether
Smerdis or Artaxerxes Longimanus be meant, the interdict referred only
to the rebuilding of the city, which the Persian kings feared might, if
rebuilt, cause them trouble to subdue; not to the rebuilding of the
temple. But the Jews were easily turned aside from the work.
Spiritually, like the Jews, men do not say they will never be religious,
but, It is not time yet. So the great work of life is left undone.

[Haggai 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hag 1:4</span></span>

Is it time--It is not time ([Hag 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#002)),
ye say, to build Jehovah's house; yet how is it that ye make it a fit
time not only to build, but to "dwell" at ease in your own houses?

you, O ye--rather, for "you, you"; the repetition marking the shameful
contrast between their concern for themselves, and their unconcern for
God \[MAURER\]. Compare a similar repetition in [Sa1
25:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#024); [Zac
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#005).

ceiled--rather, "wainscoted," or "paneled," referring to the walls as
well as the ceilings; furnished not only with comfort but luxury, in sad
contrast to God's house not merely unadorned, but the very walls not
raised above the foundations. How different David's feelings ([Sa2
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#002))!

[Haggai 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">hag 1:5</span></span>

Consider your ways--literally, "Set your heart" on your ways. The plural
implies, Consider both what ye have done (actively, [Lam
3:40](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#040)) and what ye have suffered
(passively) \[JEROME\]. Ponder earnestly whether ye have gained by
seeking self at the sacrifice of God.

[Haggai 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">hag 1:6</span></span>

Nothing has prospered with you while you neglected your duty to God. The
punishment corresponds to the sin. They thought to escape poverty by not
building, but keeping their money to themselves; God brought it on them
for not building ([Pro 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#007); [Pro
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#024); [Mat
6:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#033)). Instead of cheating God, they
had been only cheating themselves.

ye clothe . . . but . . . none warm--through insufficiency of clothing;
as ye are unable through poverty from failure of your crops to purchase
sufficient clothing. The verbs are infinitive, implying a continued
state: "Ye have sown, and been bringing in but little; ye have been
eating, but not to being satisfied; ye have been drinking, but not to
being filled; ye have been putting on clothes, but not to being warmed"
\[MOORE\]. Careful consideration of God's dealings with us will indicate
God's will regarding us. The events of life are the hieroglyphics in
which God records His feelings towards us, the key to which is found in
the Bible \[MOORE\].

wages . . . put . . . into a bag with holes--proverbial for labor and
money spent profitlessly ([Zac 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#010);
compare [Isa 55:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#002); [Jer
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#013)). Contrast, spiritually, the
"bags that wax not old, the treasure in heaven that faileth not" ([Luk
12:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#033)). Through the high cost of
necessaries, those who wrought for a day's wages parted with them at
once, as if they had put them into a bag with holes.

[Haggai 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">hag 1:8</span></span>

Go up to the mountain--Moriah \[ROSENMULLER\]; Lebanon \[HENDERSON\].
Rather, generally, the mountains around, now covered with wood, the
growth of the long period of the captivity. So [Neh
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#015), "Go forth unto the mount," that
is, the neighboring hills \[MAURER\].

wood--Haggai specifies this as being the first necessary; not to the
exclusion of other materials. Stones also were doubtless needed. That
the old walls were not standing, as the Hebrew interpreters quoted by
JEROME state, or the new walls partly built, appears from [Hag
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#018), where express mention is made of
laying the foundations.

I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified--I will be
propitious to suppliants in it ([Kg1
8:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#030)), and shall receive the honor due
to Me which has been withheld. In neglecting the temple, which is the
mirror of My presence, ye dishonor Me \[CALVIN\]; in its being built, ye
shall glorify Me.

[Haggai 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">hag 1:9</span></span>

Ye looked for much--literally "looked" so as to turn your eyes "to
much." The Hebrew infinitive here expresses continued looking. Ye hoped
to have your store made "much" by neglecting the temple. The greater was
your greediness, the more bitter your disappointment in being poorer
than ever.

when ye brought it home, I did blow upon it--even the little crop
brought into your barns I dissipated. "I did blow upon," that is, I
scattered and caused to perish with My mere breath, as scattered and
blighted corn.

mine house . . . his own house--in emphatic antithesis.

ye run--expressing the keenness of everyone of them in pursuing their
own selfish interests. Compare "run," [Psa
119:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#032); [Pro
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#016), contrasted with their apathy
about God's house.

[Haggai 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">hag 1:10</span></span>

heaven . . . is stayed from dew--literally "stays itself." Thus heaven
or the sky is personified; implying that inanimate nature obeys
Jehovah's will; and, shocked at His people's disobedience, withholds its
goods from them (compare [Jer
2:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#012)).

[Haggai 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">hag 1:11</span></span>

I called--what the "heaven" and "earth," the second causes, were said to
do ([Hag 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#010)), being the visible
instruments, Jehovah, in this verse, the invisible first cause, declares
to be His doing. He "calls for" famine, &c., as instruments of His wrath
([Kg2 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#001); [Psa
105:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#016)). The contrast is striking
between the prompt obedience of these material agencies, and the
slothful disobedience of living men, His people.

drought--Hebrew, Choreb, like in sound to Chareeb, "waste" ([Hag
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#004), [Hag
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#009)), said of God's house; implying
the correspondence between the sin and its punishment. Ye have let My
house be waste, and I will send on all that is yours a wasting drought.
This would affect not merely the "corn," &c., but also "men" and
"cattle," who must perish in the absence of the "corn," &c., lost by the
drought.

labour of the hands--all the fruits of lands, gardens, and vineyards,
obtained by labor of the hands ([Deu
28:33](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#033); [Psa
78:46](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#046)).

[Haggai 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">hag 1:12</span></span>

remnant of the people--all those who have returned from the exile ([Zac
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#006)).

as . . . God sent him--according to all that Jehovah had enjoined him to
speak. But as it is not till [Hag 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#014)
after Haggai's second message ([Hag
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#013)) that the people actually obeyed,
MAURER translates here, "hearkened to the voice of the Lord," and
instead of "as," "because the Lord had sent him." However, English
Version rightly represents their purpose of obedience as obedience in
God's eyes already, though not carried into effect till [Hag
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#014).

[Haggai 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">hag 1:13</span></span>

the Lord's messenger--so the priests ([Mal
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#007)) are called (compare [Gal
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#014); [Pe2
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#021)).

in the Lord's message--by the Lord's authority and commission: on the
Lord's embassage.

I am with you-- ([Mat 28:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#020)). On the
people showing the mere disposition to obey, even before they actually
set to work, God passes at once from the reproving tone to that of
tenderness. He hastens as it were to forget their former unfaithfulness,
and to assure them, when obedient, that He both is and will be with
them: Hebrew, "I with you!" God's presence is the best of blessings, for
it includes all others. This is the sure guarantee of their success no
matter how many their foes might be ([Rom
8:31](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#031)). Nothing more inspirits men and
rouses them from torpor, than, when relying on the promises of divine
aid, they have a sure hope of a successful issue \[CALVIN\].

[Haggai 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">hag 1:14</span></span>

Lord stirred up the spirit of, &c.--God gave them alacrity and
perseverance in the good work, though slothful in themselves. Every good
impulse and revival of religion is the direct work of God by His Spirit.

came and did work--collected the wood and stones and other materials
(compare [Hag 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#008)) for the work. Not
actually built or "laid the (secondary) foundations" of the temple, for
this was not done till three months after, namely, the twenty-fourth day
of the ninth month ([Hag 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#018))
\[GROTIUS\].

[Haggai 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">hag 1:15</span></span>

four and twentieth day--twenty-three days after the first message of
Haggai ([Hag 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#001)).
