### [1 Corinthians Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#001)

[1 Corinthians 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co1 15:1</span></span>

THE RESURRECTION PROVED AGAINST THE DENIERS OF IT AT CORINTH. (1Co.
15:1-58)

Moreover--"Now" \[ALFORD and ELLICOTT\].

I declare--literally, "I make known": it implies some degree of reproach
that it should be now necessary to make it known to them afresh, owing
to some of them "not having the knowledge of God" ([Co1
15:34](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#034)). Compare [Gal
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#011).

wherein ye stand--wherein ye now take your stand. This is your present
actual privilege, if ye suffer not yourselves to fall from your high
standing.

[1 Corinthians 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co1 15:2</span></span>

ye are saved--rather, "ye are being saved."

if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you--Able critics, BENGEL and
others, prefer connecting the words thus, "I declare unto you the Gospel
([Co1 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#001)) in what words I preached
it unto you." Paul reminds them, or rather makes known to them, as if
anew, not only the fact of the Gospel, but also with what words, and by
what arguments, he preached it to them. Translate in that case, "if ye
hold it fast." I prefer arranging as English Version, "By which ye are
saved, if ye hold fast (in memory and personal appropriation) with what
speech I preached it unto you."

unless--which is impossible, your faith is vain, in resting on Christ's
resurrection as an objective reality.

[1 Corinthians 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co1 15:3</span></span>

I delivered unto you--A short creed, or summary of articles of faith,
was probably even then existing; and a profession in accordance with it
was required of candidates for baptism ([Act
8:37](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#037)).

first of all--literally, "among the foremost points" ([Heb
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#002)). The atonement is, in Paul's
view, of primary importance.

which I . . . received--from Christ Himself by special revelation
(compare [Co1 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#023)).

died for our sins--that is, to atone FOR them; for taking away our sins
([Jo1 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#005); compare [Gal
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#004)): "gave Himself for our sins"
([Isa 53:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#005); [Co2
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#015); [Tit
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#014)). The "for" here does not, as in
some passages, imply vicarious substitution, but "in behalf of" ([Heb
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#003); [Pe1
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#024)). It does not, however, mean
merely "on account of," which is expressed by a different Greek word
([Rom 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#025)), (though in English
Version translated similarly, "for").

according to the scriptures--which "cannot be broken." Paul puts the
testimony of Scripture above that of those who saw the Lord after His
resurrection \[BENGEL\]. So our Lord quotes [Isa
53:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#012), in [Luk
22:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#037); compare [Psa
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#015), &c.; [Dan
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026).

[1 Corinthians 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co1 15:4</span></span>

buried . . . rose again--His burial is more closely connected with His
resurrection than His death. At the moment of His death, the power of
His inextinguishable life exerted itself ([Mat
27:52](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#052)). The grave was to Him not the
destined receptacle of corruption, but an apartment fitted for entering
into life ([Act 2:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#026)) \[BENGEL\].

rose again--Greek, "hath risen": the state thus begun, and its
consequences, still continue.

[1 Corinthians 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co1 15:5</span></span>

seen of Cephas--Peter ([Luk 24:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#034)).

the twelve--The round number for "the Eleven" ([Luk
24:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#033), [Luk
24:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#036)). "The Twelve" was their
ordinary appellation, even when their number was not full. However, very
possibly Matthias was present ([Act
1:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#022)). Some of the oldest
manuscripts and versions read, "the Eleven": but the best on the whole,
"the Twelve."

[1 Corinthians 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co1 15:6</span></span>

five hundred--This appearance was probably on the mountain (Tabor,
according to tradition), in Galilee, when His most solemn and public
appearance, according to His special promise, was vouchsafed ([Mat
26:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#032); [Mat
28:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#007), [Mat
28:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#010), [Mat
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#016)). He "appointed" this place, as
one remote from Jerusalem, so that believers might assemble there more
freely and securely. ALFORD'S theory of Jerusalem being the scene, is
improbable; as such a multitude of believers could not, with any safety,
have met in one place in the metropolis, after His crucifixion there.
The number of disciples ([Act 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#015)) at
Jerusalem shortly after, was one hundred and twenty, those in Galilee
and elsewhere not being reckoned. Andronicus and JUNIUS were, perhaps,
of the number ([Rom 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#007)): they are
said to be "among the apostles" (who all were witnesses of the
resurrection, [Act 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#022)).

remain unto this present--and, therefore, may be sifted thoroughly to
ascertain the trustworthiness of their testimony.

fallen asleep--in the sure hope of awaking at the resurrection ([Act
7:60](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#060)).

[1 Corinthians 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co1 15:7</span></span>

seen of James--the Less, the brother of our Lord ([Gal
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#019)). The Gospel according to the
Hebrews, quoted by JEROME \[On Illustrious Men, p. 170 D.\], records
that "James swore he would not eat bread from the hour that he drank the
cup of the Lord, till he should see Him rising again from the dead."

all the apostles--The term here includes many others besides "the
Twelve" already enumerated ([Co1
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#005)): perhaps the seventy disciples
([Luk 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#001)) \[CHRYSOSTOM\].

[1 Corinthians 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co1 15:8</span></span>

One born out of due time--Greek, "the one abortively born": the abortion
in the family of the apostles. As a child born before the due time is
puny, and though born alive, yet not of the proper size, and scarcely
worthy of the name of man, so "I am the least of the apostles," scarcely
"meet to be called an apostle"; a supernumerary taken into the college
of apostles out of regular course, not led to Christ by long
instruction, like a natural birth, but by a sudden power, as those
prematurely born \[GROTIUS\]. Compare the similar image from childbirth,
and by the same spiritual power, the resurrection of Christ ([Pe1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#003)). "Begotten again by the
resurrection of Jesus." Jesus' appearance to Paul, on the way to
Damascus, is the one here referred to.

[1 Corinthians 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co1 15:9</span></span>

least--The name, "Paulus," in Latin, means "least."

I persecuted the church--Though God has forgiven him, Paul can hardly
forgive himself at the remembrance of his past sin.

[1 Corinthians 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co1 15:10</span></span>

by . . . grace . . . and his grace--The repetition implies the
prominence which God's grace had in his mind, as the sole cause of his
marvellous conversion and subsequent labors. Though "not meet to be
called an apostle," grace has given him, in Christ, the meetness needed
for the office. Translate as the Greek, "His grace which was (showed)
towards me."

what I am--occupying the honorable office of an apostle. Contrast with
this the self-sufficient prayer of another Pharisee ([Luk
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#011)).

but I laboured--by God's grace ([Phi
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#016)).

than they all--than any of the apostles ([Co1
15:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#007)).

grace of God . . . with me--Compare "the Lord working with them" ([Mar
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#020)). The oldest manuscripts omit
"which was." The "not I, but grace," implies, that though the human will
concurred with God when brought by His Spirit into conformity with His
will, yet "grace" so preponderated in the work, that his own
co-operation is regarded as nothing, and grace as virtually the sole
agent. (Compare [Co1 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#009); [Mat
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#020); [Co2
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#001); [Phi
2:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#012)).

[1 Corinthians 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co1 15:11</span></span>

whether it were I or they--(the apostles) who "labored more abundantly"
([Co1 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#010)) in preaching, such was
the substance of our preaching, namely, the truths stated in [Co1
15:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#003).

[1 Corinthians 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co1 15:12</span></span>

if--Seeing that it is an admitted fact that Christ is announced by us
eye-witnesses as having risen from the dead, how is it that some of you
deny that which is a necessary consequence of Christ's resurrection,
namely, the general resurrection?

some--Gentile reasoners ([Act 17:32](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#032);
[Act 26:8](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#008)) who would not believe it
because they did not see "how" it could be ([Co1
15:35-36](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#035)).

[1 Corinthians 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co1 15:13</span></span>

If there be no general resurrection, which is the consequent, then there
can have been no resurrection of Christ, which is the antecedent. The
head and the members of the body stand on the same footing: what does
not hold good of them, does not hold good of Him either: His
resurrection and theirs are inseparably joined (compare [Co1
15:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#020); [Joh
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#019)).

[1 Corinthians 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co1 15:14</span></span>

your faith . . . vain-- ([Co1 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#011)).
The Greek for "vain" here is, empty, unreal: in [Co1
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#017), on the other hand, it is,
without use, frustrated. The principal argument of the first preachers
in support of Christianity was that God had raised Christ from the dead
([Act 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#022); [Act
2:32](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#032); [Act
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#010), [Act
4:33](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#033); [Act
13:37](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#037); [Rom
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#004)). If this fact were false, the
faith built on it must be false too.

[1 Corinthians 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co1 15:15</span></span>

testified of God--that is, concerning God. The rendering of others is,
"against God" \[Vulgate, ESTIUS, GROTIUS\]: the Greek preposition with
the genitive implies, not direct antagonism (as the accusative would
mean), but indirect to the dishonor of God. English Version is probably
better.

if so be--as they assert. It is not right to tell untrue stories, though
they are told and seem for the glory of God ([Job
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#007)).

[1 Corinthians 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co1 15:16</span></span>

The repetition implies the unanswerable force of the argument.

[1 Corinthians 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">co1 15:17</span></span>

vain--Ye are, by the very fact (supposing the case to be as the skeptics
maintained), frustrated of all which "your faith" appropriates: Ye are
still under the everlasting condemnation of your sins (even in the
disembodied state which is here referred to), from which Christ's
resurrection is our justification ([Rom
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#025)): "saved by his life" ([Rom
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#010)).

[1 Corinthians 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">co1 15:18</span></span>

fallen asleep in Christ--in communion with Christ as His members. "In
Christ's case the term used is death, to assure us of the reality of His
suffering; in our case, sleep, to give us consolation: In His case, His
resurrection having actually taken place, Paul shrinks not from the term
death; in ours, the resurrection being still only a matter of hope, he
uses the term falling asleep" \[PHOTIUS, QuÃ&brvbr;stiones
AmphilochiÃ&brvbr;, 197\].

perished--Their souls are lost; they are in misery in the unseen world.

[1 Corinthians 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">co1 15:19</span></span>

If our hopes in Christ were limited to this life only, we should be, of
all men, most to be pitied; namely, because, while others live
unmolested, we are exposed to every trial and persecution, and, after
all, are doomed to bitter disappointment in our most cherished hope; for
all our hope of salvation, even of the soul (not merely of the body),
hangs on the resurrection of Christ, without which His death would be of
no avail to us ([Eph 1:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#019); [Pe1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#003)). The heathen are "without hope"
([Eph 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#012); [Th1
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#013)). We should be even worse, for we
should be also without present enjoyment ([Co1
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#009)).

[1 Corinthians 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">co1 15:20</span></span>

now--as the case really is.

and become--omitted in the oldest manuscripts.

the first-fruits--the earnest or pledge, that the whole resurrection
harvest will follow, so that our faith is not vain, nor our hope limited
to this life. The time of writing this Epistle was probably about the
Passover ([Co1 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#007)); the day after the
Passover sabbath was that for offering the first-fruits ([Lev
23:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#010)), and the same was the day of
Christ's resurrection: whence appears the appropriateness of the image.

[1 Corinthians 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">co1 15:21</span></span>

by man . . . by man--The first-fruits are of the same nature as the rest
of the harvest; so Christ, the bringer of life, is of the same nature as
the race of men to whom He brings it; just as Adam, the bringer of
death, was of the same nature as the men on whom he brought it.

[1 Corinthians 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">co1 15:22</span></span>

in Adam all--in union of nature with Adam, as representative head of
mankind in their fall.

in Christ . . . all--in union of nature with Christ, the representative
head of mankind in their recovery. The life brought in by Christ is
co-extensive with the death brought in by Adam.

[1 Corinthians 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">co1 15:23</span></span>

But every man in his own order--rather, "rank": the Greek is not in the
abstract, but concrete: image from troops, "each in his own regiment."
Though all shall rise again, let not any think all shall be saved; nay,
each shall have his proper place, Christ first ([Col
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#018)), and after Him the godly who die
in Christ ([Th1 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#016)), in a separate
band from the ungodly, and then "the end," that is, the resurrection of
the rest of the dead. Christian churches, ministers, and individuals
seem about to be judged first "at His coming" (Mat. 25:1-30); then "all
the nations" (Mat. 25:31-46). Christ's own flock shall share His glory
"at His coming," which is not to be confounded with "the end," or
general judgment ([Rev 20:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#004), [Rev
20:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#011)). The latter is not in this
chapter specially discussed, but only the first resurrection, namely,
that of the saints: not even the judgment of Christian hollow professors
(Mat. 25:1-30) at His coming, is handled, but only the glory of them
"that are Christ's," who alone in the highest sense "obtain the
resurrection from the dead" ([Luk
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#014); [Luk
20:35-36](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#035); [Phi
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#011); see on [Phi
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#011)). The second coming of Christ is
not a mere point of time, but a period beginning with the resurrection
of the just at His appearing, and ending with the general judgment. The
ground of the universal resurrection is the union of all mankind in
nature with Christ, their representative Head, who has done away with
death, by His own death in their stead: the ground of the resurrection
of believers is not merely this, but their personal union with Him as
their "Life" ([Col 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#004)), effected
causatively by the Holy Spirit, and instrumentally by faith as the
subjective, and by ordinances as the objective means.

[1 Corinthians 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">co1 15:24</span></span>

Then--after that: next in the succession of "orders" or "ranks."

the end--the general resurrection, and final judgment and consummation
([Mat 25:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#046)).

delivered up . . . kingdom to . . . Father--(Compare [Joh
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#003)). Seeming at variance with [Dan
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#014), "His dominion is an everlasting
dominion which shall not pass away." Really, His giving up of the
mediatorial kingdom to the Father, when the end for which the
mediatorial economy was established has been accomplished, is altogether
in harmony with its continuing everlastingly. The change which shall
then take place, shall be in the manner of administration, not in the
kingdom itself; God shall then come into direct connection with the
earth, instead of mediatorially, when Christ shall have fully and
finally removed everything that severs asunder the holy God and a sinful
earth ([Col 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#020)). The glory of God is
the final end of Christ's mediatorial office ([Phi
2:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#010)). His co-equality with the
Father is independent of the latter, and prior to it, and shall,
therefore, continue when its function shall have ceased. His manhood,
too, shall everlastingly continue, though, as now, subordinate to the
Father. The throne of the Lamb (but no longer mediatorial) as well as of
God, shall be in the heavenly city ([Rev
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#003); compare [Rev
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#021)). The unity of the Godhead, and
the unity of the Church, shall be simultaneously manifested at Christ's
second coming. Compare [Zep 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#009); [Zac
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#009); [Joh
17:21-24](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#021). The oldest manuscripts for
"shall have delivered up," read, "delivereth up," which suits the sense
better. It is "when He shall have put down all rule," that "He
delivereth up the kingdom to the Father."

shall have put down all rule--the effect produced during the millennary
reign of Himself and His saints ([Psa
110:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001); [Psa
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#006); [Psa
2:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#006)), to which passages Paul refers,
resting his argument on the two words, "all" and "until," of the
Psalmist: a proof of verbal inspiration of Scripture (compare [Rev
2:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#026)). Meanwhile, He "rules in the
midst of His enemies" ([Psa 110:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#002)). He
is styled "the King" when He takes His great power ([Mat
25:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#034); [Rev
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#015), [Rev
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#017)). The Greek for "put down" is,
"done away with," or "brought to naught." "All" must be subject to Him,
whether openly opposed powers, as Satan and his angels, or kings and
angelic principalities ([Eph 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#021)).

[1 Corinthians 15:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">co1 15:25</span></span>

must--because Scripture foretells it.

till--There will be no further need of His mediatorial kingdom, its
object having been realized.

enemies under his feet-- ([Luk 19:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#027);
[Eph 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#022)).

[1 Corinthians 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">co1 15:26</span></span>

shall be--Greek, "is done away with" ([Rev
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#014); compare [Rev
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#018)). It is to believers especially
this applies ([Co1 15:55-57](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#055)); even in
the case of unbelievers, death is done away with by the general
resurrection. Satan brought in sin, and sin brought in death! So they
shall be destroyed (rendered utterly powerless) in the same order ([Co1
15:56](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#056); [Heb
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#014); [Rev
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#020); [Rev
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#010), [Rev
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#014)).

[1 Corinthians 15:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">co1 15:27</span></span>

all things--including death (compare [Eph
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#022); [Phi
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#021); [Heb
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#008); [Pe1
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#022)). It is said, "hath put," for
what God has said is the same as if it were already done, so sure is it.
Paul here quotes [Psa 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#006) in proof of
his previous declaration, "For (it is written), 'He hath put all things
under His feet.'"

under his feet--as His footstool ([Psa
110:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001)). In perfect and lasting
subjection.

when he--namely, God, who by His Spirit inspired the Psalmist.

[1 Corinthians 15:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">co1 15:28</span></span>

Son . . . himself . . . subject--not as the creatures are, but as a Son
voluntarily subordinate to, though co-equal with, the Father. In the
mediatorial kingdom, the Son had been, in a manner, distinct from the
Father. Now, His kingdom shall merge in the Father's, with whom He is
one; not that there is thus any derogation from His honor; for the
Father Himself wills "that all should honor the Son, as they honor the
Father" ([Joh 5:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#022); [Heb
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#006)).

God . . . all in all--as Christ is all in all ([Col
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#011); compare [Zac
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#009)). Then, and not till then, "all
things," without the least infringement of the divine prerogative, shall
be subject to the Son, and the Son subordinate to the Father, while
co-equally sharing His glory. Contrast [Psa
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#004); [Psa
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001). Even the saints do not fully
realize God as their "all" ([Psa
73:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#025)) now, through desiring it; then
each shall feel, God is all to me.

[1 Corinthians 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">co1 15:29</span></span>

Else--if there be no resurrection.

what shall they do?--How wretched is their lot!

they . . . which are baptized for the dead--third person; a class
distinct from that in which the apostle places himself, "we" ([Co1
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#030)); first person. ALFORD thinks
there is an allusion to a practice at Corinth of baptizing a living
person in behalf of a friend who died unbaptized; thus Paul, without
giving the least sanction to the practice, uses an ad hominem argument
from it against its practicers, some of whom, though using it, denied
the resurrection: "What account can they give of their practice; why are
they at the trouble of it, if the dead rise not?" \[So Jesus used an ad
hominem argument, [Mat 12:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#027)\]. But if
so, it is strange there is no direct censure of it. Some Marcionites
adopted the practice at a later period, probably from taking this
passage, as ALFORD does; but, generally, it was unknown in the Church.
BENGEL translates, "over (immediately upon) the dead," that is, who will
be gathered to the dead immediately after baptism. Compare [Job
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#001), "the graves are ready for me."
The price they get for their trouble is, that they should be gathered to
the dead for ever ([Co1 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#013), [Co1
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#016)). Many in the ancient Church put
off baptism till near death. This seems the better view; though there
may have been some rites of symbolical baptism at Corinth, now unknown,
perhaps grounded on Jesus' words ([Mat
20:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#022)), which Paul here alludes to.
The best punctuation is, "If the dead rise not at all, why are they then
baptized for them" (so the oldest manuscripts read the last words,
instead of "for the dead")?

[1 Corinthians 15:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">co1 15:30</span></span>

we--apostles ([Co1 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#009); [Co1
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#009)). A gradation from those who could
only for a little time enjoy this life (that is, those baptized at the
point of death), to us, who could enjoy it longer, if we had not
renounced the world for Christ \[BENGEL\].

[1 Corinthians 15:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">co1 15:31</span></span>

by your rejoicing--by the glorying which I have concerning you, as the
fruit of my labors in the Lord. Some of the earliest manuscripts and
fathers read "our," with the same sense. BENGEL understands "your
rejoicing," to be the enjoyable state of the Corinthians, as contrasted
with his dying daily to give his converts rejoicing or glorying ([Co1
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#008); [Co2
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#012), [Co2
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#015); [Eph
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#013); [Phi
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#026)). But the words, "which I have,"
favor the explanation--"the rejoicing which I have over you." Many of
the oldest manuscripts and Vulgate insert "brethren" here.

I die daily--This ought to stand first in the sentence, as it is so put
prominently forward in the Greek. I am day by day in sight of death,
exposed to it, and expecting it ([Co2
4:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#011); [Co2
1:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#008); [Co2
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#023)).

[1 Corinthians 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">co1 15:32</span></span>

Punctuate thus: "If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at
Ephesus, what advantageth it me? If the dead rise not, let us eat and
drink," &c. \[BENGEL\]. If "merely as a man" (with the mere human hope
of the present life; not with the Christian's hope of the resurrection;
answering to "If the dead rise not," the parallel clause in the next
sentence), I have fought with men resembling savage beasts. Heraclitus,
of Ephesus, had termed his countrymen "wild beasts" four hundred years
before. So Epimenides called the Cretians ([Tit
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#012)). Paul was still at Ephesus ([Co1
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#008)), and there his life was daily in
danger ([Co1 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#009); compare [Co2
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#008)). Though the tumult ([Act
19:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#029)) had not yet taken place (for
after it he set out immediately for Macedonia), this Epistle was written
evidently just before it, when the storm was gathering; "many
adversaries" ([Co1 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#009)) were already
menacing him.

what advantageth it me?--seeing I have renounced all that, "as a mere
man," might compensate me for such sufferings, gain, fame, &c.

let us eat, &c.--Quoted from the Septuagint, ([Isa
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#013)), where the prophet describes
the reckless self-indulgence of the despisers of God's call to mourning,
Let us enjoy the good things of life now, for it soon will end. Paul
imitates the language of such skeptics, to reprove both their theory and
practice. "If men but persuade themselves that they shall die like the
beasts, they soon will live like beasts too" \[SOUTH\].

[1 Corinthians 15:33](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">co1 15:33</span></span>

evil communications corrupt good manners--a current saying, forming a
verse in MENANDER, the comic poet, who probably took it from Euripides
\[SOCRATES, Ecclesiastical History, 3.16\]. "Evil communications" refer
to intercourse with those who deny the resurrection. Their notion seems
to have been that the resurrection is merely spiritual, that sin has its
seat solely in the body, and will be left behind when the soul leaves
it, if, indeed, the soul survive death at all.

good--not only good-natured, but pliant. Intimacy with the profligate
society around was apt to corrupt the principles of the Corinthians.

[1 Corinthians 15:34](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">co1 15:34</span></span>

Awake--literally, "out of the sleep" of carnal intoxication into which
ye are thrown by the influence of these skeptics ([Co1
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#032); [Joe
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#005)).

to righteousness--in contrast with "sin" in this verse, and corrupt
manners ([Co1 15:33](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#033)).

sin not--Do not give yourselves up to sinful pleasures. The Greek
expresses a continued state of abstinence from sin. Thus, Paul implies
that they who live in sinful pleasures readily persuade themselves of
what they wish, namely, that there is to be no resurrection.

some--the same as in [Co1 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#012).

have not the knowledge of God--and so know not His power in the
resurrection ([Mat 22:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#029)). Stronger
than "are ignorant of God." An habitual ignorance: wilful, in that they
prefer to keep their sins, rather than part with them, in order to know
God (compare [Joh 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#017); [Pe1
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#015)).

to your shame--that you Corinthian Christians, who boast of your
knowledge, should have among you, and maintain intercourse with, those
so practically ignorant of God, as to deny the resurrection.

[1 Corinthians 15:35](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">co1 15:35</span></span>

How--It is folly to deny a fact of REVELATION, because we do not know
the "how." Some measure God's power by their petty intelligence, and
won't admit, even on His assurance, anything which they cannot explain.
Ezekiel's answer of faith to the question is the truly wise one ([Eze
37:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#003)). So Jesus argues not on
principles of philosophy, but wholly from "the power of God," as
declared by the Word of God ([Mat
19:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#026); [Mar
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#027); [Mar
12:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#023); [Luk
18:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#027)).

come--The dead are said to depart, or to be deceased: those rising again
to come. The objector could not understand how the dead are to rise, and
with what kind of a body they are to come. Is it to be the same body? If
so, how is this, since the resurrection bodies will not eat or drink, or
beget children, as the natural bodies do? Besides, the latter have
mouldered into dust. How then can they rise again? If it be a different
body, how can the personal identity be preserved? Paul answers, In one
sense it will be the same body, in another, a distinct body. It will be
a body, but a spiritual, not a natural, body.

[1 Corinthians 15:36](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">co1 15:36</span></span>

fool--with all thy boasted philosophy ([Psa
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001)).

that which thou--"thou," emphatical: appeal to the objector's own
experience: "The seed which thou thyself sowest." Paul, in this verse
and in [Co1 15:42](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#042), answers the
question of [Co1 15:35](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#035), "How?" and in
[Co1 15:37-41](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#037), [Co1
15:43](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#043), the question, "With what kind
of body?" He converts the very objection (the death of the natural body)
into an argument. Death, so far from preventing quickening, is the
necessary prelude and prognostication of it, just as the seed "is not
quickened" into a new sprout with increased produce, "except it die"
(except a dissolution of its previous organization takes place). Christ
by His death for us has not given us a reprieve from death as to the
life which we have from Adam; nay, He permits the law to take its course
on our fleshly nature; but He brings from Himself new spiritual and
heavenly life out of death ([Co1
15:37](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#037)).

[1 Corinthians 15:37](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">co1 15:37</span></span>

not that body that shall be--a body beautiful and no longer a "bare
grain" \[BENGEL\]. No longer without stalk or ear, but clothed with
blade and ears, and yielding many grains instead of only one
\[GROTIUS\]. There is not an identity of all the particles of the old
and the new body. For the perpetual transmutation of matter is
inconsistent with this. But there is a hidden germ which constitutes the
identity of body amidst all outward changes: the outward accretions fall
off in its development, while the germ remains the same. Every such germ
("seed," [Co1 15:38](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#038)) "shall have its
own body," and be instantly recognized, just as each plant now is known
from the seed that was sown (see on [Co1
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#013)). So Christ by the same image
illustrated the truth that His death was the necessary prelude of His
putting on His glorified body, which is the ground of the regeneration
of the many who believe ([Joh 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#024)).
Progress is the law of the spiritual, as of the natural world. Death is
the avenue not to mere revivification or reanimation, but to
resurrection and regeneration ([Mat
19:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#028); [Phi
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#021)). Compare "planted," &c., [Rom
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#005).

[1 Corinthians 15:38](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">co1 15:38</span></span>

as it hath pleased him--at creation, when He gave to each of the (kinds
of) seeds (so the Greek is for "to every seed") a body of its own ([Gen
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#011), "after its kind," suited to its
species). So God can and will give to the blessed at the resurrection
their own appropriate body, such as it pleases Him, and such as is
suitable to their glorified state: a body peculiar to the individual,
substantially the same as the body sown.

[1 Corinthians 15:39](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">co1 15:39</span></span>

Illustrations of the suitability of bodies, however various, to their
species: the flesh of the several species of animals; bodies celestial
and terrestrial; the various kinds of light in the sun, moon, and stars,
respectively.

flesh--animal organism \[DE WETTE\]. He implies by the word that our
resurrection bodies shall be in some sense really flesh, not mere
phantoms of air \[ESTIUS\]. So some of the oldest creeds expressed it,
"I believe in the resurrection of the flesh." Compare as to Jesus' own
resurrection body, [Luk 24:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#039); [Joh
20:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#027); to which ours shall be made
like, and therefore shall be flesh, but not of animal organism ([Phi
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#021)) and liable to corruption. But
[Co1 15:50](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#050) below implies, it is not
"flesh and blood" in the animal sense we now understand them; for these
"shall not inherit the kingdom of God."

not the same--not flesh of the same nature and excellency. As the kinds
of flesh, however widely differing from one another, do not cease to be
flesh, so the kinds of bodies, however differing from one another, are
still bodies. All this is to illustrate the difference of the new
celestial body from its terrestrial seed, while retaining a substantial
identity.

beasts--quadrupeds.

another of fishes . . . another of birds--Most of the oldest manuscripts
read thus, "another FLESH of birds . . . another of fishes": the order
of nature.

[1 Corinthians 15:40](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">co1 15:40</span></span>

celestial bodies--not the sun, moon, and stars, which are first
introduced in [Co1 15:41](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#041), but the
bodies of angels, as distinguished from the bodies of earthly creatures.

the glory of the celestial-- ([Luk
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#026)).

glory of . . . terrestrial-- ([Mat
6:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#028); [Pe1
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#024)).

[1 Corinthians 15:41](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">co1 15:41</span></span>

one glory of . . . sun . . . another . . . of . . . moon--The analogy is
not to prove different degrees of glory among the blessed (whether this
may be, or not, indirectly hinted at), but this: As the various
fountains of light, which is so similar in its aspect and properties,
differ (the sun from the moon, and the moon from the stars; and even one
star from another star, though all seem so much alike); so there is
nothing unreasonable in the doctrine that our present bodies differ from
our resurrection bodies, though still continuing bodies. Compare the
same simile, appropriate especially in the clear Eastern skies ([Dan
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#003); [Mat
13:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#043)). Also that of seed in the same
parable ([Mat 13:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#024); [Gal
6:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#007)).

[1 Corinthians 15:42](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">co1 15:42</span></span>

sown--Following up the image of seed. A delightful word instead of
burial.

in corruption--liable to corruption: corruptible: not merely a prey when
dead to corruption; as the contrast shows, "raised in incorruption,"
that is, not liable to corruption: incorruptible.

[1 Corinthians 15:43](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">co1 15:43</span></span>

in dishonour--answering to "our vile body" ([Phi
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#021)); literally, "our body of
humiliation": liable to various humiliations of disease, injury, and
decay at last.

in glory--the garment of incorruption ([Co1
15:42-43](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#042)) like His glorious body ([Phi
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#021)), which we shall put on ([Co1
15:49](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#049), [Co1
15:53](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#053); [Co2
5:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#002)).

in weakness--liable to infirmities ([Co2
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#004)).

in power--answering to a "spiritual body" ([Co1
15:44](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#044); compare [Luk
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#017), "Spirit and power"). Not liable
to the weaknesses of our present frail bodies ([Isa
33:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#024); [Rev
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#004)).

[1 Corinthians 15:44](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">co1 15:44</span></span>

a natural body--literally, "an animal body," a body moulded in its
organism of "flesh and blood" ([Co1
15:50](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#050)) to suit the animal soul which
predominates in it. The Holy Spirit in the spirit of believers, indeed,
is an earnest of a superior state ([Rom
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#011)), but meanwhile in the body the
animal soul preponderates; hereafter the Spirit shall predominate, and
the animal soul be duly subordinate.

spiritual body--a body wholly moulded by the Spirit, and its organism
not conformed to the lower and animal ([Luk
20:35-36](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#035)), but to the higher and
spiritual, life (compare [Co1 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#014);
[Th1 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#023)).

There is, &c.--The oldest manuscripts read, "IF there is a natural (or
animal-souled) body, there is also a spiritual body." It is no more
wonderful a thing, that there should be a body fitted to the capacities
and want of man's highest part, his spirit (which we see to be the
case), than that there should be one fitted to the capacities and wants
of his subordinate part, the animal soul \[ALFORD\].

[1 Corinthians 15:45](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#045)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">co1 15:45</span></span>

so--in accordance with the distinction just mentioned between the
natural or animal-souled body and the spiritual body.

it is written-- ([Gen 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#007)); "Man
became (was made to become) a living soul," that is, endowed with an
animal soul, the living principle of his body.

the last Adam--the LAST Head of humanity, who is to be fully manifested
in the last day, which is His day ([Joh
6:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#039)). He is so called in [Job
19:25](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#025); see on [Job
19:25](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#025) (compare [Rom
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#014)). In contrast to "the last," Paul
calls "man" ([Gen 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#007)) "the FIRST
Adam."

quickening--not only living, but making alive ([Joh
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#021); [Joh
6:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#033), [Joh
6:39-40](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#039), [Joh
6:54](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#054), [Joh
6:57](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#057), [Joh
6:62-63](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#062); [Rom
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#011)). As the natural or animal-souled
body ([Co1 15:44](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#044)) is the fruit of our
union with the first Adam, an animal-souled man, so the spiritual body
is the fruit of our union with the second Adam, who is the quickening
Spirit ([Co2 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#017)). As He became
representative of the whole of humanity in His union of the two natures,
He exhausted in His own person the sentence of death passed on all men,
and giveth spiritual and everlasting life to whom He will.

[1 Corinthians 15:46](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#046)

afterward--Adam had a soul not necessarily mortal, as it afterwards
became by sin, but "a living soul," and destined to live for ever, if he
had eaten of the tree of life ([Gen
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#022)); still his body was but an
animal-souled body, not a spiritual body, such as believers shall have;
much less was he a "life-giving spirit," as Christ. His soul had the
germ of the Spirit, rather than the fulness of it, such as man shall
have when restored "body, soul, and spirit," by the second Adam ([Th1
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#023)). As the first and lower Adam
came before the second and heavenly Adam, so the animal-souled body
comes first, and must die before it be changed into the spiritual body
(that is, that in which the Spirit predominates over the animal soul).

of the earth--inasmuch as being sprung from the earth, he is "earthy"
([Gen 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#007); [Gen
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#019), "dust thou art"); that is, not
merely earthly or born upon the earth, but terrene, or of earth;
literally, "of heaped earth" or clay. "Adam" means red earth.

from heaven-- ([Joh 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#013), [Joh
3:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#031)). Humanity in Christ is generic.
In Him man is impersonated in his true ideal as God originally designed
him. Christ is the representative man, the federal head of redeemed man.

[1 Corinthians 15:48](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#048)

As is the earthy--namely, Adam.

([Joh 3:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#006)).

the heavenly--Christ.

they . . . that are heavenly--His people in their regenerate state ([Phi
3:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#020)). As the former precedes the
latter state, so the natural bodies precede the spiritual bodies.

we shall also bear--or wear as a garment \[BENGEL\]. The oldest
manuscripts and versions read, "We must also bear," or "let us also
bear." It implies the divine appointment (compare "must," [Co1
15:53](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#053)) and faith assenting to it. An
exhortation, and yet implying a promise (so [Rom
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#029)). The conformity to the image of
the heavenly Representative man is to be begun here in our souls, in
part, and shall be perfected at the resurrection in both bodies and
souls.

[1 Corinthians 15:50](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#050)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">co1 15:50</span></span>

(See on [Co1 15:37](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#037); [Co1
15:39](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#039)). "Flesh and blood" of the same
animal and corruptible nature as our present ([Co1
15:44](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#044)) animal-souled bodies, cannot
inherit the kingdom of God. Therefore the believer acquiesces gladly in
the unrepealed sentence of the holy law, which appoints the death of the
present body as the necessary preliminary to the resurrection body of
glory. Hence he "dies daily" to the flesh and to the world, as the
necessary condition to his regeneration here and hereafter ([Joh
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#006); [Gal
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#020)). As the being born of the flesh
constitutes a child of Adam, so the being born of the Spirit constitutes
a child of God.

cannot--Not merely is the change of body possible, but it is necessary.
The spirit extracted from the dregs of wine does not so much differ from
them, as the glorified man does from the mortal man \[BENGEL\] of mere
animal flesh and blood ([Gal 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#016)).
The resurrection body will be still a body though spiritual, and
substantially retaining the personal identity; as is proved by [Luk
24:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#039); [Joh
20:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#027), compared with [Phi
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#021).

the kingdom of God--which is not at all merely animal, but altogether
spiritual. Corruption doth not inherit, though it is the way to,
incorruption ([Co1 15:36](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#036), [Co1
15:52-53](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#052)).

[1 Corinthians 15:51](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#051)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">co1 15:51</span></span>

Behold--Calling attention to the "mystery" heretofore hidden in God's
purposes, but now revealed.

you--emphatical in the Greek; I show (Greek, "tell," namely, by the word
of the Lord, [Th1 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#015)) YOU, who think
you have so much knowledge, "a mystery" (compare [Rom
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#025)) which your reason could never
have discovered. Many of the old manuscripts and Fathers read, "We shall
all sleep, but we shall not all be changed"; but this is plainly a
corrupt reading, inconsistent with [Th1
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#015), [Th1
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#017), and with the apostle's argument
here, which is that a change is necessary ([Co1
15:53](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#053)). English Version is supported
by some of the oldest manuscripts and Fathers. The Greek is literally
"We all shall not sleep, but," &c. The putting off of the corruptible
body for an incorruptible by an instantaneous change will, in the case
of "the quick," stand as equivalent to death, appointed to all men ([Heb
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#027)); of this Enoch and Elijah are
types and forerunners. The "we" implies that Christians in that age and
every successive age since and hereafter were designed to stand waiting,
as if Christ might come again in their time, and as if they might be
found among "the quick."

[1 Corinthians 15:52](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#052)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">co1 15:52</span></span>

the last trump--at the sounding of the trumpet on the last day
\[VATABLUS\] ([Mat 24:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#031); [Th1
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#016)). Or the Spirit by Paul hints
that the other trumpets mentioned subsequently in the Apocalypse shall
precede, and that this shall be the last of all (compare [Isa
27:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#013); [Zac
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#014)). As the law was given with the
sound of a trumpet, so the final judgment according to it ([Heb
12:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#019); compare [Exo
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#016)). As the Lord ascended "with the
sound of a trumpet" ([Psa 47:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#005)), so He
shall descend ([Rev 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#015)). The
trumpet was sounded to convoke the people on solemn feasts, especially
on the first day of the seventh month (the type of the completion of
time; seven being the number for perfection; on the tenth of the same
month was the atonement, and on the fifteenth the feast of tabernacles,
commemorative of completed salvation out of the spiritual Egypt, compare
[Zac 14:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#018)); compare [Psa
50:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#001). Compare His calling forth of
Lazarus from the grave "with a loud voice," [Joh
11:43](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#043), with [Joh
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#025), [Joh
5:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#028).

and--immediately, in consequence.

[1 Corinthians 15:53](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#053)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">co1 15:53</span></span>

this--pointing to his own body and that of those whom he addresses.

put on--as a garment ([Co2 5:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#002)).

immortality--Here only, besides [Ti1
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#016), the word "immortality" is found.
Nowhere is the immortality of the soul, distinct from the body, taught;
a notion which many erroneously have derived from heathen philosophers.
Scripture does not contemplate the anomalous state brought about by
death, as the consummation to be earnestly looked for ([Co2
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#004)), but the resurrection.

[1 Corinthians 15:54](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#054)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">co1 15:54</span></span>

then--not before. Death has as yet a sting even to the believer, in that
his body is to be under its power till the resurrection. But then the
sting and power of death shall cease for ever.

Death is swallowed up in victory--In Hebrew of [Isa
25:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#008), from which it is quoted, "He
(Jehovah) will swallow up death in victory"; that is, for ever: as "in
victory" often means in Hebrew idiom ([Jer
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#005); [Lam
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#020)). Christ will swallow it up so
altogether victoriously that it shall never more regain its power
(compare [Hos 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#002); [Hos
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#014); [Co2
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#004); [Heb
2:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#014); [Rev
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#014); [Rev
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#004)).

[1 Corinthians 15:55](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#055)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_055">co1 15:55</span></span>

Quoted from [Hos 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#014), substantially;
but freely used by the warrant of the Spirit by which Paul wrote. The
Hebrew may be translated, "O death, where are thy plagues? Where, O
Hades, is thy destruction?" The Septuagint, "Where is thy victory
(literally, in a lawsuit), O death? Where is thy sting, O Hades? . . .
Sting" answers to the Hebrew "plagues," namely, a poisoned sting causing
plagues. Appropriate, as to the old serpent ([Gen
3:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#014); [Num
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#006)). "Victory" answers to the Hebrew
"destruction." Compare [Isa 25:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#007),
"destroy . . . veil . . . over all nations," namely, victoriously
destroy it; and to "in victory" ([Co1
15:54](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#054)), which he triumphantly repeats.
The "where" implies their past victorious destroying power and sting,
now gone for ever; obtained through Satan's triumph over man in Eden,
which enlisted God's law on the side of Satan and death against man
([Rom 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#012), [Rom
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#017), [Rom
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#021)). The souls in Hades being freed
by the resurrection, death's sting and victory are gone. For "O grave,"
the oldest manuscripts and versions read, "O death," the second time.

[1 Corinthians 15:56](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#056)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_056">co1 15:56</span></span>

If there were no sin, there would be no death. Man's transgression of
the law gives death its lawful power.

strength of sin is the law--Without the law sin is not perceived or
imputed ([Rom 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#020); [Rom
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#015); [Rom
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#013)). The law makes sin the more
grievous by making God's will the clearer ([Rom
7:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#008)). Christ's people are no longer
"under the law" ([Rom 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#014)).

[1 Corinthians 15:57](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#057)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_057">co1 15:57</span></span>

to God--The victory was in no way due to ourselves ([Psa
98:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#001)).

giveth--a present certainty.

the victory--which death and Hades ("the grave") had aimed at, but
which, notwithstanding the opposition of them, as well as of the law and
sin, we have gained. The repetition of the word ([Co1
15:54-55](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#054)) is appropriate to the
triumph gained.

[1 Corinthians 15:58](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#058)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_058">co1 15:58</span></span>

beloved--Sound doctrine kindles Christian love.

steadfast--not turning aside from the faith of the resurrection of
yourselves.

unmovable--not turned aside by others ([Co1
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#012); [Col
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#023)).

the work of the Lord--the promotion of Christ's kingdom ([Phi
2:30](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#030)).

not in vain--as the deniers of the resurrection would make it ([Co1
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#014), [Co1
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#017)).

in the Lord--applying to the whole sentence and its several clauses: Ye,
as being in the Lord by faith, know that your labor in the Lord (that
is, labor according to His will) is not to be without its reward in the
Lord (through His merits and according to His gracious appointment).
