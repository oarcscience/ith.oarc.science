### [Hosea Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#001)

[Hosea 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hos 14:1</span></span>

GOD'S PROMISE OF BLESSING, ON THEIR REPENTANCE: THEIR ABANDONMENT OF
IDOLATRY FORETOLD: THE CONCLUSION OF THE WHOLE, THE JUST SHALL WALK IN
GOD'S WAYS, BUT THE TRANSGRESSOR SHALL FALL THEREIN. ([Hos
14:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#001))

fallen by thine iniquity-- ([Hos 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#005);
[Hos 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#009)).

[Hosea 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">hos 14:2</span></span>

Take with you words--instead of sacrifices, namely, the words of
penitence here put in your mouths by God. "Words," in Hebrew, mean
"realities," there being the same term for "words" and "things"; so God
implies, He will not accept empty professions ([Psa
78:36](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#036); [Isa
29:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#013)). He does not ask costly
sacrifices, but words of heartfelt penitence.

receive us graciously--literally "(for) good."

calves of our lips--that is, instead of sacrifices of calves, which we
cannot offer to Thee in exile, we present the praises of our lips. Thus
the exile, wherein the temple service ceased, prepared the way for the
gospel time when the types of the animal sacrifices of the Old Testament
being realized in Christ's perfect sacrifice once for all, "the
sacrifice of praise to God continually that is the fruit of our lips"
([Heb 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#014)) takes their place in the
New Testament.

[Hosea 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">hos 14:3</span></span>

Three besetting sins of Israel are here renounced, trust in Assyria,
application to Egypt for its cavalry (forbidden, [Deu
17:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#016); compare [Hos
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#011); [Hos
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#005); [Hos
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#001); [Kg2
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#004); [Psa
33:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#017); [Isa
30:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#002), [Isa
30:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#016); [Isa
31:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#001)), and idolatry.

fatherless--descriptive of the destitute state of Israel, when severed
from God, their true Father. We shall henceforth trust in none but Thee,
the only Father of the fatherless, and Helper of the destitute ([Psa
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#014); [Psa
68:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#005)); our nation has experienced Thee
such in our helpless state in Egypt, and now in a like state again our
only hope is Thy goodness.

[Hosea 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hos 14:4</span></span>

God's gracious reply to their self-condemning prayer.

backsliding--apostasy: not merely occasional backslidings. God can heal
the most desperate sinfulness \[CALVIN\].

freely--with a gratuitous, unmerited, and abundant love ([Eze
16:60-63](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#060)). So as to the spiritual
Israel ([Joh 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#016); [Rom
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#024); [Rom
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#008); [Jo1
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#010)).

[Hosea 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">hos 14:5</span></span>

as the dew--which falls copiously in the East, taking the place of the
more frequent rains in other regions. God will not be "as the early dew
that goeth away," but constant ([Hos
6:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#003); [Job
29:19](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#019); [Pro
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#012)).

the lily--No plant is more productive than the lily, one root often
producing fifty bulbs \[PLINY, Natural History, 21.5\]. The common lily
is white, consisting of six leaves opening like bells. The royal lily
grows to the height of three or four feet; [Mat
6:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#029) alludes to the beauty of its
flowers.

roots as Lebanon--that is, as the trees of Lebanon (especially the
cedars), which cast down their roots as deeply as is their height
upwards; so that they are immovable \[JEROME\], ([Isa
10:34](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#034)). Spiritual growth consists most
in the growth of the root which is out of sight.

[Hosea 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">hos 14:6</span></span>

branches--shoots, or suckers.

beauty . . . as the olive--which never loses its verdure. One plant is
not enough to express the graces of God's elect people. The lily depicts
its lovely growth; but as it wants duration and firmness, the deeply
rooted cedars of Lebanon are added; these, however, are fruitless,
therefore the fruitful, peace-bearing, fragrant, ever green olive is
added.

smell as Lebanon--which exhaled from it the fragrance of odoriferous
trees and flowers. So Israel's name shall be in good savor with all
([Gen 27:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#027); [Sol
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#011)).

[Hosea 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">hos 14:7</span></span>

They that used to dwell under Israel's shadow (but who shall have been
forced to leave it), shall return, that is, be restored ([Eze
35:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#009)). Others take "His shadow" to
mean Jehovah's (compare [Psa 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#008);
[Psa 91:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#001); [Isa
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#006)), which [Hos
14:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#001) ("return unto the Lord," &c.)
favor. But the "his" in [Hos 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#006)
refers to Israel, and therefore must refer to the same here.

revive as . . . corn--As the corn long buried in the earth springs up,
with an abundant produce, so shall they revive from their calamities,
with a great increase of offspring (compare [Joh
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#024)).

scent thereof--that is, Israel's fame. Compare [Hos
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#006), "His smell as Lebanon"; [Sol
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#003) : "Thy name is as ointment poured
forth." The Septuagint favors the Margin, "memorial."

as the wine of Lebanon--which was most celebrated for its aroma, flavor,
and medicinal restorative properties.

[Hosea 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">hos 14:8</span></span>

Ephraim shall say--being brought to penitence by God's goodness, and
confessing and abhorring his past madness.

I have heard . . . and observed him--I Jehovah have answered and
regarded him with favor; the opposite of God's "hiding His face from"
one ([Deu 31:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#017)). It is the experience
of God's favor, in contrast to God's wrath heretofore, that leads
Ephraim to abhor his past idolatry. Jehovah heard and answered: whereas
the idols, as Ephraim now sees, could not hear, much less answer.

I am . . . a green fir--or cypress; ever green, winter and summer alike;
the leaves not falling off in winter.

From me is thy fruit found--"From Me," as the root. Thou needest go no
farther than Me for the supply of all thy wants; not merely the
protection implied by the shadow of the cypress, but that which the
cypress has not, namely, fruit, all spiritual and temporal blessings. It
may be also implied, that whatever spiritual graces Ephraim seeks for or
may have, are not of themselves, but of God ([Psa
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#003); [Joh
15:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#004), [Joh
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#008); [Jam
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#017)). God's promises to us are more
our security for mortifying sin than our promises to God ([Isa
27:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#009)).

[Hosea 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">hos 14:9</span></span>

EPILOGUE, summing up the whole previous teaching. Here alone Hosea uses
the term "righteous," so rare were such characters in his day. There is
enough of saving truth clear in God's Word to guide those humbly seeking
salvation, and enough of difficulties to confound those who curiously
seek them out, rather than practically seek salvation.

fall--stumble and are offended at difficulties opposed to their
prejudices and lusts, or above their self-wise understanding (compare
[Pro 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#029); [Mic
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#007); [Mat
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#019); [Luk
2:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#034); [Joh
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#017); [Pe1
2:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#007)). To him who sincerely seeks the
agenda, God will make plain the credenda. Christ is the foundation-stone
to some: a stone of stumbling and rock of offense to others. The same
sun softens wax and hardens clay. But their fall is the most fatal who
fall in the ways of God, split on the Rock of ages, and suck poison out
of the Balm of Gilead.
