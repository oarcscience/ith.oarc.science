### [Proverbs Chapter 30](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#001)

[Proverbs 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 30:1</span></span>

(Pro. 30:1-33)

This is the title of this chapter (see Introduction).

the prophecy--literally, "the burden" (compare [Isa
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#001); [Zac
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#001)), used for any divine instruction;
not necessarily a prediction, which was only a kind of prophecy ([Ch1
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#027), "a song"). Prophets were
inspired men, who spoke for God to man, or for man to God ([Gen
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#007); [Exo
7:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#014)). Such, also, were the New
Testament prophets. In a general sense, Gad, Nathan, and others were
such, who were divine teachers, though we do not learn that they ever
predicted.

the man spake--literally, "the saying of the man"; an expression used to
denote any solemn and important announcement (compare [Sa2
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#001); [Psa
36:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#001); [Psa
110:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001); [Isa
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#024), &c.). Ithiel and Ucal were
perhaps pupils.

[Proverbs 30:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 30:2</span></span>

brutish--stupid, a strong term to denote his lowly self-estimation; or
he may speak of such as his natural condition, as contrasted with God's
all-seeing comprehensive knowledge and almighty power. The questions of
this clause emphatically deny the attributes mentioned to be those of
any creature, thus impressively strengthening the implied reference of
the former to God (compare [Deu
30:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#012); [Isa
40:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#012); [Eph
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#008)).

[Proverbs 30:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 30:5</span></span>

(Compare [Psa 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#006); [Psa
119:140](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#140)).

[Proverbs 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 30:6</span></span>

Add . . . words--implying that his sole reliance was on God's
all-sufficient teaching.

reprove thee--or, "convict thee"--and so the falsehood will appear.

[Proverbs 30:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 30:7</span></span>

A prayer for exemption from wickedness, and the extremes of poverty and
riches, the two things mentioned. Contentment is implied as desired.

[Proverbs 30:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 30:8</span></span>

vanity--all sorts of sinful acts ([Job
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#011); [Isa
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#018)).

[Proverbs 30:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 30:9</span></span>

be full . . . deny--that is, puffed up by the pride of prosperity.

take the name . . . vain--This is not (Hebrew) the form (compare [Exo
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#007)), but "take" rather denotes
laying violent hold on any thing; that is, lest I assail God's name or
attributes, as justice, mercy, &c., which the poor are tempted to do.

[Proverbs 30:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 30:10</span></span>

Accuse not--Slander not ([Psa 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#007)).

curse . . . guilty--lest, however lowly, he be exasperated to turn on
thee, and your guilt be made to appear.

[Proverbs 30:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 30:11</span></span>

Four kinds of hateful persons--(1) graceless children, (2) hypocrites,
(3) the proud, (4) cruel oppressors (compare on [Pro
30:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#014); [Psa
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#004); [Psa
52:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#002)) --are now illustrated; (1) [Pro
30:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#015), the insatiability of
prodigal children and their fate; (2) [Pro
30:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#017), hypocrisy, or the concealment
of real character; (3 and 4) [Pro
30:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#018), various examples of pride
and oppression.

[Proverbs 30:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 30:15</span></span>

horse leech--supposed by some to be the vampire (a fabulous creature),
as being literally insatiable; but the other subjects mentioned must be
taken as this, comparatively insatiable. The use of a fabulous creature
agreeably to popular notions is not inconsistent with inspiration.

There are three . . . yea, four--(Compare [Pro
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#016)).

[Proverbs 30:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 30:17</span></span>

The eye--for the person, with reference to the use of the organ to
express mockery and contempt, and also as that by which punishment is
received.

the ravens . . . eagles . . . eat--either as dying unnaturally, or being
left unburied, or both.

[Proverbs 30:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 30:18</span></span>

Hypocrisy is illustrated by four examples of the concealment of all
methods or traces of action, and a pertinent example of double dealing
in actual vice is added, that is, the adulterous woman.

[Proverbs 30:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pro 30:20</span></span>

she eateth . . . mouth--that is, she hides the evidences of her shame
and professes innocence.

[Proverbs 30:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 30:21</span></span>

Pride and cruelty, the undue exaltation of those unfit to hold power,
produce those vices which disquiet society (compare [Pro
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#010); [Pro
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#003)).

[Proverbs 30:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 30:23</span></span>

heir . . . mistress--that is, takes her place as a wife ([Gen
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#004)).

[Proverbs 30:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 30:24</span></span>

These verses provide two classes of apt illustrations of various aspects
of the moral world, which the reader is left to apply. By the first
([Pro 30:25-28](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#025)), diligence and
providence are commended; the success of these insignificant animals
being due to their instinctive sagacity and activity, rather than
strength. The other class ([Pro
30:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#030)) provides similes for
whatever is majestic or comely, uniting efficiency with gracefulness.

[Proverbs 30:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">pro 30:26</span></span>

conies--mountain mice, or rabbits.

[Proverbs 30:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">pro 30:28</span></span>

spider--tolerated, even in palaces, to destroy flies.

taketh . . . hands--or, uses with activity the limbs provided for taking
prey.

[Proverbs 30:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">pro 30:32</span></span>

As none can hope, successfully, to resist such a king, suppress even the
thought of an attempt.

lay . . . hand upon thy mouth--"lay" is well supplied ([Jdg
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#019); [Job
29:9](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#009); [Job
40:4](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#004)).

[Proverbs 30:33](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">pro 30:33</span></span>

That is, strife--or other ills, as surely arise from devising evil as
natural effects from natural causes.
