### [1 Chronicles Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#001)

[1 Chronicles 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 22:1</span></span>

DAVID PREPARES FOR BUILDING THE TEMPLE. ([Ch1
22:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#001))

David said, This is the home of the Lord God--By the miraculous sign of
fire from heaven, and perhaps other intimations, David understood it to
be the will of God that the national place of worship should be fixed
there, and he forthwith proceeded to make preparations for the erection
of the temple on that spot.

[1 Chronicles 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch1 22:2</span></span>

David commanded to gather together the strangers--partly the descendants
of the old Canaanites ([Ch2 8:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#007)),
from whom was exacted a tribute of bond service, and partly war captives
([Ch2 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#007)), reserved for the great
work he contemplated.

[1 Chronicles 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 22:6</span></span>

HE INSTRUCTS SOLOMON. ([Ch1 22:6-19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#006))

Then he called for Solomon . . . and charged him--The earnestness and
solemnity of this address creates an impression that it was given a
little before the old king's decease. He unfolded his great and long
cherished plan, enjoined the building of God's house as a sacred duty on
him as his son and successor, and described the resources that were at
command for carrying on the work. The vast amount of personal property
he had accumulated in the precious metals \[[Ch1
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#014)\] must have been spoil taken
from the people he had conquered, and the cities he had sacked.
