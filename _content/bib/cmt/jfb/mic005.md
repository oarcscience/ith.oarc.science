### [Micah Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#001)

[Micah 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mic 5:1</span></span>

THE CALAMITIES WHICH PRECEDE MESSIAH'S ADVENT. HIS KINGDOM, CONQUEST OF
JACOB'S FOES, AND BLESSING UPON HIS PEOPLE. ([Mic
5:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#001))

gather thyself in troops--that is, thou shalt do so, to resist the
enemy. Lest the faithful should fall into carnal security because of the
previous promises, he reminds them of the calamities which are to
precede the prosperity.

daughter of troops--Jerusalem is so called on account of her numerous
troops.

he hath laid siege--the enemy hath.

they shall smite the judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek--the
greatest of insults to an Oriental. Zedekiah, the judge (or king, [Amo
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#003)) of Israel, was loaded with
insults by the Chaldeans; so also the other princes and judges ([Lam
3:30](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#030)). HENGSTENBERG thinks the
expression, "the judge," marks a time when no king of the house of David
reigned. The smiting on the cheek of other judges of Israel was a type
of the same indignity offered to Him who nevertheless is the Judge, not
only of Israel, but also of the world, and who is "from everlasting"
([Mic 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#002); [Isa
50:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#006); [Mat
26:67](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#067); [Mat
27:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#030)).

[Micah 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mic 5:2</span></span>

Beth-lehem Ephratah-- ([Gen 48:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#007)), or,
Beth-lehem Judah; so called to distinguish it from Beth-lehem in
Zebulun. It is a few miles southwest of Jerusalem. Beth-lehem means "the
house of bread"; Ephratah means "fruitful": both names referring to the
fertility of the region.

though thou be little among--though thou be scarcely large enough to be
reckoned among, &c. It was insignificant in size and population; so that
in [Jos 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#021), &c., it is not
enumerated among the cities of Judah; nor in the list in [Neh
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#025), &c. Under Rehoboam it became a
city: [Ch2 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#006), "He built
Beth-lehem." [Mat 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#006) seems to
contradict Micah, "thou art not the least," But really he, by an
independent testimony of the Spirit, confirms the prophet, Little in
worldly importance, thou art not least (that is, far from least, yea,
the very greatest) among the thousands, of princes of Judah, in the
spiritual significance of being the birthplace of Messiah ([Joh
7:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#042)). God chooses the little things
of the world to eclipse in glory its greatest things ([Jdg
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#015); [Joh
1:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#046); [Co1
1:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#027)). The low state of David's
line when Messiah was born is also implied here.

thousands--Each tribe was divided into clans or "thousands" (each
thousand containing a thousand families), which had their several heads
or "princes"; hence in [Mat 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#006) it is
quoted "princes," substantially the same as in Micah, and
authoritatively explained in Matthew. It is not so much this thousand
that is preferred to the other thousands of Judah, but the Governor or
Chief Prince out of it, who is preferred to the governors of all the
other thousands. It is called a "town" (rather in the Greek, "village"),
[Joh 7:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#042); though scarcely containing
a thousand inhabitants, it is ranked among the "thousands" or larger
divisions of the tribe, because of its being the cradle of David's line,
and of the Divine Son of David. Moses divided the people into thousands,
hundreds, fifties, and tens, with their respective "rulers" ([Exo
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#025); compare [Sa1
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#019)).

unto me--unto God the Father ([Luk
1:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#032)): to fulfil all the Father's will
and purpose from eternity. So the Son declares ([Psa
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#007); [Psa
40:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#007); [Joh
4:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#034)); and the Father confirms it
([Mat 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#017); [Mat
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#018), compare with [Isa
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001)). God's glory is hereby made the
ultimate end of redemption.

ruler--the "Shiloh," "Prince of peace," "on whose shoulders the
government is laid" ([Gen 49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010); [Isa
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006)). In [Sa2
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#003), "He that ruleth over men must be
just," the same Hebrew word is employed; Messiah alone realizes David's
ideal of a ruler. Also in [Jer 30:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#021),
"their governor shall proceed from the midst of them"; answering closely
to "out of thee shall come forth the ruler," here (compare [Isa
11:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001)).

goings forth . . . from everlasting--The plain antithesis of this
clause, to "come forth out of thee" (from Beth-lehem), shows that the
eternal generation of the Son is meant. The terms convey the strongest
assertion of infinite duration of which the Hebrew language is capable
(compare [Psa 90:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#002); [Pro
8:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#022); [Joh
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001)). Messiah's generation as man
coming forth unto God to do His will on earth is from Beth-lehem; but as
Son of God, His goings forth are from everlasting. The promise of the
Redeemer at first was vaguely general ([Gen
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#015)). Then the Shemitic division of
mankind is declared as the quarter in which He was to be looked for
([Gen 9:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#026)); then it grows clearer,
defining the race and nation whence the Deliverer should come, namely,
the seed of Abraham, the Jews ([Gen
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#003)); then the particular tribe,
Judah ([Gen 49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010)); then the family,
that of David ([Psa 89:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#019)); then
the very town of His birth, here. And as His coming drew nigh, the very
parentage (Mat. 1:1-17; [Luk 1:26-35](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#026);
[Luk 2:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#001)); and then all the
scattered rays of prophecy concentrate in Jesus, as their focus ([Heb
1:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#001)).

[Micah 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mic 5:3</span></span>

"Therefore (because of His settled plan) will God give up to their foes
His people Israel, until," &c.

she which travaileth hath brought forth--namely, "the virgin" mother,
mentioned by Micah's contemporary, [Isa
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014). Zion "in travail" ([Mic
4:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#009)) answers to the virgin in
travail of Messiah. Israel's deliverance from her long travail-pains of
sorrow will synchronize with the appearance oÅ“ Messiah as her Redeemer
([Rom 11:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#026)) in the last days, as the
Church's spiritual deliverance synchronized with the virgin's giving
birth to Him at His first advent. The ancient Church's travail-like
waiting for Messiah is represented by the virgin's travail. Hence, both
may be meant. It cannot be restricted to the Virgin Mary: for Israel is
still "given up," though Messiah has been "brought forth" almost two
thousand years ago. But the Church's throes are included, which are only
to be ended when Christ, having been preached for a witness to all
nations, shall at last appear as the Deliverer of Jacob, and when the
times of the Gentiles shall be fulfilled, and Israel as a nation shall
be born in a day ([Isa 66:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#007); [Luk
21:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#024); [Rev
12:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#001), [Rev
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#004); compare [Rom
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#022)).

the remnant of his brethren shall return unto the children of
Israel--(Compare [Mic 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#007)). The
remainder of the Israelites dispersed in foreign lands shall return to
join their countrymen in Canaan. The Hebrew for "unto" is, literally,
"upon," implying superaddition to those already gathered.

[Micah 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mic 5:4</span></span>

he shall stand--that is, persevere: implying the endurance of His
kingdom \[CALVIN\]. Rather, His sedulous care and pastoral
circumspection, as a shepherd stands erect to survey and guard His flock
on every side ([Isa 61:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#005)) \[MAURER\].

feed--that is, rule: as the Greek word similarly in [Mat
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#006), Margin, means both "feed" and
"rule" ([Isa 40:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#011); [Isa
49:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#010); [Eze
34:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#023); compare [Sa2
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#002); [Sa2
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#008)).

in the majesty of the name of the Lord--possessing the majesty of all
Jehovah's revealed attributes ("name") ([Isa
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#002); [Phi
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006), [Phi
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#009); [Heb
2:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#007)).

his God--God is "His God" in a oneness of relation distinct from the
sense in which God is our God ([Joh
20:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#017)).

they shall abide--the Israelites ("they," namely, the returning remnant
and the "children of Israel previously in Canaan) shall dwell in
permanent security and prosperity ([Mic
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#004); [Isa
14:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#030)).

unto the ends of the earth-- ([Mic
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#001); [Psa
72:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#008); [Zac
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#010)).

[Micah 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mic 5:5</span></span>

this man--in Hebrew simply "This." The One just mentioned; He and He
alone. Emphatical for Messiah (compare [Gen
5:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#029)).

the peace--the fountainhead of peace between God and man, between Israel
and Israel's justly offended God ([Gen
49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010); [Isa
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006); [Eph
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014), [Eph
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#017); [Col
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#020)), and, as the consequence, the
fountain of "peace on earth," where heretofore all is strife ([Mic
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#003); [Hos
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#018); [Zac
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#010); [Luk
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#014)).

the Assyrian--Being Israel's most powerful foe at that time, Assyria is
made the representative of all the foes of Israel in all ages, who shall
receive their final destruction at Messiah's appearing (Eze. 38:1-23).

seven shepherds, and eight--"Seven" expresses perfection; "seven and
eight" is an idiom for a full and sufficient number ([Job
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#019); [Pro
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#016); [Ecc
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#002)).

principal men--literally, "anointed (humble) men" ([Psa
62:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#009)), such as the apostles were.
Their anointing, or consecration and qualification to office, was by the
Holy Spirit \[CALVIN\] ([Jo1 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#020),
[Jo1 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#027)). "Princes" also were
anointed, and they are mentioned as under Messiah ([Isa
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#001)). English Version therefore gives
the probable sense.

[Micah 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mic 5:6</span></span>

waste--literally, "eat up": following up the metaphor of "shepherds"
(compare [Num 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#004); [Jer
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#003)).

land of Nimrod--Babylon ([Mic 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#010);
[Gen 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#010)); or, including Assyria
also, to which he extended his borders ([Gen
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#011)).

in the entrances--the passes into Assyria ([Kg2
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#021)). The Margin and JEROME, misled
by a needless attention to the parallelism, "with the sword," translate,
"with her own naked swords"; as in [Psa
55:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#021) the Hebrew is translated. But
"in the entrances" of Assyria, answers to, "within our borders." As the
Assyrians invade our borders, so shall their own borders or "entrances"
be invaded.

he . . . he--Messiah shall deliver us, when the Assyrian shall come.

[Micah 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mic 5:7</span></span>

remnant of Jacob--already mentioned in [Mic
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#003). It in comparative smallness
stands in antithesis to the "many people." Though Israel be but a
remnant amidst many nations after her restoration, yet she shall
exercise the same blessed influence in quickening them spiritually that
the small imperceptible dew exercises in refreshing the grass ([Deu
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#002); [Psa
72:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#006); [Psa
110:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#003)). The influence of the Jews
restored from Babylon in making many Gentile proselytes is an earnest of
a larger similar effect hereafter ([Isa
66:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#019); [Zac
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#013)).

from the Lord--Israel's restoration and the consequent conversion of the
Gentiles are solely of grace.

tarrieth not for man--entirely God's work, as independent of human
contrivance as the dew and rains that fertilize the soil.

[Micah 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mic 5:8</span></span>

as a lion--In [Mic 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#007) Israel's
benignant influence on the nations is described; but here her vengeance
on the godless hosts who assail her ([Isa
66:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#015), [Isa
66:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#019), [Isa
66:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#024); [Zac
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#003), [Zac
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#006), [Zac
12:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#008); [Zac
14:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#017)). Judah will be "as as lion,"
not in respect to its cruelty, but in its power of striking terror into
all opponents. Under the Maccabees, the Jews acquired Idumea, Samaria,
and parts of the territory of Ammon and Moab \[GROTIUS\]. But this was
only the earnest of their future glory on their coming restoration.

[Micah 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mic 5:9</span></span>

Thine hand shall be lifted up--In [Isa
26:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#011) it is Jehovah's hand that is
lifted up; here Israel's as [Mic 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#008)
implies, just as "Zion" is addressed and directed to "beat in pieces
many people" ([Mic 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#013); compare [Isa
54:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#015), [Isa
54:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#017)). For Israel's foes are
Jehovah's foes. When her hand is said to be lifted up, it is Jehovah's
hand that strikes the foe by her (compare [Exo
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#009), with [Exo
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#008)).

[Micah 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mic 5:10</span></span>

cut off thy horses . . . chariots--namely, those used for the purposes
of war. Israel had been forbidden the use of cavalry, or to go to Egypt
for horses ([Deu 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#016)), lest they
should trust in worldly forces, rather than in God ([Psa
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#007)). Solomon had disregarded this
command ([Kg1 10:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#026), [Kg1
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#028)). Hereafter, saith God, I will
remove these impediments to the free course of My grace: horses,
chariots, &c., on which ye trust. The Church will never be safe, till
she is stripped of all creature trusts, and rests on Jehovah alone
\[CALVIN\]. The universal peace given by God shall cause warlike
instruments to be needless. He will cut them off from Israel ([Zac
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#010)); as she will cut them off from
Babylon, the representative of the nations ([Jer
50:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#037); [Jer
51:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#021)).

[Micah 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mic 5:11</span></span>

cut off . . . cities . . . strongholds--such as are fortified for war.
In that time of peace, men shall live in unwalled villages ([Eze
38:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#011); compare [Jer
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#006); [Jer
49:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#031); [Zac
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#008)).

[Micah 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mic 5:12</span></span>

witchcrafts out of thine hand--that is, which thou now usest.

[Micah 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mic 5:13</span></span>

graven images . . . cut off--(Compare [Isa
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#008), [Isa
2:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#018); [Isa
30:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#022); [Zac
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#002)).

standing images--statues.

[Micah 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mic 5:14</span></span>

groves . . . cities--The "groves" are the idolatrous symbol of Astarte
([Deu 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#021); [Kg2
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#007)). "Cities" being parallel to
"groves," must mean cities in or near which such idolatrous groves
existed. Compare "city of the house of Baal" ([Kg2
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#025)), that is, a portion of the city
sacred to Baal.

[Micah 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mic 5:15</span></span>

vengeance . . . such as they have not heard--or, as the Hebrew order
favors, "the nations that have not hearkened to My warnings." So the
Septuagint ([Psa 149:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#007)).
