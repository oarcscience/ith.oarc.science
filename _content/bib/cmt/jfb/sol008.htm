It refers to the time after His resurrection, when the previous outward intimacy with Him was no longer allowed, but it was implied it should be renewed at the second coming (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#017">Joh 20:17</A>). For this the Church here prays; meanwhile she enjoys inward spiritual communion with Him. The last who ever "kissed" Jesus Christ on earth was the traitor Judas. The bride's return with the King to her mother's house answers to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#025">Act 8:25</A>, after the mission to Samaria. The rest spoken of (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#004">Sol 8:4</A>) answers to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#031">Act 9:31</A>.

<p>spiced wine--seasoned with aromatic perfumes. Jesus Christ ought to have our choicest gifts. Spices are never introduced in the song in His absence; therefore the time of His return from "the mountain of spices" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#014">Sol 8:14</A>) is contemplated. The cup of betrothal was given by Him at the last supper; the cup or marriage shall be presented by her at His return (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#029">Mat 26:29</A>). Till then the believer often cannot feel towards, or speak of, Him as he would wish.

The broken, longing close, like that of the whole Bible (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#020">Rev 22:20</A>), reminds us we are to be waiting for a Saviour to come.

<p>
<p>I raised thee . . . she . . . bare thee-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#014">Act 26:14-16</A>). The first words of Jesus Christ to the bride since her going to the garden of nuts (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#009">Sol 6:9-10</A>); so His appearance to Paul is the only one since His ascension, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#013">Sol 8:13</A> is not an address of Him as visible: her reply implies He is not visible (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#008">Co1 15:8</A>). Spiritually, she was found in the moral wilderness (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#005">Eze 16:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#005">Hos 13:5</A>); but now she is "coming up from" it (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#002">Jer 2:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#014">Hos 2:14</A>), especially in the last stage of her journey, her conscious weakness casting itself the more wholly on Jesus Christ (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#009">Co2 12:9</A>). "Raised" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#001">Eph 2:1-7</A>). Found ruined under the forbidden tree (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#022">Gen 3:22-24</A>); restored under the shadow of Jesus Christ crucified, "the green tree" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#031">Luk 23:31</A>), fruit-"bearing" by the cross (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#011">Isa 53:11</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#024">Joh 12:24</A>). "Born again by the Holy Ghost" "there" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#003">Eze 16:3-6</A>). In this verse, her dependence, in the similar verse, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#006">Sol 3:6</A>, &amp;c., His omnipotence to support her, are brought out (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#026">Deu 33:26</A>).

His Holy Priesthood also in heaven (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#006">Exo 28:6-12</A>, Exo. 28:15-30; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#014">Heb 4:14</A>); "his heart" there answering to "thine heart" here, and "two shoulders" to "arm." (Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#024">Jer 22:24</A>, with <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#023">Hag 2:23</A>). But the Holy Ghost (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#013">Eph 1:13-14</A>). As in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#005">Sol 8:5</A>, she was "leaning" on Him, that is, her arm on His arm, her head on His bosom; so she prays now that before they part, her impression may be engraven both on His heart and His arm, answering to His love and His power (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#015">Psa 77:15</A>; see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#018">Gen 38:18</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#003">Isa 62:3</A>).

<p>jealousy . . . the grave--Zealous love, jealous of all that would come between the soul and Jesus Christ (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#010">Kg1 19:10</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#030">Psa 106:30-31</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#060">Luk 9:60</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#026">Luk 14:26</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#022">Co1 16:22</A>). 
<p>
<p>cruel--rather, "unyielding" hard, as the grave will not let go those whom it once holds (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#028">Joh 10:28</A>). 
<p>
<p>a most vehement flame--literally, "the fire-flame of Jehovah" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#016">Psa 80:16</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#006">Isa 6:6</A>).

<p>
<p>if . . . give all the substance . . . contemned--Nothing short of Jesus Christ Himself, not even heaven without Him, can satisfy the saint (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#008">Phi 3:8</A>). Satan offers the world, as to Jesus Christ (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#008">Mat 4:8</A>), so to the saint, in vain (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#015">Jo1 2:15-17</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#004">Jo1 5:4</A>).

Now first idolatrous Gentiles are admitted directly (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#017">Act 11:17-26</A>). Generally, the saint's anxiety for other souls (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#019">Mar 5:19</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#028">Joh 4:28-29</A>). 
<p>
<p>no breasts--neither faith nor love as yet (see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#005">Sol 4:5</A>), which "come by hearing" of Him who first loved us. Not yet fit to be His bride, and mother of a spiritual offspring. 
<p>
<p>what shall we do--the chief question in the early Church at the first council (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#023">Act 15:23-29</A>). How shall "the elder brother" treat the "younger," already received by the Father (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#025">Luk 15:25-32</A>)? Generally (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#015">Sa2 15:15</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#004">Joh 9:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#006">Act 9:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#010">Gal 6:10</A>).

If she be a wall in Zion, founded on Jesus Christ (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#011">Co1 3:11</A>), we will not "withstand God" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#017">Act 11:17</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#008">Act 15:8-11</A>).

Image from the splendid turrets "built" on the "walls" of Jerusalem, and flanking the "door," or gateway. The Gentile Church is the "door," the type of catholic accessibleness (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#009">Co1 16:9</A>); but it must be not a mere thoroughfare but furnished with a wooden framework, so as not merely to admit, but also to safely enclose: cedar is fragrant, beautiful, and enduring.

<p>favour--rather, "peace." The Gentile Church too is become the Shulamite (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#013">Sol 6:13</A>), or peace-enjoying bride of Solomon, that is, Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#001">Rom 5:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014">Eph 2:14</A>).

Her voice in prayer and praise is to be heard continually by Jesus Christ, if her voice before men is to be effective (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#014">Sol 2:14</A>, end; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#004">Act 6:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#002">Act 13:2-3</A>).

As she began with longing for His first coming (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#002">Sol 1:2</A>), so she ends with praying for His second coming (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#006">Psa 130:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#020">Phi 3:20-21</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#020">Rev 22:20</A>). MOODY STUART makes the roe upon spices to be the musk deer. As there are four gardens, so four mountains, which form not mere images, as Gilead, Carmel, &amp;c., but part of the structure of the Song: (1) Bether, or division (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#017">Sol 2:17</A>), God's justice dividing us from God. (2) Those "of leopards" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#008">Sol 4:8</A>), sin, the world, and Satan. (3) That "of myrrh and aloes" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#006">Sol 4:6</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#014">Sol 4:14</A>), the sepulchre of Calvary. (4) Those "of spices," here answering to "the hill of frankincense" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#006">Sol 4:6</A>), where His soul was for the three days of His death, and heaven, where He is a High Priest now, offering incense for us on the fragrant mountain of His own finished work (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#014">Heb 4:14</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#025">Heb 7:25</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#003">Rev 8:3-4</A>); thus He surmounts the other three mountains, God's justice, our sin, death. The mountain of spices is as much greater than our sins, as heaven is higher than earth (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#011">Psa 103:11</A>). The abrupt, unsatisfied close with the yearning prayer for His visible coming shows that the marriage is future, and that to wait eagerly for it is our true attitude (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#007">Co1 1:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#010">Th1 1:10</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#013">Tit 2:13</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#012">Pe2 3:12</A>).
