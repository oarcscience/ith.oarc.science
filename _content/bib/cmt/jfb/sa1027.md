### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#001)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 27:1</span></span>

SAUL HEARING THAT DAVID WAS FLED TO GATH, SEEKS NO MORE FOR HIM. ([Sa1
27:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#001))

David said in his heart, . . . there is nothing better for me than that
I should speedily escape into the land of the Philistines--This
resolution of David's was, in every respect, wrong: (1) It was removing
him from the place where the divine oracle intimated him to remain ([Sa1
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#005)); (2) It was rushing into the
idolatrous land, for driving him into which he had denounced an
imprecation on his enemies ([Sa1
26:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#019)); (3) It was a withdrawal of his
counsel and aid from God's people. It was a movement, however, overruled
by Providence to detach him from his country and to let the disasters
impending over Saul and his followers be brought on by the Philistines.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 27:2</span></span>

Achish, the son of Maoch, king of Gath--The popular description of this
king's family creates a presumption that he was a different king from
the reigning sovereign on David's first visit to Gath. Whether David had
received a special invitation from him or a mere permission to enter his
territories, cannot be determined. It is probable that the former was
the case. From the universal notoriety given to the feud between Saul
and David, which had now become irreconcilable, it might appear to
Achish good policy to harbor him as a guest, and so the better pave the
way for the hostile measures against Israel which the Philistines were
at this time meditating.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 27:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa1 27:5</span></span>

DAVID BEGS ZIKLAG OF ACHISH. ([Sa1
27:5-12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#005))

let them give me a place in some town in the country--It was a prudent
arrangement on the part of David; for it would prevent him being an
object of jealous suspicion, or of mischievous plots among the
Philistines. It would place his followers more beyond the risk of
contamination by the idolatries of the court and capital; and it would
give him an opportunity of making reprisals on the freebooting tribes
that infested the common border of Israel and the Philistines.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 27:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 27:6</span></span>

Ziklag--Though originally assigned to Judah ([Jos
15:31](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#031)), and subsequently to Simeon
([Jos 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#005)), this town had never been
possessed by the Israelites. It belonged to the Philistines, who gave it
to David.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 27:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa1 27:8</span></span>

David . . . went up, and invaded the Geshurites--(See [Jos
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#002)).

and the Gezrites--or the Gerizi \[GESENIUS\], ([Jos
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#012)), some Arab horde which had once
encamped there.

and the Amalekites--Part of the district occupied by them lay on the
south of the land of Israel ([Jdg
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#014); [Jdg
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#015)).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 27:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa1 27:10</span></span>

Achish said, Whither have ye made a road to-day?--that is, raid, a
hostile excursion for seizing cattle and other booty.

David said, Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the
Jerahmeelites--Jerahmeel was the great-grandson of Judah, and his
posterity occupied the southern portion of that tribal domain.

the south of the Kenites--the posterity of Jethro, who occupied the
south of Judah ([Jdg 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#016); [Num
24:21](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#021)). The deceit practised upon his
royal host and the indiscriminate slaughter committed, lest any one
should escape to tell the tale, exhibit an unfavorable view of this part
of David's history.
