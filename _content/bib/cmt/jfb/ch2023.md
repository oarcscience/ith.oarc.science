### [2 Chronicles Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 23:1</span></span>

JEHOIADA MAKES JOASH KING. ([Ch2
23:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#001))

in the seventh year Jehoiada . . . took the captains of hundreds,
&c.--(See on [Kg2 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#004); [Kg2
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#017)). The five officers mentioned
here had been probably of the royal guard, and were known to be strongly
disaffected to the government of Athaliah.

[2 Chronicles 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 23:2</span></span>

chief of all the fathers of Israel--This name is frequently used in
Chronicles for Judah and Benjamin, now all that remained of Israel.
Having cautiously entrusted the secret of the young prince's
preservation to all the leading men in the kingdom, he enlisted their
interest in the royal cause and got their pledge to support it by a
secret oath of fidelity.

they came to Jerusalem--The time chosen for the grand discovery was,
probably, one of the annual festivals, when there was a general
concourse of the nation at the capital.

[2 Chronicles 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch2 23:4</span></span>

This is the thing that ye shall do--The arrangements made for defense
are here described. The people were divided into three bodies; one
attended as guards to the king, while the other two were posted at all
the doors and gates, and the captains and military officers who entered
the temple unarmed to lull suspicion, were furnished with weapons out of
the sacred armory, where David had deposited his trophies of victory and
which was reopened on this occasion.

[2 Chronicles 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch2 23:8</span></span>

Jehoiada . . . dismissed not the courses--As it was necessary to have as
large a disposable force as he could command on such a crisis, the high
priest detained those who, in other circumstances, would have returned
home on the expiry of their week of service.

[2 Chronicles 23:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 23:11</span></span>

Then they brought out the king's son, and put upon him the crown, and
gave him the testimony--Some think that the original word rendered
"testimony," as its derivation warrants, may signify here the regalia,
especially the bracelet ([Sa2 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#010));
and this view they support on the ground that "gave him" being
supplemented, the text properly runs thus, "put upon him the crown and
testimony." At the same time, it seems equally pertinent to take "the
testimony" in the usual acceptation of that term; and, accordingly, many
are of opinion that a roll containing a copy of the law ([Deu
17:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#018)) was placed in the king's hands,
which he held as a scepter or truncheon. Others, referring to a custom
of Oriental people, who when receiving a letter or document from a
highly respected quarter, lift it up to their heads before opening it,
consider that Joash, besides the crown, had the book of the law laid
upon his head (see [Job 31:35-36](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#035)).

God save the king--literally, "Long live the king."

[2 Chronicles 23:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch2 23:12</span></span>

ATHALIAH SLAIN. ([Ch2 23:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#012))

Athaliah heard the noise of the people--The unusual commotion, indicated
by the blast of the trumpets and the vehement acclamations of the
people, drew her attention, or excited her fears. She might have
flattered herself that, having slain all the royal family, she was in
perfect security; but it is just as likely that, finding on reflection,
one had escaped her murderous hands, she might not deem it expedient to
institute any enquiries; but the very idea would keep her constantly in
a state of jealous suspicion and irritation. In that state of mind, the
wicked usurper, hearing across the TyropÅ“on the outburst of popular
joy, rushed across the bridge to the temple grounds, and, penetrating
from a single glance the meaning of the whole scene, raised a shriek of
"Treason!"

[2 Chronicles 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch2 23:13</span></span>

behold, the king stood at his pillar at the entering in--The king's
pillar was in the people's court, opposite that of the priests'. The
young king, arrayed in the royal insignia, had been brought out of the
inner, to stand forth in the outer court, to the public view. Some think
that he stood on the brazen scaffold of Solomon, erected beside the
pillar \[see on [Ch2 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#013)\].

[2 Chronicles 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 23:14</span></span>

Slay her not in the house of the Lord . . . and when she was come to the
entering of the horse gate by the king's house, they slew her there--The
high priest ordered her immediately to be taken out of the temple
grounds and put to death. "And they laid hands on her; and she went by
the way by the which horses came into the king's house: and there was
she slain" ([Kg2 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#016)). "Now, we are
not to suppose that horses came into \[the king's house\] of residence,
but into the king's (horses') house or hippodrome (the gate of the
king's mules) \[JOSEPHUS\], he had built for them on the southeast of
the temple, in the immediate vicinity of the horse gate in the valley of
Kedron--a valley which was at that time a kind of desecrated place by
the destruction of idols and their appurtenances" ([Kg2
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#002), [Kg2
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#006), [Kg2
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#012)) \[BARCLAY, City of the Great
King\].

[2 Chronicles 23:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch2 23:16</span></span>

JEHOIADA RESTORES THE WORSHIP OF GOD, AND SETTLES THE KING. ([Ch2
23:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#016))

Jehoiada made a covenant--(See on [Kg2
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#017)).
