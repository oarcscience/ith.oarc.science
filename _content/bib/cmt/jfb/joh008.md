### [John Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#001)

[John 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 8:1</span></span>

THE WOMAN TAKEN IN ADULTERY. ([Joh
8:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#001))

Jesus went unto the Mount of Olives--This should have formed the last
verse of the foregoing chapter. "The return of the people to the inert
quiet and security of their dwellings ([Joh
7:53](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#053)), at the close of the feast, is
designedly contrasted with our Lord's homeless way, so to speak, of
spending the short night, who is early in the morning on the scene
again. One cannot well see why what is recorded in [Luk
21:37-38](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#037) may not even thus early have
taken place; it might have been the Lord's ordinary custom from the
beginning to leave the brilliant misery of the city every night, that so
He might compose His sorrowful and interceding heart, and collect His
energies for new labors of love; preferring for His resting-place
Bethany, and the Mount of Olives, the scene thus consecrated by many
preparatory prayers for His final humiliation and exaltation" \[STIER\].

[John 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 8:3</span></span>

scribes and Pharisees--foiled in their yesterday's attempt, and hoping
to succeed better in this.

[John 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">joh 8:4</span></span>

woman . . . in adultery . . . Moses . . . commanded . . . should be
stoned--simply put to death ([Deu
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#022)), but in aggravated cases, at
least in later times, this was probably by stoning ([Eze
16:40](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#040)).

but what sayest thou--hoping, whatever He might answer, to put Him in
the wrong:--if He said, Stone her, that would seem a stepping out of His
province; if He forbade it, that would hold Him up as a relaxer of the
public morals. But these cunning hypocrites were overmatched.

[John 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joh 8:6</span></span>

stooped down--It will be observed He was sitting when they came to Him.

with his finger wrote on the ground--The words of our translators in
italics ("as though He heard them not") have hardly improved the sense,
for it is scarcely probable He could wish that to be thought. Rather He
wished to show them His aversion to enter on the subject. But as this
did not suit them, they "continue asking Him," pressing for an answer.
At last, raising Himself He said.

[John 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">joh 8:7</span></span>

He that is without sin--not meaning sinless altogether; nor yet,
guiltless of a literal breach of the Seventh Commandment; but probably,
he whose conscience acquits him of any such sin.

cast a stone--"the stone," meaning the first one ([Deu
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#007)).

[John 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">joh 8:8</span></span>

again he stooped down and wrote--The design of this second stooping and
writing on the ground was evidently to give her accusers an opportunity
to slink away unobserved by Him, and so avoid an exposure to His eye
which they could ill have stood. Accordingly it is added.

[John 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">joh 8:9</span></span>

they . . . convicted . . . went out one by one . . . Jesus was left
alone--that is, without one of her accusers remaining; for it is added.

the woman in the midst--that is, of the remaining audience. While the
trap failed to catch Him for whom it was laid, it caught those who laid
it. Stunned by the unexpected home thrust, they immediately made
off--which makes the impudence of those impure hypocrites in dragging
such a case before the public eye the more disgusting.

[John 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">joh 8:10</span></span>

Woman, &c.--What inimitable tenderness and grace! Conscious of her own
guilt, and till now in the hands of men who had talked of stoning her,
wondering at the skill with which her accusers had been dispersed, and
the grace of the few words addressed to herself, she would be disposed
to listen, with a reverence and teachableness before unknown, to our
Lord's admonition. "And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee,
go and sin no more." He pronounces no pardon upon the woman (such as,
"Thy sins are forgiven thee" \[compare [Luk
5:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#028); [Luk
7:48](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#048)\] --"Go in peace" \[compare [Mar
5:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#034); [Luk
7:50](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#050); [Luk
8:48](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#048)\]), much less does He say that
she had done nothing condemnable; He simply leaves the matter where it
was. He meddles not with the magistrate's office, nor acts the Judge in
any sense ([Joh 12:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#047)). But in saying,
"Go and sin no more," which had been before said to one who undoubtedly
believed ([Joh 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#014)), more is probably
implied than expressed. If brought suddenly to conviction of sin,
admiration of her Deliverer, and a willingness to be admonished and
guided by Him, this call to begin a new life may have carried with it
what would ensure and naturally bring about a permanent change. (This
whole narrative is wanting in some of the earliest and most valuable
manuscripts, and those which have it vary to some extent. The internal
evidence in its favor is almost overpowering. It is easy to account for
its omission, though genuine; but if not so, it is next to impossible to
account for its insertion).

[John 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">joh 8:12</span></span>

FURTHER DISCOURSES OF JESUS--ATTEMPT TO STONE HIM. (John 8:12-59)

I am the light of the world--As the former references to water ([Joh
4:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#013); [Joh
7:37-39](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#037)) and to bread ([Joh
6:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#035)) were occasioned by outward
occurrences, so this one to light. In "the treasury" where it was spoken
(see on [Joh 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#020)) stood two colossal
golden lamp-stands, on which hung a multitude of lamps, lighted after
the evening sacrifice (probably every evening during the feast of
tabernacles), diffusing their brilliancy, it is said, over all the city.
Around these the people danced with great rejoicing. Now, as amidst the
festivities of the water from Siloam Jesus cried, saying, "If any man
thirst, let him come unto me and drink," so now amidst the blaze and the
joyousness of this illumination, He proclaims, "I AM THE LIGHT OF THE
WORLD"--plainly in the most absolute sense. For though He gives His
disciples the same title, they are only "light in the Lord" ([Eph
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#008)); and though He calls the Baptist
"the burning and shining light" (or "lamp" of his day, [Joh
5:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#035)), yet "he was not that Light, but
was sent to bear witness of that Light: that was THE TRUE LIGHT which,
coming into the world, lighteth every man" ([Joh
1:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#008)). Under this magnificent title
Messiah was promised of old ([Isa
42:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#006); [Mal
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#002), &c.).

he that followeth me--as one does a light going before him, and as the
Israelites did the pillar of bright cloud in the wilderness.

but shall have the light of life--the light, as of a new world, a newly
awakened spiritual and eternal life.

[John 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">joh 8:13</span></span>

bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true--How does He meet this
specious cavil? Not by disputing the wholesome human maxim that
"self-praise is no praise," but by affirming that He was an exception to
the rule, or rather, that it had no application to Him.

[John 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joh 8:14</span></span>

for I know whence I came, and whither I go, &c.--(See on [Joh
7:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#028)).

[John 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joh 8:15</span></span>

Ye judge after the flesh--with no spiritual apprehension.

I judge no man.

[John 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joh 8:16</span></span>

And yet if I judge, my judgment is true, &c.--Ye not only form your
carnal and warped judgments of Me, but are bent on carrying them into
effect; I, though I form and utter My judgment of you, am not here to
carry this into execution--that is reserved to a future day; yet the
judgment I now pronounce and the witness I now bear is not Mine only as
ye suppose, but His also that sent Me. (See on [Joh
5:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#031)). And these are the two
witnesses to any fact which your law requires.

[John 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">joh 8:20</span></span>

These words spake Jesus in the treasury--a division, so called, of the
fore court of the temple, part of the court of the women \[JOSEPHUS,
Antiquities, 19.6.2, &c.\], which may confirm the genuineness of [Joh
8:2-11](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#002), as the place where the woman
was brought.

no man laid hands on him, &c.--(See on [Joh
7:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#030)). In the dialogue that follows,
the conflict waxes sharper on both sides, till rising to its climax,
they take up stones to stone him.

[John 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">joh 8:21</span></span>

Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, &c.--(See on [Joh
7:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#033)).

[John 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joh 8:22</span></span>

Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself?--seeing something more in His
words than before ([Joh 7:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#035)), but
their question more malignant and scornful.

[John 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">joh 8:23</span></span>

Ye are from beneath; I am from above--contrasting Himself, not as in
[Joh 3:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#031), simply with earthborn
messengers of God, but with men sprung from and breathing an opposite
element from His, which rendered it impossible that He and they should
have any present fellowship, or dwell eternally together. (Again see on
[Joh 7:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#033); also see on [Joh
8:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#044)).

[John 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">joh 8:24</span></span>

if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins--They knew
well enough what He meant ([Mar 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#006),
Greek; compare [Mat 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#005)). But He
would not, by speaking it out, give them the materials for a charge for
which they were watching. At the same time, one is irresistibly reminded
by such language, so far transcending what is becoming in men, of those
ancient declarations of the God of Israel, "I AM HE" ([Deu
32:39](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#039); [Isa
43:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#010), [Isa
43:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#013); [Isa
46:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#004); [Isa
48:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#012)). See on [Joh
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#020).

[John 8:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">joh 8:25</span></span>

Who art thou?--hoping thus to extort an explicit answer; but they are
disappointed.

[John 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">joh 8:26</span></span>

I have many things to say and to judge of you; but he that sent me is
true, &c.--that is, I could, and at the fitting time, will say and judge
many things of you (referring perhaps to the work of the Spirit which is
for judgment as well as salvation, [Joh
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#008)), but what I do say is just the
message My Father hath given Me to deliver.

[John 8:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">joh 8:28</span></span>

When ye have lifted up the Son of man--The plainest intimation He had
yet given in public of the manner and the authors of His death.

then shall ye know that I am he, &c.--that is, find out, or have
sufficient evidence, how true was all He said, though they would be far
from owning it.

[John 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">joh 8:29</span></span>

the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that
please him, &c.--that is, To you, who gnash upon Me with your teeth, and
frown down all open appearance for Me, I seem to stand uncountenanced
and alone; but I have a sympathy and support transcending all human
applause; I came hither to do My Father's will, and in the doing of it
have not ceased to please Him; therefore is He ever by Me with His
approving smile, His cheering words, His supporting arm.

[John 8:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">joh 8:30</span></span>

As he spake these words, many believed on him--Instead of wondering at
this, the wonder would be if words of such unearthly, surpassing
grandeur could be uttered without captivating some that heard them. And
just as "all that sat in the council" to try Stephen "saw his
face"--though expecting nothing but death--"as it had been the face of
an angel" ([Act 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#015)), so may we
suppose that, full of the sweet supporting sense of His Father's
presence, amidst the rage and scorn of the rulers, a divine benignity
beamed from His countenance, irradiated the words that fell from Him,
and won over the candid "many" of His audience.

[John 8:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">joh 8:31</span></span>

Then said Jesus to those Jews who believed, If ye continue in my word,
then are ye my disciples indeed, &c.--The impression produced by the
last words of our Lord may have become visible by some decisive
movement, and here He takes advantage of it to press on them
"continuance" in the faith, since then only were they His real disciples
(compare [Joh 15:3-8](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#003)), and then should
they experimentally "know the truth," and "by the truth be made
(spiritually) free."

[John 8:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">joh 8:33</span></span>

They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to
any man, &c.--Who said this? Not surely the very class just spoken of as
won over by His divine words, and exhorted to continue in them. Most
interpreters seem to think so; but it is hard to ascribe such a petulant
speech to the newly gained disciples, even in the lowest sense, much
less persons so gained as they were. It came, probably, from persons
mixed up with them in the same part of the crowd, but of a very
different spirit. The pride of the Jewish nation, even now after
centuries of humiliation, is the most striking feature of their
character. "Talk of freedom to us? Pray when or to whom were we ever in
bondage?" This bluster sounds almost ludicrous from such a nation. Had
they forgotten their long and bitter bondage in Egypt? their dreary
captivity in Babylon? their present bondage to the Roman yoke, and their
restless eagerness to throw it off? But probably they saw that our Lord
pointed to something else--freedom, perhaps, from the leaders of sects
or parties--and were not willing to allow their subjection even to
these. Our Lord, therefore, though He knew what slaves they were in this
sense, drives the ploughshare somewhat deeper than this, to a bondage
they little dreamt of.

[John 8:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">joh 8:34</span></span>

Whosoever committeth sin--that is, liveth in the commission of
it--(Compare [Jo1 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#008); [Mat
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#023)).

is the servant of sin--that is, the bond-servant, or slave of it; for
the question is not about free service, but who are in bondage. (Compare
[Pe2 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#019); [Rev
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#016)). The great truth here expressed
was not unknown to heathen moralists; but it was applied only to vice,
for they were total strangers to what in revealed religion is called
sin. The thought of slaves and freemen in the house suggests to our Lord
a wider idea.

[John 8:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">joh 8:35</span></span>

And the servant abideth not in the house for ever, but the Son abideth
ever--that is, "And if your connection with the family of God be that of
BOND-SERVANTS, ye have no natural tie to the house; your tie is
essentially uncertain and precarious. But the SON'S relationship to the
FATHER is a natural and essential one; it is an indefeasible tie; His
abode in it is perpetual and of right: That is My relationship, My tie:
If, then, ye would have your connection with God's family made real,
rightful, permanent, ye must by the Son be manumitted and adopted as
sons and daughters of the Lord Almighty." In this sublime statement
there is no doubt a subordinate allusion to [Gen
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#010), "Cast out this bondwoman and
her son, for the son of this bond-woman shall not be heir with my son,
with Isaac." (Compare [Gal 4:22-30](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#022)).

[John 8:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">joh 8:37</span></span>

ye seek to kill me--He had said this to their face before: He now
repeats it, and they do not deny it; yet are they held back, as by some
marvellous spell--it was the awe which His combined dignity, courage,
and benignity struck into them.

because my word hath no place in you--When did ever human prophet so
speak of His words? They tell us of "the word of the Lord" coming to
them. But here is One who holds up "His word" as that which ought to
find entrance and abiding room for itself in the souls of all who hear
it.

[John 8:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">joh 8:38</span></span>

my Father . . . your father--(See on [Joh
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#023)).

[John 8:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">joh 8:39</span></span>

If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham--He had
just said He "knew they were Abraham's children," that is, according to
the flesh; but the children of his faith and holiness they were not, but
the reverse.

[John 8:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">joh 8:40</span></span>

this did not Abraham--In so doing ye act in direct opposition to him.

[John 8:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">joh 8:41</span></span>

We be not born of fornication . . . we have one Father, God--meaning, as
is generally allowed, that they were not an illegitimate race in point
of religion, pretending only to be God's people, but were descended from
His own chosen Abraham.

[John 8:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">joh 8:42</span></span>

If God were your Father, ye would love me--"If ye had anything of His
moral image, as children have their father's likeness, ye would love Me,
for I am immediately of Him and directly from Him." But "My speech"
(meaning His peculiar style of expressing Himself on these subjects) is
unintelligible to you because ye cannot take in the truth which it
conveys.

[John 8:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">joh 8:44</span></span>

Ye are of your father the devil--"This is one of the most decisive
testimonies to the objective (outward) personality of the devil. It is
quite impossible to suppose an accommodation to Jewish views, or a
metaphorical form of speech, in so solemn an assertion as this"
\[ALFORD\].

the lusts of your father--his impure, malignant, ungodly propensities,
inclinations, desires.

ye will do--are willing to do; not of any blind necessity of nature, but
of pure natural inclination.

He was a murderer from the beginning--The reference is not to Cain (as
LOCKE, DE WETTE, ALFORD, &c.), but to Adam \[GROTIUS, CALVIN, MEYER,
LUTHARDT, &c.\]. The death of the human race, in its widest sense, is
ascribed to the murderous seducer of our race.

and abode not in the truth--As, strictly speaking, the word means
"abideth," it has been denied that the fall of Satan from a former holy
state is here expressed \[LOCKE, &c.\], and some superior interpreters
think it only implied \[OLSHAUSEN, &c.\]. But though the form of the
thought is present--not past--this is to express the important idea,
that his whole character and activity are just a continual aberration
from his own original truth or rectitude; and thus his fall is not only
the implied basis of the thought, but part of the statement itself,
properly interpreted and brought out.

no truth in him--void of all that holy, transparent rectitude which, as
His creature, he originally possessed.

When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own--perhaps his own
resources, treasures ([Mat 12:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#035))
\[ALFORD\]. (The word is plural). It means that he has no temptation to
it from without; it is purely self-begotten, springing from a nature
which is nothing but obliquity.

the father of it--that is, of lying: all the falsehood in the world owes
its existence to him. What a verse is this! It holds up the devil (1) as
the murderer of the human race; but as this is meant here in the more
profound sense of spiritual death, it holds him up, (2) as the spiritual
parent of this fallen human family, communicating to his offspring his
own evil passions and universal obliquity, and stimulating these into
active exercise. But as there is "a stronger than he," who comes upon
him and overcomes him ([Luk 11:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#021)),
it is only such as "love the darkness," who are addressed as children of
the devil ([Mat 13:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#038); [Jo1
3:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#008)).

[John 8:45](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#045)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">joh 8:45</span></span>

And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not--not although, but
just because He did so, for the reason given in the former verse. Had He
been less true they would have hailed Him more readily.

[John 8:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#046)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">joh 8:46</span></span>

Which of you convinceth me of sin--"Convicteth," bringeth home a charge
of sin. Glorious dilemma! "Convict Me of sin, and reject Me: If not, why
stand ye out against My claims?" Of course, they could only be supposed
to impeach His life; but in One who had already passed through
unparalleled complications, and had continually to deal with friends and
foes of every sort and degree, such a challenge thrown wide among His
bitterest enemies, can amount to nothing short of a claim to absolute
sinlessness.

[John 8:48](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#048)

Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?--What
intense and virulent scorn! (See [Heb
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#003)). The "say we not well" refers to
[Joh 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#020). "A Samaritan" means more
than "no Israelite at all"; it means one who pretended, but had no
manner of claim to the title--retorting perhaps, this denial of their
true descent from Abraham.

[John 8:49](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#049)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">joh 8:49</span></span>

Jesus answered, I have not a devil--What calm dignity is here! Verily,
"when reviled, He reviled not again" ([Pe1
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#023)). Compare Paul ([Act
26:25](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#025)), "I am not mad," &c. He adds
not, "Nor am I a Samaritan," that He might not even seem to partake of
their contempt for a race that had already welcomed Him as the Christ,
and began to be blessed by Him.

I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me--the language of wounded
feeling. But the interior of His soul at such moments is only to be seen
in such prophetic utterances as these, "For thy sake I have borne
reproach; shame hath covered my face; I am become a stranger unto my
brethren, an alien unto my mother's children. For the zeal of thine
house hath eaten me up, and the reproaches of them that reproached thee
are fallen upon me" ([Psa 69:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#007)).

[John 8:50](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#050)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">joh 8:50</span></span>

I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh--that is,
evidently, "that seeketh My glory"; requiring "all men to honor the Son
even as they honor the Father"; judicially treating him "who honoreth
not the Son as honoring not the Father that hath sent Him" ([Joh
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#023); and compare [Mat
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#005)); but giving to Him ([Joh
6:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#037)) such as will yet cast their
crowns before His throne, in whom He "shall see of the travail of his
soul, and be satisfied" ([Isa 53:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#011)).

[John 8:51](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#051)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">joh 8:51</span></span>

If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death--Partly thus
vindicating His lofty claims as Lord of the kingdom of life everlasting,
and, at the same time, holding out even to His revilers the scepter of
grace. The word "keep" is in harmony with [Joh
8:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#031), "If ye continue in My word,"
expressing the permanency, as a living and paramount principle, of that
faith to which He referred: "never see death," though virtually uttered
before ([Joh 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#024); [Joh
6:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#040), [Joh
6:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#047), [Joh
6:51](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#051)), is the strongest and most naked
statement of a very glorious truth yet given. (In [Joh
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#026) it is repeated in nearly
identical terms).

[John 8:52](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#052)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">joh 8:52</span></span>

Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil,
&c.--"Thou art now self-convicted; only a demoniac could speak so; the
most illustrious of our fathers are dead, and Thou promisest exemption
from death to anyone who will keep Thy saying! pray, who art Thou?"

[John 8:54](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#054)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">joh 8:54</span></span>

If I honour myself, my honour is nothing, &c.--(See on [Joh
5:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#031), &c.).

[John 8:55](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#055)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_055">joh 8:55</span></span>

I shall be a liar like unto you--now rising to the summit of holy, naked
severity, thereby to draw this long dialogue to a head.

[John 8:56](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#056)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_056">joh 8:56</span></span>

Abraham rejoiced to see my day, &c.--exulted, or exceedingly rejoiced
that he should see, he exulted to see it, that is, by anticipation. Nay,

he saw it, and was glad--he actually beheld it, to his joy. If this mean
no more than that he had a prophetic foresight of the gospel-day--the
second clause just repeating the first--how could the Jews understand
our Lord to mean that He "had seen Abraham?" And if it mean that Abraham
was then beholding, in his disembodied spirit, the incarnate Messiah
\[STIER, ALFORD, &c.\], the words seem very unsuitable to express it. It
expresses something past--"he saw My day, and was glad," that is, surely
while he lived. He seems to refer to the familiar intercourse which
Abraham had with God, who is once and again in the history called "the
Angel of the Lord," and whom Christ here identifies with Himself. On
those occasions, Abraham "saw ME" (OLSHAUSEN, though he thinks the
reference is to some unrecorded scene). If this be the meaning, all that
follows is quite natural.

[John 8:57](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#057)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_057">joh 8:57</span></span>

Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old--"No
inference can be drawn from this as to the age of our Lord at the time
as man. Fifty years was with the Jews the completion of manhood"
\[ALFORD\].

and hast thou seen Abraham?--He had said Abraham saw Him, as being his
peculiar privilege. They give the opposite turn to it--"Hast Thou seen
Abraham?" as an honor too great for Him to pretend to.

[John 8:58](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#058)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_058">joh 8:58</span></span>

Before Abraham was, I am--The words rendered "was" and "am" are quite
different. The one clause means, "Abraham was brought into being"; the
other, "I exist." The statement therefore is not that Christ came into
existence before Abraham did (as Arians affirm is the meaning), but that
He never came into being at all, but existed before Abraham had a being;
in other words, existed before creation, or eternally (as [Joh
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001)). In that sense the Jews plainly
understood Him, since "then took they up stones to cast at Him," just as
they had before done when they saw that He made Himself equal with God
([Joh 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#018)).

hid himself--(See on [Luk 4:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#030)).
