### [Psalms Chapter 66](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#001)

[Psalms 66:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 66:1</span></span>

The writer invites all men to unite in praise, cites some striking
occasions for it, promises special acts of thanksgiving, and celebrates
God's great mercy. (Psa. 66:1-20)

Make . . . noise--or, "Shout."

[Psalms 66:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 66:2</span></span>

his name--as in [Psa 29:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#002).

make his praise glorious--literally, "place honor, His praise," or, "as
to His praise"; that is, let His praise be such as will glorify Him, or,
be honorable to Him.

[Psalms 66:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 66:3</span></span>

A specimen of the praise.

How terrible--(Compare [Psa 65:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#008)).

submit--(Compare Margin), show a forced subjection ([Psa
18:44](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#044)), produced by terror.

[Psalms 66:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 66:5</span></span>

The terrible works illustrated in Israel's history ([Exo
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#021)). By this example let rebels be
admonished.

[Psalms 66:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 66:7</span></span>

behold the nations--watch their conduct.

[Psalms 66:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 66:8</span></span>

Here is, perhaps, cited a case of recent deliverance.

[Psalms 66:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 66:9</span></span>

holdeth . . . in life--literally, "putteth our soul in life"; that is,
out of danger ([Psa 30:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#003); [Psa
49:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#015)).

to be moved--(Compare [Psa 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#006); [Psa
55:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#022)).

[Psalms 66:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 66:10</span></span>

Out of severe trials, God had brought them to safety (compare [Isa
48:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#010); [Pe1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#007)).

[Psalms 66:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 66:11</span></span>

affliction--literally, "pressure," or, as in [Psa
55:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#003), "oppression," which, laid on the

loins--the seat of strength ([Deu
33:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#011)), enfeebles the frame.

[Psalms 66:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 66:12</span></span>

men to ride over our heads--made us to pass.

through fire, &c.--figures describing prostration and critical dangers
(compare [Isa 43:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#002); [Eze
36:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#012)).

wealthy--literally, "overflowing," or, "irrigated," and hence fertile.

[Psalms 66:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 66:13</span></span>

These full and varied offerings constitute the payment of vows ([Lev
22:18-23](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#018)).

[Psalms 66:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 66:15</span></span>

I will offer--literally, "make to ascend," alluding to the smoke of
burnt offering, which explains the use of "incense."

incense--elsewhere always denoting the fumes of aromatics.

[Psalms 66:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 66:16</span></span>

With these he unites his public thanks, inviting those who fear God
([Psa 60:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#004); [Psa
61:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#005), His true worshippers) to hear.
He vindicates his sincerity, inasmuch as God would not hear hypocrites,
but had heard him.

[Psalms 66:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 66:17</span></span>

he was extolled with my tongue--literally, "exaltation (was) under my
tongue," as a place of deposit, whence it proceeded; that is, honoring
God was habitual.

[Psalms 66:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 66:18</span></span>

If I regard iniquity in my heart--literally, "see iniquity with
pleasure."
