### [Ruth Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#001)

[Ruth 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rut 4:1</span></span>

BOAZ CALLS INTO JUDGMENT THE NEXT KINSMAN. ([Rut
4:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#001))

Then went Boaz up to the gate of the city--a roofed building, unenclosed
by walls; the place where, in ancient times, and in many Eastern towns
still, all business transactions are made, and where, therefore, the
kinsman was most likely to be found. No preliminaries were necessary in
summoning one before the public assemblage; no writings and no delay
were required. In a short conversation the matter was stated and
arranged--probably in the morning as people went out, or at noon when
they returned from the field.

[Ruth 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rut 4:2</span></span>

he took ten men of the elders of the city--as witnesses. In ordinary
circumstances, two or three were sufficient to attest a bargain; but in
cases of importance, such as matrimony, divorce, conveyancing of
property, it was the Jewish practice to have ten ([Kg1
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#008)).

[Ruth 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rut 4:3</span></span>

Naomi . . . selleth a parcel of land--that is, entertains the idea of
selling. In her circumstances she was at liberty to part with it ([Lev
25:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#025)). Both Naomi and Ruth had an
interest in the land during their lives; but Naomi alone was mentioned,
not only because she directed all the negotiations, but because the
introduction of Ruth's name would awaken a suspicion of the necessity of
marrying her, before the first proposition was answered.

[Ruth 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rut 4:4</span></span>

there is none to redeem it beside thee; and I am after thee--(See on
[Deu 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#005)). The redemption of the land
of course involved a marriage with Ruth, the widow of the former owner.

[Ruth 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rut 4:6</span></span>

HE REFUSES THE REDEMPTION. ([Rut
4:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#006))

The kinsman said, I cannot redeem it . . ., lest I mar mine own
inheritance--This consequence would follow, either, first, from his
having a son by Ruth, who, though heir to the property, would not bear
his name; his name would be extinguished in that of her former husband;
or, secondly, from its having to be subdivided among his other children,
which he had probably by a previous marriage. This right, therefore, was
renounced and assigned in favor of Boaz, in the way of whose marriage
with Ruth the only existing obstacle was now removed.

[Ruth 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rut 4:7</span></span>

a man plucked off his shoe--Where the kinsman refused to perform his
duty to the family of his deceased relation, the widow was directed to
pull off the shoe with some attendant circumstances of contemptuous
disdain. But, as in this case, there was no refusal, the usual ignominy
was spared; and the plucking off the shoe, the only ceremony observed,
was a pledge of the transaction being completed.

[Ruth 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rut 4:9</span></span>

HE MARRIES RUTH. ([Rut 4:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#009))

Boaz said unto the elders, Ye are witnesses this day, that I have bought
all that was . . . Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of
Naomi--Although the widow of Chilion was still living, no regard was
paid to her in the disposal of her husband's property. From her
remaining in Moab, she was considered to have either been married again,
or to have renounced all right to an inheritance with the family of
Elimelech.

[Ruth 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rut 4:10</span></span>

Ruth the Moabitess . . . have I purchased to be my wife--This connection
Boaz not only might form, since Ruth had embraced the true religion, but
he was under a legal necessity of forming it.

[Ruth 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rut 4:11</span></span>

all the people and the elders, said, We are witnesses--A multitude,
doubtless from curiosity or interest, were present on the occasion.
There was no signing of deeds; yet was the transfer made, and complete
security given, by the public manner in which the whole matter was
carried on and concluded.

the Lord make the woman that is come into thine house like Rachel and
like Leah--This was the usual bridal benediction.

[Ruth 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rut 4:12</span></span>

let thy house be like the house of Pharez--that is, as honorable and
numerous as his. He was the ancestor of the Beth-lehem people, and his
family one of the five from which the tribe of Judah sprang.

[Ruth 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rut 4:17</span></span>

SHE BEARS OBED. ([Rut 4:13-18](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#013))

Obed--means "servant."

[Ruth 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rut 4:18</span></span>

these are the generations of Pharez--that is, his descendants. This
appendix shows that the special object contemplated by the inspired
author of this little book was to preserve the memory of an interesting
domestic episode, and to trace the genealogy of David. There was an
interval of three hundred eighty years between Salmon and David. It is
evident that whole generations are omitted; the leading personages only
are named, and grandfathers are said, in Scripture language, to beget
their grandchildren, without specifying the intermediate links.
