### [Genesis Chapter 47](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#001)

[Genesis 47:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 47:1</span></span>

JOSEPH'S PRESENTATION AT COURT. (Gen. 47:1-31)

Joseph . . . told Pharaoh, My father and my brethren--Joseph furnishes a
beautiful example of a man who could bear equally well the extremes of
prosperity and adversity. High as he was, he did not forget that he had
a superior. Dearly as he loved his father and anxiously as he desired to
provide for the whole family, he would not go into the arrangements he
had planned for their stay in Goshen until he had obtained the sanction
of his royal master.

[Genesis 47:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 47:2</span></span>

he took some of his brethren--probably the five eldest brothers:
seniority being the least invidious principle of selection.

[Genesis 47:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 47:4</span></span>

For to sojourn . . . are we come--The royal conversation took the course
which Joseph had anticipated ([Gen
46:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#033)), and they answered according to
previous instructions--manifesting, however, in their determination to
return to Canaan, a faith and piety which affords a hopeful symptom of
their having become all, or most of them, religious men.

[Genesis 47:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 47:7</span></span>

Joseph brought in Jacob his father--There is a pathetic and most
affecting interest attending this interview with royalty; and when, with
all the simplicity and dignified solemnity of a man of God, Jacob
signalized his entrance by imploring the divine blessing on the royal
head, it may easily be imagined what a striking impression the scene
would produce (compare [Heb 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#007)).

[Genesis 47:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 47:8</span></span>

Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old art thou?--The question was put from
the deep and impressive interest which the appearance of the old
patriarch had created in the minds of Pharaoh and his court. In the
low-lying land of Egypt and from the artificial habits of its society,
the age of man was far shorter among the inhabitants of that country
than it had yet become in the pure bracing climate and among the simple
mountaineers of Canaan. The Hebrews, at least, still attained a
protracted longevity.

[Genesis 47:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 47:9</span></span>

The days of the years of my pilgrimage, &c.--Though a hundred thirty
years, he reckons by days (compare [Psa
90:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#012)), which he calls few, as they
appeared in retrospect, and evil, because his life had been one almost
unbroken series of trouble. The answer is remarkable, considering the
comparative darkness of the patriarchal age (compare [Ti2
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#010)).

[Genesis 47:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gen 47:11</span></span>

Joseph placed his father and his brethren . . . in the best of the
land--best pasture land in lower Egypt. Goshen, "the land of verdure,"
lay along the Pelusiac or eastern branch of the Nile. It included a part
of the district of Heliopolis, or "On," the capital, and on the east
stretched out a considerable length into the desert. The ground included
within these boundaries was a rich and fertile extent of natural meadow,
and admirably adapted for the purposes of the Hebrew shepherds (compare
[Gen 49:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#024); [Psa
34:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#010); [Psa
78:72](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#072)).

[Genesis 47:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gen 47:13</span></span>

there was no bread in all the land--This probably refers to the second
year of the famine ([Gen 45:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#006)) when
any little stores of individuals or families were exhausted and when the
people had become universally dependent on the government. At first they
obtained supplies for payment. Before long money failed.

[Genesis 47:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gen 47:16</span></span>

And Joseph said, Give your cattle--"This was the wisest course that
could be adopted for the preservation both of the people and the cattle,
which, being bought by Joseph, was supported at the royal expense, and
very likely returned to the people at the end of the famine, to enable
them to resume their agricultural labors."

[Genesis 47:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">gen 47:21</span></span>

as for the people, he removed them to cities--obviously for the
convenience of the country people, who were doing nothing, to the cities
where the corn stores were situated.

[Genesis 47:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">gen 47:22</span></span>

Only the land of the priests bought he not--These lands were
inalienable, being endowments by which the temples were supported. The
priests for themselves received an annual allowance of provision from
the state, and it would evidently have been the height of cruelty to
withhold that allowance when their lands were incapable of being tilled.

[Genesis 47:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">gen 47:23</span></span>

Joseph said, Behold, &c.--The lands being sold to the government ([Gen
47:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#019)), seed would be distributed
for the first crop after the famine; and the people would occupy them as
tenants-at-will on the payment of a produce rent, almost the same rule
as obtains in Egypt in the present day.

[Genesis 47:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">gen 47:29</span></span>

the time drew nigh that Israel must die--One only of his dying
arrangements is recorded; but that one reveals his whole character. It
was the disposal of his remains, which were to be carried to Canaan, not
from a mere romantic attachment to his native soil, nor, like his modern
descendants, from a superstitious feeling for the soil of the Holy Land,
but from faith in the promises. His address to Joseph--"if now I have
found grace in thy sight," that is, as the vizier of Egypt--his exacting
a solemn oath that his wishes would be fulfilled and the peculiar form
of that oath, all pointed significantly to the promise and showed the
intensity of his desire to enjoy its blessings (compare [Num
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#029)).

[Genesis 47:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">gen 47:31</span></span>

Israel bowed himself upon the bed's head--Oriental beds are mere mats,
having no head, and the translation should be "the top of his staff," as
the apostle renders it ([Heb 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#021)).
