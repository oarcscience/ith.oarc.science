### [Proverbs Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#001)

[Proverbs 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 18:1</span></span>

(Pro. 18:1-24)

Through desire . . . seeketh--that is, seeks selfish gratification.

intermeddleth . . . wisdom--or, "rushes on" ([Pro
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#014)) against all wisdom, or what is
valuable ([Pro 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#007)).

[Proverbs 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 18:2</span></span>

that his heart . . . itself--that is, takes pleasure in revealing his
folly ([Pro 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#023); [Pro
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#002)).

[Proverbs 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 18:3</span></span>

So surely are sin and punishment connected ([Pro
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#004)).

wicked, for "wickedness," answers to

ignominy, or the state of such; and

contempt, the feeling of others to them; and to

reproach, a manifestation of contempt.

[Proverbs 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 18:4</span></span>

Wise speech is like an exhaustless stream of benefit.

[Proverbs 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 18:5</span></span>

accept the person--(Compare [Psa
82:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#002)). "It is not good" is to be
supplied before "to overthrow."

[Proverbs 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 18:6</span></span>

The quarrelsome bring trouble on themselves. Their rash language
ensnares them ([Pro 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#002)).

[Proverbs 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 18:8</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 16:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#028)).

as wounds--not sustained by the Hebrew; better, as "sweet morsels,"
which men gladly swallow.

innermost . . . belly--the mind, or heart (compare [Pro
20:27-30](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#027); [Psa
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#014)).

[Proverbs 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 18:9</span></span>

One by failing to get, the other by wasting wealth, grows poor.

waster--literally, "master of washing," a prodigal.

[Proverbs 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 18:10</span></span>

name of the Lord--manifested perfections ([Psa
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#001); [Psa
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#002)), as faithfulness, power, mercy,
&c., on which men rely.

is safe--literally, "set on high, out of danger" ([Psa
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#002); [Psa
91:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#004)).

[Proverbs 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 18:11</span></span>

contrasts with [Pro 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#010) (compare
[Pro 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#015)). Such is a vain trust
(compare [Psa 73:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#006)).

[Proverbs 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 18:12</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 15:33](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#033); [Pro
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#018)).

[Proverbs 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 18:13</span></span>

Hasty speech evinces self-conceit, and ensures shame ([Pro
26:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#012)).

[Proverbs 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 18:14</span></span>

infirmity--bodily sickness, or outward evil. The spirit, which sustains,
being wounded, no support is left, except, as implied, in God.

[Proverbs 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 18:15</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#005), [Pro
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#015), [Pro
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#031)).

[Proverbs 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 18:16</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#008), [Pro
17:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#023)). Disapproval of the fact stated
is implied.

[Proverbs 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 18:17</span></span>

One-sided statements are not reliable.

searcheth--thoroughly ([Pro 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#009), [Pro
17:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#019)).

[Proverbs 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 18:18</span></span>

The lot--whose disposal is of God ([Pro
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#013)), may, properly used, be a right
mode of settling disputes.

[Proverbs 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 18:19</span></span>

No feuds so difficult of adjustment as those of relatives; hence great
care should be used to avoid them.

[Proverbs 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pro 18:20</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#014); [Pro
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#002)). Men's words are the fruit, or,
increase of his lips, and when good, benefit them.

satisfied with--(Compare [Pro 1:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#031);
[Pro 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#014)).

[Proverbs 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 18:21</span></span>

Death and life--or, the greatest evil and good.

that love it--that is, the tongue, or its use for good or evil.

eat . . . fruit--(Compare [Pro 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#019);
[Jam 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#019)).

[Proverbs 18:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 18:22</span></span>

The old versions supply "good" before the "wife," as the last clause and
[Pro 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#014) imply (compare [Pro
31:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#010)).

[Proverbs 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 18:23</span></span>

the rich . . . roughly--He is tolerated because rich, implying that the
estimate of men by wealth is wrong.

[Proverbs 18:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 18:24</span></span>

A man . . . friendly--better, "A man . . . (is) to, or, may triumph
([Psa 108:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#009)), or, shout for joy ([Psa
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#011)), that is, may congratulate
himself." Indeed, there is a Friend who is better than a brother; such
is the "Friend of sinners" \[[Mat
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#019); [Luk
7:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#034)\], who may have been before the
writer's mind.
