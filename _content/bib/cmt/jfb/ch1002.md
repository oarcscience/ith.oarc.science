### [1 Chronicles Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#001)

[1 Chronicles 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch1 2:3</span></span>

POSTERITY OF JUDAH. ([Ch1 2:3-12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#003))

The sons of Judah--His descendants are enumerated first, because the
right and privileges of the primogeniture had been transferred to him
([Gen 49:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#008)), and because from his
tribe the Messiah was to spring.

[1 Chronicles 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 2:6</span></span>

Zimri, and Ethan, and Heman, and Calcol, and Dara--These five are here
stated to be the sons of Zerah, that is, of Ezra, whence they were
called Ezrahites ([Kg1 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#031)). In that
passage they are called "the sons of Mahol," which, however, is to be
taken not as a proper name, but appellatively for "sons of music,
dancing," &c. The traditional fame of their great sagacity and
acquirements had descended to the time of Solomon and formed a standard
of comparison for showing the superior wisdom of that monarch. Jewish
writers say that they were looked up to as prophets by their countrymen
during the abode in Egypt.

[1 Chronicles 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch1 2:7</span></span>

the sons of Carmi--He was the son of Zimri, or Zabdi, as he is called
([Jos 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#001)).

Achar--or Achan ([Jos 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#001)). This
variety in the form of the name is with great propriety used here, since
Achar means "troubler."

[1 Chronicles 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch1 2:15</span></span>

CHILDREN OF JESSE. ([Ch1 2:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#013))

David the seventh--As it appears ([Sa1
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#010); [Sa1
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#012)) that Jesse had eight sons, the
presumption is from David being mentioned here as the seventh son of his
father, that one of them had died at an early age, without leaving
issue.

[1 Chronicles 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch1 2:17</span></span>

Jether the Ishmaelite--(compare [Sa2
17:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#025)). In that passage he is called
Ithra an Israelite; and there seems no reason why, in the early days of
David, anyone should be specially distinguished as an Israelite. The
presumption is in favor of the reading followed by the Septuagint, which
calls him "Jetra the Jezreelite." The circumstance of his settling in
another tribe, or of a woman marrying out of her own tribe, was
sufficiently rare and singular to call for the statement that Abigail
was married to a man of Jezreel.

[1 Chronicles 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch1 2:18</span></span>

POSTERITY OF CALEB. (1Ch. 2:18-55)

Caleb the son of Hezron--The notices concerning this person appear
confused in our version. In [Ch1 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#019)
he is said to be the father of Hur, whereas in [Ch1
2:50](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#050) he is called "the son of Hur."
The words in this latter passage have been transposed in the copying,
and should be read thus, "Hur the son of Caleb."

begat children of Azubah his wife, and of Jerioth--The former was his
spouse, while Jerioth seems to have been a secondary wife, and the
mother of the children whose names are here given. On the death of his
principal wife, he married Ephrath, and by her had Hur \[[Ch1
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#019)\].

[1 Chronicles 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch1 2:21</span></span>

Hezron . . . daughter of Machir the father of Gilead--that is, chief of
that town, which with the lands adjacent was no doubt the property of
Machir, who was so desirous of a male heir. He was grandson of Joseph.
The wife of Machir was of the tribe of Manasseh ([Num
26:29](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#029)).

[1 Chronicles 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch1 2:22</span></span>

Jair, who had three and twenty cities in the land of Gilead--As the son
of Segub and the grandson of Hezron, he was of the tribe of Judah; but
from his maternal descent he is called ([Num
32:41](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#041); [Deu
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#014)) "the son of Manasseh." This
designation implies that his inheritance lay in that tribe in right of
his grandmother; in other words, his maternal and adopting
great-grandfather was Machir the son of Manasseh. Jair, inheriting his
property, was his lineal representative; and accordingly this is
expressly stated to be the case; for the village group of "Havoth-Jair"
was awarded to him in that tribe, in consequence of his valiant and
patriotic exploits. This arrangement, however, took place previous to
the law ([Num 36:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/num036.htm#001)), by which it
was enacted that heiresses were to marry in their own tribe. But this
instance of Jair shows that in the case of a man obtaining an
inheritance in another tribe it required him to become thoroughly
incorporated with it as a representative of the family through which the
inheritance was received. He had been adopted into Manasseh, and it
would never have been imagined that he was other than "a son of
Manasseh" naturally, had not this passage given information
supplementary to that of the passage in Numbers.

[1 Chronicles 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ch1 2:23</span></span>

he took--rather "he had taken." This statement is accounting for his
acquisition of so large a territory; he got it by right of conquest from
the former possessors.

Kenath--This place, along with its group of surrounding villages, was
gained by Nobah, one of Jair's officers sent by him to capture it ([Num
32:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#001)).

All these belonged to the sons of Machir--In their number Jair is
included as having completely identified himself by his marriage and
residence in Gilead with the tribe of Manasseh.

[1 Chronicles 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ch1 2:24</span></span>

Caleb-ephratah--so called from uniting the names of husband and wife
([Ch1 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#019)), and supposed to be the
same as was afterwards called Beth-lehem-ephratah.

Ashur, the father of Tekoa-- ([Sa2
14:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#002)). He is called the father,
either from his being the first founder, or perhaps the ruler, of the
city.

[1 Chronicles 2:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">ch1 2:34</span></span>

Sheshan had no sons, but daughters--either he had no sons alive at his
death, or his family consisted wholly of daughters, of whom Ahlai ([Ch1
2:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#031)) was one, she being specially
mentioned on account of the domestic relations about to be noted.

[1 Chronicles 2:35](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">ch1 2:35</span></span>

Sheshan gave his daughter to Jarha his servant to wife--The adoption and
marriage of a foreign slave in the family where he is serving, is far
from being a rare or extraordinary occurrence in Eastern countries. It
is thought, however, by some to have been a connection not sanctioned by
the law of Moses \[MICHAELIS\]. But this is not a well-founded
objection, as the history of the Jews furnishes not a few examples of
foreign proselytes in the same manner obtaining an inheritance in
Israel; and doubtless Jarha had previously embraced the Jewish faith in
place of the grovelling idolatries of his native Egypt. In such a case,
therefore, there could be no legal difficulty. Being a foreign slave, he
had no inheritance in a different tribe to injure by this connection;
while his marriage with Sheshan's daughter led to his adoption into the
tribe of Judah, as well as his becoming heir of the family property.

[1 Chronicles 2:42](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">ch1 2:42</span></span>

the sons of Caleb--(compare [Ch1 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#018),
[Ch1 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#025)). The sons here noticed were
the fruit of his union with a third wife.

[1 Chronicles 2:55](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#055)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_055">ch1 2:55</span></span>

the families of the scribes--either civil or ecclesiastical officers of
the Kenite origin, who are here classed with the tribe of Judah, not as
being descended from it, but as dwelling within its territory, and in a
measure incorporated with its people.

Jabez--a place in Judah ([Ch1 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#009)).

Kenites that came of Hemath--who settled in Judah, and were thus
distinguished from another division of the Kenite clan which dwelt in
Manasseh ([Jdg 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#011)).
