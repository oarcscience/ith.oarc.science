### [Micah Introduction](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#001)

[Micah](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mic 0:0</span></span>

MICAH was a native of Moresheth, not the same as Mareshah in [Mic
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#015), but the town called
Moresheth-gath ([Mic 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#014)), which lay
near Eleutheropolis, west of Jerusalem, on the border of the Philistine
country; so called to distinguish it from Moresheth of Judah. His full
name is Micaiah (not the Micaiah mentioned [Kg1
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#008), the son of Imlah), signifying,
Who is like Jehovah? The time of his prophesying is stated in the
introduction to be in the reigns of Jotham. Ahaz, and Hezekiah, that is,
between 757 and 699 B.C. Jeremiah ([Jer
26:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#018)) quotes [Mic
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#012), as delivered in the reign of
Hezekiah. He was thus a contemporary of Isaiah and Hosea. The idolatries
practised in the reign of Ahaz accord with Micah's denunciations of such
gross evils, and confirm the truth of the time assigned [Mic
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#001). His prophecies are partly against
Israel (Samaria), partly against Judah. As Samaria, Israel's metropolis,
was taken first, and Jerusalem, the capital of Judah subsequently, in
the introductory heading, [Mic 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#001),
Samaria is put first, then Jerusalem. He prophesies the capture of both;
the Jews captivity and restoration; and the coming and reign of Messiah.
His style is full, round, and perspicuous; his diction pure, and his
parallelisms regular. His description of Jehovah ([Mic
7:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#018)) is not surpassed by any
elsewhere in Scripture. The similarity between Isaiah and Micah in some
passages (compare [Mic 4:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#001), with
[Isa 2:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002)) is to be accounted for by
their being contemporaries, acquainted with each other's inspired
writings, and having the same subjects for their theme. HENGSTENBERG
maintains that the passage in Micah is the original. Isaiah was somewhat
the older, being a prophet in the reign of Uzziah, Jotham's predecessor,
whereas Micah began his prophecies under Jotham.

The book consists of two parts: (1) the first through fifth chapters;
(2) the sixth and seventh chapters, a dialogue or contestation between
Jehovah and His people, in which He reproaches them with their unnatural
and ungrateful conduct, and threatens judgment for their corruptions,
but consoles them with the promise of restoration from captivity.

Micah stands sixth of the minor prophets in the Hebrew canon, but third
in the Septuagint.
