### [Proverbs Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#001)

[Proverbs 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 26:1</span></span>

(Pro. 26:1-28)

The incongruities of nature illustrate also those of the moral world.
The fool's unworthiness is also implied ([Pro
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#007); [Pro
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#010)).

[Proverbs 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 26:2</span></span>

Though not obvious to us,

the bird--literally, "sparrow"--and

swallow--have an object in their motions, so penal evil falls on none
without a reason.

[Proverbs 26:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 26:3</span></span>

The rod is as much needed by fools and as well suited to them, as whips
and bridles are for beasts.

[Proverbs 26:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 26:4</span></span>

Answer not--that is, approvingly by like folly.

[Proverbs 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 26:5</span></span>

Answer--by reproof.

[Proverbs 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 26:6</span></span>

A fool fails by folly as surely as if he were maimed.

drinketh damage--that is, gets it abundantly ([Job
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#016); [Job
34:7](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#007)).

[Proverbs 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 26:7</span></span>

legs . . . equal--or, "take away the legs," or "the legs . . . are
weak." In any case the idea is that they are the occasion of an
awkwardness, such as the fool shows in using a parable or proverb (see
Introduction; [Pro 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#007)).

[Proverbs 26:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 26:8</span></span>

A stone, bound in a sling, is useless; so honor, conferred on a fool, is
thrown away.

[Proverbs 26:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 26:9</span></span>

As vexatious and unmanageable as a thorn in a drunkard's hand is a
parable to a fool. He will be as apt to misuse is as to use it rightly.

[Proverbs 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 26:10</span></span>

Various versions of this are proposed (compare Margin). Better
perhaps--"Much He injures (or literally, "wounds") all who reward," &c.,
that is, society is injured by encouraging evil men.

transgressors--may be rendered "vagrants." The word "God" is improperly
supplied.

[Proverbs 26:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 26:11</span></span>

returneth . . . folly--Though disgusting to others, the fool delights in
his folly.

[Proverbs 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 26:12</span></span>

The self-conceited are taught with more difficulty than the stupid.

[Proverbs 26:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 26:13</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 22:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#013)).

[Proverbs 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 26:14</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#010); [Pro
24:33](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#033)).

[Proverbs 26:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 26:15</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 19:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#024)).

[Proverbs 26:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 26:16</span></span>

The thoughtless being ignorant of their ignorance are conceited.

[Proverbs 26:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 26:17</span></span>

meddleth--as in [Pro 20:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#019); [Pro
24:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#021); as either holding a dog by the
ears or letting him go involves danger, so success in another man's
strife or failure involves a useless risk of reputation, does no good,
and may do us harm.

[Proverbs 26:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 26:18</span></span>

Such are reckless of results.

[Proverbs 26:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pro 26:20</span></span>

The talebearers foster ([Pro 16:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#028)),
and the contentious excite, strife.

[Proverbs 26:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 26:22</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#008)).

[Proverbs 26:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 26:23</span></span>

Warm professions can no more give value to insincerity than silver
coating to rude earthenware.

[Proverbs 26:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 26:24</span></span>

dissembleth--though an unusual sense of the word (compare Margin), is
allowable, and better suits the context, which sets forth hypocrisy.

[Proverbs 26:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">pro 26:25</span></span>

Sentiment of [Pro 26:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#024) carried out.

seven abominations in his heart--that is, very many (compare [Pro
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#016)).

[Proverbs 26:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">pro 26:26</span></span>

Deceit will at last be exposed, and the wicked by their own arts often
bring on retribution (compare [Pro
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#013); [Psa
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#016); [Psa
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#017), &c.).

[Proverbs 26:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">pro 26:28</span></span>

Men hate those they injure.

A lying tongue--"lips" for the persons (compare [Pro
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#024); [Psa
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#003)).
