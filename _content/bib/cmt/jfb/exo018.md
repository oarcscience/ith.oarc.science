### [Exodus Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#001)

[Exodus 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 18:1</span></span>

VISIT OF JETHRO. (Exo. 18:1-27)

Jethro . . . came . . . unto Moses, &c.--It is thought by many eminent
commentators that this episode is inserted out of its chronological
order, for it is described as occurring when the Israelites were
"encamped at the mount of God." And yet they did not reach it till the
third month after their departure from Egypt ([Exo
19:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#001); compare [Deu
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#006), [Deu
1:9-15](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#009)).

[Exodus 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">exo 18:6</span></span>

and thy wife, and her two sons--See [Exo
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#020).

[Exodus 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">exo 18:7</span></span>

Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, &c.--Their salutations would
be marked by all the warm and social greetings of Oriental friends (see
on [Exo 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#027)) --the one going out to
"meet" the other, the "obeisance," the "kiss" on each side of the head,
the silent entrance into the tent for consultation; and their
conversation ran in the strain that might have been expected of two
pious men, rehearsing and listening to a narrative of the wonderful
works and providence of God.

[Exodus 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">exo 18:12</span></span>

Jethro . . . took a burnt offering--This friendly interview was
terminated by a solemn religious service--the burnt offerings were
consumed on the altar, and the sacrifices were peace offerings, used in
a feast of joy and gratitude at which Jethro, as priest of the true God,
seems to have presided, and to which the chiefs of Israel were invited.
This incident is in beautiful keeping with the character of the parties,
and is well worthy of the imitation of Christian friends when they meet
in the present day.

[Exodus 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">exo 18:13</span></span>

on the morrow . . . Moses sat to judge the people, &c.--We are here
presented with a specimen of his daily morning occupations; and among
the multifarious duties his divine legation imposed, it must be
considered only a small portion of his official employments. He appears
in this attitude as a type of Christ in His legislative and judicial
characters.

the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening,
&c.--Governors in the East seat themselves at the most public gate of
their palace or the city, and there, amid a crowd of applicants, hear
causes, receive petitions, redress grievances, and adjust the claims of
contending parties.

[Exodus 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">exo 18:17</span></span>

Moses' father-in-law said unto him, The thing . . . is not good--not
good either for Moses himself, for the maintenance of justice, or for
the satisfaction and interests of the people. Jethro gave a prudent
counsel as to the division of labor \[[Exo
18:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#021)\], and universal experience
in the Church and State has attested the soundness and advantages of the
principle.

[Exodus 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">exo 18:23</span></span>

If thou shalt do this thing, &c.--Jethro's counsel was given merely in
the form of a suggestion; it was not to be adopted without the express
sanction and approval of a better and higher Counsellor; and although we
are not informed of it, there can be no doubt that Moses, before
appointing subordinate magistrates, would ask the mind of God, as it is
the duty and privilege of every Christian in like manner to supplicate
the divine direction in all his ways.
