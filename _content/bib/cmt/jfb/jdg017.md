### [Judges Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#001)

[Judges 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 17:1</span></span>

MICAH RESTORING THE STOLEN MONEY TO HIS MOTHER, SHE MAKES IMAGES. ([Jdg
17:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#001))

a man of mount Ephraim--that is, the mountainous parts of Ephraim. This
and the other narratives that follow form a miscellaneous collection, or
appendix to the Book of Judges. It belongs to a period when the Hebrew
nation was in a greatly disordered and corrupt state. This episode of
Micah is connected with [Jdg 1:34](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#034). It
relates to his foundation of a small sanctuary of his own--a miniature
representation of the Shiloh tabernacle--which he stocked with images
modelled probably in imitation of the ark and cherubim. Micah and his
mother were sincere in their intention to honor God. But their faith was
blended with a sad amount of ignorance and delusion. The divisive course
they pursued, as well as the will-worship they practised, subjected the
perpetrators to the penalty of death.

[Judges 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jdg 17:3</span></span>

a graven image and a molten image--The one carved from a block of wood
or stone, to be plated over with silver; the other, a figure formed of
the solid metal cast into a mould. It is observable, however, that only
two hundred shekels were given to the founder. Probably the expense of
making two such figures of silver, with their appurtenances (pedestals,
bases, &c.), might easily cost, in those days, two hundred shekels,
which (at 2 shillings, 4 pence each, is about 23 pounds) would be a sum
not adequate to the formation of large statues \[TAYLOR, Fragments\].

[Judges 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jdg 17:5</span></span>

the man Micah had an house of gods--Hebrew, "a house of God"--a domestic
chapel, a private religious establishment of his own.

an ephod--(see on [Exo 28:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#006)).

teraphim--tutelary gods of the household (see [Gen
31:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#019) and see on [Gen
31:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#026)).

consecrated one of his sons who became his priest--The assumption of the
priestly office by any one out of the family of Aaron was a direct
violation of the divine law ([Num
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#010); [Num
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#017); [Deu
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#005); [Heb
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#004)).

[Judges 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jdg 17:6</span></span>

every man did that which was right in his own eyes--From want of a
settled government, there was no one to call him to account. No
punishment followed any crime.

[Judges 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jdg 17:7</span></span>

Beth-lehem-judah--so called in contradistinction to a town of the same
name in Zebulun ([Jos 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#015)).

of the family--that is, tribe.

of Judah--Men of the tribe of Levi might connect themselves, as Aaron
did ([Exo 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#023)), by marriage with
another tribe; and this young Levite belonged to the tribe of Judah, by
his mother's side, which accounts for his being in Beth-lehem, not one
of the Levitical cities.

[Judges 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jdg 17:8</span></span>

the man departed . . . to sojourn where he could find a place--A
competent provision being secured for every member of the Levitical
order, his wandering about showed him to have been a person of a roving
disposition or unsettled habits. In the course of his journeying he came
to the house of Micah, who, on learning what he was, engaged his
permanent services.

[Judges 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jdg 17:10</span></span>

Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father--a spiritual
father, to conduct the religious services of my establishment. He was to
receive, in addition to his board, a salary of ten shekels of silver,
equal to 25 shillings a year.

a suit of apparel--not only dress for ordinary use, but vestments
suitable for the discharge of his priestly functions.

[Judges 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jdg 17:12</span></span>

Micah consecrated the Levite--Hebrew, "filled his hand." This act of
consecration was not less unlawful for Micah to perform than for this
Levite to receive (see on [Jdg 18:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#030)).

[Judges 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jdg 17:13</span></span>

Now know I that the Lord will do me good--The removal of his son,
followed by the installation of this Levite into the priestly office,
seems to have satisfied his conscience, that by what he deemed the
orderly ministrations of religion he would prosper. This expression of
his hope evinces the united influence of ignorance and superstition.
