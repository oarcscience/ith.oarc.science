<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">eze 21:2</A></FONT></span></p>PROPHECY AGAINST ISRAEL AND JERUSALEM, AND AGAINST AMMON. (Eze. 21:1-32)
<p>
<p>the holy places--the three parts of the temple: the courts, the holy place, and the holiest. If "synagogues" existed before the Babylonian captivity, as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#008">Psa 74:8</A> seems to imply, they and the proseuch&Atilde;&brvbr;, or oratories, may be included in the "holy places" here.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#003">Ezekiel 21:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">eze 21:3</A></FONT></span></p>righteous . . . wicked--not contradictory of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#004">Eze 18:4</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#009">Eze 18:9</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#023">Gen 18:23</A>. Ezekiel here views the mere outward aspect of the indiscriminate universality of the national calamity. But really the same captivity to the "righteous" would prove a blessing as a wholesome discipline, which to the "wicked" would be an unmitigated punishment. The godly were sealed with a mark (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#004">Eze 9:4</A>), not for outward exemption from the common calamity, but as marked for the secret interpositions of Providence, overruling even evil to their good. The godly were by comparison so few, that not their salvation but the universality of the judgment is brought into view here.

<p>
<p>glitter--literally, "glitter as the lightning flash": flashing terror into the foe. 
<p>
<p>should we . . . make mirth--It is no time for levity when such a calamity is impending (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#012">Isa 22:12-13</A>). 
<p>
<p>it contemneth the rod of my son, &amp;c.--The sword has no more respect to the trivial "rod" or scepter of Judah (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010">Gen 49:10</A>) than if it were any common "tree." "Tree" is the image retained from <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#047">Eze 20:47</A>; explained in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#002">Eze 21:2-3</A>. God calls Judah "My son" (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#022">Exo 4:22</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001">Hos 11:1</A>). FAIRBAIRN arbitrarily translates, "Perchance the scepter of My son rejoiceth; it (the sword) despiseth every tree."

<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#012">Ezekiel 21:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">eze 21:12</A></FONT></span></p>terrors by reason of the sword, &amp;c.--rather, "they (the princes of Israel) are delivered up to the sword together with My people" [GLASSIUS]. 
<p>
<p>smite . . . upon . . . thigh--a mark of grief (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#019">Jer 31:19</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#013">Ezekiel 21:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">eze 21:13</A></FONT></span></p>it is a trial--rather, "There is a trial" being made: the sword of the Lord will subject all to the ordeal. "What, then, if it contemn even the rod" (scepter of Judah)? Compare as to a similar scourge of unsparing trial, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#023">Job 9:23</A>. 
<p>
<p>it shall be no more--the scepter, that is, the state, must necessarily then come to an end. Fulfilled in part at the overthrow of Judah by Nebuchadnezzar, but fully at the time of "Shiloh's" (Messiah's) coming (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010">Gen 49:10</A>), when Judea became a Roman province.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#014">Ezekiel 21:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">eze 21:14</A></FONT></span></p>smite . . . hands together-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#010">Num 24:10</A>), indicative of the indignant fury with which God will "smite" the people. 
<p>
<p>sword . . . doubled the third time--referring to the threefold calamity:--(1) The taking of Zedekiah (to whom the "rod," or scepter, may refer); (2) the taking of the city; (3) the removal of all those who remained with Gedaliah. "Doubled" means "multiplied" or "repeated." The stroke shall be doubled and even trebled. 
<p>
<p>of the slain--that is, by which many are slain. As the Hebrew is singular, FAIRBAIRN makes it refer to the king, "the sword of the great one that is slain," or "pierced through." 
<p>
<p>entereth . . . privy chambers-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#021">Jer 9:21</A>). The sword shall overtake them, not merely in the open battlefield, but in the chambers whither they flee to hide themselves (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#030">Kg1 20:30</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#025">Kg1 22:25</A>). MAURER translates, "which besieged them"; FAIRBAIRN, "which penetrates to them." English Version is more literal.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#015">Ezekiel 21:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">eze 21:15</A></FONT></span></p>point--"the whirling glance of the sword" [FAIRBAIRN]. "The naked (bared) sword" [HENDERSON]. 
<p>
<p>ruins--literally, "stumbling-blocks." Their own houses and walls shall be stumbling-blocks in their way, whether they wish to fight or flee. 
<p>
<p>made bright--made to glitter. 
<p>
<p>wrapped, &amp;c.--namely, in the hand of him who holds the hilt, or in its scabbard, that the edge may not be blunt when it is presently drawn forth to strike. GESENIUS, translates, "sharpened," &amp;c.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#016">Ezekiel 21:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">eze 21:16</A></FONT></span></p>Apostrophe to the sword. 
<p>
<p>Go . . . one way--or, "Concentrate thyself"; "Unite thy forces on the right hand" [GROTIUS]. The sword is commanded to take the nearest route for Jerusalem, "whither their face was set," whether south or north ("right hand or left"), according to where the several parts of the Chaldean host may be. 
<p>
<p>or other, . . . on the left--rather "set thyself on the left." The verbs are well-chosen. The main "concentration" of forces was to be on "the right hand," or south, the part of Judea in which Jerusalem was, and which lay south in marching from Babylon, whereas the Chaldean forces advancing on Jerusalem from Egypt, of which Jerusalem was north, were fewer, and therefore "set thyself" is the verb used.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#017">Ezekiel 21:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">eze 21:17</A></FONT></span></p>Jehovah Himself smites His hands together, doing what He had commanded Ezekiel to do (see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#014">Eze 21:14</A>), in token of His smiting Jerusalem; compare the similar symbolical action (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#018">Kg2 13:18-19</A>). 
<p>
<p>cause . . . fury to rest--give it full vent, and so satisfy it (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#013">Eze 5:13</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#019">Ezekiel 21:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">eze 21:19</A></FONT></span></p>two ways--The king coming from Babylon is represented in the graphic style of Ezekiel as reaching the point where the road branched off in two ways, one leading by the south, by Tadmor or Palmyra, to Rabbath of Ammon, east of Jordan; the other by the north, by Riblah in Syria, to Jerusalem--and hesitating which way to take. Ezekiel is told to "appoint the two ways" (as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#001">Eze 4:1</A>); for Nebuchadnezzar, though knowing no other control but his own will and superstition, had really this path "appointed" for him by the all-ruling God. 
<p>
<p>out of one land--namely, Babylon. 
<p>
<p>choose . . . a place--literally "a hand." So it is translated by FAIRBAIRN, "make a finger-post," namely, at the head of the two ways, the hand post pointing Nebuchadnezzar to the way to Jerusalem as the way he should select. But MAURER rightly supports English Version. Ezekiel is told to "choose the place" where Nebuchadnezzar should do as is described in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#020">Eze 21:20-21</A>; so entirely does God order by the prophet every particular of place and time in the movements of the invader.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#020">Ezekiel 21:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">eze 21:20</A></FONT></span></p>Rabbath of the Ammonites--distinct from Rabbah in Judah (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#026">Sa2 12:26</A>). Rabbath is put first, as it was from her that Jerusalem, that doomed city, had borrowed many of her idols. 
<p>
<p>to Judah in Jerusalem--instead of simply putting "Jerusalem," to imply the sword was to come not merely to Judah, but to its people within Jerusalem, defended though it was; its defenses on which the Jews relied so much would not keep the foe out.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#021">Ezekiel 21:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">eze 21:21</A></FONT></span></p>parting--literally, "mother of the way." As "head of the two ways" follows, which seems tautology after "parting of the way," HAVERNICK translates, according to Arabic idiom, "the highway," or principal road. English Version is not tautology, "head of the two ways" defining more accurately "parting of the way." 
<p>
<p>made . . . bright--rather, "shook," from an Arabic root. 
<p>
<p>arrows--Divination by arrows is here referred to: they were put into a quiver marked with the names of particular places to be attacked, and then shaken together; whichever came forth first intimated the one selected as the first to be attacked [JEROME]. The same usage existed among the Arabs, and is mentioned in the Koran. In the Nineveh sculptures the king is represented with a cup in his right hand, his left resting on a bow; also with two arrows in the right, and the bow in the left, probably practising divination. 
<p>
<p>images--Hebrew, "teraphim"; household gods, worshipped as family talismans, to obtain direction as to the future and other blessings. First mentioned in Mesopotamia, whence Rachel brought them (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#019">Gen 31:19</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#034">Gen 31:34</A>); put away by Jacob (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#004">Gen 35:4</A>); set up by Micah as his household gods (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#005">Jdg 17:5</A>); stigmatized as idolatry (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#023">Sa1 15:23</A>, Hebrew; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#002">Zac 10:2</A>, Margin). 
<p>
<p>liver--They judged of the success, or failure, of an undertaking by the healthy, or unhealthy, state of the liver and entrails of a sacrifice.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#022">Ezekiel 21:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">eze 21:22</A></FONT></span></p>Rather, "In his right hand was [is] the divination," that is, he holds up in his right hand the arrow marked with "Jerusalem," to encourage his army to march for it. 
<p>
<p>captains--The Margin, "battering-rams," adopted by FAIRBAIRN, is less appropriate, for "battering-rams" follow presently after [GROTIUS]. 
<p>
<p>open the mouth in . . . slaughter--that is, commanding slaughter: raising the war cry of death. Not as GESENIUS, "to open the mouth with the war shout."
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#023">Ezekiel 21:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">eze 21:23</A></FONT></span></p>Unto the Jews, though credulous of divinations when in their favor, Nebuchadnezzar's divination "shall be (seen) as false." This gives the reason which makes the Jews fancy themselves safe from the Chaldeans, namely, that they "have sworn" to the latter "oaths" of allegiance, forgetting that they had violated them (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#013">Eze 17:13</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#015">Eze 17:15-16</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#018">Eze 17:18</A>). 
<p>
<p>but he, &amp;c.--Nebuchadnezzar will remember in consulting his idols that he swore to Zedekiah by them, but that Zedekiah broke the league [GROTIUS]. Rather, God will remember against them (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#019">Rev 16:19</A>) their violating their oath sworn by the true God, whereas Nebuchadnezzar kept his oath sworn by a false god; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#024">Eze 21:24</A> confirms this.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#024">Ezekiel 21:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">eze 21:24</A></FONT></span></p>Their unfaithfulness to Nebuchadnezzar was a type of their general unfaithfulness to their covenant God. 
<p>
<p>with the hand--namely, of the king of Babylon.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_025">eze 21:25</A></FONT></span></p>profane--as having desecrated by idolatry and perjury his office as the Lord's anointed. HAVERNICK translates, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#014">Eze 21:14</A>, "slain," that is, not literally, but virtually; to Ezekiel's idealizing view Zedekiah was the grand victim "pierced through" by God's sword of judgment, as his sons were slain before his eyes, which were then put out, and he was led a captive in chains to Babylon. English Version is better: so GESENIUS (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#013">Ch2 36:13</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#002">Jer 52:2</A>). 
<p>
<p>when iniquity shall have an end-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#029">Eze 21:29</A>). When thine iniquity, having reached its last stage of guilt, shall be put an end to by judgment (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#005">Eze 35:5</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#026">Ezekiel 21:26</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_026">eze 21:26</A></FONT></span></p>diadem--rather, "the miter" of the holy priest (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#004">Exo 28:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#005">Zac 3:5</A>). His priestly emblem as representative of the priestly people. Both this and "the crown," the emblem of the kingdom, were to be removed, until they should be restored and united in the Mediator, Messiah (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#002">Psa 110:2</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#004">Psa 110:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#013">Zac 6:13</A>), [FAIRBAIRN]. As, however, King Zedekiah alone, not the high priest also, is referred to in the context, English Version is supported by GESENIUS. 
<p>
<p>this shall not be the same--The diadem shall not be as it was [ROSENMULLER]. Nothing shall remain what it was [FAIRBAIRN]. 
<p>
<p>exalt . . . low, . . . abase . . . high--not the general truth expressed (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#034">Pro 3:34</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#052">Luk 1:52</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#006">Jam 4:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#005">Pe1 5:5</A>); but specially referring to Messiah and Zedekiah contrasted together. The "tender plant . . . out of the dry ground" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#002">Isa 53:2</A>) is to be "exalted" in the end (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#027">Eze 21:27</A>); the now "high" representative on David's throne, Zedekiah, is to be "abased." The outward relations of things shall be made to change places in just retaliation on the people for having so perverted the moral relations of things [HENGSTENBERG].
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#027">Ezekiel 21:27</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_027">eze 21:27</A></FONT></span></p>Literally, "An overturning, overturning, overturning, will I make it." The threefold repetition denotes the awful certainty of the event; not as ROSENMULLER explains, the overthrow of the three, Jehoiakim, Jeconiah, and Zedekiah; for Zedekiah alone is referred to. 
<p>
<p>it shall be no more, until he come whose fight it is--strikingly parallel to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010">Gen 49:10</A>. Nowhere shall there be rest or permanence; all things shall be in fluctuation until He comes who, as the rightful Heir, shall restore the throne of David that fell with Zedekiah. The Hebrew for "right" is "judgment"; it perhaps includes, besides the right to rule, the idea of His rule being one in righteousness (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#002">Psa 72:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006">Isa 9:6-7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#004">Isa 11:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#011">Rev 19:11</A>). Others (Nebuchadnezzar, &amp;c.), who held the rule of the earth delegated to them by God, abused it by unrighteousness, and so forfeited the "right." He both has the truest "right" to the rule, and exercises it in "right." It is true the tribal "scepter" continued with Judah "till Shiloh came" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010">Gen 49:10</A>); but there was no kingly scepter till Messiah came, as the spiritual King then (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#036">Joh 18:36-37</A>); this spiritual kingdom being about to pass into the literal, personal kingdom over Israel at His second coming, when, and not before, this prophecy shall have its exhaustive fulfilment (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#032">Luk 1:32-33</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#017">Jer 3:17</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#007">Jer 10:7</A>; "To thee doth it appertain").

<p>their reproach--This constituted a leading feature in their guilt; they treated with proud contumely the covenant-people after the taking of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#003">Eze 25:3</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#006">Eze 25:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#009">Zep 2:9-10</A>), and appropriated Israel's territory (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#001">Jer 49:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#013">Amo 1:13-15</A>). 
<p>
<p>furbished, to consume--MAURER punctuates thus, "Drawn for the slaughter, it is furbished to devour ('consume'), to glitter." English Version, "to consume because of the glittering," means, "to consume by reason of the lightning, flash-like rapidity with which it falls." Five years after the fall of Jerusalem, Ammon was destroyed for aiding Ishmael in usurping the government of Judea against the will of the king of Babylon (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#025">Kg2 25:25</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#015">Jer 41:15</A>) [GROTIUS].

Certainly not (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#006">Jer 47:6-7</A>).
