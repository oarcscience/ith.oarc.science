<p>
<p>a wise man--which Job claims to be. 
<p>
<p>vain knowledge--Hebrew, "windy knowledge"; literally, "of wind" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#002">Job 8:2</A>). In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#014">Ecc 1:14</A>, Hebrew, "to catch wind," expresses to strive for what is vain. 
<p>
<p>east wind--stronger than the previous "wind," for in that region the east wind is the most destructive of winds (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#008">Isa 27:8</A>). Thus here,--empty violence. 
<p>
<p>belly--the inward parts, the breast (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#008">Pro 18:8</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#004">Job 15:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">job 15:4</A></FONT></span></p>fear--reverence for God (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#006">Job 4:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#011">Psa 2:11</A>). 
<p>
<p>prayer--meditation, in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#034">Psa 104:34</A>; so devotion. If thy views were right, reasons Eliphaz, that God disregards the afflictions of the righteous and makes the wicked to prosper, all devotion would be at an end.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#005">Job 15:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">job 15:5</A></FONT></span></p>The sophistry of thine own speeches proves thy guilt.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#006">Job 15:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">job 15:6</A></FONT></span></p>No pious man would utter such sentiments.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#007">Job 15:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">job 15:7</A></FONT></span></p>That is, Art thou wisdom personified? Wisdom existed before the hills; that is, the eternal Son of God (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#025">Pro 8:25</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#002">Psa 90:2</A>). Wast thou in existence before Adam? The farther back one existed, the nearer he was to the Eternal Wisdom.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#008">Job 15:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">job 15:8</A></FONT></span></p>secret--rather, "Wast thou a listener in the secret council of God?" The Hebrew means properly the cushions of a divan on which counsellors in the East usually sit. God's servants are admitted to God's secrets (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#014">Psa 25:14</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#017">Gen 18:17</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#015">Joh 15:15</A>). 
<p>
<p>restrain--Rather, didst thou take away, or borrow, thence (namely, from the divine secret council) thy wisdom? Eliphaz in this (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#008">Job 15:8-9</A>) retorts Job's words upon himself (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#002">Job 12:2-3</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#002">Job 13:2</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#009">Job 15:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">job 15:9</A></FONT></span></p>in us--or, "with us," Hebraism for "we are aware of."
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#010">Job 15:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">job 15:10</A></FONT></span></p>On our side, thinking with us are the aged. Job had admitted that wisdom is with them (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#012">Job 12:12</A>). Eliphaz seems to have been himself older than Job; perhaps the other two were also (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#006">Job 32:6</A>). Job, in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#001">Job 30:1</A>, does not refer to his three friends; it therefore forms no objection. The Arabs are proud of fulness of years.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#011">Job 15:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">job 15:11</A></FONT></span></p>consolations--namely, the revelation which Eliphaz had stated as a consolatory reproof to Job, and which he repeats in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#014">Job 15:14</A>. 
<p>
<p>secret--Hast thou some secret wisdom and source of consolation, which makes thee disregard those suggested by me? (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#008">Job 15:8</A>). Rather, from a different Hebrew root, Is the word of kindness or gentleness addressed by me treated by thee as valueless? [UMBREIT].
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#012">Job 15:12</A></p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">job 15:13</A></FONT></span></p>That is, frettest against God and lettest fall rash words.
<p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">job 15:14</A></FONT></span></p>Eliphaz repeats the revelation (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#017">Job 4:17</A>) in substance, but using Job's own words (see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#001">Job 14:1</A>, on "born of a woman") to strike him with his own weapons.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#015">Job 15:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">job 15:15</A></FONT></span></p>Repeated from <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#018">Job 4:18</A>; "servants" there are "saints" here; namely, holy angels. 
<p>
<p>heavens--literally, or else answering to "angels" (see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#018">Job 4:18</A>, and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job025.htm#005">Job 25:5</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#016">Job 15:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">job 15:16</A></FONT></span></p>filthy--in Arabic "sour" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#003">Psa 14:3</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#003">Psa 53:3</A>), corrupted from his original purity.

<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#017">Job 15:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">job 15:17</A></FONT></span></p>In direct contradiction of Job's position (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#006">Job 12:6</A>, &amp;c.), that the lot of the wicked was the most prosperous here, Eliphaz appeals (1) to his own experience, (2) to the wisdom of the ancients.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#018">Job 15:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">job 15:18</A></FONT></span></p>Rather, "and which as handed down from their fathers, they have not concealed."
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#019">Job 15:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">job 15:19</A></FONT></span></p>Eliphaz speaks like a genuine Arab when he boasts that his ancestors had ever possessed the land unmixed with foreigners [UMBREIT]. His words are intended to oppose Job's (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#024">Job 9:24</A>); "the earth" in their case was not "given into the hand of the wicked." He refers to the division of the earth by divine appointment (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#005">Gen 10:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#032">Gen 25:32</A>). Also he may insinuate that Job's sentiments had been corrupted from original purity by his vicinity to the Sabeans and Chaldeans [ROSENMULLER].
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#020">Job 15:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">job 15:20</A></FONT></span></p>travaileth--rather, "trembleth of himself," though there is no real danger [UMBREIT]. 
<p>
<p>and the number of his years, &amp;c.--This gives the reason why the wicked man trembles continually; namely, because he knows not the moment when his life must end.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#021">Job 15:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">job 15:21</A></FONT></span></p>An evil conscience conceives alarm at every sudden sound, though it be in a time of peace ("prosperity"), when there is no real danger (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#036">Lev 26:36</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#001">Pro 28:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#006">Kg2 7:6</A>).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">job 15:22</A></FONT></span></p>darkness--namely, danger or calamity. Glancing at Job, who despaired of restoration: in contrast to good men when in darkness (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#008">Mic 7:8-9</A>). 
<p>
<p>waited for of--that is, He is destined for the sword [GESENIUS]. Rather (in the night of danger), "he looks anxiously towards the sword," as if every sword was drawn against him [UMBREIT].
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#023">Job 15:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">job 15:23</A></FONT></span></p>Wandereth in anxious search for bread. Famine in Old Testament depicts sore need (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#013">Isa 5:13</A>). Contrast the pious man's lot (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#020">Job 5:20-22</A>). 
<p>
<p>knoweth--has the firm conviction. Contrast the same word applied to the pious (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#024">Job 5:24-25</A>). 
<p>
<p>ready at his hand--an Arabic phrase to denote a thing's complete readiness and full presence, as if in the hand.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#024">Job 15:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">job 15:24</A></FONT></span></p>prevail--break upon him suddenly and terribly, as a king, &amp;c. (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#011">Pro 6:11</A>).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_026">job 15:26</A></FONT></span></p>on his neck--rather, "with outstretched neck," namely, that of the rebel [UMBREIT] (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#005">Psa 75:5</A>). 
<p>
<p>upon . . . bucklers--rather, "with--his (the rebel's, not God's) bucklers." The rebel and his fellows are depicted as joining shields together, to form a compact covering over their heads against the weapons hurled on them from a fortress [UMBREIT and GESENIUS].
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#027">Job 15:27</A></p>

<p>
<p>collops--masses of fat. He pampers and fattens himself with sensual indulgences; hence his rebellion against God (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#015">Deu 32:15</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#029">Sa1 2:29</A>).

Eliphaz chooses this class because Job had chosen the same (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#006">Job 12:6</A>). 
<p>
<p>heaps--of ruins.

<p>perfection--rather, "His acquired wealth--what he possesses--shall not be extended," &amp;c.

<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#030">Job 15:30</A></p>

<p>
<p>vanity--that which is unsubstantial. Sin is its own punishment (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#031">Pro 1:31</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#019">Jer 2:19</A>).

The "fire of God" that consumed Job's possessions (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#016">Job 1:16</A>) Eliphaz insinuates may have been on account of Job's bribery as an Arab sheik or emir.
