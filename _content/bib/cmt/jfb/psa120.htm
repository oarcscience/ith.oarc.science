<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#002">Psalms 120:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">psa 120:2</A></FONT></span></p>This is the first of fifteen Psalms (Psalms 120-134) entitled "A Song of Degrees" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#001">Psa 121:1</A> --literally, "A song for the degrees"), or ascents. It seems most probable they were designed for the use of the people when going up (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#027">Kg1 12:27-28</A>) to Jerusalem on the festival occasions (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#016">Deu 16:16</A>), three times a year. David appears as the author of four, Solomon of one (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#001">Psa 127:1</A>), and the other ten are anonymous, probably composed after the captivity. In this Psalm the writer acknowledges God's mercy, prays for relief from a malicious foe, whose punishment he anticipates, and then repeats his complaint. (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#001">Psa 120:1-7</A>)
<p>
<p>Slander and deceit charged on his foes implies his innocence.

<p>
<p>coals of juniper--which retain heat long. This verse may be read as a description of the wicked, but better as their punishment, in reply to the question of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#003">Psa 120:3</A>.

<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#005">Psalms 120:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">psa 120:5</A></FONT></span></p>A residence in these remote lands pictures his miserable condition.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">psa 120:6</A></FONT></span></p>While those who surrounded him were maliciously hostile, he was disposed to peace. This Psalm may well begin such a series as this, as a contrast to the promised joys of God's worship.
