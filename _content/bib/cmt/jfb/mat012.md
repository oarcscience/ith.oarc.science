### [Matthew Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#001)

[Matthew 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 12:1</span></span>

PLUCKING CORN EARS ON THE SABBATH DAY. ( = [Mar
2:23-28](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#023); [Luk
6:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#001)). ([Mat
12:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#001))

At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn--"the
cornfields" ([Mar 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#023); [Luk
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#001)).

and his disciples were an hungered--not as one may be before his regular
meals; but evidently from shortness of provisions: for Jesus defends
their plucking the corn-ears and eating them on the plea of necessity.

and began to pluck the ears of corn, and to eat--"rubbing them in their
hands" ([Luk 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#001)).

[Matthew 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 12:2</span></span>

But when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto him, Behold, thy disciples
do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day--The act itself
was expressly permitted ([Deu 23:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#025)).
But as being "servile work," which was prohibited on the sabbath day, it
was regarded as sinful.

[Matthew 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 12:3</span></span>

But he said unto them, Have ye not read--or, as Mark ([Mar
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#025)) has it, "Have ye never read."

what David did when he was an hungered, and they that were with him--
([Sa1 21:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#001))

[Matthew 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mat 12:4</span></span>

How he entered into the house of God, and did eat the showbread, which
was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them which were with him, but
only for the priests?--No example could be more apposite than this. The
man after God's own heart, of whom the Jews ever boasted, when suffering
in God's cause and straitened for provisions, asked and obtained from
the high priest what, according to the law, it was illegal for anyone
save the priests to touch. Mark ([Mar
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#026)) says this occurred "in the days
of Abiathar the high priest." But this means not during his high
priesthood--for it was under that of his father Ahimelech--but simply,
in his time. Ahimelech was soon succeeded by Abiathar, whose connection
with David, and prominence during his reign, may account for his name,
rather than his father's, being here introduced. Yet there is not a
little confusion in what is said of these priests in different parts of
the Old Testament. Thus he is called both the son of the father of
Ahimelech ([Sa1 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#020); [Sa2
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#017)); and Ahimelech is called Ahiah
([Sa1 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#003)), and Abimelech ([Ch1
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#016)).

[Matthew 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mat 12:5</span></span>

Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days the priests
in the temple profane the sabbath--by doing "servile work."

and are blameless?--The double offerings required on the sabbath day
([Num 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#009)) could not be presented,
and the new-baked showbread ([Lev
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#005); [Ch1
9:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#032)) could not be prepared and
presented every sabbath morning, without a good deal of servile work on
the part of the priests; not to speak of circumcision, which, when the
child's eighth day happened to fall on a sabbath, had to be performed by
the priests on that day. (See on [Joh
7:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#022)).

[Matthew 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mat 12:6</span></span>

But I say unto you, That in this place is one greater than the
temple--or rather, according to the reading which is best supported,
"something greater." The argument stands thus: "The ordinary rules for
the observance of the sabbath give way before the requirements of the
temple; but there are rights here before which the temple itself must
give way." Thus indirectly, but not the less decidedly, does our Lord
put in His own claims to consideration in this question--claims to be
presently put in even more nakedly.

[Matthew 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mat 12:7</span></span>

But if ye had known what this meaneth, I will have mercy, and not
sacrifice-- ([Hos 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#006); [Mic
6:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#006), &c.). See on [Mat
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#013).

ye would not have condemned the guiltless--that is, Had ye understood
the great principle of all religion, which the Scripture everywhere
recognizes--that ceremonial observances must give way before moral
duties, and particularly the necessities of nature--ye would have
refrained from these captious complaints against men who in this matter
are blameless. But our Lord added a specific application of this great
principle to the law of the sabbath, preserved only in Mark: "And he
said unto them, the sabbath was made for man, and not man for the
sabbath" ([Mar 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#027)). A glorious and
far-reaching maxim, alike for the permanent establishment of the sabbath
and the true freedom of its observance.

[Matthew 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mat 12:8</span></span>

For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day--In what sense now is
the Son of man Lord of the sabbath day? Not surely to abolish it--that
surely were a strange lordship, especially just after saying that it was
made or instituted for MAN--but to own it, to interpret it, to preside
over it, and to ennoble it, by merging it in the "Lord's Day" ([Rev
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#010)), breathing into it an air of
liberty and love necessarily unknown before, and thus making it the
nearest resemblance to the eternal sabbatism.

[Matthew 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 12:9</span></span>

THE HEALING OF A WITHERED HAND ON THE SABBATH DAY AND RETIREMENT OF
JESUS TO AVOID DANGER. ( = [Mar
3:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#001); [Luk
6:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#006)). ([Mat
12:9-21](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#009))

And when he was departed thence--but "on another sabbath" ([Luk
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#006)).

he went into their synagogue--and taught," He had now, no doubt, arrived
in Galilee; but this, it would appear, did not occur at Capernaum, for
after it was over, He "withdrew Himelf," it is said "to the sea" ([Mar
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#007)), whereas Capernaum was at the
sea.

And, behold, there was a man which had his hand withered--disabled by
paralysis (as in [Kg1 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#004)). It was
his right hand, as Luke ([Luk 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#006))
graphically notes. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on
the sabbath days? that they might accuse him--Mark and Luke ([Mar
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#002); [Luk
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#007)) say they "watched Him whether He
would heal on the sabbath day." They were now come to the length of
dogging His steps, to collect materials for a charge of impiety against
Him. It is probable that it was to their thoughts rather than their
words that Jesus addressed Himself in what follows.

[Matthew 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mat 12:11</span></span>

And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you that shall have
one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay
hold on it, and lift it out?

[Matthew 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mat 12:12</span></span>

How much then is a man better than a sheep?--Resistless appeal! "A
righteous man regardeth the life of his beast" ([Pro
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#010)), and would instinctively rescue
it from death or suffering on the sabbath day; how much more his nobler
fellow man! But the reasoning, as given in the other two Gospels, is
singularly striking: "But He knew their thoughts, and said to the man
which had the withered hand, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And
he arose and stood forth. Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one
thing: Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to
save life or to destroy it?" ([Luk
6:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#008)), or as in Mark ([Mar
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#004)), "to kill?" He thus shuts them up
to this startling alternative: "Not to do good, when it is in the power
of our hand to do it, is to do evil; not to save life, when we can, is
to kill"--and must the letter of the sabbath rest be kept at this
expense? This unexpected thrust shut their mouths. By this great ethical
principle our Lord, we see, held Himself bound, as man. But here we must
turn to Mark, whose graphic details make the second Gospel so
exceedingly precious. "When He had looked round about on them with
anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, He saith unto the
man" ([Mar 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#005)). This is one of the
very few passages in the Gospel history which reveal our Lord's
feelings. How holy this anger was appears from the "grief" which mingled
with it at "the hardness of their hearts."

[Matthew 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mat 12:13</span></span>

Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it
forth--the power to obey going forth with the word of command.

and it was restored whole, like as the other--The poor man, having faith
in this wonderful Healer--which no doubt the whole scene would
singularly help to strengthen--disregarded the proud and venomous
Pharisees, and thus gloriously put them to shame.

[Matthew 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mat 12:14</span></span>

Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how they
might destroy him--This is the first explicit mention of their murderous
designs against our Lord. Luke ([Luk
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#011)) says, they were filled with
madness, and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus." But
their doubt was not, whether to get rid of Him, but how to compass it.
Mark ([Mar 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#006)), as usual, is more
definite: "The Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with
the Herodians against Him, how they might destroy Him." These Herodians
were supporters of Herod's dynasty, created by CÃ&brvbr;sar--a political
rather than religious party. The Pharisees regarded them as untrue to
their religion and country. But here we see them combining together
against Christ as a common enemy. So on a subsequent occasion ([Mat
22:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#015)).

Jesus Retires to Avoid Danger ([Mat
12:15-21](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#015)).

[Matthew 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mat 12:15</span></span>

But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from thence--whither, our
Evangelist says not; but Mark ([Mar
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#007)) says "it was to the sea"--to some
distance, no doubt, from the scene of the miracle, the madness, and the
plotting just recorded.

and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all--Mark gives
the following interesting details: "A great multitude from Galilee
followed Him, and from Judea and from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and
from beyond Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude,
when they had heard what great things He did, came unto Him. And He
spake to His disciples, that a small ship should wait on Him because of
the multitude, lest they should throng Him. For He had healed many;
insomuch that they pressed upon Him for to touch Him, as many as had
plagues. And unclean spirits, when they saw Him, fell down before Him,
and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God. And He straitly charged them
that they should not make Him known" ([Mar
3:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#007)). How glorious this extorted
homage to the Son of God! But as this was not the time, so neither were
they the fitting preachers, as BENGEL says. (See on [Mar
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#025), and compare [Jam
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#019)). Coming back now to our
Evangelist: after saying, "He healed them all," he continues:

[Matthew 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mat 12:16</span></span>

And charged them--the healed.

that they should not make him known--(See on [Mat
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#004)).

[Matthew 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mat 12:17</span></span>

That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet,
saying-- ([Isa 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001)).

[Matthew 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mat 12:18</span></span>

Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is
well pleased: I will put my Spirit upon him, and he shall show judgment
to the Gentiles.

[Matthew 12:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mat 12:19</span></span>

He shall not strive nor cry; neither shall any man hear his voice in the
streets.

[Matthew 12:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mat 12:20</span></span>

A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench,
till he send forth judgment unto victory--"unto truth," says the Hebrew
original, and the Septuagint also. But our Evangelist merely seizes the
spirit, instead of the letter of the prediction in this point. The
grandeur and completeness of Messiah's victories would prove, it seems,
not more wonderful than the unobtrusive noiselessness with which they
were to be achieved. And whereas one rough touch will break a bruised
reed, and quench the flickering, smoking flax, His it should be, with
matchless tenderness, love, and skill, to lift up the meek, to
strengthen the weak hands and confirm the feeble knees, to comfort all
that mourn, to say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear
not.

[Matthew 12:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mat 12:21</span></span>

And in his name shall the Gentiles trust--Part of His present audience
were Gentiles--from Tyre and Sidon--first-fruits of the great Gentile
harvest contemplated in the prophecy.

[Matthew 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mat 12:22</span></span>

A BLIND AND DUMB DEMONIAC HEALED AND REPLY TO THE MALIGNANT EXPLANATION
PUT UPON IT. ( = [Mar 3:20-30](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#020); [Luk
11:14-23](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#014)). (Mat. 12:22-37)

Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil--"a demonized
person."

blind and dumb, and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and the dumb
both spake and saw.

[Matthew 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mat 12:23</span></span>

And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son of
David?--The form of the interrogative requires this to be rendered, "Is
this the Son of David?" And as questions put in this form (in Greek)
suppose doubt, and expect rather a negative answer, the meaning is, "Can
it possibly be?"--the people thus indicating their secret impression
that this must be He; yet saving themselves from the wrath of the
ecclesiastics, which a direct assertion of it would have brought upon
them. (On a similar question, see on [Joh
4:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#029); and on the phrase, "Son of
David," see on [Mat 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#027)).

[Matthew 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mat 12:24</span></span>

But when the Pharisees heard it--Mark ([Mar
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#022)) says, "the scribes which came
down from Jerusalem"; so that this had been a hostile party of the
ecclesiastics, who had come all the way from Jerusalem to collect
materials for a charge against Him. (See on [Mat
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#014)).

they said, This fellow--an expression of contempt.

doth not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub--rather, "Beelzebul" (see on
[Mat 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#025)).

the prince of the devils--Two things are here implied--first, that the
bitterest enemies of our Lord were unable to deny the reality of His
miracles; and next, that they believed in an organized internal kingdom
of evil, under one chief. This belief would be of small consequence, had
not our Lord set His seal to it; but this He immediately does. Stung by
the unsophisticated testimony of "all the people," they had no way of
holding out against His claims but the desperate shift of ascribing His
miracles to Satan.

[Matthew 12:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mat 12:25</span></span>

And Jesus knew their thoughts--"called them" ([Mar
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#023)).

and said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to
desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not
stand--"house," that is, "household"

[Matthew 12:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mat 12:26</span></span>

And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how shall
then his kingdom stand?--The argument here is irresistible. "No
organized society can stand--whether kingdom, city, or household--when
turned against itself; such intestine war is suicidal: But the works I
do are destructive of Satan's kingdom: That I should be in league with
Satan, therefore, is incredible and absurd."

[Matthew 12:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mat 12:27</span></span>

And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children--"your
sons," meaning here the "disciples" or pupils of the Pharisees, who were
so termed after the familiar language of the Old Testament in speaking
of the sons of the prophets ([Kg1
20:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#035); [Kg2
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#003), &c.). Our Lord here seems to
admit that such works were wrought by them; in which case the Pharisees
stood self-condemned, as expressed in Luke ([Luk
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#019)), "Therefore shall they be your
judges."

[Matthew 12:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mat 12:28</span></span>

But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God--In Luke ([Luk
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#020)) it is, "with (or 'by') the
finger of God." This latter expression is just a figurative way of
representing the power of God, while the former tells us the living
Personal Agent was made use of by the Lord Jesus in every exercise of
that power.

then--"no doubt" ([Luk 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#020)).

the kingdom of God is come unto you--rather "upon you," as the same
expression is rendered in Luke ([Luk
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#020)): --that is, "If this expulsion
of Satan is, and can be, by no other than the Spirit of God, then is his
Destroyer already in the midst of you, and that kingdom which is
destined to supplant his is already rising on its ruins."

[Matthew 12:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">mat 12:29</span></span>

Or else how can one enter into a strong man's house--or rather, "the
strong man's house."

and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he
will spoil his house.

[Matthew 12:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">mat 12:30</span></span>

He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me
scattereth abroad--On this important parable, in connection with the
corresponding one ([Mat 12:43-45](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#043)), see
on [Luk 11:21-26](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#021).

[Matthew 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">mat 12:31</span></span>

Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be
forgiven unto men--The word "blasphemy" properly signifies "detraction,"
or "slander." In the New Testament it is applied, as it is here, to
vituperation directed against God as well as against men; and in this
sense it is to be understood as an aggravated form of sin. Well, says
our Lord, all sin--whether in its ordinary or its more aggravated
forms--shall find forgiveness with God. Accordingly, in Mark ([Mar
3:28](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#028)) the language is still stronger:
"All sin shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies
wherewith soever they shall blaspheme." There is no sin whatever, it
seems, of which it may be said. "That is not a pardonable sin." This
glorious assurance is not to be limited by what follows; but, on the
contrary, what follows is to be explained by this.

but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men.

[Matthew 12:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mat 12:32</span></span>

And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be
forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall
not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to
come--In Mark the language is awfully strong, "hath never forgiveness,
but is in danger of eternal damnation"--or rather, according to what
appears to be the preferable though very unusual reading, "in danger of
eternal guilt"--a guilt which he will underlie for ever. Mark has the
important addition ([Mar 3:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#030)),
"Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit." (See on [Mat
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#025)). What, then, is this sin
against the Holy Ghost--the unpardonable sin? One thing is clear: Its
unpardonableness cannot arise from anything in the nature of sin itself;
for that would be a naked contradiction to the emphatic declaration of
[Mat 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#031), that all manner of sin is
pardonable. And what is this but the fundamental truth of the Gospel?
(See [Act 13:38-39](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#038); [Rom
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#022), [Rom
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#024); [Jo1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#007), &c.). Then, again when it is said
([Mat 12:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#032)), that to speak against or
blaspheme the Son of man is pardonable, but the blasphemy against the
Holy Ghost is not pardonable, it is not to be conceived that this arises
from any greater sanctity in the one blessed Person than the other.
These remarks so narrow the question that the true sense of our Lord's
words seem to disclose themselves at once. It is a contrast between
slandering "the Son of man" in His veiled condition and unfinished
work--which might be done "ignorantly, in unbelief" ([Ti1
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#013)), and slandering the same blessed
Person after the blaze of glory which the Holy Ghost was soon to throw
around His claims, and in the full knowledge of all that. This would be
to slander Him with eyes open, or to do it "presumptuously." To
blaspheme Christ in the former condition--when even the apostles
stumbled at many things--left them still open to conviction on fuller
light: but to blaspheme Him in the latter condition would be to hate the
light the clearer it became, and resolutely to shut it out; which, of
course, precludes salvation. (See on [Heb
10:26-29](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#026)). The Pharisees had not as
yet done this; but in charging Jesus with being in league with hell they
were displaying beforehand a malignant determination to shut their eyes
to all evidence, and so, bordering upon, and in spirit committing, the
unpardonable sin.

[Matthew 12:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">mat 12:33</span></span>

Either make the tree good, &c.

[Matthew 12:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mat 12:34</span></span>

O generation of vipers--(See on [Mat
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#007)).

how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of
the heart the mouth speaketh--a principle obvious enough, yet of deepest
significance and vast application. In [Luk
6:45](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#045) we find it uttered as part of the
discourse delivered after the choice of the apostles.

[Matthew 12:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">mat 12:35</span></span>

A good man, out of the good treasure of the heart, bringeth forth good
things--or, "putteth forth good things":

and an evil man, out of the evil treasure, bringeth forth evil
things--or "putteth forth evil things." The word "putteth " indicates
the spontaneity of what comes from the heart; for it is out of the
abundance of the heart that the mouth speaketh. We have here a new
application of a former saying (see on [Mat
7:16-20](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#016)). Here, the sentiment is,
"There are but two kingdoms, interests, parties--with the proper
workings of each: If I promote the one, I cannot belong to the other;
but they that set themselves in wilful opposition to the kingdom of
light openly proclaim to what other kingdom they belong. As for you, in
what ye have now uttered, ye have but revealed the venomous malignity of
your hearts."

[Matthew 12:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">mat 12:36</span></span>

But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they
shall give account thereof in the day of judgment--They might say, "It
was nothing: we meant no evil; we merely threw out a supposition, as one
way of accounting for the miracle we witnessed; if it will not stand,
let it go; why make so much of it, and bear down with such severity for
it?" Jesus replies, "It was not nothing, and at the great day will not
be treated as nothing: Words, as the index of the heart, however idle
they may seem, will be taken account of, whether good or bad, in
estimating character in the day of judgment."

[Matthew 12:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">mat 12:38</span></span>

A SIGN DEMANDED AND THE REPLY--HIS MOTHER AND BRETHREN SEEK TO SPEAK
WITH HIM, AND THE ANSWER. ( = [Luk
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#016), [Luk
11:24-36](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#024); [Mar
3:31-35](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#031); [Luk
8:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#019)). ([Mat
12:38-50](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#038))

Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying,
Master--"Teacher," equivalent to "Rabbi."

we would see a sign from thee--"a sign from heaven" ([Luk
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#016)); something of an immediate and
decisive nature, to show, not that His miracles were real--that they
seemed willing to concede--but that they were from above, not from
beneath. These were not the same class with those who charged Him with
being in league with Satan (as we see from [Luk
11:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#015)); but as the spirit of both
was similar, the tone of severe rebuke is continued.

[Matthew 12:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">mat 12:39</span></span>

But he answered and said unto them--"when the people were gathered thick
together" ([Luk 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#029)).

An evil and adulterous generation--This latter expression is best
explained by [Jer 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#020), "Surely as a
wife treacherously departeth from her husband, so have ye dealt
treacherously with Me, O house of Israel, saith the Lord." For this was
the relationship in which He stood to the covenant-people--"I am married
unto you" ([Jer 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#014)).

seeketh after a sign--In the eye of Jesus this class were but the
spokesmen of their generation, the exponents of the reigning spirit of
unbelief.

and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet
Jonas.

[Matthew 12:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">mat 12:40</span></span>

For as Jonas was--"a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the Son of
man be to this generation" ([Luk
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#030)). For as Jonas was

three days and three nights in the whale's belly-- ([Jon
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#017)).

so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of
the earth--This was the second public announcement of His resurrection
three days after His death. (For the first, see [Joh
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#019)). Jonah's case was analogous to
this, as being a signal judgment of God; reversed in three days; and
followed by a glorious mission to the Gentiles. The expression "in the
heart of the earth," suggested by the expression of Jonah with respect
to the sea ([Jon 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/jon002.htm#003), in the
Septuagint), means simply the grave, but this considered as the most
emphatic expression of real and total entombment. The period during
which He was to lie in the grave is here expressed in round numbers,
according to the Jewish way of speaking, which was to regard any part of
a day, however small, included within a period of days, as a full day.
(See [Sa1 30:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#012); [Est
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/est004.htm#016); [Est
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#001); [Mat
27:63-64](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#063), &c.).

[Matthew 12:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">mat 12:41</span></span>

The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, &c.--The
Ninevites, though heathens, repented at a man's preaching; while they,
God's covenant-people, repented not at the preaching of the Son of
God--whose supreme dignity is rather implied here than expressed.

[Matthew 12:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">mat 12:42</span></span>

The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this
generation, &c.--The queen of Sheba (a tract in Arabia, near the shores
of the Red Sea) came from a remote country, "south" of Judea, to hear
the wisdom of a mere man, though a gifted one, and was transported with
wonder at what she saw and heard ([Kg1
10:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#001)). They, when a Greater than
Solomon had come to them, despised and rejected, slighted and slandered
Him.

[Matthew 12:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">mat 12:43</span></span>

When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, &c.--On this important
parable, in connection with the corresponding one ([Mat
12:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#029)) see on [Luk
11:21-26](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#021).

A charming little incident, given only in [Luk
11:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#027), seems to have its proper
place here.

[Luk 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#027) :

And it came to pass, as He spake these things, a certain woman of the
company--out of the crowd.

lifted up her voice and said unto Him, Blessed is the womb that bare
Thee, and the paps which Thou hast sucked--With true womanly feeling she
envies the mother of such a wonderful Teacher. And a higher and better
than she had said as much before her (see on [Luk
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#028)). How does our Lord, then, treat
it? He is far from condemning it. He only holds up as "blessed rather"
another class: [Luk 11:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#028) :

But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, and
keep it--in other words, the humblest real saint of God. How utterly
alien is this sentiment from the teaching of the Church of Rome, which
would doubtless excommunicate any one of its members that dared to talk
in such a strain!

His Mother and Brethren Seek to Speak with Hint and the Answer ([Mat
12:46-50](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#046)).

[Matthew 12:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#046)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">mat 12:46</span></span>

While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his
brethren--(See on [Mat 13:55-56](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#055)).

stood without, desiring to speak with him--"and could not come at Him
for the press" ([Luk 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#019)). For what
purpose these came, we learn from [Mar
3:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#020). In His zeal and ardor He
seemed indifferent both to food and repose, and "they went to lay hold
of Him" as one "beside Himself." Mark ([Mar
3:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#032)) says graphically, "And the
multitude sat about Him"--or "around Him."

[Matthew 12:47](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#047)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">mat 12:47</span></span>

Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand
without, desiring to speak with thee, &c.--Absorbed in the awful
warnings He was pouring forth. He felt this to be an unseasonable
interruption, fitted to dissipate the impression made upon the large
audience--such an interruption as duty to the nearest relatives did not
require Him to give way to. But instead of a direct rebuke, He seizes on
the incident to convey a sublime lesson, expressed in a style of
inimitable condescension.

[Matthew 12:49](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#049)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">mat 12:49</span></span>

And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples--How graphic is
this! It is the language evidently of an eye-witness.

and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!

[Matthew 12:50](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#050)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">mat 12:50</span></span>

For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the
same is my brother, and sister, and mother--that is, "There stand here
the members of a family transcending and surviving this of earth: Filial
subjection to the will of My Father in heaven is the indissoluble bond
of union between Me and all its members; and whosoever enters this
hallowed circle becomes to Me brother, and sister, and mother!"
