### [Titus Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#001)

[Titus 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">tit 1:1</span></span>

ADDRESS: FOR WHAT END TITUS WAS LEFT IN CRETE. QUALIFICATIONS FOR
ELDERS: GAINSAYERS IN CRETE NEEDING REPROOF. (Tit. 1:1-16)

servant of God--not found elsewhere in the same connection. In [Rom
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#001) it is "servant of Jesus Christ"
([Gal 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#010); [Phi
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#001); compare [Act
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#017); [Rev
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#001); [Rev
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#003)). In [Rom
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#001), there follows, "called to be an
apostle," which corresponds to the general designation of the office
first, "servant of GOD," here, followed by the special description,
"apostle of Jesus Christ." The full expression of his apostolic office
answers, in both Epistles, to the design, and is a comprehensive index
to the contents. The peculiar form here would never have proceeded from
a forger.

according to the faith--rather, "for," "with a view to subserve the
faith"; this is the object of my apostleship (compare [Tit
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#004), [Tit
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#009); [Rom
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#005)).

the elect--for whose sake we ought to endure all things ([Ti2
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#010)). This election has its ground,
not in anything belonging to those thus distinguished, but in the
purpose and will of God from everlasting ([Ti2
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#009); [Rom
8:30-33](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#030); compare [Luk
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#007); [Eph
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#004); [Col
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#012)). [Act
13:48](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#048) shows that all faith on the part
of the elect, rests on the divine foreordination: they do not become
elect by their faith, but receive faith, and so become believers,
because they are elect.

and the acknowledging of the truth--"and (for promoting) the full
knowledge of the truth," that is, the Christian truth ([Eph
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#013)).

after godliness--that is, which belongs to piety: opposed to the
knowledge which has not for its object the truth, but error, doctrinal
and practical ([Tit 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#011), [Tit
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#016); [Ti1
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#003)); or even which has for its object
mere earthly truth, not growth in the divine life. "Godliness," or
"piety," is a term peculiar to the Pastoral Epistles: a fact explained
by the apostle having in them to combat doctrine tending to
"ungodliness" ([Ti2 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#016); compare [Tit
2:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#011)).

[Titus 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">tit 1:2</span></span>

In hope of eternal life--connected with the whole preceding sentence.
That whereon rests my aim as an apostle to promote the elect's faith and
full knowledge of the truth, is, "the hope of eternal life" ([Tit
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#013); [Tit
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#007); [Act
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#006); [Act
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#015); [Act
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#020)).

that cannot lie-- ([Rom 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#004); [Rom
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#029); [Heb
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#018)).

promised before the world began--a contracted expression for "purposed
before the world began (literally, 'before the ages of time'), and
promised actually in time," the promise springing from the eternal
purpose; as in [Ti2 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#009), the gift of
grace was the result of the eternal purpose "before the world began."

[Titus 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">tit 1:3</span></span>

in due times--Greek, "in its own seasons," the seasons appropriate to
it, and fixed by God for it ([Act
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#007)).

manifested--implying that the "promise," [Tit
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#002), had lain hidden in His eternal
purpose heretofore (compare [Col 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#026);
[Ti2 1:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#009)).

his word--equivalent to "eternal life" ([Tit
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#002); [Joh
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#024); [Joh
6:63](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#063); [Joh
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#003), [Joh
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#017)).

through preaching--Greek, "in preaching," of rather as ALFORD (see on
[Ti2 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#017)), "in the (Gospel)
proclamation (the thing preached, the Gospel) with which I was
entrusted."

according to--in pursuance of (compare [Ti1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#001)).

of God our Saviour--rather as Greek, "of our Saviour God." God is
predicated of our Saviour (compare [Jde
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#025); [Luk
1:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#047)). Also [Psa
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#005); [Isa
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#002); [Isa
45:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#015), [Isa
45:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#021), Septuagint. Applied to Jesus,
[Tit 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#004); [Tit
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#013); [Tit
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#006); [Ti2
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#010).

[Titus 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">tit 1:4</span></span>

Titus, mine own son--Greek, "my genuine child" ([Ti1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#002)), that is, converted by my
instrumentality ([Co1 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#017); [Plm
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#010)).

after the common faith--a genuine son in respect to (in virtue of) the
faith common to all the people of God, comprising in a common
brotherhood Gentiles as well as Jews, therefore embracing Titus a
Gentile ([Pe2 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#001); [Jde
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#003)).

Grace, mercy, and peace--"mercy" is omitted in some of the oldest
manuscripts. But one of the best and oldest manuscripts supports it
(compare Notes, see on [Ti1 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#002); [Ti2
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#002)). There are many similarities of
phrase in the Pastoral Epistles.

the Lord Jesus Christ--The oldest manuscripts read only "Christ Jesus."

our Saviour--found thus added to "Christ" only in Paul's Pastoral
Epistles, and in [Pe2 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#001), [Pe2
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#011); [Pe2
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#020); [Pe2
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#018).

[Titus 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">tit 1:5</span></span>

I left thee--"I left thee behind" \[ALFORD\] when I left the island: not
implying permanence of commission (compare [Ti1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#003)).

in Crete--now Candia.

set in order--rather as Greek, "that thou mightest follow up (the work
begun by me), setting right the things that are wanting," which I was
unable to complete by reason of the shortness of my stay in Crete.
Christianity, doubtless, had long existed in Crete: there were some
Cretans among those who heard Peter's preaching on Pentecost ([Act
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#011)). The number of Jews in Crete was
large ([Tit 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#010)), and it is likely
that those scattered in the persecution of Stephen ([Act
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#019)) preached to them, as they did
to the Jews of Cyprus, &c. Paul also was there on his voyage to Rome
([Act 27:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#007)). By all these
instrumentalities the Gospel was sure to reach Crete. But until Paul's
later visit, after his first imprisonment at Rome, the Cretan Christians
were without Church organization. This Paul began, and had commissioned
(before leaving Crete) Titus to go on with, and now reminds him of that
commission.

ordain--rather, "appoint," "constitute."

in every city--"from city to city."

as I . . . appointed thee--that is, as I directed thee; prescribing as
well the act of constituting elders, as also the manner of doing so,
which latter includes the qualifications required in a presbyter
presently stated. Those called "elders" here are called "bishops" in
[Tit 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#007). Elder is the term of dignity
in relation to the college of presbyters; bishop points to the duties of
his office in relation to the flock. From the unsound state of the
Cretan Christians described here, we see the danger of the want of
Church government. The appointment of presbyters was designed to check
idle talk and speculation, by setting forth the "faithful word."

[Titus 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">tit 1:6</span></span>

(Compare Notes, see on [Ti1 3:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#002).)
The thing dwelt on here as the requisite in a bishop, is a good
reputation among those over whom he is to be set. The immorality of the
Cretan professors rendered this a necessary requisite in one who was to
be a reprover: and their unsoundness in doctrine also made needful great
steadfastness in the faith ([Tit 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#009),
[Tit 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#013)).

having faithful children--that is, believing children. He who could not
bring his children to faith, how shall he bring others? \[BENGEL\].
ALFORD explains, "established in the faith."

not accused--not merely not riotous, but "not (even) accused of riot"
("profligacy" \[ALFORD\]; "dissolute life" \[WAHL\]).

unruly--insubordinate; opposed to "in subjection" ([Ti1
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#004)).

[Titus 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">tit 1:7</span></span>

For . . . must--The emphasis is on "must." The reason why I said
"blameless," is the very idea of a "bishop" (an overseer of the flock;
he here substitutes for "presbyter" the term which expresses his duties)
involves the necessity for such blamelessness, if he is to have
influence over the flock.

steward of God--The greater the master is, the greater the virtues
required in His servant \[BENGEL\], ([Ti1
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#015)); the Church is God's house, over
which the minister is set as a steward ([Heb
3:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#002); [Pe1
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#010), [Pe1
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#017)). Note: ministers are not merely
Church officers, but God's stewards; Church government is of divine
appointment.

not self-willed--literally, "self-pleasing"; unaccommodating to others;
harsh, the opposite of "a lover of hospitality" ([Tit
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#006)); so Nabal (1Sa. 25:1-44);
self-loving and imperious; such a spirit would incapacitate him for
leading a willing flock, instead of driving.

not given to wine--(See on [Ti1 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#003);
[Ti1 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#008)).

not given to filthy lucre--not making the Gospel a means of gain ([Ti1
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#003), [Ti1
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#008)). In opposition to those "teaching
for filthy lucre's sake" ([Tit 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#011);
[Ti1 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#005); [Pe1
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#002)).

[Titus 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">tit 1:8</span></span>

lover of hospitality--needed especially in those days ([Rom
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#013); [Ti1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#002); [Heb
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#002); [Pe1
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#009); [Jo3
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#005)). Christians travelling from one
place to another were received and forwarded on their journey by their
brethren.

lover of good men--Greek, "a lover of (all that is) good," men or things
([Phi 4:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#008)).

sober--towards one's self; "discreet"; "self-restrained" \[ALFORD\],
(see on [Ti1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#009)).

just--towards "men."

holy--towards God (see on [Th1 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#010)).

temperate--"One having his passions, tongue, hand and eyes, at command"
\[CHRYSOSTOM\]; "continent."

[Titus 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">tit 1:9</span></span>

Holding fast--Holding firmly to (compare [Mat
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#024); [Luk
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#013)).

the faithful--true and trustworthy ([Ti1
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#015)).

word as he has been taught--literally, "the word (which is) according to
the teaching" which he has received (compare [Ti1
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#006), end; [Ti2
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#014)).

by--Translate as Greek, "to exhort in doctrine (instruction) which is
sound"; sound doctrine or instruction is the element IN which his
exhorting is to have place . . . On "sound" (peculiar to the Pastoral
Epistles), see [Ti1 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#010); [Ti1
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#003).

convince--rather, "reprove" \[ALFORD\], ([Tit
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#013)).

[Titus 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">tit 1:10</span></span>

unruly--"insubordinate."

and--omitted in the oldest manuscripts. "There are many unruly persons,
vain talkers, and deceivers"; "unruly" being predicated of both vain
talkers and deceivers.

vain talkers--opposed to "holding fast the faithful word" ([Tit
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#009)). "Vain jangling" ([Ti1
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#006)); "foolish questions, unprofitable
and vain" ([Tit 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#009)). The source of
the evil was corrupted Judaism ([Tit
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#014)). Many Jews were then living in
Crete, according to JOSEPHUS; so the Jewish leaven remained in some of
them after conversion.

deceivers--literally, "deceivers of the minds of others" (Greek, [Gal
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#003)).

[Titus 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">tit 1:11</span></span>

mouths . . . stopped--literally, "muzzled," "bridled" as an unruly beast
(compare [Psa 32:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#009)).

who--Greek, "(seeing that they are) such men as"; or "inasmuch as they"
\[ELLICOTT\].

subvert . . . houses--"overthrowing" their "faith" ([Ti2
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#018)). "They are the devil's levers by
which he subverts the houses of God" \[THEOPHYLACT\].

for filthy lucre-- ([Ti1 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#003), [Ti1
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#008); [Ti1
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#005)).

[Titus 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">tit 1:12</span></span>

One--Epimenides of PhÃ&brvbr;stus, or Gnossus, in Crete, about 600. He
was sent for to purify Athens from its pollution occasioned by Cylon. He
was regarded as a diviner and prophet. The words here are taken probably
from his treatise "concerning oracles." Paul also quotes from two other
heathen writers, ARATUS ([Act 17:28](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#028))
and MENANDER ([Co1 15:33](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#033)), but he does
not honor them so far as even to mention their names.

of themselves . . . their own--which enhances his authority as a
witness. "To Cretanize" was proverbial for to lie: as "to Corinthianize"
was for to be dissolute.

alway liars--not merely at times, as every natural man is. Contrast [Tit
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#002), "God that cannot lie." They love
"fables" ([Tit 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#014)); even the heathen
poets laughed at their lying assertion that they had in their country
the sepulchre of Jupiter.

evil beasts--rude, savage, cunning, greedy. Crete was a country without
wild beasts. Epimenides' sarcasm was that its human inhabitants supplied
the place of wild beasts.

slow bellies--indolent through pampering their bellies. They themselves
are called "bellies," for that is the member for which they live ([Rom
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#018); [Phi
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#019)).

[Titus 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">tit 1:13</span></span>

This witness--"This testimony (though coming from a Cretan) is true."

sharply--Gentleness would not reclaim so perverse offenders.

that they--that those seduced by the false teachers may be brought back
to soundness in the faith. Their malady is strifes about words and
questions ([Tit 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#009); [Ti1
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#004)).

[Titus 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">tit 1:14</span></span>

Jewish fables--(See on [Ti1 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#004); [Ti1
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#007); [Ti2
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#004)). These formed the transition
stage to subsequent Gnosticism; as yet the error was but profitless, and
not tending to godliness, rather than openly opposed to the faith.

commandments of men--as to ascetic abstinence ([Tit
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#015); [Mar
7:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#007); [Col
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#016), [Col
2:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#020); [Ti1
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#003)).

that turn from the truth--whose characteristic is that they turn away
from the truth ([Ti2 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#004)).

[Titus 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">tit 1:15</span></span>

all things--external, "are pure" in themselves; the distinction of pure
and impure is not in the things, but in the disposition of him who uses
them; in opposition to "the commandments of men" ([Tit
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#014)), which forbade certain things as
if impure intrinsically. "To the pure" inwardly, that is, those purified
in heart by faith ([Act 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#009); [Rom
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#020); [Ti1
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#003)), all outward things are pure; all
are open to, their use. Sin alone touches and defiles the soul ([Mat
23:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#026); [Luk
11:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#041)).

nothing pure--either within or without ([Rom
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#023)).

mind--their mental sense and intelligence.

conscience--their moral consciousness of the conformity or discrepancy
between their motives and acts on the one hand, and God's law on the
other. A conscience and a mind defiled are represented as the source of
the errors opposed in the Pastoral Epistles ([Ti1
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#019); [Ti1
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#009); [Ti1
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#005)).

[Titus 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">tit 1:16</span></span>

They profess--that is, make a profession acknowledging God. He does not
deny their theoretical knowledge of God, but that they practically know
Him.

deny him--the opposite of the previous "profess" or "confess" Him ([Ti1
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#008); [Ti2
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#012); [Ti2
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#005)).

abominable--themselves, though laying so much stress on the contracting
of abomination from outward things (compare [Lev
11:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#010); [Rom
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#022)).

disobedient--to God ([Tit 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#003); [Eph
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#002); [Eph
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#006)).

reprobate--rejected as worthless when tested (see on [Rom
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#028); [Co1
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#027); [Ti2
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#008)).
