### [Jeremiah Chapter 32](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 32:1</span></span>

JEREMIAH, IMPRISONED FOR HIS PROPHECY AGAINST JERUSALEM, BUYS A
PATRIMONIAL PROPERTY (HIS RELATIVE HANAMEEL'S), IN ORDER TO CERTIFY TO
THE JEWS THEIR FUTURE RETURN FROM BABYLON. ([Jer
32:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#001))

tenth year--The siege of Jerusalem had already begun, in the tenth month
of the ninth year of Zedekiah ([Jer
39:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#001); [Kg2
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#001)).

[Jeremiah 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 32:2</span></span>

in . . . court of . . . prison--that is, in the open space occupied by
the guard, from which he was not allowed to depart, but where any of his
friends might visit him ([Jer 32:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#012);
[Jer 38:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#013), [Jer
38:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#028)). Marvellous obstinacy, that at
the time when they were experiencing the truth of Jeremiah's words in
the pressure of the siege, they should still keep the prophet in
confinement \[CALVIN\]. The circumstances narrated ([Jer
32:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#003)) occurred at the beginning of
the siege, when Jeremiah foretold the capture of the city ([Jer
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#001); [Jer
34:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#001); [Jer
39:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#001)). He was at that time put into
free custody in the court of the prison. At the raising of the siege by
Pharaoh-hophra, Jeremiah was on the point of repairing to Benjamin, when
he was cast into "the dungeon," but obtained leave to be removed again
to the court of the prison ([Jer
37:12-21](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#012)). When there he urged the
Jews, on the second advance of the Chaldeans to the siege, to save
themselves by submission to Nebuchadnezzar ([Jer
38:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#002)); in consequence of this the
king, at the instigation of the princes, had him cast into a miry
dungeon ([Jer 38:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#004)); again he was
removed to the prison court at the intercession of a courtier ([Jer
32:7-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#007)), where he remained till the
capture of the city ([Jer 32:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#028)), when
he was liberated ([Jer 39:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#011), &c.;
[Jer 40:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#001), &c.).

[Jeremiah 32:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 32:4</span></span>

his eyes shall behold his eyes--that is, only before reaching Babylon,
which he was not to see. [Jer 39:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#006)
harmonizes this prophecy ([Jer 32:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#004))
with the seemingly opposite prophecy, [Eze
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#013), "He shall not see."

[Jeremiah 32:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 32:5</span></span>

visit him--in a good sense ([Jer
27:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#022)); referring to the honor paid
Zedekiah at his death and burial ([Jer
34:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#004)). Perhaps, too, before his
death he was treated by Nebuchadnezzar with some favor.

though ye fight . . . shall not prosper-- ([Jer
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#004)).

[Jeremiah 32:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 32:6</span></span>

Jeremiah said--resuming the thread of [Jer
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#001), which was interrupted by the
parenthesis ([Jer 32:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#002)).

[Jeremiah 32:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 32:7</span></span>

son of Shallum thine uncle--therefore, Jeremiah's first cousin.

field . . . in Anathoth--a sacerdotal city: and so having one thousand
cubits of suburban fields outside the wall attached to it ([Num
35:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#004)). The prohibition to sell these
suburban fields ([Lev 25:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#034)) applied
merely to their alienating them from Levites to another tribe; so that
this chapter does not contravene that prohibition. Besides, what is here
meant is only the purchase of the use of the field till the year of
jubilee. On the failure of the owner, the next of kin had the right of
redeeming it ([Lev 25:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#025), &c.; [Rut
4:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#003)).

[Jeremiah 32:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 32:8</span></span>

Then I knew--Not that Jeremiah previously doubted the reality of the
divine communication, but, the effect following it, and the prophet's
experimentally knowing it, confirmed his faith and was the seal to the
vision. The Roman historian, FLORUS (2.6), records a similar instance:
During the days that Rome was being besieged by Hannibal, the very
ground on which he was encamped was put up for sale at Rome, and found a
purchaser; implying the calm confidence of the ultimate issue
entertained by the Roman people.

[Jeremiah 32:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 32:9</span></span>

seventeen shekels of silver--As the shekel was only 2s. 4d.., the whole
would be under Â£2, a rather small sum, even taking into account the
fact of the Chaldean occupation of the land, and the uncertainty of the
time when it might come to Jeremiah or his heirs. Perhaps the "seven
shekels," which in the Hebrew (see Margin) are distinguished from the
"ten pieces of silver," were shekels of gold \[MAURER\].

[Jeremiah 32:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 32:10</span></span>

subscribed--I wrote in the deed, "book of purchase" ([Jer
32:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#012)).

weighed--coined money was not in early use; hence money was "weighed"
([Gen 23:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#016)).

[Jeremiah 32:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 32:11</span></span>

evidence . . . sealed . . . open--Two deeds were drawn up in a contract
of sale; the one, the original copy, witnessed and sealed with the
public seal; the other not so, but open, and therefore less
authoritative, being but a copy. GATAKER thinks that the purchaser
sealed the one with his own seal; the other he showed to witnesses that
they might write their names on the back of it and know the contents;
and that some details, for example, the conditions and time of
redemption were in the sealed copy, which the parties might not choose
to be known to the witnesses, and which were therefore not in the open
copy. The sealed copy, when opened after the seventy years' captivity,
would greatly confirm the faith of those living at that time. The "law
and custom" refer, probably, not merely to the sealing up of the
conditions and details of purchase, but also to the law of redemption,
according to which, at the return to Judea, the deed would show that
Jeremiah had bought the field by his right as next of kin ([Lev
25:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#013)), \[LUDOVICUS DE DIEU\].

[Jeremiah 32:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 32:12</span></span>

Baruch--Jeremiah's amanuensis and agent ([Jer
36:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#004), &c.).

before all--In sales everything clandestine was avoided; publicity was
required. So here, in the court of prison, where Jeremiah was confined,
there were soldiers and others, who had free access to him, present
([Jer 38:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#001)).

[Jeremiah 32:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 32:14</span></span>

in an earthen vessel--that the documents might not be injured by the
moisture of the surrounding earth; at the same time, being buried, they
could not be stolen, but would remain as a pledge of the Jews'
deliverance until God's time should come.

[Jeremiah 32:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 32:15</span></span>

(Compare [Jer 32:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#024), [Jer
32:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#037), [Jer
32:43-44](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#043)).

[Jeremiah 32:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 32:16</span></span>

Jeremiah, not comprehending how God's threat of destroying Judah could
be reconciled with God's commanding him to purchase land in it as if in
a free country, has recourse to his grand remedy against perplexities,
prayer.

[Jeremiah 32:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 32:17</span></span>

hast made . . . heaven--Jeremiah extols God's creative power, as a
ground of humility on his part as man: It is not my part to call Thee,
the mighty God, to account for Thy ways (compare [Jer
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#001)).

too hard--In [Jer 32:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#027) God's reply
exactly accords with Jeremiah's prayer ([Gen
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#014); [Zac
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#006); [Luk
1:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#037)).

[Jeremiah 32:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 32:18</span></span>

([Exo 34:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#007); [Isa
65:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#006)). This is taken from the
decalogue ([Exo 20:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#005)). This is a
second consideration to check hasty judgments as to God's ways: Thou art
the gracious and righteous Judge of the world.

[Jeremiah 32:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 32:19</span></span>

counsel . . . work--devising . . . executing ([Isa
28:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#029)).

eyes . . . open upon all-- ([Job
34:21](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#021); [Pro
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#021)).

to give . . . according to . . . ways-- ([Jer
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#010)).

[Jeremiah 32:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 32:20</span></span>

even unto this day--Thou hast given "signs" of Thy power from the day
when Thou didst deliver Israel out of Egypt by mighty miracles, down to
the present time \[MAURER\]. CALVIN explains it, "memorable even unto
this day."

among other men--not in Israel only, but among foreign peoples also.
Compare for "other" understood, [Psa
73:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#005).

made thee a name-- ([Exo 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#016); [Ch1
17:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#021); [Isa
63:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#012)).

as at this day--a name of power, such as Thou hast at this day.

[Jeremiah 32:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 32:21</span></span>

([Psa 136:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#011)).

[Jeremiah 32:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 32:22</span></span>

given . . . didst swear--God gave it by a gratuitous covenant, not for
their deserts.

a land flowing with milk and honey--(See on [Num
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#008)).

[Jeremiah 32:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 32:23</span></span>

all . . . thou commandedst . . . all this evil--Their punishment was
thus exactly commensurate with their sin. It was not fortuitous.

[Jeremiah 32:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jer 32:24</span></span>

mounts--mounds of earth raised as breastworks by the besieging army,
behind which they employed their engines, and which they gradually
pushed forward to the walls of the city.

behold, thou seest it--connected with [Jer
32:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#025). Thou seest all this with Thine
own eyes, and yet (what seems inconsistent with it) Thou commandest me
to buy a field.

[Jeremiah 32:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jer 32:25</span></span>

for the city, &c.--rather, "though," &c.

[Jeremiah 32:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jer 32:27</span></span>

Jehovah retorts Jeremiah's own words: I am indeed, as thou sayest ([Jer
32:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#017)), the God and Creator of "all
flesh," and "nothing is too hard for Me"; thine own words ought to have
taught thee that, though Judea and Jerusalem are given up to the
Chaldeans now for the sins of the Jews, yet it will not be hard to Me,
when I please, to restore the state so that houses and lands therein
shall be possessed in safety ([Jer
32:36-44](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#036)).

[Jeremiah 32:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jer 32:29</span></span>

burn . . . houses upon whose roofs . . . incense unto Baal--retribution
in kind. They burnt incense to Baal, on the houses, so the houses shall
be burnt ([Jer 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#013)). The god of fire
was the object of their worship; so fire shall be the instrument of
their punishment.

to provoke me--indicating the design, not merely the event. They seemed
to court God's "anger," and purposely to "provoke" Him.

[Jeremiah 32:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">jer 32:30</span></span>

have . . . done--literally, "have been doing"; implying continuous
action.

only . . . evil . . . only provoked me--They have been doing nothing
else but evil; their sole aim seems to have been to provoke Me.

their youth--the time when they were in the wilderness, having just
before come into national existence.

[Jeremiah 32:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">jer 32:31</span></span>

provocation of mine anger--literally, "for mine anger." CALVIN,
therefore, connects those words with those at the end of the verse,
"this city has been to me an object for mine anger (namely, by reason of
the provocations mentioned, [Jer
32:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#030), &c.), that I should remove it,"
&c. Thus, there will not be the repetition of the sentiment, [Jer
32:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#030), as in English Version; the
Hebrew also favors this rendering. However, Jeremiah delights in
repetitions. In English Version the words, "that I should remove it,"
&c., stand independently, as the result of what precedes. The time is
ripe for taking vengeance on them ([Kg2
23:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#027)).

from the day that they built it--Solomon completed the building of the
city; and it was he who, first of the Jewish kings, turned to idolatry.
It was originally built by the idolatrous Canaanites.

[Jeremiah 32:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">jer 32:32</span></span>

priests . . . prophets-- ([Neh 9:32](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#032),
[Neh 9:34](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#034)). Hence, learn, though
ministers of God apostatize, we must remain faithful.

[Jeremiah 32:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">jer 32:33</span></span>

([Jer 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#027); [Jer
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#013)).

[Jeremiah 32:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">jer 32:34</span></span>

([Jer 7:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#030); [Eze
8:5-17](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#005)).

[Jeremiah 32:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">jer 32:35</span></span>

cause . . . pass through . . . fire--By way of purification, they passed
through with bare feet ([Lev 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#021)).

Molech--meaning "king"; the same as Milcom ([Kg1
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#033)).

I commanded . . . not--This cuts off from the superstitious the plea of
a good intention. All "will-worship" exposes to God's wrath ([Col
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#018), [Col
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#023)).

[Jeremiah 32:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">jer 32:36</span></span>

And now therefore--rather, "But now, nevertheless." Notwithstanding that
their guilt deserves lasting vengeance, God, for the elect's sake and
for His covenant's sake, will, contrary to all that might have been
expected, restore them.

ye say, It shall be delivered into . . . king of Babylon--The reprobate
pass from the extreme of self-confidence to that of despair of God's
fulfilling His promise of restoring them.

[Jeremiah 32:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">jer 32:37</span></span>

(See on [Jer 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#015)). The "all"
countries implies a future restoration of Israel more universal than
that from Babylon.

[Jeremiah 32:38](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">jer 32:38</span></span>

([Jer 30:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#022); [Jer
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#007)).

[Jeremiah 32:39](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">jer 32:39</span></span>

one heart--all seeking the Lord with one accord, in contrast to their
state when only scattered individuals sought Him ([Eze
11:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#019); [Zep
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#009)).

for . . . good of them-- ([Psa
34:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#012)).

[Jeremiah 32:40](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">jer 32:40</span></span>

([Jer 31:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#031), [Jer
31:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#033); [Isa
55:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#003)).

not depart from me--never yet fully realized as to the Israelites.

I will not turn away from them . . . good-- ([Isa
30:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#021)). Jehovah compares Himself to a
sedulous preceptor following his pupils everywhere to direct their
words, gestures.

put my fear in . . . hearts . . . not depart from me--Both the
conversion and perseverance of the saints are the work of God alone, by
the operation of the Holy Spirit.

[Jeremiah 32:41](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">jer 32:41</span></span>

rejoice over them-- ([Deu 30:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#009); [Isa
62:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#005); [Isa
65:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#019); [Zep
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#017)).

plant . . . assuredly--rather, "in stability," that is, permanently, for
ever ([Jer 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#006); [Amo
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#015)).

[Jeremiah 32:42](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">jer 32:42</span></span>

([Jer 31:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#028)). The restoration from
Babylon was only a slight foretaste of the grace to be expected by
Israel at last through Christ.

[Jeremiah 32:43](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">jer 32:43</span></span>

([Jer 32:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#015)).

whereof ye say, It is desolate-- ([Jer
33:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#010)).

[Jeremiah 32:44](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">jer 32:44</span></span>

Referring to the forms of contract ([Jer
32:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#010)):

Benjamin--specified as Anathoth; Jeremiah's place of residence where the
field lay ([Jer 32:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#008)), was in it.
