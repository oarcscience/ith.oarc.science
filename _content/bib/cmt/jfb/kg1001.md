[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#001)

ABISHAG CHERISHES DAVID IN HIS EXTREME AGE. ([Kg1
1:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#001))

Now king David was old--He was in the seventieth year of his age ([Sa2
5:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#004)). But the wear and tear of a
military life, bodily fatigue, and mental care, had prematurely, if we
may say it, exhausted the energies of David's strong constitution ([Sa1
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#012)). In modern Palestine and Egypt
the people, owing to the heat of the climate, sleep each in a "separate"
bed. They only depart from this practice for medical reasons ([Ecc
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#011)). The expedient recommended by
David's physicians is the regimen still prescribed in similar cases in
the East, particularly among the Arab population, not simply to give
heat, but "to cherish," as they are aware that the inhalation of young
breath will give new life and vigor to the worn-out frame. The fact of
the health of the young and healthier person being, as it were, stolen
to support that of the more aged and sickly is well established among
the medical faculty. And hence the prescription for the aged king was
made in a hygienic point of view for the prolongation of his valuable
life, and not merely for the comfort to be derived from the natural
warmth imparted to his withered frame \[PORTER, Tent and Khan\]. The
polygamy of the age and country may account for the introduction of this
practice; and it is evident that Abishag was made a concubine or
secondary wife to David (see on [Kg1
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#022)).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#003)

a Shunammite--Shunem, in the tribe of Issachar ([Jos
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#018)), lay on an eminence in the
plain of Esdraelon, five miles south of Tabor. It is now called Sulam.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg1 1:5</span></span>

ADONIJAH USURPS THE KINGDOM. (1Ki. 1:5-31)

Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself--Nothing is said as to
the origin or rank of Haggith, so that it is probable she was not
distinguished by family descent. Adonijah, though David's fourth son
([Sa2 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#004); [Ch1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#002)), was now the oldest alive; and
his personal attractions and manners ([Sa1
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#002)) not only recommended him to the
leading men about court, but made him the favorite of his father, who,
though seeing him assume an equipage becoming only the heir-presumptive
to the throne ([Sa2 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#001)), said
nothing; and his silence was considered by many, as well as by Adonijah,
to be equivalent to an expression of consent. The sinking health of the
king prompted him to take a decisive step in furtherance of his
ambitious designs.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg1 1:7</span></span>

he conferred with Joab--The anxiety of Adonijah to secure the influence
of a leader so bold, enterprising, and popular with the army was
natural, and the accession of the hoary commander is easily accounted
for from his recent grudge at the king (see on [Sa2
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#013)).

and with Abiathar the priest--His influence was as great over the
priests and Levites--a powerful body in the kingdom--as that of Joab
over the troops. It might be that both of them thought the crown
belonged to Adonijah by right of primogeniture, from his mature age and
the general expectations of the people ([Kg1
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#015)).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg1 1:8</span></span>

But Zadok the priest--He had been high priest in the tabernacle at
Gibeon under Saul ([Ch1 16:39](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#039)). David,
on his accession, had conjoined him and Abiathar equal in the exercise
of their high functions ([Sa2 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#017);
[Sa2 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#024), [Sa2
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#029), [Sa2
15:35](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#035)). But it is extremely probable
that some cause of jealousy or discord between them had arisen, and
hence each lent his countenance and support to opposite parties.

Benaiah--Distinguished for his bravery ([Sa1
23:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#020)), he had been appointed captain
of the king's bodyguard ([Sa2 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#018);
[Sa2 20:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#023); [Ch1
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#017)), and was regarded by Joab as a
rival.

Nathan the prophet--He was held in high estimation by David, and stood
on the most intimate relations with the royal family ([Sa2
12:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#025)).

Shimei--probably the person of this name who was afterwards enrolled
among Solomon's great officers ([Kg1
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#018)).

Rei--supposed to be the same as Ira ([Sa2
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#026)).

and the mighty men--the select band of worthies.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg1 1:9</span></span>

En-rogel--situated ([Jos 15:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#007)) east
of Jerusalem, in a level place, just below the junction of the valley of
Hinnom with that of Jehoshaphat. It is a very deep well, measuring one
hundred twenty-five feet in depth; the water is sweet, but not very
cold, and it is at times quite full to overflowing. The Orientals are
fond of enjoying festive repasts in the open air at places which command
the advantage of shade, water, and verdure; and those fetes champetres
are not cold collations, but magnificent entertainments, the animals
being killed and dressed on the spot. Adonijah's feast at En-rogel was
one of this Oriental description, and it was on a large scale ([Sa2
3:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#004); [Sa2
5:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#014); [Ch1
14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#001)). At the accession of a new
king there were sacrifices offered ([Sa1
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#015)). But on such an occasion it was
no less customary to entertain the grandees of the kingdom and even the
populace in a public manner (1Ch. 12:23-40). There is the strongest
probability that Adonijah's feast was purely political, to court
popularity and secure a party to support his claim to the crown.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg1 1:11</span></span>

Nathan spake unto Bath-sheba . . . let me . . . give thee counsel,
&c.--The revolt was defeated by this prophet, who, knowing the Lord's
will ([Sa2 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#012); [Ch1
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#009)), felt himself bound, in
accordance with his character and office, to take the lead in seeing it
executed. Hitherto the succession of the Hebrew monarchy had not been
settled. The Lord had reserved to Himself the right of nomination ([Deu
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#015)), which was acted upon in the
appointments both of Saul and David; and in the case of the latter the
rule was so far modified that his posterity were guaranteed the
perpetual possession of the sovereignty ([Sa2
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#012)). This divine purpose was known
throughout the kingdom; but no intimation had been made as to whether
the right of inheritance was to belong to the oldest son. Adonijah, in
common with the people generally, expected that this natural arrangement
should be followed in the Hebrew kingdom as in all others. Nathan, who
was aware of the old king's solemn promise to Solomon, and, moreover,
that this promise was sanctioned by the divine will, saw that no time
was to be lost. Fearing the effects of too sudden excitement in the
king's feeble state, he arranged that Bath-sheba should go first to
inform him of what was being transacted without the walls, and that he
himself should follow to confirm her statement. The narrative here not
only exhibits the vivid picture of a scene within the interior of a
palace, but gives the impression that a great deal of Oriental state
ceremonial had been established in the Hebrew court.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg1 1:20</span></span>

the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that thou shouldest tell them who
shall sit on the throne--When the kings died without declaring their
will, then their oldest son succeeded. But frequently they designated
long before their death which of their sons should inherit the throne.
The kings of Persia, as well as of other Eastern countries, have
exercised the same right in modern and even recent times.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg1 1:21</span></span>

I and my son . . . shall be counted offenders--that is, slain, according
to the barbarous usage of the East towards all who are rivals to the
throne.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">kg1 1:28</span></span>

Then king David answered and said, Call me Bath-sheba--He renews to her
the solemn pledge he had given, in terms of solemnity and impressiveness
which show that the aged monarch had roused himself to the duty the
emergency called for.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">kg1 1:33</span></span>

SOLOMON, BY DAVID'S APPOINTMENT, IS ANOINTED KING. (1Ki. 1:32-49)

cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule--Directions were
forthwith given for the immediate coronation of Solomon. A procession
was to be formed by the "servants of their lord"--that is, the king's
bodyguard. Mules were then used by all the princes ([Sa2
13:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#029)); but there was a state mule of
which all subjects were forbidden, under pain of death, to make use,
without special permission; so that its being granted to Solomon was a
public declaration in his favor as the future king (see on [Est
6:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#008)).

bring him down to Gihon--a pool or fountain on the west of Jerusalem
(see on [Ch2 32:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#030)), chosen as equally
public for the counter proclamation.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">kg1 1:34</span></span>

anoint him--done only in the case of a new dynasty or disputed
succession (see on [Sa1 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#013); [Sa2
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#001)).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">kg1 1:35</span></span>

Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my
throne--The public recognition of the successor to the throne, during
the old king's lifetime, is accordant with the customs of the East.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:39](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">kg1 1:39</span></span>

an horn of oil out of the tabernacle--It was the sacred oil ([Exo
30:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#025)) with which the kings were
anointed.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:40](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">kg1 1:40</span></span>

all the people came up after him--that is, from the valley to the
citadel of Zion.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:41](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">kg1 1:41</span></span>

Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made
an end of eating--The loud shouts raised by the populace at the joyous
proclamation at Gihon, and echoed by assembled thousands, from Zion to
En-rogel, were easily heard at that distance by Adonijah and his
confederates. The arrival of a trusty messenger, who gave a full detail
of the coronation ceremony \[[Kg1
1:43-48](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#043)\], spread dismay in their
camp. The wicked and ambitious plot they had assembled to execute was
dissipated, and every one of the conspirators consulted his safety by
flight.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:50](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#050)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">kg1 1:50</span></span>

ADONIJAH, FLEEING TO THE HORNS OF THE ALTAR, IS DISMISSED BY SOLOMON.
([Kg1 1:50-53](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#050))

Adonijah . . . went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar--most
probably the altar of burnt offering which had been erected on Mount
Zion, where Abiathar, one of his partisans, presided as high priest. The
horns or projections at the four corners of the altar, to which the
sacrifices were bound, and which were tipped with the blood of the
victim, were symbols of grace and salvation to the sinner. Hence the
altar was regarded as a sanctuary ([Exo
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#014)), but not to murderers, rebels,
or deliberate perpetrators. Adonijah, having acted in opposition to the
will of the reigning king, was guilty of rebellion, and stood
self-condemned. Solomon spared his life on the express condition of his
good behavior--living in strict privacy, leading a quiet, peaceable
life, and meddling with the affairs of neither the court nor the
kingdom.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:53](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#053)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">kg1 1:53</span></span>

they brought him down from the altar--from the ledge around the altar on
which he was standing.

he bowed himself--that is, did homage to Solomon as king.
