### [Isaiah Chapter 60](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#001)

[Isaiah 60:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 60:1</span></span>

ISRAEL'S GLORY AFTER HER AFFLICTION. (Isa. 60:1-22)

Arise--from the dust in which thou hast been sitting as a mourning
female captive ([Isa 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#026); [Isa
52:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#001)).

shine--or, "be enlightened; for thy light cometh"; impart to others the
spiritual light now given thee ([Isa
60:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#003)). The Margin and GESENIUS
translate, "Be enlightened"; be resplendent with posterity; imperative
for the future indicative, "Thou shalt be enlightened" ([Isa
58:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#008), [Isa
58:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#010); [Eph
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#008), [Eph
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#014)).

glory of the Lord--not merely the Shekinah, or cloud of glory, such as
rested above the ark in the old dispensation, but the glory of the Lord
in person ([Jer 3:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#016)).

is risen--as the sun ([Mal 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#002); [Luk
1:78](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#078), Margin).

[Isaiah 60:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 60:2</span></span>

darkness . . . earth--the rest of the earth: in contrast with "light . .
. upon thee" ([Isa 60:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#001)). The earth
will be afterwards enlightened through Israel ([Isa
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#002)).

be seen--conspicuously: so the Hebrew.

[Isaiah 60:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 60:3</span></span>

([Isa 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#003); [Isa
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#010); [Isa
43:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#006); [Isa
49:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#022); [Isa
66:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#012)).

kings-- ([Isa 49:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#007), [Isa
49:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#023); [Isa
52:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#015)).

thy rising--rather, "thy sun-rising," that is, "to the brightness that
riseth upon thee."

[Isaiah 60:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 60:4</span></span>

Lift up . . . eyes--Jerusalem is addressed as a female with eyes cast
down from grief.

all they . . . they--The Gentile peoples come together to bring back the
dispersed Hebrews, restore their city, and worship Jehovah with
offerings.

nursed at thy side--rather "carried at thy side." It is the custom in
the East to carry the children astride on the hip, with the arms around
the body ([Isa 66:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#012)).

[Isaiah 60:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 60:5</span></span>

see-- ([Isa 60:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#004)), namely, the
bringing back of thy sons.

flow together--rather, "overflow with joy" \[LOWTH\]; or, from a
different Hebrew root, "be bright with joy" \[GESENIUS\] ([Job
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#004)).

fear--rather, beat with the agitation of solemn joy at the marvellous
sight \[HORSLEY\] ([Jer 33:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#009)).

be enlarged--swell with delight. Grief, on the contrary, contracts the
heart.

abundance of . . . sea--the wealth of the lands beyond the sea, as in
Solomon's time, the type of the coming reign of the Prince of peace.

converted--rather, "be turned," instead of being turned to purposes of
sin and idolatry.

forces--rather, "riches."

[Isaiah 60:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 60:6</span></span>

camels--laden with merchandise; the camel is "the ship of the desert"
(compare [Isa 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#006)).

cover thee--so many of them shall there be.

dromedaries--They have one hunch on the back, whereas the camel has two:
distinguished for swiftness ([Jer
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#023)).

Midian--east of the Elanitic branch of the Red Sea, and stretching
northward along Mount Seir. Associated with the Ishmaelites in traffic
([Gen 37:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#025), [Gen
37:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#028)).

Ephah--part of Midian, east of the Dead Sea. It abounded in camels ([Jdg
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#005)).

Sheba--in Arabia-Felix, famed for frankincense and gold ([Psa
72:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#015); [Jer
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#020)), which they traded in ([Isa
45:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#014); [Job
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#019); [Eze
27:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#022)).

[Isaiah 60:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 60:7</span></span>

Kedar-- ([Isa 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#016); [Sol
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#005)), in the south of Arabia-Deserta,
or north of Arabia-PetrÃ&brvbr;a; they traded in flocks ([Eze
27:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#021)).

Nebaioth--son of Ishmael, as was Kedar. Father of the Nabatheans in
Arabia-PetrÃ&brvbr;a.

minister--by coming up as an acceptable sacrifice.

come up with acceptance--that is, acceptably. The rams offering
themselves voluntarily ([Psa 68:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#030);
[Rom 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#001); [Pe1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005)), without waiting for any other
priest, answer to believers strong in faith and lamb-like meekness; and
in the white fleece-like robe of sanctity \[VITRINGA\].

house of my glory--the temple (Eze. 41:1-26; [Hag
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#007), [Hag
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#009); [Mal
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001)).

[Isaiah 60:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 60:8</span></span>

The prophet, seeing in vision new hosts approaching quickly like a cloud
of doves, asks who they are.

[Isaiah 60:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 60:9</span></span>

(see on [Isa 42:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#004)).

Tarshish first--The ships of Tartessus (see on [Isa
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#016); [Isa
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#001), that is, vessels that trade to
the most distant regions) will be among the foremost to bring back the
scattered Israelites ([Isa 66:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#020)).

their silver--The nations among whom the Jews have been scattered shall
help them with their money in returning ([Isa
60:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#005), [Isa
60:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#011), [Isa
60:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#016)), as was the case at the return
from Babylon ([Ezr 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#004); compare [Psa
68:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#030)).

unto the name . . . to the Holy One--rather, because of the
name--because of the Holy One (compare [Isa
55:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#005)) \[LOWTH\].

[Isaiah 60:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 60:10</span></span>

kings . . . minister unto thee--(See on [Isa
60:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#007); [Isa
49:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#023)).

in my wrath I smote thee-- ([Isa
54:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#007); [Isa
57:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#017)).

[Isaiah 60:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 60:11</span></span>

([Rev 21:25](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#025)). The gates are ever open
to receive new offerings and converts ([Isa
26:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#002); [Act
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#027); [Rev
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#008)). In time of peace the gates of a
city are open: so, under the Prince of peace, there shall be no need of
barring gates against invaders.

forces--riches.

be brought--as willing captives to the truth; or, if not willingly, be
bought by judgments to submit to Israel ([Isa
60:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#012), [Isa
60:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#014)). GESENIUS explains it, "may
come escorted by a retinue."

[Isaiah 60:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 60:12</span></span>

For--the reason which will lead Gentile kings and people to submit
themselves; fear of the God in Israel ([Zac
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#017)).

[Isaiah 60:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 60:13</span></span>

glory--that is, the trees which adorned Lebanon; emblem of men eminent
in natural gifts, devoting all that is in them to the God of Israel
([Hos 14:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#005)).

fir . . . pine . . . box--rather, "the cypress . . . ilex . . . cedar."

place of my sanctuary--Jerusalem ([Jer
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#017)).

place of my feet--no longer the ark ([Jer
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#016)), "the footstool" of Jehovah
([Psa 99:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#005); [Psa
132:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#007); [Ch1
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#002)); but "the place of His throne,
the place of the soles of His feet, where He will dwell in the midst of
the children of Israel for ever," in the new temple ([Eze
43:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#007)).

[Isaiah 60:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 60:14</span></span>

The sons--Their fathers who "afflicted" Israel having been cut off by
divine judgments ([Isa 14:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#001); [Isa
49:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#023)).

The Zion of the Holy One--The royal court of the Holy One. MAURER
translates, "Zion, the sanctuary (holy place) of Israel" ([Isa
57:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#015); [Psa
46:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#004)).

[Isaiah 60:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 60:15</span></span>

forsaken-- ([Psa 78:60-61](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#060)).

no man went through thee--Thy land was so desolate that no traveller, or
caravan, passed through thee; true only of Israel, not true of the
Church ([Lam 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#004)).

excellency--glory, that is, for ever honored.

[Isaiah 60:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 60:16</span></span>

suck--Thou shalt draw to thyself and enjoy all that is valuable of the
possessions of the Gentiles, &c. ([Isa
49:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#023); [Isa
61:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#006); [Isa
66:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#011)).

know--by the favors bestowed on thee, and through thee on the Gentiles.

[Isaiah 60:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 60:17</span></span>

Poetically, with figurative allusion to the furniture of the temple; all
things in that happy age to come shall be changed for the better.

exactors--namely, of tribute.

righteousness--All rulers in restored Jerusalem shall not only be
peaceable and righteous, but shall be, as it were, "peace" and
"righteousness" itself in their administration.

[Isaiah 60:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 60:18</span></span>

([Isa 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#004)). Not only shall thy walls
keep thee safe from foes, but "Salvation" shall serve as thy walls,
converting thy foes into friends, and so ensuring thee perfect safety
([Isa 26:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#001)).

gates--once the scene of "destruction" when victorious foes burst
through them ([Neh 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#003)); henceforth to
be not only the scene of praises, but "Praise" itself; the "gates," as
the place of public concourse, were the scene of thanksgivings ([Ch2
31:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#002); [Psa
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#014); [Psa
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#007); [Psa
100:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa100.htm#004)). "Judah," the favored tribe,
means "praise."

[Isaiah 60:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 60:19</span></span>

The sun and moon, the brightest objects by day and night, shall be
eclipsed by the surpassing glory of God manifesting Himself to thee
([Isa 30:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#026); [Zac
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#005); [Rev
21:23](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#023); [Rev
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#005)).

[Isaiah 60:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 60:20</span></span>

There shall be no national and spiritual obscuration again as formerly
([Joe 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#010); [Amo
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#009)).

mourning . . . ended-- ([Isa 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#008);
[Rev 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#004)).

[Isaiah 60:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 60:21</span></span>

all righteous-- ([Isa 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#003); [Isa
52:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#001); [Rev
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#027)).

inherit . . . land-- ([Isa 49:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#008); [Isa
54:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#003); [Isa
65:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#009); [Psa
37:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#011), [Psa
37:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#022); [Mat
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#005)).

branch of my planting-- ([Isa 61:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#003);
[Psa 92:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#013); [Mat
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#013)).

work of my hands--the converted Israelites ([Isa
29:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#023); [Isa
45:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#011)).

that I may be glorified--the final end of all God's gracious dealings
([Isa 49:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#003); [Isa
61:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#003)).

[Isaiah 60:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 60:22</span></span>

little one--Even one, and that the smallest in number and rank, shall be
multiplied a thousandfold in both respects ([Mic
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#002); [Mat
13:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#031)).

his time--not our time; we might wish to hasten it, but it will come in
due time, as in the case of Jesus' first coming ([Gal
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#004)); so in that of the restoration of
Israel and the conversion of the world ([Isa
66:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#008); [Hab
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#003); [Act
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#007); [Heb
10:37](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#037)).

Messiah announces His twofold commission to bring gospel mercy at His
first coming, and judgments on unbelievers and comfort to Zion at His
second coming ([Isa 61:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001)); the
language can be applied to Isaiah, comforting by his prophecies the
exiles in Babylon, only in a subordinate sense.
