### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#001)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg1 6:2</span></span>

THE BUILDING OF SOLOMON'S TEMPLE. ([Kg1
6:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#001))

the house which king Solomon built for the Lord--The dimensions are
given in cubits, which are to be reckoned according to the early
standard ([Ch2 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#003)), or holy cubit
([Eze 40:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#005); [Eze
43:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#013)), a handbreadth longer than the
common or later one. It is probable that the internal elevation only is
here stated.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg1 6:3</span></span>

the porch--or portico, extended across the whole front (see on [Ch2
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#004)).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg1 6:4</span></span>

windows of narrow lights--that is, windows with lattices, capable of
being shut and opened at pleasure, partly to let out the vapor of the
lamps, the smoke of the frankincense, and partly to give light \[KEIL\].

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg1 6:5</span></span>

THE CHAMBERS THEREOF. ([Kg1 6:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#005))

against the wall of the house he built chambers--On three sides, there
were chambers in three stories, each story wider than the one beneath
it, as the walls were narrowed or made thinner as they ascended, by a
rebate being made, on which the beams of the side floor rested, without
penetrating the wall. These chambers were approached from the right-hand
side, in the interior of the under story, by a winding staircase of
stone, which led to the middle and upper stories.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg1 6:7</span></span>

there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house
while it was in building--A subterranean quarry has been very recently
discovered near Jerusalem, where the temple stones are supposed to have
been hewn. There is unequivocal evidence in this quarry that the stones
were dressed there; for there are blocks very similar in size, as well
as of the same kind of stone, as those found in the ancient remains.
Thence, probably, they would be moved on rollers down the Tyropean
valley to the very side of the temple \[PORTER, Tent and Kahn\].

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg1 6:9</span></span>

built the house--The temple is here distinguished from the wings or
chambers attached to it--and its roofing was of cedar-wood.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg1 6:10</span></span>

chambers . . . five cubits high--The height of the whole three stories
was therefore about fifteen cubits.

they rested on the house with timber of cedar--that is, because the
beams of the side stones rested on the ledges of the temple wall. The
wing was attached to the house; it was connected with the temple,
without, however, interfering injuriously with the sanctuary \[KEIL\].

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg1 6:11</span></span>

GOD'S PROMISES UNTO IT. ([Kg1 6:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#011))

the word of the Lord came to Solomon--probably by a prophet. It was very
seasonable, being designed: first, to encourage him to go on with the
building, by confirming anew the promise made to his father David ([Sa2
7:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#012)); and secondly, to warn him
against the pride and presumption of supposing that after the erection
of so magnificent a temple, he and his people would always be sure of
the presence and favor of God. The condition on which that blessing
could alone be expected was expressly stated. The dwelling of God among
the children of Israel refers to those symbols of His presence in the
temple, which were the visible tokens of His spiritual relation to that
people.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg1 6:15</span></span>

THE CEILING AND ADORNING OF IT. ([Kg1
6:15-22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#015))

he built the walls of the house within--The walls were wainscotted with
cedar-wood; the floor, paved with cypress planks; the interior was
divided (by a partition consisting of folding doors, which were opened
and shut with golden chains) into two apartments--the back or inner
room, that is, the most holy place, was twenty cubits long and broad;
the front, or outer room, that is, the holy place, was forty cubits. The
cedar-wood was beautifully embellished with figures in relievo,
representing clusters of foliage, open flowers, cherubims, and palm
trees. The whole interior was overlaid with gold, so that neither wood
nor stone was seen; nothing met the eye but pure gold, either plain or
richly chased.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 6:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">kg1 6:31</span></span>

for the entering of the oracle--The door of the most holy place was made
of solid olive tree and adorned with figures. The door of the holy place
was made of cypress wood, the sides being of olive wood.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 6:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">kg1 6:36</span></span>

the inner court--was for the priests. Its wall, which had a coping of
cedar, is said to have been so low that the people could see over it.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 6:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">kg1 6:37</span></span>

THE TIME TAKEN TO BUILD IT. ([Kg1
6:37-38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#037))

In the fourth year was the foundation laid--The building was begun in
the second month of the fourth year and completed in the eighth month of
the eleventh year of Solomon's reign, comprising a period of seven and a
half years, which is reckoned here in round numbers. It was not a very
large, but a very splendid building, requiring great care, and
ingenuity, and division of labor. The immense number of workmen
employed, together with the previous preparation of the materials,
serves to account for the short time occupied in the process of
building.
