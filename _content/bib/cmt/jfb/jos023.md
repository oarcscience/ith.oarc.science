### [Joshua Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#001)

[Joshua 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 23:1</span></span>

JOSHUA'S EXHORTATION BEFORE HIS DEATH. ([Jos
23:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#001))

a long time after that the Lord had given rest unto Israel from all
their enemies--about fourteen years after the conquest of Canaan, and
seven after the distribution of that country among the tribes.

[Joshua 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jos 23:2</span></span>

Joshua called for all Israel--The clause which follows seems to restrict
this general expression as applicable only to the officers and
representatives of the people. The place of assembly was most probably
Shiloh. The occasion of convening it was the extreme age and approaching
death of the venerable leader; and the purport of this solemn address
was to animate the chosen people and their posterity to a faithful and
unswerving continuance in the faith and worship of the God of Israel.

[Joshua 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jos 23:3</span></span>

BY FORMER BENEFITS. ([Jos 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#003))

ye have seen all that the Lord your God hath done unto all these nations
because of you--The modesty and humility of Joshua are remarkably
displayed at the commencement of this address. Dismissing all thoughts
of his personal services, he ascribed the subjugation and occupation of
Canaan entirely to the favoring presence and aid of God; and in doing
so, he spoke not more piously than truly. This had been promised ([Deu
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#030); [Deu
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#022)); and the reality of the divine
aid was seen in the rapid overthrow of the Canaanites, which had already
led to the division of the whole land among the tribes \[[Jos
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#004)\].

[Joshua 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jos 23:5</span></span>

BY PROMISES. ([Jos 23:5-11](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#005))

the Lord your God, he shall expel them from before you, as the Lord your
God hath promised you, &c.--The actual possessions which God had given
were a pledge of the complete fulfilment of His promise in giving them
the parts of the country still unconquered. But the accomplishment of
the divine promise depended on their inviolable fidelity to God's
law--on their keeping resolutely aloof from all familiar intercourse and
intimate connections with the Canaanites, or in any way partaking of
their idolatrous sins. In the event of their continuing in steadfast
adherence to the cause of God, as happily distinguished the nation at
that time, His blessing would secure them a course of brilliant and easy
victories ([Lev 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#007); [Deu
28:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#007); [Deu
32:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#030)).

[Joshua 23:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jos 23:11</span></span>

Take good heed, therefore, that ye love the Lord your God--The sum of
his exhortation is comprised in the love of God, which is the end or
fulfilment of the law ([Deu 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#005); [Deu
6:11:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#011); [Mat
22:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#037)).

[Joshua 23:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jos 23:12</span></span>

BY THREATENINGS IN CASE OF DISOBEDIENCE. ([Jos
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#012))

Else if ye do in any wise go back, and cleave unto the remnant of these
nations--As marriage connections with the idolatrous Canaanites would
present many and strong temptations to transgress it, these were
strictly prohibited ([Exo 34:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#012);
[Deu 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#003)). With his eye, as it were,
upon those prohibitions, Joshua threatens them with the certain
withdrawal of the divine aid in the further expulsion of the Canaanites
(a threat founded [Exo 23:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#033); [Num
33:55](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#055); [Deu
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#016)).
