### [Ezekiel Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#001)

[Ezekiel 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 3:1</span></span>

EZEKIEL EATS THE ROLL. IS COMMISSIONED TO GO TO THEM OF THE CAPTIVITY
AND GOES TO TEL-ABIB BY THE CHEBAR: AGAIN BEHOLDS THE SHEKINAH GLORY: IS
TOLD TO RETIRE TO HIS HOUSE, AND ONLY SPEAK WHEN GOD OPENS HIS MOUTH.
(Eze. 3:1-27)

eat . . . and . . . speak--God's messenger must first inwardly
appropriate God's truth himself, before he "speaks" it to others (see on
[Eze 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#008)). Symbolic actions were, when
possible and proper, performed outwardly; otherwise, internally and in
spiritual vision, the action so narrated making the naked statement more
intuitive and impressive by presenting the subject in a concentrated,
embodied form.

[Ezekiel 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 3:3</span></span>

honey for sweetness--Compare [Psa
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#010); [Psa
119:103](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#103); [Rev
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#009), where, as here in [Eze
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#014), the "sweetness" is followed by
"bitterness." The former being due to the painful nature of the message;
the latter because it was the Lord's service which he was engaged in;
and his eating the roll and finding it sweet, implied that, divesting
himself of carnal feeling, he made God's will his will, however painful
the message that God might require him to announce. The fact that God
would be glorified was his greatest pleasure.

[Ezekiel 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 3:5</span></span>

See Margin, Hebrew, "deep of lip, and heavy of tongue," that is, men
speaking an obscure and unintelligible tongue. Even they would have
listened to the prophet; but the Jews, though addressed in their own
tongue, will not hear him.

[Ezekiel 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 3:6</span></span>

many people--It would have increased the difficulty had he been sent,
not merely to one, but to "many people" differing in tongues, so that
the missionary would have needed to acquire a new tongue for addressing
each. The after mission of the apostles to many peoples, and the gift of
tongues for that end, are foreshadowed (compare [Co1
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#021) with [Isa
28:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#011)).

had I sent thee to them, they would have hearkened-- ([Mat
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#021), [Mat
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#023)).

[Ezekiel 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 3:7</span></span>

will not hearken unto thee: for . . . not . . . me-- ([Joh
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#020)). Take patiently their rejection
of thee, for I thy Lord bear it along with thee.

[Ezekiel 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 3:8</span></span>

Ezekiel means one "strengthened by God." Such he was in godly firmness,
in spite of his people's opposition, according to the divine command to
the priest tribe to which he belonged ([Deu
33:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#009)).

[Ezekiel 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 3:9</span></span>

As . . . flint--so Messiah the antitype ([Isa
50:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#007); compare [Jer
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#008), [Jer
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#017)).

[Ezekiel 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 3:10</span></span>

receive in . . . heart . . . ears--The transposition from the natural
order, namely, first receiving with the ears, then in the heart, is
designed. The preparation of the heart for God's message should precede
the reception of it with the ears (compare [Pro
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#001); [Psa
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#017)).

[Ezekiel 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 3:11</span></span>

thy people--who ought to be better disposed to hearken to thee, their
fellow countryman, than hadst thou been a foreigner ([Eze
3:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#005)).

[Ezekiel 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 3:12</span></span>

([Act 8:39](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#039)). Ezekiel's abode
heretofore had not been the most suitable for his work. He, therefore,
is guided by the Spirit to Tel-Abib, the chief town of the Jewish colony
of captives: there he sat on the ground, "the throne of the miserable"
([Ezr 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#003); [Lam
1:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#001)), seven days, the usual period
for manifesting deep grief ([Job 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#013);
see [Psa 137:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#001)), thus winning their
confidence by sympathy in their sorrow. He is accompanied by the
cherubim which had been manifested at Chebar ([Eze
1:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#003)), after their departure from
Jerusalem. They now are heard moving with the "voice of a great rushing
(compare [Act 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#002)), saying, Blessed be
the glory of the Lord from His place," that is, moving from the place in
which it had been at Chebar, to accompany Ezekiel to his new destination
([Eze 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#003)); or, "from His place" may
rather mean, in His place and manifested "from" it. Though God may seem
to have forsaken His temple, He is still in it and will restore His
people to it. His glory is "blessed," in opposition to those Jews who
spoke evil of Him, as if He had been unjustly rigorous towards their
nation \[CALVIN\].

[Ezekiel 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 3:13</span></span>

touched--literally, "kissed," that is, closely embraced.

noise of a great rushing--typical of great disasters impending over the
Jews.

[Ezekiel 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 3:14</span></span>

bitterness--sadness on account of the impending calamities of which I
was required to be the unwelcome messenger. But the "hand," or powerful
impulse of Jehovah, urged me forward.

[Ezekiel 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 3:15</span></span>

Tel-Abib--Tel means an "elevation." It is identified by MICHAELIS with
Thallaba on the Chabor. Perhaps the name expressed the Jew's hopes of
restoration, or else the fertility of the region. Abib means the green
ears of corn which appeared in the month Nisan, the pledge of the
harvest.

I sat, &c.--This is the Hebrew Margin reading. The text is rather, "I
beheld them sitting there" \[GESENIUS\]; or, "And those that were
settled there," namely, the older settlers, as distinguished from the
more recent ones alluded to in the previous clause. The ten tribes had
been long since settled on the Chabor or Habor ([Kg2
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#006)) \[HAVERNICK\].

[Ezekiel 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 3:17</span></span>

watchman--Ezekiel alone, among the prophets, is called a "watchman," not
merely to sympathize, but to give timely warning of danger to his people
where none was suspected. Habakkuk ([Hab
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#001)) speaks of standing upon his
"watch," but it was only in order to be on the lookout for the
manifestation of God's power (so [Isa
52:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#008); [Isa
62:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#006)); not as Ezekiel, to act as a
watchman to others.

[Ezekiel 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 3:18</span></span>

warning . . . speakest to warn--The repetition implies that it is not
enough to warn once in passing, but that the warning is to be inculcated
continually ([Ti2 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#002), "in season, out
of season"; [Act 20:31](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#031), "night and day
with tears").

save--[Eze 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#005) had seemingly taken
away all hope of salvation; but the reference there was to the mass of
the people whose case was hopeless; a few individuals, however, were
reclaimable.

die in . . . iniquity-- ([Joh 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#021),
[Joh 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#024)). Men are not to flatter
themselves that their ignorance, owing to the negligence of their
teachers, will save them ([Rom 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#012),
"As many as have sinned without law, shall also perish without law").

[Ezekiel 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eze 3:19</span></span>

wickedness . . . wicked way--internal wickedness of heart, and external
of the life, respectively.

delivered thy soul-- ([Isa 49:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#004);
[Act 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#026)).

[Ezekiel 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 3:20</span></span>

righteous . . . turn from . . . righteousness--not one "righteous" as to
the root and spirit of regeneration ([Psa
89:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#033); [Psa
138:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#008); [Isa
26:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#012); [Isa
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#003); [Joh
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#028); [Phi
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#006)), but as to its outward appearance
and performances. So the "righteous" ([Pro
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#017); [Mat
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#013)). As in [Eze
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#019) the minister is required to lead
the wicked to good, so in [Eze 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#020) he
is to confirm the well-disposed in their duty.

commit iniquity--that is, give himself up wholly to it ([Jo1
3:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#008)), for even the best often fall,
but not wilfully and habitually.

I lay a stumbling-block--not that God tempts to sin ([Jam
1:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#013)), but God gives men over to
judicial blindness, and to their own corruptions ([Psa
9:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#016); [Psa
94:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#023)) when they "like not to retain
God in their knowledge" ([Rom 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#024),
[Rom 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#026)); just as, on the contrary,
God makes "the way of the righteous plain" ([Pro
4:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#011); [Pro
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#019)), so that they do "not stumble."
CALVIN refers "stumbling-block" not to the guilt, but to its punishment;
"I bring ruin on him." The former is best. Ahab, after a kind of
righteousness ([Kg1 21:27-29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#027)),
relapsed and consulted lying spirits in false prophets; so God permitted
one of these to be his "stumbling-block," both to sin and its
corresponding punishment ([Kg1
22:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#021)).

his blood will I require-- ([Heb
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#017)).

[Ezekiel 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eze 3:22</span></span>

hand of the Lord-- ([Eze 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#003)).

go . . . into the plain--in order that he might there, in a place
secluded from unbelieving men, receive a fresh manifestation of the
divine glory, to inspirit him for his trying work.

[Ezekiel 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eze 3:23</span></span>

glory of the Lord-- ([Eze 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#028)).

[Ezekiel 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">eze 3:24</span></span>

set me upon my feet--having been previously prostrate and unable to rise
until raised by the divine power.

shut thyself within . . . house--implying that in the work he had to do,
he must look for no sympathy from man but must be often alone with God
and draw his strength from Him \[FAIRBAIRN\]. "Do not go out of thy
house till I reveal the future to thee by signs and words," which God
does in the following chapters, down to the eleventh. Thus a
representation was given of the city shut up by siege \[GROTIUS\].
Thereby God proved the obedience of His servant, and Ezekiel showed the
reality of His call by proceeding, not through rash impulse, but by the
directions of God \[CALVIN\].

[Ezekiel 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">eze 3:25</span></span>

put bands upon thee--not literally, but spiritually, the binding,
depressing influence which their rebellious conduct would exert on his
spirit. Their perversity, like bands, would repress his freedom in
preaching; as in [Co2 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#012), Paul calls
himself "straitened" because his teaching did not find easy access to
them. Or else, it is said to console the prophet for being shut up; if
thou wert now at once to announce God's message, they would rush on thee
and bind them with "bands" \[CALVIN\].

[Ezekiel 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">eze 3:26</span></span>

I will make my tongue . . . dumb--Israel had rejected the prophets;
therefore God deprives Israel of the prophets and of His word--God's
sorest judgment ([Sa1 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#002); [Amo
8:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#011)).

[Ezekiel 3:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">eze 3:27</span></span>

when I speak . . . I will open thy mouth--opposed to the silence imposed
on the prophet, to punish the people ([Eze
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#026)). After the interval of silence
has awakened their attention to the cause of it, namely, their sins,
they may then hearken to the prophecies which they would not do before.

He that heareth, let him hear . . . forbear--that is, thou hast done thy
part, whether they hear or forbear. He who shall forbear to hear, it
shall be at his own peril; he who hears, it shall be to his own eternal
good (compare [Rev 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#011)).
