### [Acts Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#001)

[Acts 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 9:1</span></span>

CONVERSION OF SAUL, AND BEGINNINGS OF HIS MINISTRY. (Acts 9:1-25)

Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples
of the Lord, &c.--The emphatic "yet" is intended to note the remarkable
fact, that up to this moment his blind persecuting rage against the
disciples of the Lord burned as fiercely as ever. (In the teeth of this,
NEANDER and OLSHAUSEN picture him deeply impressed with Stephen's joyful
faith, remembering passages of the Old Testament confirmatory of the
Messiahship of Jesus, and experiencing such a violent struggle as would
inwardly prepare the way for the designs of God towards him. Is not
dislike, if not unconscious disbelief, of sudden conversion at the
bottom of this?) The word "slaughter" here points to cruelties not yet
recorded, but the particulars of which are supplied by himself nearly
thirty years afterwards: "And I persecuted this way unto the death"
([Act 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#004)); "and when they were put
to death, I gave my voice \[vote\] against them. And I punished them oft
in every synagogue, and compelled them to \[did my utmost to make them\]
blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them
even unto strange \[foreign\] cities" ([Act
26:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#010)). All this was before his
present journey.

[Acts 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 9:2</span></span>

desired . . . letters--of authorization.

to Damascus--the capital of Syria and the great highway between eastern
and western Asia, about one hundred thirty miles northeast of Jerusalem;
the most ancient city perhaps in the world, and lying in the center of a
verdant and inexhaustible paradise. It abounded (as appears from
JOSEPHUS, Wars of the Jews, 2.20,2) with Jews, and with Gentile
proselytes to the Jewish faith. Thither the Gospel had penetrated; and
Saul, flushed with past successes, undertakes to crush it out.

that if he found any of this way, whether men or women--Thrice are women
specified as objects of his cruelty, as an aggravated feature of it
([Act 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#003); [Act
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#004); and here).

[Acts 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 9:3</span></span>

he came near Damascus--so [Act 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#006).
Tradition points to a bridge near the city as the spot referred to.
Events which are the turning points in one's history so imprint
themselves upon the memory that circumstances the most trifling in
themselves acquire by connection with them something of their
importance, and are recalled with inexpressible interest.

suddenly--At what time of day, it is not said; for artless simplicity
reigns here. But he himself emphatically states, in one of his
narratives, that it was "about noon" ([Act
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#006)), and in the other, "at midday"
([Act 26:13](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#013)), when there could be no
deception.

there shined round about him a light from heaven--"a great light (he
himself says) above the brightness of the sun," then shining in its full
strength.

[Acts 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 9:4</span></span>

he fell to the earth--and his companions with him ([Act
26:14](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#014)), who "saw the light" ([Act
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#009)).

and heard a voice saying unto him--"in the Hebrew tongue" ([Act
26:14](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#014)).

Saul, Saul--a reduplication full of tenderness \[DE WETTE\]. Though his
name was soon changed into "Paul," we find him, in both his own
narratives of the scene, after the lapse of so many years, retaining the
original form, as not daring to alter, in the smallest detail, the
overpowering words addressed to him.

why persecutest thou me?--No language can express the affecting
character of this question, addressed from the right hand of the Majesty
on high to an infuriated, persecuting mortal. (See [Mat
25:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#045), and that whole judgment scene).

[Acts 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 9:5</span></span>

Who art thou, Lord?--"Jesus knew Saul ere Saul knew Jesus" \[BENGEL\].
The term "Lord" here is an indefinite term of respect for some unknown
but august speaker. That Saul saw as well as heard this glorious
Speaker, is expressly said by Ananias ([Act
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#017); [Act
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#014)), by Barnabas ([Act
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#027)), and by himself ([Act
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#016)); and in claiming apostleship,
he explicitly states that he had "seen the Lord" ([Co1
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#001); [Co1
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#008)), which can refer only to this
scene.

I am Jesus whom thou persecutest--The "I" and "thou" here are touchingly
emphatic in the original; while the term "JESUS" is purposely chosen, to
convey to him the thrilling information that the hated name which he
sought to hunt down--"the Nazarene," as it is in [Act
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#008) --was now speaking to him from
the skies, "crowned with glory and honor" (see [Act
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#009)).

It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks--The metaphor of an ox,
only driving the goad deeper by kicking against it, is a classic one,
and here forcibly expresses, not only the vanity of all his measures for
crushing the Gospel, but the deeper wound which every such effort
inflicted upon himself.

[Acts 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 9:6</span></span>

And he, trembling and astonished, said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to
do? And the Lord said--(The most ancient manuscripts and versions of the
New Testament lack all these words here \[including the last clause of
[Act 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#005)\]; but they occur in [Act
26:14](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#014) and [Act
22:10](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#010), from which they appear to have
been inserted here). The question, "What shall I do, Lord?" or, "Lord,
what wilt Thou have me to do?" indicates a state of mind singularly
interesting (see on [Act 2:37](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#037)). Its
elements seem to be these: (1) Resistless conviction that "Jesus whom he
persecuted," now speaking to him, was "Christ the Lord." (See on [Gal
1:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#015)). (2) As a consequence of
this, that not only all his religious views, but his whole religious
character, had been an entire mistake; that he was up to that moment
fundamentally and wholly wrong. (3) That though his whole future was now
a blank, he had absolute confidence in Him who had so tenderly arrested
him in his blind career, and was ready both to take in all His teaching
and to carry out all His directions. (For more, see on [Act
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#009)).

Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee, &c.--See on [Act
8:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#026).

[Acts 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 9:7</span></span>

the men . . . stood speechless--This may mean merely that they remained
so; but if the standing posture be intended, we have only to suppose
that though at first they "all fell to the earth" ([Act
26:14](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#014)), they arose of their own accord
while Saul yet lay prostrate.

hearing a--rather "the"

voice--Paul himself says, "they heard not the voice of Him that spake to
me" ([Act 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#009)). But just as "the
people that stood by heard" the voice that saluted our Lord with
recorded words of consolation and assurance, and yet heard not the
articulate words, but thought "it thundered" or that some "angel spake
to Him" ([Joh 12:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#028)) --so these men
heard the voice that spake to Saul, but heard not the articulate words.
Apparent discrepancies like these, in the different narratives of the
same scene in one and the same book of Acts, furnish the strongest
confirmation both of the facts themselves and of the book which records
them.

[Acts 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 9:8</span></span>

Saul arose . . . and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man--after
beholding the Lord, since he "could not see for the glory of that light"
([Act 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#011)), he had involuntarily
closed his eyes to protect them from the glare; and on opening them
again he found his vision gone. "It is not said, however, that he was
blind, for it was no punishment" \[BENGEL\].

[Acts 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 9:9</span></span>

And he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor drink--that
is, according to the Hebrew mode of computation: he took no food during
the remainder of that day, the entire day following, and so much of the
subsequent day as elapsed before the visit of Ananias. Such a period of
entire abstinence from food, in that state of mental absorption and
revolution into which he had been so suddenly thrown, is in perfect
harmony with known laws and numerous facts. But what three days those
must have been! "Only one other space of three days' duration can be
mentioned of equal importance in the history of the world" \[HOWSON\].
Since Jesus had been revealed not only to his eyes but to his soul (see
on [Gal 1:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#015)), the double
conviction must have immediately flashed upon him, that his whole
reading of the Old Testament hitherto had been wrong, and that the
system of legal righteousness in which he had, up to that moment, rested
and prided himself was false and fatal. What materials these for
spiritual exercise during those three days of total darkness, fasting,
and solitude! On the one hand, what self-condemnation, what anguish,
what death of legal hope, what difficulty in believing that in such a
case there could be hope at all; on the other hand, what heartbreaking
admiration of the grace that had "pulled him out of the fire," what
resistless conviction that there must be a purpose of love in it, and
what tender expectation of being yet honored, as a chosen vessel, to
declare what the Lord had done for his soul, and to spread abroad the
savor of that Name which he had so wickedly, though ignorantly, sought
to destroy--must have struggled in his breast during those memorable
days! Is it too much to say that all that profound insight into the Old
Testament, that comprehensive grasp of the principles of the divine
economy, that penetrating spirituality, that vivid apprehension of man's
lost state, and those glowing views of the perfection and glory of the
divine remedy, that beautiful ideal of the loftiness and the lowliness
of the Christian character, that large philanthropy and burning zeal to
spend and be spent through all his future life for Christ, which
distinguish the writings of this chiefest of the apostles and greatest
of men, were all quickened into life during those three successive days?

[Acts 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 9:10</span></span>

a certain disciple . . . named Ananias--See on [Act
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#012).

to him said the Lord--that is, Jesus. (See [Act
9:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#013), [Act
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#017)).

[Acts 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 9:11</span></span>

go into the street . . . called Straight--There is still a street of
this name in Damascus, about half a mile in length, running from east to
west through the city \[MAUNDRELL\].

and inquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul of Tarsus--There
is something touching in the minuteness of these directions. Tarsus was
the capital of the province of Cilicia, lying along the northeast coast
of the Mediterranean. It was situated on the river Cydnus, was a "large
and populous city" (says XENOPHON, and see [Act
21:39](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#039)), and under the Romans had the
privilege of self-government.

behold, he prayeth--"breathing out" no longer "threatenings and
slaughter," but struggling desires after light and life in the
Persecuted One. Beautiful note of encouragement as to the frame in which
Ananias would find the persecutor.

[Acts 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 9:12</span></span>

And hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias, &c.--Thus, as in the case
of Cornelius and Peter afterwards, there was a mutual preparation of
each for each. But we have no account of the vision which Saul had of
Ananias coming unto him and putting his hands upon him for the
restoration of his sight, save this interesting allusion to it in the
vision which Ananias himself had.

[Acts 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 9:13</span></span>

Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, &c.--"The
objections of Ananias, and the removal of them by the Lord, display in a
very touching manner the childlike relation of the believing soul to its
Redeemer. The Saviour speaks with Ananias as a man does with his friend"
\[OLSHAUSEN\].

how much evil he hath done to thy saints--"Thy saints," says Ananias to
Christ; therefore Christ is God \[BENGEL\]. So, in [Act
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#014), Ananias describes the disciples
as "those that called on Christ's name." See on [Act
7:59-60](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#059); and compare [Co1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#002).

[Acts 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 9:14</span></span>

here he hath authority, &c.--so that the terror not only of the great
persecutor's name, but of this commission to Damascus, had travelled
before him from the capital to the doomed spot.

[Acts 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 9:15</span></span>

Go thy way--Do as thou art bidden, without gainsaying.

he is a chosen vessel--a word often used by Paul in illustrating God's
sovereignty in election ([Rom 9:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#021);
[Co2 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#007); [Ti2
2:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#020) \[ALFORD\]. Compare [Zac
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#002)).

[Acts 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">act 9:16</span></span>

I will show him--(See [Act 20:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#023);
[Act 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#011)).

how great things he must suffer for my name--that is, Much he has done
against that Name; but now, when I show him what great things he must
suffer for that Name, he shall count it his honor and privilege.

[Acts 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">act 9:17</span></span>

Ananias went his way, and putting his hands on him, said, Brother
Saul--How beautifully childlike is the obedience of Ananias to "the
heavenly vision!"

the Lord, even Jesus--This clearly shows in what sense the term "Lord"
is used in this book. It is JESUS that is meant, as almost invariably in
the Epistles also.

who appeared unto thee in the way--This knowledge by an inhabitant of
Damascus of what had happened to Saul before entering it, would show him
at once that this was the man whom Jesus had already prepared him to
expect.

and be filled with the Holy Ghost--which Ananias probably, without any
express instructions on that subject, took it for granted would descend
upon him; and not necessarily after his baptism \[BAUMGARTEN, WEBSTER
and WILKINSON\]--for Cornelius and his company received it before theirs
([Act 10:44-48](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#044)) --but perhaps
immediately after the recovery of his sight by the laying on of Ananias'
hands.

[Acts 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 9:18</span></span>

there fell from his eyes as it were scales--"This shows that the
blindness as well as the cure was supernatural. Substances like scales
would not form naturally in so short a time" \[WEBSTER and WILKINSON\].
And the medical precision of Luke's language here is to be noted.

was baptized--as directed by Ananias ([Act
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#016)).

[Acts 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 9:19</span></span>

when he had received meat, he was strengthened--for the exhaustion
occasioned by his three days' fast would not be the less real, though
unfelt during his struggles. (See on [Mat
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#002)).

Then was Saul certain days with the disciples at Damascus--making their
acquaintance, in another way than either he or they had anticipated, and
regaining his tone by the fellowship of the saints; but not certainly in
order to learn from them what he was to teach, which he expressly
disavows ([Gal 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#012), [Gal
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#016)).

[Acts 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 9:20</span></span>

preached Christ . . . that he is the Son of God--rather, "preached
Jesus," according to all the most ancient manuscripts and versions of
the New Testament (so [Act 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#021), "all
that call on this name," that is, Jesus; and [Act
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#022), "proving that this Jesus is very
Christ").

[Acts 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 9:23</span></span>

And after many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to kill
him--Had we no other record than this, we should have supposed that what
is here related took place while Saul continued at Damascus after his
baptism. But in [Gal 1:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#017) we learn
from Paul himself that he "went into Arabia, and returned again unto
Damascus," and that from the time of his first visit to the close of his
second, both of which appear to have been short, a period of three years
elapsed; either three full years, or one full year and part of two
others. (See on [Gal 1:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#016)). That
such a blank should occur in the Acts, and be filled up in Galatians, is
not more remarkable than that the flight of the Holy Family into Egypt,
their stay there, and their return thence, recorded only by Matthew,
should be so entirely passed over by Luke, that if we had only his
Gospel, we should have supposed that they returned to Nazareth
immediately after the presentation in the temple. (Indeed in one of his
narratives, [Act 22:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#016), Paul
himself takes no notice of this period). But wherefore this journey?
Perhaps (1) because he felt a period of repose and partial seclusion to
be needful to his spirit, after the violence of the change and the
excitement of his new occupation. (2) To prevent the rising storm which
was gathering against him from coming too soon to a head. (3) To
exercise his ministry in the Jewish synagogues, as opportunity afforded.
On his return, refreshed and strengthened in spirit, he immediately
resumed his ministry, but soon to the imminent hazard of his life.

[Acts 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 9:24</span></span>

they watched the gates night and day to kill him--The full extent of his
danger appears only from his own account ([Co2
11:32](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#032)): "In Damascus, the governor
under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison,
desirous to apprehend me"; the exasperated Jews having obtained from the
governor a military force, the more surely to compass his destruction.

[Acts 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 9:25</span></span>

Then the disciples . . . by night let him down--"through a window" ([Co2
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#033)).

by the wall--Such overhanging windows in the walls of Eastern cities
were common, and are to be seen in Damascus to this day.

[Acts 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 9:26</span></span>

SAUL'S FIRST VISIT TO JERUSALEM AFTER HIS CONVERSION. ([Act
9:26-31](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#026))

And when Saul was come to Jerusalem--"three years after" his conversion,
and particularly "to see Peter" ([Gal
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#018)); no doubt because he was the
leading apostle, and to communicate to him the prescribed sphere of his
labors, specially to "the Gentiles."

he assayed to join himself to the disciples--simply as one of them,
leaving his apostolic commission to manifest itself.

they were all afraid of him, &c.--knowing him only as a persecutor of
the faith; the rumor of his conversion, if it ever was cordially
believed, passing away during his long absence in Arabia, and the news
of his subsequent labors in Damascus perhaps not having reached them.

[Acts 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">act 9:27</span></span>

But Barnabas . . . brought him to the apostles--that is, to Peter and
James; for "other of the apostles saw I none," says he fourteen years
after ([Gal 1:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#018)). Probably none of
the other apostles were there at the time ([Act
4:36](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#036)). Barnabas being of Cyprus, which
was within a few hours' sail of Cilicia, and annexed to it as a Roman
province, and Saul and he being Hellenistic Jews and eminent in their
respective localities, they may very well have been acquainted with each
other before this \[HOWSON\]. What is here said of Barnabas is in fine
consistency with the "goodness" ascribed to him ([Act
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#024)), and with the name "son of
consolation," given him by the apostles ([Act
4:36](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#036)); and after Peter and James were
satisfied, the disciples generally would at once receive him.

how he had seen the Lord . . . and he--the Lord.

had spoken to him--that is, how he had received his commission direct
from the Lord Himself.

[Acts 9:28](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">act 9:28</span></span>

And he was with them, coming in and going out at Jerusalem--for fifteen
days, lodging with Peter ([Gal 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#018)).

[Acts 9:29](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">act 9:29</span></span>

disputed against the Grecians--(See on [Act
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#001)); addressing himself specially to
them, perhaps, as being of his own class, and that against which he had
in the days of his ignorance been the fiercest.

they went about to slay him--Thus was he made to feel, throughout his
whole course, what he himself had made others so cruelly to feel, the
cost of discipleship.

[Acts 9:30](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">act 9:30</span></span>

they brought him down to CÃ&brvbr;sarea--on the coast (see on [Act
8:40](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#040)); accompanying him thus far. But
Paul had another reason than his own apprehension for quitting Jerusalem
so soon. "While he was praying in the temple, he was in a trance," and
received express injunctions to this effect. (See on [Act
22:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#017)).

and sent him forth to Tarsus--In [Gal
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#021) he himself says of this journey,
that he "came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia"; from which it is
natural to infer that instead of sailing direct for Tarsus, he landed at
Seleucia, travelled thence to Antioch, and penetrated from this
northward into Cilicia, ending his journey at Tarsus. As this was his
first visit to his native city since his conversion, so it is not
certain that he ever was there again. (See on [Act

became the instrument of gathering into the fold of Christ those
"kinsmen," that "sister," and perhaps her "son," of whom mention is made
in [Act 23:16](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#016), &c.; [Rom
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#007), [Rom

FLOURISHING STATE OF THE CHURCH IN PALESTINE AT THIS TIME. ([Act

Then had all the churches rest--rather, "the Church," according to the
best manuscripts and versions. But this rest was owing not so much to
the conversion of Saul, as probably to the Jews being engrossed with the
emperor Caligula's attempt to have his own image set up in the temple of
Jerusalem \[JOSEPHUS, Antiquities, 18.8.1, &c.\].

throughout all Judea, and Galilee, and Samaria--This incidental notice
of distinct churches already dotting all the regions which were the
chief scenes of our Lord's ministry, and that were best able to test the
facts on which the whole preaching of the apostles was based, is
extremely interesting. "The fear of the Lord" expresses their holy walk;
"the comfort of the Holy Ghost," their "peace and joy in believing,"
under the silent operation of the blessed Comforter.

the Philistines, afterwards and still the seaport of Jerusalem, from

or gazelle, which, from its loveliness, was frequently employed as a
proper name for women \[MEYER, OLSHAUSEN\]. Doubtless the
interpretation, as here given, is but an echo of the remarks made by the
Christians regarding her--how well her character answered to her name.

Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down--the one in imitation of his
Master's way ([Luk 8:54](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#054); and compare
[Kg2 4:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#033)); the other, in striking
contrast with it. The kneeling became the lowly servant, but not the
Lord Himself, of whom it is never once recorded that he knelt in the
performance of a miracle.

and consequently disreputable, from the contact with dead animals and
blood which was connected with it. For this reason, even by other
nations, it is usually carried on at some distance from towns;
accordingly, Simon's house was "by the seaside" ([Act
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#006)). Peter's lodging there shows him
already to some extent above Jewish prejudice.
