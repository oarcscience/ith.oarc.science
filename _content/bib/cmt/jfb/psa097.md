### [Psalms Chapter 97](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#001)

[Psalms 97:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 97:1</span></span>

The writer celebrates the Lord's dominion over nations and nature,
describes its effect on foes and friends, and exhorts and encourages the
latter. ([Psa 97:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#001))

This dominion is a cause of joy, because, even though our minds are
oppressed with terror before the throne of the King of kings ([Exo
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#016); [Deu
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#022)), we know it is based on
righteous principles and judgments which are according to truth.

[Psalms 97:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 97:3</span></span>

The attending illustrations of God's awful justice on enemies ([Psa
83:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#014)) are seen in the disclosures of
His almighty power on the elements of nature (compare [Psa
46:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#002); [Psa
77:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#017); [Hab
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#006), &c.).

[Psalms 97:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 97:6</span></span>

heavens--or, their inhabitants ([Psa
50:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#006)), as opposed to "nations" in the
latter clause (compare [Isa 40:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#005); [Isa
66:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#018)).

[Psalms 97:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 97:7</span></span>

Idolaters are utterly put to shame, for if angels must worship Him, how
much more those who worshipped them.

all ye gods--literally, "all ye angels" ([Psa
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#005); [Psa
138:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#001); [Heb
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#006); [Heb
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#007)). Paul quotes, not as a prophecy,
but as language used in regard to the Lord Jehovah, who in the Old
Testament theophania is the second person of the Godhead.

[Psalms 97:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 97:8</span></span>

The exaltation of Zion's king is joy to the righteous and sorrow to the
wicked.

daughters of Judah--(Compare [Psa
48:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#011)).

[Psalms 97:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 97:9</span></span>

above all gods-- ([Psa 95:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#003)).

[Psalms 97:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 97:10</span></span>

Let gratitude for the blessings of providence and grace incite saints
([Psa 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#003)) to holy living. Spiritual
blessings are in store, represented by light ([Psa
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#001)) and gladness.

[Psalms 97:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 97:11</span></span>

sown--to spring forth abundantly for such, who alone can and well may
rejoice in the holy government of their sovereign Lord (compare [Psa
30:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#004); [Psa
32:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#011)).
