(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#001">Eze 15:1-8</A>)
<p>
<p>What has the vine-wood to make it pre-eminent above other forest-wood? Nothing. Nay, the reverse. Other trees yield useful timber, but vine-wood is soft, brittle, crooked, and seldom large; not so much as a "pin" (the large wooden peg used inside houses in the East to hang household articles on, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#023">Isa 22:23-25</A>) can be made of it. Its sole excellency is that it should bear fruit; when it does not bear fruit, it is not only not better, but inferior to other trees: so if God's people lose their distinctive excellency by not bearing fruits of righteousness, they are more unprofitable than the worldly (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#032">Deu 32:32</A>), for they are the vine; the sole end of their being is to bear fruit to His glory (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#008">Psa 80:8-9</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#001">Isa 5:1</A>, &amp;c.; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#021">Jer 2:21</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#001">Hos 10:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#033">Mat 21:33</A>). In all respects, except in their being planted by God, the Jews were inferior to other nations, as Egypt, Babylon, &amp;c., for example, in antiquity, extent of territory, resources, military power, attainments in arts and sciences. 
<p>
<p>or than a branch--rather, in apposition with "the vine tree." Omit "or than." What superiority has the vine if it be but a branch among the trees of the forest, that is, if, as having no fruit, it lies cut down among other woods of trees?

<p>both the ends--the north kingdom having been already overturned by Assyria under Tiglath-pileser; the south being pressed on by Egypt (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#029">Kg2 23:29-35</A>).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">eze 15:6</A></FONT></span></p>So will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem, as being utterly unprofitable (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#033">Mat 21:33-41</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#030">Mat 25:30</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#012">Mar 11:12-14</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#006">Luk 13:6-9</A>) in answering God's design that they should be witnesses for Jehovah before the heathen (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#010">Mat 3:10</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#013">Mat 5:13</A>).

<p>
<p>from one fire . . . another--(Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#018">Isa 24:18</A>). "Fire" means here every kind of calamity (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#012">Psa 66:12</A>). The Jewish fugitives shall escape from the ruin of Jerusalem, only to fall into some other calamity.
<p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">eze 15:8</A></FONT></span></p>trespass--rather, "they have perversely fallen into perverse rebellion." The Jews were not merely sinners as the other nations, but revolters and apostates. It is one thing to neglect what we know not, but quite another thing to despise what we profess to worship [JEROME], as the Jews did towards God and the law.
