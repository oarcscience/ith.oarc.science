### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 30](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#001)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 30:1</span></span>

THE AMALEKITES SPOIL ZIKLAG. ([Sa1
30:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#001))

Amalekites had invaded the south, and Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag--While
the strength of the Philistine forces was poured out of their country
into the plain of Esdraelon, the Amalekite marauders seized the
opportunity of the defenseless state of Philistia to invade the southern
territory. Of course, David's town suffered from the ravages of these
nomad plunderers, in revenge for his recent raid upon their territory.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 30:2</span></span>

they slew not any, either great or small, but carried them away--Their
conduct seems to stand in favorable contrast to that of David ([Sa1
27:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#011)). But their apparent clemency
did not arise from humane considerations. It is traceable to the ancient
war usages of the East, where the men of war, on the capture of a city,
were unsparingly put to death, but there were no warriors in Ziklag at
the time. The women and boys were reserved for slaves, and the old
people were spared out of respect to age.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 30:3</span></span>

David and his men came to the city, and, behold, it was burned with
fire--The language implies that the smoke of the conflagration was still
visible, and the sacking very recent.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 30:6</span></span>

BUT DAVID, ENCOURAGED BY GOD, PURSUES THEM. ([Sa1
30:6-15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#006))

David was greatly distressed--He had reason, not only on his own
personal account ([Sa1 30:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#005)), but on
account of the vehement outcry and insurrectionary threats against him
for having left the place so defenseless that the families of his men
fell an unresisting prey to the enemy. Under the pressure of so
unexpected and widespread a calamity, of which he was upbraided as the
indirect occasion, the spirit of any other leader guided by ordinary
motives would have sunk;

but David encouraged himself in the LORD his God--His faith supplied him
with inward resources of comfort and energy, and through the seasonable
inquiries he made by Urim, he inspired confidence by ordering an
immediate pursuit of the plunderers.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa1 30:9</span></span>

came to the brook Besor--now Wady Gaza, a winter torrent, a little to
the south of Gaza. The bank of a stream naturally offered a convenient
rest to the soldiers, who, through fatigue, were unable to continue the
pursuit.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa1 30:11</span></span>

they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David--Old and
homeborn slaves are usually treated with great kindness. But a purchased
or captured slave must look to himself; for, if feeble or sick, his
master will leave him to perish rather than encumber himself with any
additional burden. This Egyptian seems to have recently fallen into the
hands of an Amalekite, and his master having belonged to the marauding
party that had made the attack on Ziklag, he could give useful
information as to the course taken by them on their return.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa1 30:14</span></span>

the Cherethites--that is, the Philistines ([Eze
25:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#016); [Zep
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#005)).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa1 30:15</span></span>

Swear unto me by God--Whether there was still among these idolatrous
tribes a lingering belief in one God, or this Egyptian wished to bind
David by the God whom the Hebrews worshipped, the solemn sanction of an
oath was mutually recognized.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa1 30:16</span></span>

AND RECOVERS HIS TWO WIVES AND ALL THE SPOIL. (1Sa. 30:16-31)

they were spread abroad upon all the earth--Believing that David and all
his men of war were far away, engaged with the Philistine expedition,
they deemed themselves perfectly secure and abandoned themselves to all
manner of barbaric revelry. The promise made in answer to the devout
inquiries of David ([Sa1 30:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#008)) was
fulfilled. The marauders were surprised and panic-stricken. A great
slaughter ensued--the people as well as the booty taken from Ziklag was
recovered, besides a great amount of spoil which they had collected in a
wide, freebooting excursion.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa1 30:21</span></span>

David came to the two hundred men, which were so faint that they could
not follow--This unexpected accession of spoil was nearly proving an
occasion of quarrel through the selfish cupidity of some of his
followers, and serious consequences might have ensued had they not been
prevented by the prudence of the leader, who enacted it as a standing
ordinance--the equitable rule--that all the soldiers should share alike
(see [Num 31:11](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#011); see on [Num
31:25](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#025)).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">sa1 30:26</span></span>

when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil to the elders of
Judah--This was intended as an acknowledgment to the leading men in
those towns and villages of Judah which had ministered to his
necessities in the course of his various wanderings. It was the dictate
of an amiable and grateful heart; and the effect of this well-timed
liberality was to bring a large accession of numbers to his camp ([Ch1
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#022)). The enumeration of these
places shows what a numerous and influential party of adherents to his
cause he could count within his own tribe \[[Sa1
30:27-31](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#027)\].
