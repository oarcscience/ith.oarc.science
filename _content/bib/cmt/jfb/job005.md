### [Job Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#001)

[Job 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 5:1</span></span>

ELIPHAZ' CONCLUSION FROM THE VISION. (Job 5:1-27)

if there be any, &c.--Rather, "will He (God) reply to thee?" Job, after
the revelation just given, cannot be so presumptuous as to think God or
any of the holy ones ([Dan 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#017),
"angels") round His throne, will vouchsafe a reply (a judicial
expression) to his rebellious complaint.

[Job 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 5:2</span></span>

wrath . . . envy--fretful and passionate complaints, such as Eliphaz
charged Job with ([Job 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#005); so [Pro
14:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#030)). Not, the wrath of God killeth
the foolish, and His envy, &c.

[Job 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 5:3</span></span>

the foolish--the wicked. I have seen the sinner spread his "root" wide
in prosperity, yet circumstances "suddenly" occurred which gave occasion
for his once prosperous dwelling being "cursed" as desolate ([Psa
37:35-36](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#035); [Jer
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#008)).

[Job 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 5:4</span></span>

His children . . . crushed in the gate--A judicial formula. The gate was
the place of judgment and of other public proceedings ([Psa
127:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#005); [Pro
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#022); [Gen
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#010); [Deu
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#019)). Such propylÃ&brvbr;a have been
found in the Assyrian remains. Eliphaz obliquely alludes to the calamity
which cut off Job's children.

[Job 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 5:5</span></span>

even out of the thorns--Even when part of the grain remains hanging on
the thorn bushes (or, "is growing among thorns," [Mat
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#007)), the hungry gleaner does not
grudge the trouble of even taking it away, so clean swept away is the
harvest of the wicked.

the robber--as the Sabeans, who robbed Job. Rather, translate "the
thirsty," as the antithesis in the parallelism, "the hungry," proves.

[Job 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 5:6</span></span>

Although--rather, "for truly" \[UMBREIT\].

affliction cometh not forth of the dust--like a weed, of its own accord.
Eliphaz hints that the cause of it lay with Job himself.

[Job 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 5:7</span></span>

Yet--rather, "Truly," or, But affliction does not come from chance, but
is the appointment of God for sin; that is, the original birth-sin of
man. Eliphaz passes from the particular sin and consequent suffering of
Job to the universal sin and suffering of mankind. Troubles spring from
man's common sin by as necessary a law of natural consequences as sparks
(Hebrew, "sons of coal") fly upward. Troubles are many and fiery, as
sparks ([Pe1 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#012); [Isa
43:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#002)). UMBREIT for "sparks" has "birds
of prey;" literally, "sons of lightning," not so well.

[Job 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 5:8</span></span>

Therefore (as affliction is ordered by God, on account of sin), "I
would" have you to "seek unto God" ([Isa
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#019); [Amo
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#008); [Jer
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#024)).

[Job 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 5:11</span></span>

Connected with [Job 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#009). His
"unsearchable" dealings are with a view to raise the humble and abase
the proud ([Luk 1:52](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#052)). Therefore Job
ought to turn humbly to Him.

[Job 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 5:12</span></span>

enterprise--literally, "realization." The Hebrew combines in the one
word the two ideas, wisdom and happiness, "enduring existence" being the
etymological and philosophical root of the combined notion \[UMBREIT\].

[Job 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 5:13</span></span>

Paul ([Co1 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#019)) quoted this clause
with the formula establishing its inspiration, "it is written." He cites
the exact Hebrew words, not as he usually does the Septuagint, Greek
version ([Psa 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#015)). Haman was hanged
on the gallows he prepared for Mordecai ([Est
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#014); [Est
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/est007.htm#010)).

the wise--that is, "the cunning."

is carried headlong--Their scheme is precipitated before it is ripe.

[Job 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 5:14</span></span>

Judicial blindness often is sent upon keen men of the world ([Deu
28:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#029); [Isa
59:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#010); [Joh
9:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#039)).

[Job 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 5:15</span></span>

"From the sword" which proceedeth "from their mouth" ([Psa
59:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#007); [Psa
57:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#004)).

[Job 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 5:16</span></span>

the poor hath hope--of the interposition of God.

iniquity stoppeth her mouth-- ([Psa
107:42](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#042); [Mic
7:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#009); [Isa
52:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#015)). Especially at the last day,
through shame ([Jde 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#015); [Mat
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#012)). The "mouth" was the offender
([Job 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#015)), and the mouth shall then
be stopped ([Isa 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#008)) at the end.

[Job 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 5:17</span></span>

happy--not that the actual suffering is joyous; but the consideration of
the righteousness of Him who sends it, and the end for which it is sent,
make it a cause for thankfulness, not for complaints, such as Job had
uttered ([Heb 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#011)). Eliphaz implies
that the end in this case is to call back Job from the particular sin of
which he takes for granted that Job is guilty. Paul seems to allude to
this passage in [Heb 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#005); so [Jam
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#012); [Pro
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#012). Eliphaz does not give due
prominence to this truth, but rather to Job's sin. It is Elihu alone
(Job 32:1-37:24) who fully dwells upon the truth, that affliction is
mercy and justice in disguise, for the good of the sufferer.

[Job 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 5:18</span></span>

he maketh sore, and bindeth up-- ([Deu
32:39](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#039); [Hos
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#001); [Sa1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#006)). An image from binding up a
wound. The healing art consisted much at that time in external
applications.

[Job 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 5:19</span></span>

in six . . . yea, in seven-- ([Pro
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#016); [Amo
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#003)). The Hebrew idiom fixes on a
certain number (here "six"), in order to call attention as to a thing of
importance; then increases the force by adding, with a "yea, nay seven,"
the next higher number; here "seven," the sacred and perfect number. In
all possible troubles; not merely in the precise number "seven."

[Job 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 5:20</span></span>

power-- ([Jer 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#012)). Hebrew, "hands."

of the sword-- ([Eze 35:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#005), Margin).
Hands are given to the sword personified as a living agent.

[Job 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 5:21</span></span>

([Psa 31:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#020); [Jer
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#018)). Smite (Psalm 73. 9).

[Job 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 5:22</span></span>

famine thou shalt laugh--Not, in spite of destruction and famine, which
is true ([Hab 3:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#017)), though not the
truth meant by Eliphaz, but because those calamities shall not come upon
thee. A different Hebrew word from that in [Job
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#020); there, famine in general; here,
the languid state of those wanting proper nutriment \[BARNES\].

[Job 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">job 5:23</span></span>

in league with the stones of the field--They shall not hurt the
fertility of thy soil; nor the wild beasts thy fruits; spoken in
Arabia-Deserta, where stones abounded. Arabia, derived from Arabah--a
desert plain. The first clause of this verse answers to the first clause
of [Job 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#022); and the last of this
verse to the last of that verse. The full realization of this is yet
future ([Isa 65:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#023), [Isa
65:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#025); [Hos
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#018)).

[Job 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">job 5:24</span></span>

know--"Thou shalt rest in the assurance, that thine habitation is the
abode of peace; and (if) thou numberest thine herd, thine expectations
prove not fallacious" \[UMBREIT\]. "Sin" does not agree with the
context. The Hebrew word--"to miss" a mark, said of archers ([Jdg
20:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#016)). The Hebrew for "habitation"
primarily means "the fold for cattle"; and for "visit," often to "take
an account of, to number." "Peace" is the common Eastern salutation;
including inward and outward prosperity.

[Job 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">job 5:25</span></span>

as the grass-- ([Psa 72:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#016)). Properly,
"herb-bearing seed" ([Gen 1:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#011)).

[Job 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">job 5:26</span></span>

in a full age--So "full of days" ([Job
42:17](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#017); [Gen
35:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#029)). Not mere length of years, but
ripeness for death, one's inward and outward full development not being
prematurely cut short, is denoted ([Isa
65:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#022)).

Thou shalt come--not literally, but expressing willingness to die.
Eliphaz speaks from the Old Testament point of view, which made full
years a reward of the righteous ([Psa
91:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#016); [Exo
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#012)), and premature death the lot of
the wicked ([Psa 55:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#023)). The righteous
are immortal till their work is done. To keep them longer would be to
render them less fit to die. God takes them at their best ([Isa
57:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#001)). The good are compared to wheat
([Mat 13:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#030)).

cometh in--literally, "ascends." The corn is lifted up off the earth and
carried home; so the good man "is raised into the heap of sheaves"
\[UMBREIT\].

[Job 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">job 5:27</span></span>

searched it . . . for thy good--literally, "for thyself" ([Psa
111:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#002); [Pro
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#004); [Pro
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#012)).
