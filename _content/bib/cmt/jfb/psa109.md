### [Psalms Chapter 109](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#001)

[Psalms 109:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 109:1</span></span>

The writer complains of his virulent enemies, on whom he imprecates
God's righteous punishment, and to a prayer for a divine interposition
in his behalf appends the expression of his confidence and a promise of
his praises. This Psalm is remarkable for the number and severity of its
imprecations. Its evident typical character (compare [Psa
109:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#008)) justifies the explanation of
these already given, that as the language of David respecting his own
enemies, or those of Christ, it has respect not to the penitent, but to
the impenitent and implacable foes of good men, and of God and His
cause, whose inevitable fate is thus indicated by inspired authority.
(Psa. 109:1-31)

God of my praise--its object, thus recognizing God as a certain helper.

They return evil for good (compare [Psa
27:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#012); [Pro
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#013)).

Let his family share the punishment, his children be as wandering

In confidence that God's blessing would come on him, and confusion and
shame on his enemies ([Psa 73:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#013)), he
ceases to regard their curses, and anticipates a season of joyful and
public thanksgiving; for God is near to protect ([Psa

34:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#006)) the poor from all unrighteous
judges who may condemn him.
