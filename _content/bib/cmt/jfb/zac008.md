### [Zechariah Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#001)

[Zechariah 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">zac 8:2</span></span>

CONTINUATION OF THE SUBJECT IN THE SEVENTH CHAPTER. After urging them to
obedience by the fate of their fathers, he urges them to it by promises
of coming prosperity. (Zec. 8:1-23)

jealous for Zion-- ([Zac 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#014)).

with great fury--against her oppressors.

[Zechariah 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">zac 8:3</span></span>

I am returned--that is, I am determined to return. My decree to that
effect is gone forth.

Jerusalem . . . city of truth--that is, faithful to her God, who is the
God of truth ([Isa 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#021), [Isa
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#026); [Joh
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#017)). Never yet fully fulfilled,
therefore still to be so.

the mountain of the Lord-- ([Isa
2:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002)).

holy mountain-- ([Jer 31:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#023)).

[Zechariah 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">zac 8:4</span></span>

So tranquil and prosperous shall the nation be that wars shall no longer
prematurely cut off the people: men and women shall reach advanced ages.
The promise of long life was esteemed one of the greatest blessings in
the Jewish theocracy with its temporal rewards of obedience ([Exo
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#012); [Deu
4:40](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#040)). Hence this is a leading feature
in millennial blessedness ([Isa 65:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#020),
[Isa 65:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#022)).

for very age--literally, "for multitude of days."

[Zechariah 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">zac 8:5</span></span>

boys and girls playing--implying security and a numerous progeny,
accounted a leading blessing among the Jews. Contrast [Jer
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#011); [Jer
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#021).

[Zechariah 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">zac 8:6</span></span>

However impossible these things just promised by Me seem to you, they
are not so with God. The "remnant" that had returned from the captivity,
beholding the city desolate and the walls and houses in ruins, could
hardly believe what God promised. The expression "remnant" glances at
their ingratitude in rating so low God's power, though they had
experienced it so "marvellously" displayed in their restoration. A great
source of unbelief is, men "limit" God's power by their own ([Psa
78:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#019), [Psa
78:41](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#041)).

these days--"of small things" ([Zac
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#010)), when such great things promised
seemed incredible. MAURER, after JEROME, translates, "in those days";
that is, if the thing which I promised to do in those days, seems
"marvellous," &c.

[Zechariah 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">zac 8:7</span></span>

save my people from . . . east . . . west--that is, from every region
(compare [Psa 50:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#001); the "West" is
literally, "the going down of the sun") to which they are scattered;
they are now found especially in countries west of Jerusalem. The
dispersion under Nebuchadnezzar was only to the east, namely, to
Babylonia. The restoration, including a spiritual return to God ([Zac
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#008)), here foretold, must therefore be
still future ([Isa 11:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#011); [Isa
43:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#005); [Eze
37:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#021); [Amo
9:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#014); also [Zac
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#009); [Jer
30:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#022); [Jer
31:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#001), [Jer
31:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#033)).

[Zechariah 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">zac 8:8</span></span>

in truth--in good faith, both on their side and Mine: God being faithful
to His everlasting covenant and enabling them by His Spirit to be
faithful to Him.

[Zechariah 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">zac 8:9</span></span>

All adversities formerly attended them when neglecting to build the
temple: but now God promises all blessings, as an encouragement to
energy in the work.

hands . . . strong--be of courageous mind ([Sa2
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#021)), not merely in building, but in
general, as having such bright prospects ([Zac
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#013), &c.).

these days--the time that had elapsed between the prophet's having
spoken "these words" and the time ([Zac
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#010); compare [Hag
2:15-19](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#015)) when they set about in
earnest restoring the temple.

the prophets--Haggai and Zechariah himself ([Ezr
5:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#001)). The same prophets who promised
prosperity at the foundation of the temple, now promised still greater
blessings hereafter.

[Zechariah 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">zac 8:10</span></span>

before these days--before the time in which ye again proceeded with the
building of the temple ([Zac 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#009)),
namely, at the time that the temple lay neglected.

no hire for man . . . beast--that is, no produce of the field to repay
the labor of man and beast on it ([Hag
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#006), [Hag
1:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#009); [Hag
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#016)).

neither . . . peace to him that went out or came in-- ([Ch2
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#005)). No one could in safety do his
business at home or abroad, in the city or in the country, whether going
or returning.

because of the affliction--so sorely pressed were they by the foe
outside. MAURER translates, "Because of the foe" ([Ezr
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#001)).

every one against . . . neighbour--There was internal discord, as well
as foes from without.

[Zechariah 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">zac 8:11</span></span>

"But now that the temple has been built, I will not do as I had formerly
done to those who returned from Babylon" \[JEROME\]. Henceforth I will
bless you.

[Zechariah 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">zac 8:12</span></span>

seed . . . prosperous--that is, shall not fair to yield abundantly ([Hos
2:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#021); [Hag
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#019)). Contrast with this verse [Hag
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#006), [Hag
1:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#009); [Hag
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#016).

dew--especially beneficial in hot countries where rain is rare.

[Zechariah 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">zac 8:13</span></span>

a curse--As the heathen have made you another name for "a curse,"
wishing to their foes as bad a lot as yours ([Jer
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#009); [Jer
29:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#018)); so your name shall be a
formula of blessing, so that men shall say to their friend, May thy lot
be as happy as that of Judah ([Gen
48:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#020)). Including also the idea of the
Jews being a source of blessing to the Gentile nations ([Mic
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#007); [Zep
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#020)). The distinct mention of "Judah"
and "Israel" proves that the prophecy has not yet had its full
accomplishment, as Israel (the ten tribes) has never yet been restored,
though individuals of Israel returned with Judah.

[Zechariah 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">zac 8:14</span></span>

I thought--I determined.

you--that is, your fathers, with whom ye are one; the Jewish Church of
all ages being regarded as an organic whole (compare [Hag
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#005); [Mat
23:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#031)).

repented not--I changed not My purpose, because they changed not their
mind ([Ch2 36:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#016)). With the froward
God shows Himself froward ([Psa
18:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#026)). If the threatened punishment
has been so unchangeably inflicted, much more will God surely give the
promised blessing, which is so much more consonant to His nature ([Jer
31:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#028)).

[Zechariah 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">zac 8:16</span></span>

The promised blessings are connected with obedience. God's covenanted
grace will lead those truly blessed by it to holiness, not
licentiousness.

truth to . . . neighbour--not that the truth should not be spoken to
foreigners too; but He makes it an aggravation of their sin, that they
spared not even their brethren. Besides, and above all outward
ordinances ([Zac 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#003)), God requires
truth and justice.

judgment of . . . peace--Equitable decisions tend to allay feuds and
produce peace.

gates--the place where courts of judicature in the East were held.

[Zechariah 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">zac 8:17</span></span>

all these . . . I hate--therefore ye too ought to hate them. Religion
consists in conformity to God's nature, that we should love what God
loves and hate what God hates.

[Zechariah 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">zac 8:18</span></span>

The prophet answers the query ([Zac
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#003)) as to the fast in the fifth
month, by a reply applying to all their fasts: these are to be turned
into days of rejoicing. So Jesus replied to His disciples when similarly
consulting Him as to why fasting was not imposed by Him, as it was by
John the Baptist. When the Sun of righteousness shines, tears are dried
up ([Mat 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#015)). So hereafter ([Isa
35:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#010)).

[Zechariah 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">zac 8:19</span></span>

fast of . . . fourth month--On the fourth month of the eleventh year of
Zedekiah's reign, on the ninth day, Jerusalem was taken ([Jer
39:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#002); [Jer
52:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#006)). It was therefore made a fast
day.

fifth . . . seventh--(See on [Zac 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#003);
[Zac 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#005)).

tenth--On the tenth month and tenth day, in the ninth year of Zedekiah,
the siege began ([Jer 52:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#004)).

therefore love the truth--or, "only love." English Version is better.
God's blessing covenanted to Israel is not made to depend on Israel's
goodness: but Israel's goodness should follow as the consequence of
God's gracious promises ([Zac 8:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#016);
[Zac 7:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#009)). God will bless, but not
those who harden themselves in sin.

[Zechariah 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">zac 8:20</span></span>

([Isa 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#003); [Mic
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#002)).

Thus saith the Lord of hosts--a preface needed to assure the Jews, now
disheartened by the perils surrounding them, and by the humble aspect of
the temple. "Unlikely as what follows may seem to you, Jehovah of hosts,
boundless in resources, saith it, therefore it shall be so." Just before
Christ's coming, a feeling grew up among the heathen of the
unsatisfactoriness of their systems of religion and philosophy; this
disposed them favorably towards the religion of the Jew, so that
proselytes embraced the worship of Jehovah from various parts of Asia;
these again were predisposed to embrace Christianity when it was
preached to them ([Act 2:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#009), [Act
2:41](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#041)). But the full accomplishment of
the conversion of the Gentiles foretold here is reserved till
"Jerusalem" ([Zac 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#022)) becomes the
center of Christianized Jewry ([Rom
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#012), [Rom
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#015)).

[Zechariah 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">zac 8:21</span></span>

Let us . . . I--manifesting zeal and love: converted themselves, they
seek the conversion of others ([Sol
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#004)). To exhortation in general ("Let
us go"), they add individual example ("I will go"). Or, the change from
plural to singular implies that the general consent in religious
earnestness leads each individual to decide for God.

go speedily--literally, "go, going"; implying intense earnestness.

pray--Hebrew, "entreat the face" ([Zac
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#002)); entreat His favor and grace.

[Zechariah 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">zac 8:22</span></span>

many . . . strong nations . . . in Jerusalem--In contrast to the few and
weak Jews now building the temple and city, then such shall be their
influence that many and strong nations shall come to worship Jehovah
their God in Jerusalem ([Isa 60:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#003);
[Isa 66:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#023)).

[Zechariah 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">zac 8:23</span></span>

ten--a definite number for an indefinite. So in [Lev
22:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#026); [Num
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#022).

of all languages of the nations--that is, of nations of all languages
(compare [Isa 66:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#018); [Rev
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#009)).

take hold of the skirt--a gesture of suppliant entreaty as to a
superior. Compare [Isa 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#006); [Isa
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#001), on a different occasion. The
Gentiles shall eagerly seek to share the religious privileges of the
Jew. The skirt with a fringe and blue ribbon upon it ([Num
15:38](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#038); [Deu
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#012)) was a distinguishing badge of a
Jew.

God is with you--the effect produced on unbelievers in entering the
assemblies of the Church ([Co1 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#025)).
But primarily, that produced on the nations in witnessing the
deliverance of the Jews by Cyrus. Finally, that to be produced on the
nations by the future grand interposition of Messiah in behalf of His
people.

Written long after the previous portions of the book, whence arise the
various features which have been made grounds for attacking their
authenticity, notwithstanding the testimony of the Septuagint and of the
compilers of the Jewish canon in their favor. See Introduction.

ALEXANDER'S CONQUESTS IN SYRIA ([Zac
9:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#001)). GOD'S PEOPLE SAFE BECAUSE HER
COMETH LOWLY, BUT A SAVIOUR ([Zac
9:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#009)). THE MACCABEAN DELIVERANCE A
TYPE THEREOF ([Zac 9:11-17](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#011)).
