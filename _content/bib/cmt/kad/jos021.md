### [Joshua Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#001)

[Joshua 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 21:1</span></span>

After the cities of refuge had been set apart, the towns were also
selected, which the different tribes were to give up for the priest and
Levites to dwell in according to the Mosaic instructions in [Num
35:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#001), together with the necessary
fields as pasturage for their cattle. The setting apart of the cities of
refuge took place before the appointment of the Levitical towns, because
the Lord had given commandment through Moses in [Num
35:6](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#006), that they were to give to the
Levites the six cities of refuge, and forty-two cities besides, i.e.,
forty-eight cities in all. From the introductory statement in [Jos
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#001), [Jos
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#002), that the heads of the fathers
(see [Exo 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#014), [Exo
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#025)) of the Levitical families
reminded the distribution committee at Shiloh of the command of God that
had been issued through Moses, that towns were to be given them to dwell
in, we cannot infer, as Calvin has done, that the Levites had been
forgotten, till they came and asserted their claims. All that is stated
in these words is, "that when the business had reached that point, they
approached the dividers of the land in the common name of the members of
their tribe, to receive by lot the cities appointed for them. They
simply expressed the commands of God, and said in so many words, that
they had been deputed by the Levites generally to draw lots for those
forty-eight cities with their suburbs, which had been appointed for that
tribe" (Masius). The clause appended to Shiloh, "in the land of Canaan,"
points to the instructions in [Num
34:29](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#029) and [Num
35:10](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#010), to give the children of Israel
their inheritance in the land of Canaan.

[Joshua 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jos 21:4</span></span>

Number of the cities which the different families of Levi received from
each tribe. The tribe of Levi was divided into three branches, - The
Gershonites, the Kohathites, and the Merarites (see Num 3 and [Exo
6:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#016)). The Kohathites again were
divided into the four families of Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel ([Exo
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#018)); and the family of Amram into
two lines, consisting of the descendants of Moses and Aaron ([Exo
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#020)). The priesthood was committed to
the line of Aaron ([Num 18:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#001)); but
the other descendants of Amram, i.e., the descendants of Moses, were
placed on a par with the other descendants of Levi, and numbered among
the simple Levites (Num. 3; [Ch1
6:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#001)). The towns in which the
different families of Levi were to dwell were determined by lot; but in
all probability the towns which each tribe was to give up to them were
selected first of all, so that the lot merely decided to which branch of
the Levites each particular town was to belong.

[Jos 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#004)

The first lot came out for the families of Kohath, and among these again
for the sons of Aaron, i.e., the priests. They received thirteen towns
from the tribes of Judah, Simeon, and Benjamin. "This did not happen by
chance; but God, according to His wonderful counsel, placed them just in
that situation which He had determined to select for His own temple"
(Calvin).

[Jos 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#005)

The rest of the Kohathites, i.e., the descendants of Moses, Izhar,
Hebron, and Uzziel, received ten towns from Ephraim, Dan, and half
Manasseh.

[Jos 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#006)

The Gershonites received thirteen towns from Issachar, Asher, Naphtali,
and half Manasseh in Bashan.

[Jos 21:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#007)

The Merarites received twelve towns from Reuben, Gad, and Zebulun.

The number of towns thus assigned to the Levites will not appear too
large, if we consider, (1) that judging from the number of towns in so
small a land, the greater part of them cannot have been very large; (2)
that the Levites were not the sole possessors of these towns, but simply
received the number of dwelling-houses which they actually required,
with meadow land for their cattle in the suburbs of the towns, whilst
the rest of the space still belonged to the different tribes; and (3)
that if the 23,000 males, the number of the Levites at the second census
which was taken in the steppes of Moab, were distributed among the
thirty-five towns, it would give 657 males, or 1300 male and female
Levites for every town. On the other hand, offence has been taken at the
statement, that thirteen towns were given up to the priests; and under
the idea that Aaron could hardly have had descendants enough in Joshua's
time from his two sons who remained alive to fill even two towns, to say
nothing of thirteen, the list has been set down as a document which was
drawn up at a much later date (Maurer, etc.). But any one who takes this
ground not only attributes to the distribution commission the enormous
shortsightedness of setting apart towns for the priests merely to meet
their existing wants, and without any regard to the subsequent increase
which would take place in their numbers, but also forms too large an
estimate of the size of the towns, and too small an estimate of the
number of the priests. Moreover, it was never intended that the towns
should be filled with priests' families; and the number of priests alive
at that time is not mentioned anywhere. But if we bear in mind that
Aaron died in the fortieth year of the journeys of the Israelites, at
the age of 123 years ([Num 33:38](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#038)), and
therefore was eighty-three years old at the time of the exodus from
Egypt, his descendants might have entered upon the fourth generation
seven years after his death. Now his two sons had twenty-four male
descendants, who were the founders of the twenty-four classes instituted
by David (1 Chron 24). And if we only reckon six males to each of the
next generations, there would be 144 in the third generation, who would
be between the ages of twenty-five and thirty-five when the distribution
of the land took place, and who might therefore have had 864 male
children living at that time; so that the total number of males in the
families of the priests might have amounted to more than 1000, that is
to say, might have consisted of at least 200 families.

[Joshua 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jos 21:9</span></span>

Names of the Levitical Towns.

(Note: There is a similar list in 1 Chron 6:54-81, though in some
respects differently arranged, and with many variations in the names,
and corruptions of different kinds in the text, which show that the
author of the Chronicles has inserted an ancient document that was
altogether independent of the book before us. Thus in the Chronicles
there are only forty-two towns mentioned by name instead of forty-eight,
although it is stated in [Ch1 6:45](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#045).
that 13 + 10 + 13 + 12, i.e., forty-eight towns in all, were given up to
the Levites. The names omitted are (1) Jutta in Judah; (2) Gibeon in
Benjamin; (3 and 4) Ethekeh and Gibbethon in Dan; (5 and 6) and Jokneam
and Nahalal in Zebulun (compare [Jos
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#016), [Jos
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#017), [Jos
21:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#023), [Jos
21:34](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#034), and [Jos
21:35](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#035), with [Ch1
6:59-60](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#059), [Ch1
6:68](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#068), [Ch1
6:77](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#077). In some cases also the author of
the Chronicles gives different names, though some of them indeed are
only different forms of the same name, e.g., Hilen for Holon, Alemeth
for Almon, Ashtaroth for Beeshterah, Mashal for Misheal, Hammon for
Hammoth-dor, Kirjathaim for Kartan (compare [Ch1
6:58](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#058), [Ch1
6:60](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#060), [Ch1
6:71](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#071), [Ch1
6:74](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#074), [Ch1
6:76](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#076), with [Jos
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#015), [Jos
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#018), [Jos
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#027), [Jos
21:30](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#030), [Jos
21:32](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#032)); or in some cases possibly
different names of the same town, e.g., Jokmeam for Kibzaim, and Ramoth
for Jarmuth, and Anem for En-gannim ([Ch1
6:68](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#068), 83, and [Jos
21:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#022), [Jos
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#029)); whilst some evidently give the
true reading, viz., Ashan for Ain, and Bileam for Gath-rimmon ([Ch1
6:59](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#059), [Ch1
6:70](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#070); [Jos
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#016), [Jos
21:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#026)). The majority, however, are
faulty readings, viz., Aner for Tanach, Kedesh for Kishon, Hukok for
Helkath, Rimmon and Tabor (compare [Ch1
6:70](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#070), [Ch1
6:72](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#072), [Ch1
6:75](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#075), [Ch1
6:77](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#077), with [Jos
21:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#025), [Jos
21:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#028), [Jos
21:31](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#031), [Jos
21:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#034)).)

[Jos 21:9-19](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#009)

The priests' towns: (a) in Judah and Simeon ([Jos
21:9-16](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#009)); (b) in Benjamin ([Jos
21:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#017)).

[Jos 21:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#009)

In the tribe of Judah the priests received Kirjath-arba, or Hebron, with
the necessary pasturage round about the town (see [Num
35:2](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#002)), whilst the field of the town
with the villages belonging to it remained in the hands of Caleb and his
family as their possession ([Jos
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#012).).

[Jos 21:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#013)

[Jos 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#013) contains a repetition of
[Jos 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#011), occasioned by the
parenthetical remark in [Jos 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#012).
They also received Libnah in the lowland (see [Jos
15:42](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#042); [Jos
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#029)); Jattir ([Jos
15:48](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#048)), Eshtemoah ([Jos
15:50](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#050)), Holon ([Jos
15:51](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#051)), and Debir ([Jos
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#015), [Jos
15:49](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#049); [Jos
10:38](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#038)) on the mountains of Judah; Ain,
for which we should read Ashan ([Ch1
6:44](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#044); cf. [Jos
15:42](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#042)), in the tribe of Simeon ([Jos
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#007)); Juttah on the mountains ([Jos
15:55](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#055)); and Beth-shemesh in the
lowland ([Jos 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#010)).

[Jos 21:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#017)

In the tribe of Benjamin they received Gibeon (see [Jos
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#003)), Geba ([Jos
18:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#024)), also Anathoth and Almon, which
are missing in the list of the towns of Benjamin (see at [Jos
18:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#024)).

[Jos 21:20-25](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#020)

Towns of the Levites. - [Jos 21:20-26](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#020).
The other Kohathites received four towns from the tribe of Ephraim ([Jos
21:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#021), [Jos
21:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#022)), four from Dan ([Jos
21:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#023), [Jos
21:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#024)), and two from the half tribe of
Manasseh on this side of the Jordan ([Jos
21:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#025)). From Ephraim they received
Shechem (see [Jos 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#007)), Gezer ([Jos
10:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#033)), Kibzaim - for which we find
Jockmeam in [Ch1 6:68](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#068), possibly a
different name for the same place, which has not yet been discovered -
and Beth-horon, whether Upper or Lower is not stated (see [Jos
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#010)). From Dan they received
Elthekeh and Gibbethon ([Jos 19:44](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#044)),
Ajalon and Gath-rimmon ([Jos 19:42](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#042),
[Jos 19:45](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#045)). From half Manasseh they
received Taanach ([Jos 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#011); [Jos
12:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#021)) and Gath-rimmon - eye to the
previous verse, for Bileam ([Ch1
6:70](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#070)), i.e., Jibleam ([Jos
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#011)).

[Jos 21:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#026)

Thus they received ten towns in all.

[Jos 21:27-33](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#027)

The Gershonites received two towns from eastern Manasseh: Golan ([Jos
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#008); [Deu
4:43](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#043)), and Beeshterah. Beeshterah
(contracted from Beth-eshterah, the house of Astarte), called Ashtaroth
in [Ch1 6:56](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#056), may possibly have been
the capital of king Og (Ashtaroth-karnaim, [Gen
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#005)), if not one of the two villages
named Astaroth, which are mentioned by Eusebius in the Onom. (s. v.
Astharoth-karnaim), and are described by Jerome as duo castella in
Batanaea, novem inter se millibus separata inter Adaram et Abilam
civitates, though Adara and Abila are too indefinite to determine the
situation with any exactness. At any rate, the present Busra on the east
of the Hauran cannot be thought of for a moment; for this was called
Βόσσορα or Βοσορρά, i.e., בּצרה, in ancient times, as it is at the
present day (see 1 Macc. 5:26, and Joseph. Ant. xii. 8, 3), and was
corrupted into Bostra by the Greeks and Romans. Nor can it be the
present Kul'at Bustra on the north of Banyas upon a shoulder of the
Hermon, where there are the ruins of a magnificent building, probably a
temple of ancient date (Burckhardt, Syr. pp. 93, 94; Rob. Bibl. Res. pp.
414-15), as Knobel supposes, since the territory of the Israelites did
not reach so far north, the land conquered by Joshua merely extending to
Baal-gad, i.e., Banyas, at the foot of the Hermon (see [Jos
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#017)), and the land to the east of
the Jordan, or Bashan, only to the Hermon itself, or more correctly,
merely to the districts of Geshuri and Maacah at the south-eastern
border of the Hermon (see at [Deu 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#008),
[Deu 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#014)).

[Jos 21:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#028)

From Issachar they received four towns: Kishon ([Jos
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#020)), Dabrath ([Jos
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#012)), Jarmuth = Remeth (see [Jos
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#021)), and En-gannim ([Jos
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#021), or Anem, [Ch1
6:73](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#073)).

[Jos 21:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#030)

From Asher they received four towns: Mishal or Masal ([Jos
19:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#026); cf. [Ch1
6:74](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#074)), Abdon ([Jos
19:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#028)), Helkath ([Jos
19:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#025), called Hukok in [Ch1
6:75](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#075), probably a copyist's error), and
Rehob ([Jos 19:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#028)).

[Jos 21:32](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#032)

From Naphtali they received three towns: Kedesh ([Jos
19:37](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#037) and [Jos
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#022)), Hammoth-dor (called Hammath in
[Jos 19:35](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#035), and Hammon in [Ch1
6:76](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#076)), and Kartan (contracted from
Kartain for Kirjathaim, [Ch1 6:76](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#076);
like Dothan in [Kg2 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#013), from Dothain
in [Gen 37:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#017)). Kartan is not
mentioned among the towns of Naphtali in [Jos
19:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#033).; according to Knobel it may
possibly be Katanah, a place with ruins to the north-east of Safed (Van
de Velde, Mem. p. 147).

[Jos 21:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#033)

They received thirteen towns in all.

[Jos 21:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#034)

The Merarites received twelve towns. From the tribe of Zebulun they
received four: Jokneam ([Jos 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#011) :
see at [Jos 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#022)), Kartah and Dimnah,

(Note: Many commentators identify Dimnah with Rimmono in [Ch1
6:77](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#077), but without sufficient reason;
for the next of the Chronicles is no doubt corrupt in this passage, as
it has only two names, Rimmono and Tabor, instead of four.)

which are not mentioned among the towns of Zebulun in [Jos
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#011)., and are unknown, and Nahalal
([Jos 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#015)).

[Jos 21:36-37](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#036)

From Reuben they received four: Gezer ([Jos
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#008) : see [Deu
4:43](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#043)), Jahza, Kedemoth, and Mephaath
([Jos 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#018)).

(Note: R. Jacob ben Chajim has omitted [Jos
21:36](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#036) and [Jos
21:37](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#037) from his Rabbinical Bible of the
year 1525 as spurious, upon the authority of Kimchi and the larger
Masora; but upon insufficient grounds, as these verses are to be found
in many good MSS and old editions of an earlier date than 1525, as well
as in all the ancient versions, and could not possibly have been wanting
from the very first, since the Merarites received twelve towns, which
included the four that belonged to Reuben. In those MSS in which they
are wanting, the omission was, no doubt, a copyist's error, occasioned
by the homoioteleuto'n (see de Rossi variae lectt. ad h. l., and J. H.
Michaelis' Note to his Hebrew Bible).)

[Jos 21:38-39](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#038)

From Gad they received four towns: Ramoth in Gilead, and Mahanaim (see
at [Jos 13:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#026)), Heshbon ([Jos
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#017)) and Jaezer ([Jos
13:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#025) : see at [Num
21:32](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#032)).

[Jos 21:40-42](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#040)

They received twelve towns in all. - In [Jos
21:41](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#041) and [Jos
21:42](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#042) the list of the Levitical towns
is closed with a statement of their total number, and also with the
repetition of the remark that "these cities were every one with their
suburbs round about them." ום עיר עיר, city city, i.e., every city, with
its pasture round about it.

[Joshua 21:43](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">jos 21:43</span></span>

[Jos 21:43-45](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#043) form the conclusion to
the account of the division of the land in Josh 13-21, which not only
points back to [Jos 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#023), but also to
[Jos 1:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#002), and connects the two
halves of our book together. By the division of Canaan among the tribes
of Israel, the promise which Joshua had received from God after the
death of Moses was fulfilled ([Jos
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#002).). The Lord had given Israel the
whole land which He had sworn to the fathers ([Gen
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#007); [Gen
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#018), compared with [Jos
1:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#003)); and they had now taken
possession of it to dwell therein.

[Jos 21:44](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#044)

He had also procured them rest round about, as He had sworn to their
fathers, inasmuch as not a man of all their enemies stood against them.
The expression "gave them rest," etc., points back to [Deu
12:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#009), and refers to all the divine
promises of the Pentateuch which assured the Israelites of the peaceable
possession of Canaan, such as [Exo
33:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#014); [Deu
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#020), etc. No enemy had been able to
withstand them, as the Lord had promised Joshua ([Jos
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#005)). "The Lord delivered all their
enemies into their hand." It is true the Canaanites were not all
exterminated; but those who were left had become so powerless, that they
could neither accomplish nor attempt anything against Israel, so long as
the Israelites adhered faithfully to their God, or so long as Joshua and
the elders who were his contemporaries were alive ([Jdg
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#006).), because the Lord had
overwhelmed them with fear and terror before the Israelites.

(Note: "If any one should raise a question as to their actual peace, the
solution is easy enough. The tribes of Canaan were so alarmed and broken
down with their fear, that in their opinion nothing could serve their
purpose better than to purchase peace from the children of Israel by the
most obsequious servility. Clearly, therefore, the land was subdued and
their home at peace, since no one disturbed them, or attempted anything
against them; there were no threats, no snares, no violence, and no
conspiracy." - Calvin.)

[Jos 21:45](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#045)

Of all the good words which the Lord had spoken to the house of Israel
not one had fallen, i.e., remained unfulfilled ([Num
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#012)); all had come to pass (vid.,
[Jos 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#014)). הטּוב כּל־הדּבר relates
to the gracious promises of God with regard to the peaceful possession
of Canaan, which formed the basis of all the salvation promised to
Israel, and the pledge of the fulfilment of all the further promises of
God. Notwithstanding the fact that many a tract of country still
remained in the hands of the Canaanites, the promise that the land of
Canaan should be given to the house of Israel for a possession had been
fulfilled; for God had not promised the immediate and total destruction
of the Canaanites, but only their gradual extermination ([Exo
23:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#029); [Deu
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#022)). And even though the Israelites
never came into undisputed possession of the whole of the promised land,
to the full extent of the boundaries laid down in [Num
34:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#001), never conquering Tyre and
Sidon for example, the promises of God were no more broken on that
account than they were through the circumstance, that after the death of
Joshua and the elders his contemporaries, Israel was sometimes hard
pressed by the Canaanites; since the complete fulfilment of this promise
was inseparably connected with the fidelity of Israel to the Lord.

(Note: With reference to this apparent discrepancy between the promises
of God and the actual results, Calvin observes, that "in order to remove
every appearance of discrepancy, it is right to distinguish well between
the clear, unwavering, and certain fidelity of God in the fulfilment of
His promises, and the weakness and indolence of the people, which caused
the blessings of God to slip from their hands. Whatever war the people
undertook, in whatever direction they carried their standards, there was
victory ready to their hand; nor was there anything to retard or prevent
the extermination of all their enemies except their own slothfulness.
Consequently, although they did not destroy them all, so as to empty the
land for their own possession, the truth of God stood out as distinctly
as if they had; for there would have been no difficulty in their
accomplishment of all that remained to be done, if they had only been
disposed to grasp the victories that were ready to their hand.")
