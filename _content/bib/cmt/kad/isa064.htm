<p>The similes which follow cannot be attached to this na&#770;zo&#772;llu&#772;, however we may explain it. Yet <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#001">Isa 64:1</A> (2) does not form a new and independent sentence; but we must in thought repeat the word upon which the principal emphasis rests in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#019">Isa 63:19</A> (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#001">Isa 64:1</A>). "(Wouldst come down) as fire kindles brushwood, fire causes water to boil; to make known Thy name to Thine adversaries, that the heathen may tremble before Thy face! When Thou doest terrible things which we hoped not for; wouldst come down, (and) mountains shake before Thy countenance!" The older expositors gave themselves a great deal of trouble in the attempt to trace ha&#774;ma&#770;s&#305;&#772;m to ma&#770;sas, to melt. But since Louis de Dieu and Albert Schultens have followed Saadia and Abulwlid in citing the Arabic hms, to crack, to mutter, to mumble, etc., and hs&#780;m, to break in pieces, confringere, from which comes hashim, broken, dry wood, it is generally admitted that ha&#774;ma&#770;sim is from hemes (lit. crackling, rattling, Arab. hams), and signifies "dry twigs," arida sarmenta. The second simile might be rendered, "as water bubbles up in the fire;" and in that case mayim would be treated as a feminine (according to the rule in Ges. 146, 3), in support of which <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#019">Job 14:19</A> may be adduced as an unquestionable example (although in other cases it is masculine), and &#1488;&#1513;&#1473; = &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; would be used in a local sense, like leha&#770;bha&#770;h, into flames, in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#024">Isa 5:24</A>. But it is much more natural to take &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, which is just as often a feminine as &#1502;&#1497;&#1501; is a masculine, as the subject of &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1506;&#1492;, and to give to the verb &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492;, which is originally intransitive, judging from the Arabic bga&#770;, to swell, the Chald. &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;, to spring up (compare &#1488;&#1489;&#1506;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514;, blisters, pustules), the Syr. &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1488;, to bubble up, etc., the transitive meaning to cause to boil or bubble up, rather than the intransitive to boil (comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#013">Isa 30:13</A>, &#1504;&#1489;&#1506;&#1492;, swollen = bent forwards, as it were protumidus). Jehovah is to come down with the same irresistible force which fire exerts upon brushwood or water, when it sets the former in flames and makes the latter boil; in order that by such a display of might He may make His name known (viz., the name thus judicially revealing itself, hence "in fire," <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#027">Isa 30:27</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#015">Isa 66:15</A>) to His adversaries, and that nations (viz., those that are idolaters) may tremble before Him (&#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498;: cf., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#002">Psa 68:2-3</A>). The infinitive clause denoting the purpose, like that indicating the comparison, passes into the finite (cf., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#002">Isa 10:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#009">Isa 13:9</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#025">Isa 14:25</A>). Modern commentators for the most part now regard the optative lu&#772;' (O that) as extending to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#002">Isa 64:2</A> also; and, in fact, although this continued influence of lu&#772;' appears to overstep the bounds of the possible, we are forced to resort to this extremity. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#002">Isa 64:2</A> cannot contain a historical retrospect: the word "formerly" would be introduced if it did, and the order of the words would be a different one. Again, we cannot assume that &#1504;&#1494;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498; &#1497;&#1512;&#1491;&#1514;&#1468; contains an expression of confidence, or that the prefects indicate certainty. Neither the context, the foregoing &#1504;&#1493;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514;&#1498; &#1504;&#1493; (why not &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;?), nor the parenthetical assertion &#1504;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; &#1500;&#1488;, permits of this. On the other hand, &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1489;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514;&#1498; connects itself very appropriately with the purposes indicated in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#001">Isa 64:1</A> (2.): "may tremble when Thou doest terrible things, which we, i.e., such as we, do not look for," i.e., which surpass our expectations. And now nothing remains but to recognise the resumption of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#019">Isa 63:19</A> (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#001">Isa 64:1</A>) in the clause "The mountains shake at Thy presence," in which case Isaiah 63:19b-64:2 (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#001">Isa 64:1-3</A>) forms a grand period rounded off palindromically after Isaiah's peculiar style. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#003">Isaiah 64:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">isa 64:3</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The following clause gives the reason for this; &#1493; being very frequently the logical equivalent for k&#305;&#772; (e.g., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#007">Isa 3:7</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#015">Isa 38:15</A>). The justification of this wish, which is forced from them by the existing misery, is found in the incomparable acts of Jehovah for the good of His own people, which are to be seen in a long series of historical events. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#003">Isa 64:3</A> (4.). "For from olden time men have not heard, nor perceived, nor hath an eye seen, a God beside Thee, who acted on behalf of him that waiteth for Him." No ear, no eye has ever been able to perceive the existence of a God who acted like Jehovah, i.e., really interposed on behalf of those who set their hopes upon Him. This is the explanation adopted by Knobel; but he wrongly supplies &#1504;&#1493;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; to &#1497;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, whereas &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; is used here in the same pregnant sense as in Ps. 22:32; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#005">Psa 37:5</A>; 52:11 (cf., ga&#770;mar in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#003">Psa 57:3</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#008">Psa 138:8</A>). It has been objected to this explanation, that &#1492;&#1488;&#1494;&#1497;&#1503; is never connected with the accusative of the person, and that God can neither be heard nor seen. But what is terrible in relation to &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#005">Job 42:5</A> cannot be untenable in relation to &#1492;&#1488;&#1494;&#1497;&#1503;. Hearing and seeing God are here equivalent to recognising His existence through the perception of His works. The explanation favoured by Rosenmller and Stier, viz., "And from olden time men have not heard it, nor perceived with ears, no eye has seen it, O God, beside Thee, what (this God) doth to him that waiteth for Him," is open to still graver objections. The thought is the same as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#020">Psa 31:20</A>, and when so explained it corresponds more exactly to the free quotation in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#009">Co1 2:9</A>, which with our explanation there is no necessity to trace back to either <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#015">Isa 42:15-16</A>, or a lost book, as Origen imagined (see Tischendorf's ed. vii. of the N.T. on this passage). This which no ear has heard, no eye seen, is not God Himself, but He who acts for His people, and justifies their waiting for Him (cf., Hofmann, Die h. Schrift Neuen Testaments, ii. 2, 51). Another proof that Paul had no other passage than this in his mind, is the fact that the same quotation is met with in Clement's Epistle to the Corinthians (ch. 34), where, instead of "those that love Him," we have "those that wait for Him," a literal rendering of &#1500;&#1502;&#1495;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1470;&#1500;&#1493;. The quotation by Paul therefore by no means leads us to take Elohim as a vocative or &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1497;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; as the object, although it must not be concealed that this view of the passage and its reference to the fulness of glory in the eternal life is an old rabbinical one, as Rashi expressly affirms, when he appeals to R. Jose (Joseph Kara) as bondsman for the other (see b. Sanhedrin 99a). Hahn has justly objected to this traditional explanation, which regards Elohim as a vocative, that the thought, that God alone has heard and perceived and seen with His eye what He intends to do to His people, is unsuitable in itself, and at variance with the context, and that if &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1497;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; was intended as the object, &#1488;&#1513;&#1512; (&#1488;&#1514;) would certainly be inserted. And to this we may add, that we cannot find the words Elohim zu&#772;la&#770;thekha&#770; (God beside Thee) preceded by a negation anywhere in chapters 40-66 without receiving at once the impression, that they affirm the sole deity of Jehovah (comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#005">Isa 45:5</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#021">Isa 45:21</A>). The meaning therefore is, "No other God beside Jehovah has ever been heard or seen, who acted for (ageret pro) those who waited for Him." Mechakke&#772;h is the construct, according to Ges. 116, 1; and ya&#8219;a&#774;se&#772;h has tsere here, according to Kimchi (Michlol 125b) and other testimonies, just as we meet with &#1514;&#1506;&#1505;&#1492; four times (in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#029">Gen 26:29</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#009">Jos 7:9</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#012">Sa2 13:12</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#016">Jer 40:16</A>) and &#1493;&#1504;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; once (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#024">Jos 9:24</A>), mostly with a disjunctive accent, and not without the influence of a whole or half pause, the form with tsere being regarded as more emphatic than that with seghol.
<p>(Note: In addition to the examples given above, we have the following forms of the same kind in kal: &#1497;&#1502;&#1468;&#1510;&#1492; (with tiphchah) in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#017">Jer 17:17</A>; &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; (with tsakpeh) in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#013">Dan 1:13</A>, compare &#1514;&#1468;&#1490;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; (with athnach) in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#007">Lev 18:7-8</A>, and &#1514;&#1490;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; (with the smaller disjunctive tiphchah) in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#009">Lev 18:9-11</A>; &#1497;&#1504;&#1511;&#1468;&#1492; (with athnach) in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#003">Nah 1:3</A>; &#1488;&#1494;&#1512;&#1492; (with tsakeph) in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#012">Eze 5:12</A>. This influence of the accentuation has escaped the notice of the more modern grammarians (e.g., Ges. 75, Anm. 17).)

<p>After the long period governed by &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; has thus been followed by the retrospect in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#003">Isa 64:3</A> (4.), it is absolutely impossible that <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#004">Isa 64:4</A> (5a) should be intended as an optative, in the sense of "O that thou wouldst receive him that," etc., as Stier and others propose. The retrospect is still continued thus: "Thou didst meet him that rejoiceth to work righteousness, when they remembered Thee in Thy ways." &#1510;&#1491;&#1511; &#1493;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1513;&#1474;&#1513;&#1474; is one in whom joy and right action are paired, and is therefore equivalent to &#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514; &#1513;&#1474;&#1513;&#1474;. At the same time, it may possibly be more correct to take &#1510;&#1491;&#1511; as the object of both verses, as Hofmann does in the sense of "those who let what is right be their joy, and their action also;" for though &#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474; (&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1513;&#1474;) cannot be directly construed with the accusative of the object, as we have already observed at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#006">Isa 8:6</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#001">Isa 35:1</A>, it may be indirectly, as in this passage and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#018">Isa 65:18</A>. On pa&#770;ga&#8219;, "to come to meet," in the sense of "coming to the help of," see at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#003">Isa 47:3</A>; it is here significantly interchanged with &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497;&#1498; of the minor clause bidra&#770;khekha&#770; yizkeru&#772;kha&#770;, "those who remember Thee in Thy ways" (for the syntax, compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#005">Isa 1:5</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#016">Isa 26:16</A>): "When such as love and do right, walking in Thy ways, remembered Thee (i.e., thanked Thee for grace received, and longed for fresh grace), Thou camest again and again to meet them as a friend." 
<p>But Israel appeared to have been given up without hope to the wrath of this very God. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#004">Isa 64:4</A> (5b). "Behold, Thou, Thou art enraged, and we stood as sinners there; already have we been long in this state, and shall we be saved?" Instead of he&#772;n &#8219;atta&#770;h (the antithesis of now and formerly), the passage proceeds with he&#772;n 'atta&#770;h. There was no necessity for 'atta&#770;h with qa&#770;tsaphta&#770;; so that it is used with special emphasis: "Behold, Thou, a God who so faithfully accepts His own people, hast broken out in wrath." The following word &#1493;&#1504;&#1468;&#1495;&#1496;&#1488; cannot mean "and we have sinned," but is a fut. consec., and therefore must mean at least, "then we have sinned" (the sin inferred from the punishment). It is more correct, however, to take it, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#009">Gen 43:9</A>, in the sense of, "Then we stand as sinners, as guilty persons:" the punishment has exhibited Israel before the world, and before itself, as what it really is (consequently the fut. consec. does not express the logical inference, but the practical consequence). As &#1493;&#1504;&#1495;&#1496;&#1488; has tsakeph, and therefore the accents at any rate preclude Shelling's rendering, "and we have wandered in those ways from the very earliest times," we must take the next two clauses as independent, if indeed &#1489;&#1492;&#1501; is to be understood as referring to &#1489;&#1491;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497;&#1498;. Stier only goes halfway towards this when he renders it, "And indeed in them (the ways of God, we sinned) from of old, and should we be helped?" This is forced, and yet not in accordance with the accents. Rosenmller and Hahn quite satisfy this demand when they render it, "Tamen in viis tuis aeternitas ut salvemur;" but &#8219;o&#772;la&#770;m, &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd;, in this sense of &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;, is not scriptural. The rendering adopted by Besser, Grotius, and Starck is a better one: "(Si vero) in illis (viis tuis) perpetuo (mansissemus), tunc servati fuerimus" (if we had continued in Thy ways, then we should have been preserved). But there is no succession of tenses here, which could warrant us in taking &#1493;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; as a paulo-post future; and Hofmann's view is syntactically more correct, "In them (i.e., the ways of Jehovah) eternally, we shall find salvation, after the time is passed in which He has been angry and we have sinned" (or rather, been shown to be guilty). But we question the connection between &#1489;&#1492;&#1501; and &#1512;&#1491;&#1499;&#1497;&#1498; in any form. In our view the prayer suddenly takes a new turn from he&#772;n (behold) onwards, just as it did with lu&#772;' (O that) in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#001">Isa 64:1</A>; and &#1512;&#1491;&#1499;&#1497;&#1498; in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#005">Isa 64:5</A> stands at the head of a subordinate clause. Hence &#1489;&#1492;&#1501; must refer back to &#1493;&#1504;&#1495;&#1496;&#1488; &#1511;&#1510;&#1508;&#1514; ("in Thine anger and in our sins," Schegg). There is no necessity, however, to search for nouns to which to refer &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1501;. It is rather to be taken as neuter, signifying "therein" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#018">Eze 33:18</A>, cf., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#010">Psa 90:10</A>), like &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, thereupon = thereby (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#016">Isa 38:16</A>), &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1503; therein (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#016">Isa 37:16</A>), &#1502;&#1492;&#1501; thereout (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#006">Isa 30:6</A>), therefrom (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#015">Isa 44:15</A>). The idea suggested by such expressions as these is no doubt that of plurality (here a plurality of manifestations of wrath and of sins), but one which vanishes into the neuter idea of totality. Now we do justice both to the clause without a verb, which, being a logical copula, admits simply of a present sumus; and also to &#8219;o&#772;la&#770;m, which is the accusative of duration, when we explain the sentence as meaning, "In this state we are and have been for a long time." &#8219;Ola&#770;m is used in other instances in these prophecies to denote the long continuance of the sate of punishment (see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#014">Isa 42:14</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#011">Isa 57:11</A>), since it appeared to the exiles as an eternity (a whole aeon), and what lay beyond it as but a little while (mits&#8219;a&#770;r, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#018">Isa 63:18</A>). The following word &#1493;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; needs no correction. There is no necessity to change it into &#1493;&#1504;&#1468;&#1514;&#1506;, as Ewald proposes, after the lxx &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; ("and we fell into wandering"), or what would correspond still more closely to the lxx (cf., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#008">Isa 46:8</A>, &#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;, lxx &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;), but is less appropriate here, into &#1493;&#1504;&#1468;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; ("and we fell into apostasy"), the reading supported by Lowth and others. If it were necessary to alter the text at all, we might simply transpose the letters, and read &#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;, "and cried for help." But if we take it as a question, "And shall we experience salvation - find help?" there is nothing grammatically inadmissible in this (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#028">Isa 28:28</A>), and psychologically it is commended by the state of mind depicted in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#027">Isa 40:27</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#010">Isa 59:10-12</A>. Moreover, what follows attaches itself quite naturally to this. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#005">Isaiah 64:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">isa 64:5</A></FONT></span></p>(6)
<p>The people who ask the question in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#005">Isa 64:5</A> do not regard themselves as worthy of redemption, as their self-righteousness has been so thoroughly put to shame. "We all became like the unclean thing, and all our virtues like a garment soiled with blood; and we all faded away together like the leaves; and our iniquities, like the storm they carried us away." The whole nation is like one whom the law pronounces unclean, like a leper, who has to cry "ta&#770;me&#772;, ta&#770;me&#772; "as he goes along, that men may get out of his way (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#045">Lev 13:45</A>). Doing right in all its manifold forms (tseda&#770;qo&#772;th, like <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#015">Isa 33:15</A>, used elsewhere of the manifestations of divine righteousness), which once made Israel well-pleasing to God (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#021">Isa 1:21</A>), has disappeared and become like a garment stained with menstruous discharge (cf., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#017">Eze 36:17</A>); (lxx &#x3c9;&#788;&#x3c2; &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; = da&#770;va&#770;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#022">Isa 30:22</A>; nidda&#770;h, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#017">Lam 1:17</A>; teme&#772;'a&#770;h, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#033">Lev 15:33</A>). &#8219;Idd&#305;&#772;m (used thus in the plural in the Talmud also) signifies the monthly period (menstrua). In the third figure, that of fading falling foliage, the form vanna&#770;bhel is not kal (= vannibbo&#772;l or vannibbal; Ewald, 232, b), which would be an impossibility according to the laws of inflexion; still less is it niphal = vanninna&#770;bhel (which Kimchi suggests as an alternative); but certainly a hiphil. It is not, however, from na&#770;bhe&#772;l = vannabbel, "with the reduplication dropped to express the idea of something gradual," as Bttcher proposes (a new and arbitrary explanation in the place of one founded upon the simple laws of inflexion), but either from ba&#770;lal (compare the remarks on bel&#305;&#772;l in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#024">Isa 30:24</A>, which hardly signifies "ripe barley" however), after the form &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1490;&#1500; (from &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500;) &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1505;&#1498; (from &#1505;&#1499;&#1498;), or from bu&#772;l, after the form &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1511;&#1501;, etc. In any case, therefore, it is a metaplastic formation, whether from ba&#770;lal or bu&#772;l = na&#770;bhe&#772;l, like &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512; (in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1020.htm#003">Ch1 20:3</A>, after the form &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1505;&#1512;, from &#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1493;&#1512; = &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;, or after the form &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;, from &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1512; = &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512; (compare the rabbinical explanation of the name of the month Bul from the falling of the leaves, in Buxtorf, Lex. talm. col. 271). The hiphil &#1492;&#1489;&#1500; or &#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1500; is to be compared to &#1492;&#1488;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, to stream out red (= to be red); &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1498;, to make an extension (= to be long); &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, to strike root (= to root), etc., and signifies literally to produce a fading (= to fade away). In the fourth figure, &#1506;&#1493;&#1504;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; (as it is also written in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#006">Isa 64:6</A> according to correct codices) is a defective plural (as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#007">Jer 14:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#018">Eze 28:18</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#013">Dan 9:13</A>) for the more usual &#1506;&#1493;&#1504;&#1514;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#012">Isa 59:12</A>). &#1506;&#1493;&#1503; is the usual term applied to sin regarded as guilt, which produces punishment of itself. The people were robbed by their sins of all vital strength and energy, like dry leaves, which the guilt and punishment springing from sin carried off as a very easy prey.

<p>Universal forgetfulness of God was the consequence of this self-instigated departure from God. "And there was no one who called upon Thy name, who aroused himself to lay firm hold of Thee: for Thou hadst hidden Thy face from us, and didst melt us into the hand of our transgressions." There was no one (see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#016">Isa 59:16</A>) who had risen up in prayer and intercession out of this deep fall, or had shaken himself out of the sleep of security and lethargy of insensibility, to lay firm hold of Jehovah, i.e., not to let Him go till He blessed him and his people again. The curse of God pressed every one down; God had withdrawn His grace from them, and given them up to the consequences of their sins. The form &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1490;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; is not softened from the pilel &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1490;&#1490;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, but is a kal like &#1493;&#1497;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; ekil  in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#015">Job 31:15</A> (which see), &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1490; being used in a transitive sense, as ku&#772;n is there (cf., shu&#772;bh, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#008">Isa 52:8</A>; mu&#772;sh, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#009">Zac 3:9</A>). The lxx, Targ., and Syr. render it et tradidisti nos; but we cannot conclude from this with any certainty that they read &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1490;&#1468;&#1504;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, which Knobel follows Ewald in correcting into the incorrect form &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1490;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;. The prophet himself had the expression migge&#772;n beyad (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#020">Gen 14:20</A>, cf., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#004">Job 8:4</A>) in his mind, in the sense of liquefecisti nos in manum, equivalent to liquefecisti et tradidisti (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#028">Rom 1:28</A>), from which it is evident that &#1489;&#1497;&#1491; is not a mere &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769; (lxx), but the "hand" of the transgressions is their destructive and damning power.

<p>This was the case when the measure of Israel's sins had become full. They were carried into exile, where they sank deeper and deeper. The great mass of the people proved themselves to be really massa perdita, and perished among the heathen. But there were some, though a vanishingly small number, who humbled themselves under the mighty hand of God, and, when redemption could not be far off, wrestled in such prayers as these, that the nation might share it in its entirety, and if possible not one be left behind. With &#1493;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; the existing state of sin and punishment is placed among the things of the past, and the petition presented that the present moment of prayer may have all the significance of a turning-point in their history. "And now, O Jehovah, Thou art our Father: we are the clay, and Thou our Maker; and we are all the work of Thy hand. Be not extremely angry, O Jehovah, and remember not the transgression for ever! Behold, consider, we beseech Thee, we are all Thy people." The state of things must change at last; for Israel is an image made by Jehovah; yea, more than this, Jehovah is the begetter of Israel, and loves Israel not merely as a sculptor, but as a father (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#009">Isa 45:9-10</A>, and the unquestionable passage of Isaiah in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#016">Isa 29:16</A>). Let Him then not be angry &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1502;&#1488;&#1491;, "to the utmost measure" (cf., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#008">Psa 119:8</A>), or if we paraphrase it according to the radical meaning of &#1502;&#1491;, "till the weight becomes intolerable." Let Him not keep in mind the guilt for ever, to punish it; but, in consideration of the fact that Israel is the nation of His choice, let mercy take the place of justice. &#1492;&#1503; strengthens the petition in its own way (see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#034">Gen 30:34</A>), just as &#1504;&#1488; does; and &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1496; signifies here, as elsewhere, to fix the eye upon anything. The object, in this instance, is the existing fact expressed in "we are all Thy people." Hitzig is correct in regarding the repetition of "all of us" in this prayer as significant. The object throughout is to entreat that the whole nation may participate in the inheritance of the coming salvation, in order that the exodus from Babylonia may resemble the exodus from Egypt.

<p>The re-erection of the ruins of the promised land requires the zeal of every one, and this state of ruin must not continue. It calls out the love and faithfulness of Jehovah. "The cities of Thy holiness have become a pasture-ground; Zion has become a pasture-ground, Jerusalem a desert. The house of our holiness and of our adorning, where our fathers praised Thee, is given up to the fire, and everything that was our delight given up to devastation. Wilt Thou restrain Thyself in spite of this, O Jehovah, be silent, and leave us to suffer the utmost?" Jerusalem by itself could not possibly be called "cities" (&#8219;a&#770;re&#772;), say with reference to the upper and lower cities (Vitringa). It is merely mentioned by name as the most prominent of the many cities which were all "holy cities," inasmuch as the whole of Canaan was the land of Jehovah (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#025">Isa 14:25</A>), and His holy territory (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#054">Psa 78:54</A>). The word midba&#770;r (pasture-land, heath, different from tsiyya&#770;h, the pastureless desert, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#001">Isa 35:1</A>) is repeated, for the purpose of showing that the same fate had fallen upon Zion-Jerusalem as upon the rest of the cities of the land. The climax of the terrible calamity was the fact, that the temple had also fallen a prey to the burning of the fire (compare for the fact, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#013">Jer 52:13</A>). The people call it "house of our holiness and of our glory." Jehovah's qo&#772;desh and tiph'ereth have, as it were, transplanted heaven to earth in the temple (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#015">Isa 63:15</A> with <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#007">Isa 60:7</A>); and this earthly dwelling-place of God is Israel's possession, and therefore Israel's qo&#772;desh and tiph'ereth. The relative clause describes what sublime historical reminiscences are attached to the temple: &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is equivalent to &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#020">Gen 39:20</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#013">Num 20:13</A> (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#004">Psa 84:4</A>), <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#015">Deu 8:15</A>, etc. &#1492;&#1500;&#1500;&#1468;&#1498; has chateph-pathach, into which, as a rule, the vocal sheva under the first of two similar letters is changed. Macha&#774;madde&#772;nu&#772; (our delights) may possibly include favourite places, ornamental buildings, and pleasure grounds; but the parallel leads us rather to think primarily of things associated with the worship of God, in which the people found a holy delight. &#1499;&#1500;, contrary to the usual custom, is here followed by the singular of the predicate, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#002">Pro 16:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#015">Eze 31:15</A> (cf., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#029">Gen 9:29</A>). Will Jehovah still put restraint upon Himself, and cause His merciful love to keep silence, &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1494;&#1488;&#1514;, with such a state of things as this, or notwithstanding this state of things (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#007">Job 10:7</A>)? On &#1492;&#1514;&#1488;&#1508;&#1468;&#1511;, see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#015">Isa 63:15</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#014">Isa 42:14</A>. The suffering would indeed increase &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1502;&#1488;&#1491; (to the utmost), if it caused the destruction of Israel, or should not be followed at last by Israel's restoration. Jehovah's compassion cannot any longer thus forcibly restrain itself; it must break forth, like Joseph's tears in the recognition scene (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#001">Gen 45:1</A>).
