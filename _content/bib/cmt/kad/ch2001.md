III\. History of Solomon's Kingship - 2 Chronicles 1-9

The kingship of Solomon centres in the building of the temple of the
Lord, and the account of that begins in 2 Chron 2 with a statement of
the preparations which Solomon made for the accomplishment of this great
work, so much pressed upon him by his father, and concludes in 2 Chron 7
with the answer which the Lord gave to his consecrating prayer in a
vision. In 2 Chron 1, before the history of the temple building, we have
an account of the sacrifice at Gibeon by which Solomon inaugurated his
reign ([Ch2 1:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001)), with some short
notices of his power and riches ([Ch2
1:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#014)); and in 2 Chron 8 and 9,
after the temple building, we have summary statements about the palaces
and cities which he built ([Ch2
8:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#001)), the arrangement of the
regular religious service ([Ch2
8:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#012)), the voyage to Ophir ([Ch2
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#017), [Ch2
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#018)), the visit of the queen of Sheba
([Ch2 9:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#001)), his riches and his
royal magnificence and glory (2 Chron 9:13-28), with the concluding
notices of the duration of his reign, and of his death ([Ch2
9:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#029), [Ch2
9:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#030)). If we compare with this the
description of Solomon's reign in 1 Kings 1-11, we find that in the
Chronicle not only are the narratives of his accession to the throne in
consequence of Adonijah's attempted usurpation, and his confirming his
kingdom by punishing the revolter (1 Kings 1 and 2), of his marriage to
the Egyptian princess ([Kg1 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#001), [Kg1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#002)), his wise judgment ([Kg1
3:16-28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#016)), his public officers, his
official men, his royal magnificence and glory (1 Kings 4:1-5:14),
omitted, but also the accounts of the building of his palace ([Kg1
7:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#001)), of his idolatry, and of the
adversaries who rose against him (1 Kings 11:1-40). On the other hand,
the description of the building and consecration of the temple is
supplemented by various important details which are omitted from the
first book of Kings. Hence it is clear that the author of the Chronicle
purposed only to portray more exactly the building of the house of God,
and has only shortly touched upon all the other undertakings of this
wise and fortunate king.

[2 Chronicles 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 1:1</span></span>

[Ch2 1:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001)

The sacrifice at Gibeon, and the theophany. - [Ch2
1:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001). When Solomon had established
himself upon his throne, he went with the princes and representatives of
the congregation of Israel to Gibeon, to seek for the divine blessing
upon his reign by a solemn sacrifice to be offered there before the
tabernacle. [Ch2 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001) forms, as it
were, the superscription of the account of Solomon's reign which
follows. In וגו ויּתחזּק = Solomon established himself in his kingdom,
i.e., he became strong and mighty in his kingdom, the older commentators
saw a reference to the defeat of Adonijah, the pretender to the crown,
and his followers (1 Kings 2). But this view of the words is too narrow;
we find the same remark made of other kings whose succession to the
throne had not been questioned (cf. [Ch2
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#013); [Ch2
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#021); [Ch2
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#001), and [Ch2
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#004)), and the remark refers to the
whole reign-to all that Solomon undertook in order to establish a firm
dominion, not merely to his entry upon it. With this view of the words,
the second clause, "his God was with him, and made him very great,"
coincides. God gave His blessing to all that Solomon did for this end.
With the last words cf. [Ch1 29:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#025).

We have an account of the sacrifice at Gibeon ([Ch2
1:7-13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#007)) in [Kg1
3:4-15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#004) also. The two narratives agree
in all the main points, but, in so far as their form is concerned, it is
at once discernible that they are two independent descriptions of the
same thing, but derived from the same sources. In 1 Kings 3 the
theophany-in our text, on the contrary, that aspect of the sacrifice
which connected it with the public worship-is more circumstantially
narrated. While in [Kg1 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#004) it is
briefly said the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there, our historian
records that Solomon summoned the princes and representatives of the
people to this solemn act, and accompanied by them went to Gibeon. This
sacrifice was no mere private sacrifice-it was the religious
consecration of the opening of his reign, at which the estates of the
kingdom were present as a matter of course. "All Israel" is defined by
"the princes over the thousands ..., the judges, and all the
honourable;" then לכל־שׂראל is again taken up and explained by the
apposition האבות ראשׁי: to all Israel, viz., the heads of the
fathers'-houses. ל is to be repeated before ראשׁי. What Solomon said to
all Israel through its representatives, is not communicated; but it may
be gathered from what succeeds, that he summoned them to accompany him
to Gibeon to offer the sacrifice. The reason why he offered his
sacrifice at the בּמה, i.e., place of sacrifice, is given in [Ch2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#003). There the Mosaic tabernacle
stood, yet without the ark, which David had caused to be brought up from
Kirjath-jearim to Jerusalem ([Ch1
13:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#001) and 15). In לו בּהכין the
article in ba represents the relative אשׁר = בּאשׁר or לו הכין אשׁר
בּמקום; cf. [Jdg 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#027); [Rut
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#016); [Kg1
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#019); see on [Ch1
26:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#028). Although the ark was separated
from the tabernacle, yet by the latter at Gibeon was the Mosaic altar of
burnt-offering, and on that account the sanctuary at Gibeon was Jahve's
dwelling, and the legal place of worship for burnt-offerings of
national-theocratic import. "As our historian here brings forward
emphatically the fact that Solomon offered his burnt-offering at the
legal place of worship, so he points out in [Ch1
21:28-30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#028) :1, how David was only
brought by extraordinary events, and special signs from God, to
sacrifice on the altar of burnt-offering erected by him on the
threshing-floor of Ornan, and also states how he was prevented from
offering his burnt-offering in Gibeon" (Berth.). As to Bezaleel, the
maker of the brazen altar, cf. [Exo
31:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#002) and [Exo
37:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo037.htm#001). Instead of שׂם, which most
manuscripts and many editions have before לפני, and which the Targ. and
Syr. also express, there is found in most editions of the 16th century,
and also in manuscripts, שׁם, which the lxx and Vulgate also read. The
reading שׁם is unquestionably better and more correct, and the Masoretic
pointing שׂם, posuit, has arisen by an undue assimilation of it to [Exo
40:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#029). The suffix in ידרשׁהוּ does not
refer to the altar, but to the preceding word יהוה; cf. אלהים דּרשׁ,
[Ch1 21:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#030); [Ch1
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#013), etc.

[Ch2 1:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#007)

The theophany, cf. [Kg1 3:5-15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#005). In
that night, i.e., on the night succeeding the day of the sacrifice. The
appearance of God by night points to a dream, and in [Kg1
3:5-15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#005) we are expressly informed that
He appeared in a vision. Solomon's address to God, [Ch2
1:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#008), is in [Kg1
3:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#006) given more at length. The mode
of expression brings to mind [Ch1
17:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#023), and recurs in [Ch2
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#017); [Kg1
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#026). מדּע, with Pathach in the second
syllable, elsewhere מדּע ([Ch2 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#011),
[Ch2 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#012)), occurs elsewhere only in
[Dan 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#004), [Dan
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#017); [Ecc
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#020).

[Ch2 1:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#011)

The divine promise. Here עשׁר is strengthened by the addition נכסים,
treasures ([Jos 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#008); [Ecc
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#018); [Ecc
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#002)). תּשׁפּט אשׁר, ut judicare
possis. In general, the mode of expression is briefer than in [Kg1
3:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#011), and the conditional promise,
"long life" ([Kg1 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#014)), is omitted,
because Solomon did not fulfil the condition, and the promise was not
fulfilled. In [Ch2 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#013) לבּמה is
unintelligible, and has probably come into our text only by a backward
glance at [Ch2 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#003), instead of מהבּמה,
which the contents demand, and as the lxx and Vulgate have rightly
translated it. The addition, "from before the tabernacle," which seems
superfluous after the preceding "from the Bamah at Gibeon," is inserted
in order again to point to the place of sacrifice at Gibeon, and to the
legal validity of the sacrifices offered there (Berth.). According to
[Kg1 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#015), Solomon, on his return to
Jerusalem, offered before the ark still other burnt-offerings and
thank-offerings, and prepared a meal for his servants. This is omitted
by the author of the Chronicle, because these sacrifices had no ultimate
import for Solomon's reign, and not, as Then, supposes, because in his
view only the sacrifices offered on the ancient brazen altar of
burnt-offering belonging to the temple had legal validity. For he
narrates at length in [Ch1 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#018), [Ch1
21:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#026). how God Himself directed David
to sacrifice in Jerusalem, and how the sacrifice offered there was
graciously accepted by fire from heaven, and the threshing-floor of
Araunah thereby consecrated as a place of sacrifice; and it is only with
the purpose of explaining to his readers why Solomon offered the solemn
burnt-offering in Gibeon, and not, as we should have expected from 1
Chron 21, in Jerusalem, that he is so circumstantial in his statements
as to the tabernacle. The last clause of [Ch2
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#013), "and he was king over Israel,"
does not belong to the section treating of the sacrifice at Gibeon, but
corresponds to the remark in [Kg1 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#001),
and forms the transition to what follows.

[2 Chronicles 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 1:14</span></span>

Solomon's chariots, horses, and riches. - In order to prove by facts the
fulfilment of the divine promise which Solomon received in answer to his
prayer at Gibeon, we have in [Kg1
3:16-28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#016) a narrative of Solomon's wise
judgment, then in 2 Chron 4 an account of his public officers; and in
[Ch2 5:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#001) the royal magnificence,
glory, and wisdom of his reign is further portrayed. In our Chronicle,
on the contrary, we have in [Ch2
1:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#014) only a short statement as to
his chariots and horses, and the wealth in silver and gold to be found
in the land, merely for the purpose of showing how God had given him
riches and possessions. This statement recurs verbally in [Kg1
10:26-29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#026), in the concluding remarks on
the riches and splendour of Solomon's reign; while in the parallel
passage, 2 Chron 9:13-28, it is repeated in an abridged form, and
interwoven with other statements. From this we see in how free and
peculiar a manner the author of the Chronicle has made use of his
authorities, and how he has arranged the material derived from them
according to his own special plan.

(Note: The assertion of Thenius on [Kg1
10:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#026)., that he found this section in
his authorities in two different places and in different connections,
copied them mechanically, and only towards the end of the second passage
remarked the repetition and then abridged the statement, is at once
refuted by observing, that in the supposed repetition the first half
([Ch2 9:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#025)) does not at all agree
with [Kg1 10:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#026), but coincides with
the statement in [Kg1 5:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#006).)

For the commentary on this section, see on [Kg1
10:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#026).

[Ch2 1:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#014)

[Ch2 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#014), [Ch2
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#015), with the exception of one
divergence in form and one in matter, correspond word for word to [Kg1
10:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#026) and [Kg1
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#027). Instead of ויּנחם, he led them
(Kings), there stands in [Ch2 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#015), as
in [Ch2 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#025), the more expressive word
ויּנּיהם, "he laid them" in the chariot cities; and in [Ch2
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#015) ואת־הזּהב is added to את־הכּסף,
while it is omitted from both [Kg1
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#027) and also [Ch2
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#027). It is, however, very suitable in
this connection, since the comparison "like stones" has reference to
quantity, and Solomon had collected not only silver, but also gold, in
quantity.

[Ch2 1:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#016)

[Ch2 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#016), [Ch2
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#017) coincide with [Kg1
10:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#028), except that מקרא is used for
hw'q;mi, and ותּצא ותּעלה is altered into ויּוציאוּ ויּעלוּ. For the
commentary on these verses, see [Kg1
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#028).
