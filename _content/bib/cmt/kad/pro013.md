### [Proverbs Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#001)

[Proverbs 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 13:1</span></span>

The proverb [Pro 12:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#028) is so sublime,
so weighty, that it manifestly forms a period and conclusion. This is
confirmed from the following proverb, which begins like [Pro
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#001) (cf. 5), and anew stamps the
collection as intended for youth:

1 A wise son is his father's correction;

But a scorner listens not to rebuke.

The lxx, which the Syr. follows, translate Ψἱὸς πανουργὸς ὑπήκοος πατρί,
whence it is not to be concluded with Lagarde that they read נוסר in the
sense of a Ni. tolerativum; they correctly understood the text according
to the Jewish rule of interpretation, "that which is wanting is to be
supplied from the context." The Targ. had already supplied שׁמע from 1b,
and is herein followed by Hitzig, as also by Glassius in the Philologia
sacra. But such an ellipse is in the Hebr. style without an example, and
would be comprehensible only in passionate, hasty discourse, but in a
language in which the representation filius sapiens disciplinam patris
audit numbers among the anomalies is not in general possible, and has
not even its parallel in Tacitus, Ann. xiii. 56: deesse nobis terra, in
qua vivamus - in qua moriemur, non potest, because here the primary
idea, which the one expression confirms, the other denies, and besides
no particle, such as the ו of this passage before us, stands between
them. Bttcher therefore maintains the falling out of the verb, and
writes יבּין before בּן; but one says not בין מוסר, but שׁמע מוסר, [Pro
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#008); [Pro
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#001); [Pro
19:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#027). Should not the clause, as it
thus stands, give a sense complete in itself? But מוּסר can hardly, with
Schultens and Ewald, be taken as part. Hoph. of יסר: one brought up by
his father, for the usage of the language knows מוסר only as part. Hoph.
of סוּר. Thus, as Jerome and the Venet. translate: a wise son is the
correction of his father, i.e., the product of the same, as also
Fleischer explains, "Attribution of the cause, the ground, as elsewhere
of the effect." But we call that which one has trained (vegetable or
animal) his Zucht (= παιδεία in the sense of παίδευμα). To the wise son
([Pro 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#001)) who is indebted to the
מוסר אב ([Pro 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#001)), stands opposed the
לץ (vid., [Pro 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#022)), the mocker at
religion and virtue, who has no ear for גּערה, strong and stern words
which awaken in him a wholesome fear (cf. [Pro
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#010), [Jde
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#023) : ἐν φόβῳ).

[Proverbs 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 13:2</span></span>

2 From the fruit of the mouth of a man he himself enjoys good;

But the delight of the godless is violence.

2a = [Pro 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#014), where ישׂבּע for
יאכל. A man with a fruit-bringing mouth, himself enjoys also the
blessing of his fruit-producing speech; his food (cf. βρῶμα, [Joh
4:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#034)) is the good action in words,
which in themselves are deeds, and are followed by deeds; this good
action affords enjoyment not merely to others, but also to himself.
Ewald and Bertheau attract יאכל to 2b; so also does Fleischer: "the
violence which the בּגדים wish to do to others turns back upon
themselves; they must eat it also, i.e., bear its evil consequences."
The thought would then be like [Pro
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#006) : os improborum obteget
violentia, and "to eat violence" is parallel to "to drink ([Pro
26:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#006)) violence (injury)." But
wherefore then the naming of the soul, of which elsewhere it is said
that it hungers or satiates itself, but never simply (but cf. [Luk
12:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#019)) that it eats? On the contrary,
נפשׁ means also appetitus, [Pro 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#002),
and particularly wicked desire, [Psa
27:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#012); here, as [Psa
35:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#025), the object of this desire
(Psychol. p. 202). Regarding בגדים, vid., above, p. 85. There are such
as do injury in a cunning deceitful manner to their neighbour to their
own advantage. While the former (the righteous) distributes to his
neighbour from the inner impulse without having such a result in view,
yet according to God's direction he derives enjoyment himself therefrom:
the desire of the latter goes to חמס, ἀδικία, and thus to the enjoyment
of good unrighteously and violently seized.

[Proverbs 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 13:3</span></span>

3 He that guardeth his mouth keepeth his soul;

He that openeth his lips, to him it is destruction.

3a is extended in [Pro 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#023) to a
distich. Mouth and soul stand in closest interchangeable relation, for
speech is the most immediate and continuous expression of the soul; thus
whoever guards his mouth keeps his soul (the Venet., with excellent
rendering of the synonym, ὁ τηρῶν τὸ στόμα ἑαυτοῦ φυλάσσει τὴν ψυχὴν
ἑαυτοῦ), for he watches that no sinful vain thoughts rise up in his soul
and come forth in words, and because he thus keeps his soul, i.e.,
himself, safe from the destructive consequences of the sins of the
tongue. On the contrary, he who opens wide his lips, i.e., cannot hold
his mouth (lxx ὁ δὲ προπετὴς χείλεσιν), but expresses unexamined and
unconsidered whatever comes into his mind and gives delight, he is
destruction to himself (supply הוּא), or to him it is destruction
(supply זאת); both interpretations are possible, the parallelism brings
nearer the former, and the parallel [Pro
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#007) brings nearer the latter. פּשׂק
means to spread (Schultens diducere cum ruptura vel ad rupturam usque),
here the lips, Pih. [Eze 16:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#025), the
legs, Arab. fashkh, farshkh; vid., regarding the R. פש, to extend, to
spread out, Fleischer in the supplements to the A. L. Z. 1843, col. 116.
Regarding the Mishle word מחתּה, vid., under [Pro
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#014).

[Proverbs 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 13:4</span></span>

The three proverbs ([Pro 13:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#001)) which
refer to hearing and speaking are now following by a fourth which, like
[Pro 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#002) and [Pro
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#003), speaks of the נפשׁ.

The soul of the sluggard desires, yet has not;

But the soul of the industrious is richly satisfied.

The view that the o in נפשׁו עצל is the cholem compaginis, Bttcher, 835,
meets with the right answer that this would be the only example of a
vocal casus in the whole of gnomic poetry; but when on his own part
(Neue Aehrenlese, 1305) he regards נפשׁו as the accus. of the nearer
definition (= בּנפשׁו), he proceeds inadvertently on the view that the
first word of the proverb is מתאוּה, while we read מתאוּה, and נפשׁו is
thus the nom. of the subject. נפשׁו עצל means "his (the sluggard's)
soul" (for עצל occurs as explanatory permutative briefly for נפשׁ עצל),
as סעיפיה פּריּה means "its branches (i.e., of the fruitful tree)," [Isa
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#006). One might, it is true, add ה to
the following word here, as at [Pro
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#013); but the similar expression
appertaining to the syntax ornata occurs also [Sa2
22:33](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#033); [Psa
71:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#007), and elsewhere, where this is
impracticable. Meri appropriately compares the scheme [Exo
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#006), she saw him, viz., the boy. With
reference to the ואין here violently (cf. [Pro
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#001)) introduced, Bttcher rightly
remarks, that it is an adverb altogether like necquidquam, [Pro
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#006); [Pro
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#004), [Psa
68:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#021), etc., thus: appetit necquidquam
anima ejus, scilicet pigri. 4b shows the meaning of the desire that has
not, for there תדשּׁן occurs, a favourite strong Mishle word ([Pro
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#025); [Pro
28:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#025), etc.) for abundant satisfaction
(the lxx here, as at 28:25, ἐν ἐπιμελείᾳ, sc. ἔσονται, instead of which,
Montfaucon supposed πιμελείᾳ, which is, however, a word not
authenticated). The slothful wishes and dreams of prosperity and
abundance (cf. [Pro 21:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#025)., a parallel
which the Syr. has here in view), but his desire remains unsatisfied,
since the object is not gained but only lost by doing nothing; the
industrious gain, and that richly, what the slothful wishes for, but in
vain.

[Proverbs 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 13:5</span></span>

Two proverbs of the character of the righteous and of the effect of
righteousness:

A deceitful thing the righteous hateth;

But the godless disgraceth and putteth to shame.

With דּבּר in the sphere of an intelligible generality (as here of
falsehood, or [Psa 41:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#009) of
worthlessness) a concrete event is in view, as with דּברי in the
following plur. a general fact is separated into its individual
instances and circumstances (vid., at [Psa
65:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#004)); for דבר means not only the word
in which the soul reveals itself, but also any fact in which an inner
principle or a general fact or a whole comes forth to view. The
righteous hateth all that bears in it the character of a falsehood
(punctuate דּבר־שׁקר with Gaja, cf. [Pro
12:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#019)), but the godless ... Should we
now, with Bertheau, Hitzig, and others, translate "acteth basely and
shamefully"? It is true that both Hiphs. may be regarded as transitive,
but this expression gives not right contrast to 5a, and is pointless. We
have seen at [Pro 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#005) that הבישׁ,
like השׂכּיל, has also a causative signification: to put to shame, i.e.,
bring shame upon others, and that [Pro
19:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#026), where מבישׁ וּמחפּיר are
connected, this causative signification lies nearer than the
intrinsically transitive. Thus it will also here be meant, that while
the righteous hateth all that is false or that is tainted by falsehood,
the godless on the contrary loves to disgrace and to put to shame. But
it is a question whether יבאישׁ is to be derived from בּאשׁ = בּושׁ, and
thus is of the same meaning as יבישׁ; הבאישׁ, [Isa
30:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#005), which there signifies pudefactum
esse, is pointed הבאישׁ, and is thus derived from a יבשׁ = בּושׁ, vid.,
[Sa2 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#006). But הבאישׁ occurs also as
Hiph. of בּאשׁ, and means transitively to make of an evil savour, [Gen
34:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#030), cf. [Exo
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#021), as well as intransitively to
come into evil savour, [Sa1 27:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#012). In
this sense of putidum faciens, bringing into evil savour, יבאישׁ occurs
here as at [Pro 19:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#026), suitably along
with יחפיר; [Pro 19:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#026) is the putidum
facere by evil report (slander), into which the foolish son brings his
parents, here by his own evil report, thus to be thought of as brought
about by means of slander. The old translators here fall into error;
Luther renders both Hiphils reflexively; only the Venet. (after Kimchi)
is right: ὀζώσει (from an ὀζοῦν as trans. to ὀζεῖν) καὶ ἀτιμώσει, he
makes to be of ill odour and dishonours.

[Proverbs 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 13:6</span></span>

6 Righteousness protecteth an upright walk,

And godlessness bringeth sinners to destruction.

The double thought is closely like that of [Pro
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#005), but is peculiarly and almost
enigmatically expressed. As there, צדקה and רשׁעה are meant of a twofold
inner relation to God, which consists of a ruling influence over man's
conduct and a determination of his walk. But instead of naming the
persons of the תּמימי דּרך and חטּאים as the objects of this influence,
the proverb uses the abstract expression, but with personal reference,
תּם־דּרך and חטּאת dna תּם, and designates in two words the connection
of this twofold character with the principles of their conduct. What is
meant by תּצּר and תּסלּף proceeds from the contrasted relationship of
the two (cf. [Pro 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#012)). נצר
signifies observare, which is not suitable here, but also tueri
(τηρεῖν), to which סלּף (vid., at [Pro
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#003), and in Gesen. Thesaurus), not so
much in the sense of "to turn upside down," pervertere (as [Pro
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#003); [Pro
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#008)), as in the sense of "to
overthrow," evertere (as e.g., [Pro
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#012)), forms a fitting contrast. He
who walks forth with an unfeigned and untroubled pure mind stands under
the shield and the protection of righteousness (cf. with this
prosopopoeia [Psa 25:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#021)), from which
such a walk proceeds, and at the same time under the protection of God,
to whom righteousness appertains, is well-pleasing. but he who in his
conduct permits himself to be determined by sin, godlessness (cf. [Zac
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#008)) from which such a love for sin
springs forth, brings to destruction; in other words: God, from whom the
רשע, those of a perverse disposition, tear themselves away, makes the
sin their snare by virtue of the inner connection established by Him
between the רשׁעה and the destruction ([Isa
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#017)). In the lxx this 6th verse was
originally wanting; the translation in the version of Aquila, in the
Complut. and elsewhere, which the Syr. follows, falsely makes חטאת the
subj.: τοὺς δὲ ἀσεβεῖς φαύλους ποιεῖ ἁμαρτία.

[Proverbs 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 13:7</span></span>

Two proverbs of riches and poverty: -

There is one who maketh himself rich and hath nothing;

There is another who representeth himself poor amid great riches.

A sentence which includes in itself the judgment which [Pro
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#009) expresses. To the Hithpa. התכּבּד
(to make oneself of importance) there are associated here two others, in
the meaning to make oneself something, without anything after it, thus
to place oneself so or so, Ewald, 124a. To the clauses with ו there is
supplied a self-intelligible לּו.

[Proverbs 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 13:8</span></span>

8 A ransom for a man's life are his riches;

But the poor heareth no threatening.

Bertheau falls into error when he understands גּערה of warning; the
contrast points to threatening with the loss of life. The wealth of the
rich before the judgment is not here to be thought of; for apart from
this, that the Tor only in a single case permits, or rather ordains
([Exo 21:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#029).), ransom from the
punishment of death, and declares it in all other cases inadmissible,
[Num 35:31](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#031). (one might indeed think of
an administration of justice not strictly in accordance with the Mosaic
law, or altogether accessible to bribery), 8b does not accord therewith,
since the poor in such cases would fare ill, because one would lay hold
on his person. But one may think e.g., on waylayers as those introduced
as speaking [Pro 1:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#011). The poor has
no room to fear that such will threateningly point their swords against
his breast, for there is nothing to be got from him: he has nothing, one
sees it in him and he is known as such. But the rich is a valuable prize
for them, and he has to congratulate himself if he is permitted to
escape with his life. Also in the times of war and commotion it may be
seen that riches endanger the life of their possessor, and that in
fortunate cases they are given as a ransom for his life, while his
poverty places the poor man in safety. To לא שׁמע Hitzig fittingly
compares [Job 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#018); [Job
39:7](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#007) : he does not hear, he has no
need to hear. Michaelis, Umbreit, Lwenstein (who calls to remembrance
the state of things under despotic governments, especially in the East)
also explain 8b correctly; and Fleischer remarks: pauper minas hostiles
non audit, i.e., non minatur ei hostis. Ewald's syntactic refinement:
"Yet he became poor who never heard an accusation," presents a thought
not in harmony with 8a.

[Proverbs 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 13:9</span></span>

The three following proverbs in [Pro
13:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#009) have at least this in common,
that the two concluding words of each correspond with one another almost
rhythmically.

9 The light of the righteous burneth joyously,

And the lamp of the godless goeth out.

The second line = [Pro 24:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#020), cf. [Pro
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#020). In the Book of [Job
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#005)., אור רשׁעים ידעך and נרו עליו
ידעך (cf. [Pro 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#017)) stand together,
and there is spoken of ([Pro 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#003)) a
divine נר as well as a divine אור which enlightens the righteous;
however, one must say that the poet, as he, [Pro
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#003), deliberately calls the Tor אור,
and the commandment, as derived from it and separated, נר, so also here
designedly calls the righteous אור, viz., אור היום ([Pro
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#018), cf. [Pe2
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#019)), and the godless נר, viz., נר
דלוק - the former imparts the sunny daylight, the latter the light of
tapers set in darkness. The authentic punctuation is אור־צדיקים,
Ben-Naphtali's is 'אור צ' si s'i without Makkeph. To ישׂמח Hitzig
compares the "laughing tongue of the taper" of Meidni, iii. 475; Kimchi
also the "laughing, i.e., amply measured span, טפח שׂוהק," of the
Talmud; for the light laughs when it brightly shines, and increases
rather than decreases; in Arab. samuḥa has in it the idea of joy
directly related to that of liberality. The lxx translates ישׂמח
incorrectly by διαπαντός, and has a distich following [Pro
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#009), the first line of which is ψυχαὶ
δόλιαι (נפשׁ רמיּה?) πλανῶνται ἐν ἁμαρτίαις, and the second line is from
[Psa 37:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#021).

[Proverbs 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 13:10</span></span>

10 Nothing comes by pride but contention;

But wisdom is with those who receive counsel.

The restrictive רק (only) does not, according to the sense, belong to
בּזדון (by pride), but to מצּה, vid., under [Psa
32:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#006) and [Job
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#010). Of יתּן = there is, vid., under
[Pro 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#024). Bertheau's "one causes" is
not exact, for "one" \[man\] is the most general personal subject, but
יתן is in such cases to be regarded as impersonal: by pride is always a
something which causes nothing but quarrel and strife, for the root of
pride is egoism. Line second is a variant to [Pro
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#002). Bescheidenheit (modesty) is in
our old \[German\] language exactly equivalent to Klugheit (prudence).
But here the צנועים are more exactly designated as permitting themselves
to be advised; the elsewhere reciprocal נועץ has here once a tolerative
signification, although the reciprocal is also allowable: with such as
reciprocally advise themselves, and thus without positiveness supplement
each his own knowledge by means of that of another. Most interpreters
regard 10b as a substantival clause, but why should not יתן be carried
forward? With such as permit themselves to be advised, or are not too
proud to sustain with others the relation of giving and receiving, there
is wisdom, since instead of hatred comes wisdom - the peaceful fruit
resulting from an interchange of views.

[Proverbs 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 13:11</span></span>

11 Wealth by means of fraud always becomes less;

But he that increaseth it by labour gains always more.

We punctuate הון־מהבל (with Makkeph, as in Ven. 1521, Antw. 1582,
Frank.-on-the-Oder 1595, Gen. 1618, Leyden 1662), not הון מהבל (as other
editions, and e.g., also Lwenstein); for the meaning is not that the
wealth becomes less by הבל (Targ., but not the Syr.), or that it is less
than הבל (Umbreit), but הון־מהבל is one idea: wealth proceeding from
הבל; but הבל tub ;הב, properly a breath (Theod. ἀπὸ ἀτμοῦ or ἀτμίδος),
then appearance without reality (Aquila, ἀπὸ ματαιότητος), covers itself
here by that which we call swindle, i.e., by morally unrestrained
fraudulent and deceitful speculation in contrast to solid and real gain.
The translations: ἐπισπουδαζομένη μετὰ ἀνομίας (lxx), ὑπερσπουδαζομένη
(Symmachus, Quinta),

(Note: A fragment of an anonymous translation, so called from the place
it holds in Origen's Hexapla.)

festinata (Jerome), do not necessarily suppose the phrase מהבּל = מבהל,
[Pro 20:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#021) Kerı̂, for wealth which
comes מהבל is obtained in a windy (unsubstantial) manner and as if by
storm, of which the proverb holds good: "so gewonnen so zerronnen" (=
quickly come, quickly go). מהבל needs neither to be changed into that
unhebraic מהבּל (Hitzig) nor into the cognate מבהל (Ewald), but yet
inferior to מהבל in the content of its idea. The contrast of one who by
fraud and deception quickly arrives at wealth is one who brings it
together in his hand, ἐπὶ χειρός (Venet.), i.e., always as often as he
can bear it in his hand and bring it forth (Ewald, Bertheau, Elster, and
Lagarde), or according to the measure of the hand, κατὰ χεῖρα (which
means "according to external ability"), so that על, which is applied to
the formation of adverbs, e.g., [Psa
31:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#024) (Hitzig) - by both explanations
על־יד has the meaning of "gradually," - is used as in the post-bibl.
Hebr. על יד על יד = מעט מעט, e.g., Schabbath 156a (vid., Aruch under על)
(distinguish from ביד = with thought, intentionally, Berachoth 52b).
There is scarcely a word having more significations that יד. Connected
with על, it means at one time side or place, at another mediation or
direction; that which is characteristic here is the omission of the
pronoun (על־ידו, על־ידיו). The lxx translates על יד with the
unrestrained freedom which it allows to itself by μετ ̓ εὐσεβείας, and
has following πληθυνθήσεται another line, δίκαιος οἰκτείρει καὶ κιχρᾷ
(from [Psa 37:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#026)).

[Proverbs 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 13:12</span></span>

The figures of paradise in [Pro 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#012)
and [Pro 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#014) require us to take
along with them the intermediate verse ([Pro
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#013)).

12 Deferred waiting maketh the heart sick,

And a tree of life is a wish accomplished.

Singularly the lxx Κρείσσων ἐναρχόμενος βοηθῶν καρδίᾳ, followed by the
Syr. (which the Targ. Transcribes):

(Note: That the Targum of the Proverbs is a Jewish elaboration of the
Peshito text, vid., Nldeke in Merx' Archiv, Bd. ii. pp. 246-49.)

Better is he who begins to help than he who remains in hesitating
expectation, by which תחלת is doubled, and is derived once from הוחיל,
to wait, and the second time from החל, to begin. If the lxx, with its
imitators, deteriorates to such a degree proverbs so clear, beautiful,
and inviolable, what may one expect from it in the case of those not
easily understood! משּׁך signifies also, [Isa
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#002), to be widely extended (cf. Arab.
meshaḳ), here in the sense of time, as נמשׁך, to prolong, [Isa
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#022), and post-bibl. משׁך הזּמן, the
course of time. Regarding תּוחלת, vid., at [Pro
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#028), where as [Pro
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#027) תּקות, here תּאוה, as also [Psa
78:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#029) of the object of the wish, and
with בוא in the sense of being fulfilled (cf. [Jos
21:43](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#043)), as there with הביא in the
sense of accomplishing or performing. Extended waiting makes the heart
sick, causes heart-woe (מחלה, part. fem. Hiph. of חלה, to be slack,
feeble, sick; R. חל, to loosen, to make loose); on the contrary, a wish
that has been fulfilled is a tree of life (cf. p. 23), of a quickening
and strengthening influence, like that tree of paradise which was
destined to renew and extend the life of man.

[Proverbs 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 13:13</span></span>

13 Whoever despiseth the word is in bonds to it,

And he that feareth the commandment is rewarded.

The word is thought of as ordering, and thus in the sense of the
commandment, e.g., [Sa1 17:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#019); [Dan
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#023), [Dan
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025). That which is here said is
always true where the will of a man has subordinated itself to the
authoritative will of a superior, but principally the proverb has in
view the word of God, the מצוה κατ ̓ ἐξ. as the expression of the divine
will, which ([Pro 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#003)) appears as the
secondary, with the תורה, the general record of the divine will.
Regarding בּוּז ל of contemptuous, despiteful opposition, vid., at [Pro
6:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#030), cf. [Pro
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#012). Jol records the prevailing
tradition, for he translates: "Whoever despises advice rushes into
destruction; whoever holds the commandment in honour is perfect." But
that ישׁלּם is to be understood neither of perfection nor of peace (lxx
and Jerome), but means compensabitur (here not in the sense of
punishment, but of reward), we know from [Pro
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#031). The translation also of יחבל לו
by "he rushes into destruction" (lxx καταφθαρήσεται, which the
Syr.-Hexap. repeats; Luther, "he destroys himself;" the Venet. οἰχησεταί
οἱ, periet sibi) fails, for one does not see what should have determined
the poet to choose just this word, and, instead of the ambiguous dat.
ethicus, not rather to say יחבּל נפשׁו. So also this יחבל is not with
Gesenius to be connected with חבל = Arab. khabl, corrumpere, but with
חבל = Arab. ḥabl, ligare, obligare. Whoever places himself
contemptuously against a word which binds him to obedience will
nevertheless not be free from that word, but is under pledge until he
redeem the pledge by the performance of the obedience refused, or till
that higher will enforce payment of the debt withheld by visiting with
punishment. Jerome came near the right interpretation: ipse se in
futurum obligat; Abulwald refers to [Exo
22:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#025); and Parchon, Rashi, and others
paraphrase: משׁכּן יתמשׁכּן עליו, he is confiscated as by mortgage.
Schultens has, with the correct reference of the לו not to the
contemner, but to the word, well established and illustrated this
explanation: he is pledged by the word, Arab. marhwan (rahyn), viz.,
pigneratus paenae (Livius, xxix. 36). Ewald translates correctly: he is
pledged to it; and Hitzig gives the right explanation: "A חבלה \[a
pledge, cf. [Pro 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#016)\] is handed
over to the offended law with the חבוּלה \[the bad conduct\] by the
despiser himself, which lapses when he has exhausted the forbearance, so
that the punishment is inflicted." The lxx has another proverb following
[Pro 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#013) regarding υἱὸς δόλιος and
οἰκέτης σοφός; the Syr. has adopted it; Jerome has here the proverb of
the animae dolosae (vid., at [Pro
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#009)).

[Proverbs 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 13:14</span></span>

14 The doctrine of the wise man is a fountain of life,

To escape the snares of death.

An integral distich, vid., p. 8 of the Introduction. Essentially like
14a, [Pro 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#011) says, "a fountain of
life is the mouth of the righteous." The figure of the fountain of life
with the teleological 'לסור וגו (the ל of the end and consequence of the
action) is repeated [Pro 14:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#027). The
common non-biblical figure of the laquei mortis leads also to the idea
of death as יקוּשׁ a fowler, [Psa
91:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#003). If it is not here a mere formula
for the dangers of death (Hitzig), then the proverb is designed to state
that the life which springs from the doctrine of the wise man as from a
fountain of health, for the disciple who will receive it, communicates
to him knowledge and strength, to know where the snares of destruction
lie, and to hasten with vigorous steps away when they threaten to
entangle him.

[Proverbs 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 13:15</span></span>

Four proverbs follow, whose connection appears to have been occasioned
by the sound of their words (שׂכל ... כל, בדעת ... ברע, רשׁע ... רישׁ).

15 Fine prudence produceth favour;

But the way of the malicious is uncultivated.

Regarding שׂכל טוב (thus to be punctuated, without Makkeph with Munach,
after Codd. and old editions), vid., p. 84; for the most part it
corresponds with that which in a deep ethical sense we call fine
culture. Regarding יתּן, vid., at [Pro
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#010) : it is not used here, as there,
impersonally, but has a personal subject: he brings forth, causes. Fine
culture, which shows men how to take the right side and in all
circumstances to strike the right key, exercises a kindly heart-winning
influence, not merely, as would be expressed by ימצא חן, to the benefit
of its possessor, but, as is expressed by יתּן חן, such as removes
generally a partition wall and brings men closer to one another. The
איתן \[perennis\], touching it both for the eye and the ear, forms the
contrast to יתן חן. This word, an elative formation from יתן = Arab.
wtn, denotes that which stretches itself far, and that with reference to
time: that which remains the same during the course of time. "That which
does not change in time, continuing the same, according to its nature,
strong, firm, and thus איתן becomes the designation of the enduring and
the solid, whose quality remains always the same." Thus Orelli, Die
hebr. Synonyme der Zeit u. Ewigkeit, 1871. But that in the passage
before us it denotes the way of the בגדים as "endlessly going forward,"
the explanation of Orelli, after Bttcher (Collectanea, p. 135), is
withdrawn by the latter in the new Aehrenlese (where he reads ריב איתן,
"constant strife"). And נחל איתן ([Deu
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#004)) does not mean "a brook, the
existence of which is not dependent on the weather and the season of the
year," at least not in accordance with the traditional meaning which is
given Sota ix. 5 (cf. the Gemara), but a stony valley; for the Mishna
says: איתן כמשׁמעו קשׁה, i.e., איתן is here, according to its verbal
meaning, equivalent to קשׁה (hard). We are of the opinion that here, in
the midst of the discussion of the law of the עגלה ערופה (the ritual for
the atonement of a murder perpetrated by an unknown hand), the same
meaning of the איתן is certified which is to be adopted in the passage
before us. Maimuni

(Note: = R. Moses b. Maimum = Rambam, so called by the Jews from the
initial letters of his name = Maimonides, d. 1204.)

(in Sota and Hilchoth Rozeach ix. 2) indeed, with the Mishna and Gemara,
thinks the meaning of a "strong rushing wdy" to be compatible; but קשׁה
is a word which more naturally denotes the property of the ground than
of a river, and the description, [Deu
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#004) : in a נחל איתן, in which there
is no tillage and sowing, demands for נחל here the idea of the valley,
and not primarily that of the valley-brook. According to this tradition,
the Targum places a תּקּיפא in the Peshito translation of 15b, and the
Venet. translates, after Kimchi, ὁδὸς δὲ ἀνταρτῶν (of ἀνταρτής from
ἀνταίρειν) ἰσχυρά. The fundamental idea of remaining like itself,
continuing, passes over into the idea of the firm, the hard, so that
איתן is a word that interchanges with סלע, [Num
24:21](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#021), and serves as a figurative
designation of the rocky mountains, [Jer
49:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#019), and the rocky framework of the
earth, [Mic 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#002). Thus the meaning of
hardness (πετρῶδες, [Mat 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#005))
connects itself with the word, and at the same time, according to [Deu
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#004), of the uncultivable and the
uncultivated. The way of the בּגדים, the treacherous, i.e., the manner
in which they transact with men, is stiff, as hard as stone, and
repulsive; they follow selfish views, never placing themselves in
sympathy with the condition of their neighbour; they are without the
tenderness which is connected with fine culture; they remain destitute
of feeling in things which, as we say, would soften a stone. It is
unnecessary to give a catalogue of the different meanings of this איתן,
such as vorago (Jerome), a standing bog (Umbreit), and ever trodden way
(Bertheau), etc.; Schultens offers, as frequently, the relatively best:
at via perfidorum pertinacissime tensum; but יתן does not mean to
strain, but to extend. The lxx has between 15a and 15b the
interpolation: τὸ δὲ γνῶναι νόμον διανοίας ἐστὶν ἀγαθῆς.

[Proverbs 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 13:16</span></span>

16 Every prudent man acteth with understanding;

But a fool spreadeth abroad folly.

Hitzig reads, with the Syr. (but not the Targ.) and Jerome, כּל (omnia
agit), but contrary to the Hebr. syntax. The כּל־ is not feeble and
useless, but means that he always acts בּדּעת, mit Bedacht \[with
judgment\] (opp. בּבלי דעת, inconsulto, [Deu
4:42](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#042); [Deu
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#004)), while on the contrary the fool
displays folly. [Pro 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#023) and [Pro
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#002) serve to explain both members of
the verse. Bedchtigkeit \[judgment\] is just knowledge directed to a
definite practical end, a clear thought concentrated on a definite
point. יקרא, he calls out, and יבּיע, he sputters out, are parallels to
יפרשׂ. Fleischer: פּרשׂ, expandit (opp. Arab. ṭawy, intra animum
cohibuit), as a cloth or paper folded or rolled together, cf. Schiller's

(Note: "Er breitet es heiter und glnzend aus,

Das zusammengewickelte Leben.") -

"He spreads out brightly and splendidly

The enveloped life."

There lies in the word something derisive: as the merchant unrolls and
spreads out his wares in order to commend them, so the fool does with
his foolery, which he had enveloped, i.e., had the greatest interest to
keep concealed within himself - he is puffed up therewith.

[Proverbs 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 13:17</span></span>

17 A godless messenger falls into trouble;

But a faithful messenger is a cordial.

The traditional text, which the translations also give (except Jerome,
nuntius impii, and leaving out of view the lxx, which makes of [Pro
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#017) a history of a foolhardy king
and a wise messenger), has not מלאך, but מלאך; the Masora places the
word along with המלאך, [Gen 48:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#016). And
יפל is likewise testified to by all translators; they all read it as
Kal, as the traditional text punctuates it; Luther alone departs from
this and translates the Hiph.: "a godless messenger bringeth
misfortune." Indeed, this conj. יפּל presses itself forward; and even
though one read יפּל, the sense intended by virtue of the parallelism
could be no other than that a godless messenger, because no blessing
rests on his godlessness, stumbles into disaster, and draws him who gave
the commission along with him. The connection מלאך רשׁע is like אדם
רשׁע, [Pro 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#007) (cf. the fem. of this
adj., [Eze 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#018)). Instead of בּרע is
בּרעה, [Pro 17:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#020); [Pro
28:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#014), parallels (cf. also [Pro
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#005)) which the punctuators may have
had in view in giving the preference to Kal. With מלאך, from לאך, R. לך,
to make to go = to send, is interchanged ציר, from צוּר, to turn, whence
to journey (cf. Arab. ṣar, to become, to be, as the vulg. "to be to
Dresden = to journey" is used). The connection ציר אמוּנים (cf. the more
simple ציר נאמן, [Pro 25:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#013)) is like
[Pro 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#015), עד אמונים; the pluralet.
means faithfulness in the full extent of the idea. Regarding מרפּא, the
means of healing, here to strength, refreshment, vid., [Pro
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#022); [Pro
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#018).

[Proverbs 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 13:18</span></span>

18 Poverty and shame (to him) who rejecteth correction;

But he who regardeth reproof is honoured.

We are neither to supply אישׁ before רישׁ קלונו (or more correctly,
abstr. pro concr., as רמיּה, [Pro
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#027)), nor ל before פורע, as Gesenius
(Lehrgeb. 227a) does; nor has the part. פּורע the value of a
hypothetical clause like [Pro 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#013),
[Job 41:18](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#018), although it may certainly
be changed into such without destroying the meaning (Ewald, Hitzig); but
"poverty and shame is he who is without correction," is equivalent to,
poverty and shame is the conclusion or lot of him who is without
correction; it is left to the hearer to find out the reference of the
predicate to the subject in the sense of the quality, the consequence,
or the lot (cf. e.g., [Pro 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#017); [Pro
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#001); [Pro
14:35](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#035)).

(Note: Vid., regarding the strong demand which the Hebr. style makes on
hearer and reader, my Gesch. der jdischen Poesie (1863), p. 189.)

Regarding פרע, vid., p. 73. The Latin expression corresponding is: qui
detrectat disciplinam. He who rejects the admonition and correction of
his parents, his pastor, or his friend, and refuses every counsel to
duty as a burdensome moralizing, such an one must at last gather wisdom
by means of injury if he is at all wise: he grows poorer in consequence
of missing the right rule of life, and has in addition thereto to be
subject to disgrace through his own fault. On the contrary, to him who
has the disgrace to deserve reproof, but who willingly receives it, and
gives it effect, the disgrace becomes an honour, for not to reject
reproof shows self-knowledge, humility, and good-will; and these
properties in the judgment of others bring men to honour, and have the
effect of raising them in their position in life and in their calling.

[Proverbs 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 13:19</span></span>

Two pairs of proverbs regarding fools and wise men, ranged together by
catchwords.

19 Quickened desire is sweet to the soul,

And it is an abomination to fools to avoid evil.

A synthetic distich, the first line of which, viewed by itself, is only
a feebler expression of that which is said in [Pro
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#012), for תּאוה נהיה is essentially
of the same meaning as תאוה באה, not the desire that has just arisen and
is not yet appeased (Umbreit, Hitzig, Zckler), which when expressed by a
part. of the same verb would be הוה (= אשׁר היתה), but the desire that
is appeased (Jerome, Luther, also Venet. ἔφεσις γενομένη, i.e., after
Kimchi: in the fulfilling of past desire; on the contrary, the Syr.,
Targ. render the phrase נאוה of becoming desire). The Niph. נהיה denotes
not the passing into a state of being, but the being carried out into
historical reality, e.g., [Eze 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#012);
[Eze 39:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#008), where it is connected with
באה; it is always the expression of the completed fact to which there is
a looking back, e.g., [Jdg 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#003); and
this sense of the Niph. stands so fast, that it even means to be done,
finished (brought to an end), to be out, to be done with anything, e.g.,
[Dan 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#001).

(Note: We have said, p. 156, that a Niph. in which the peculiar
causative meaning of the Hiph. would be rendered passively is without
example; we must here with נהיה add, that the Niph. of intransitive
verbs denotes the entrance into the condition expressed by the Kal, and
may certainly be regarded, according to our way of thinking, as passive
of the Hiphil (Gesen. 51, 2). But the old language shows no ההוה to
which נהיה (Arab. âinhaway, in Mutenebbi) stood as passive; in the Arab.
also the seventh form, rightly regarded, is always formed from the
first, vid., Fleischer's Beitrge, u.s.w., in the Sitzungs-Bericht. d.
Schs. Gesellschaft d. Wiss. 1863, p. 172f.)

The sentence, that fulfilled desire does good to the soul, appears
commonplace (Hitzig); but it is comprehensive enough on the ground of
Heb 11 to cheer even a dying person, and conceals the ethically
significant truth that the blessedness of vision is measured by the
degree of the longing of faith. But the application of the clause in its
pairing with 19b acquires another aspect. On this account, because the
desire of the soul is pleasant in its fulfilment, fools abhor the
renouncing of evil, for their desire is directed to that which is
morally worthless and blameworthy, and the endeavour, which they closely
and constantly adhere to, is to reach the attainment of this desire.
This subordinate proposition of the conclusion is unexpressed. The
pairing of the two lines of the proverb may have been occasioned by the
resemblance in sound of תועבת and תּאוה. סוּר is n. actionis, like [Pro
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#017), cf. 6. Besides, it in to be
observed that the proverb speaks of fools and not of the godless. Folly
is that which causes that men do not break free from evil, for it is the
deceit of sinful lust which binds them fast thereto.

[Proverbs 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pro 13:20</span></span>

20 Whoever goes with wise men, becomes wise;

And whoever has intercourse with fools, becomes base.

Regarding the significance of this proverb in the history of the
religion and worship of Israel, vid., p. 39. We have translated 20a
after the Kerı̂; the translation according to the Chethı̂b is: "go with
wise men and become wise" (cf. [Pro
8:33](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#033)), not הלוך, for the connection of
the (meant imperatively) infin. absol. with an imper. (meant
conclusively) is not tenable; but הלוך is an imper. form established by
הלכוּ, [Jer 51:50](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#050) (cf. הלוך = לכת,
[Num 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#014)), and appears to have been
used with such shades of conception as here as intercourse and
companionship for לך. Regarding ירוע gnid, vid., at [Pro
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#015); there it meant malo afficietur,
here it means malus (pejor) fiet. The Venet. (contrary to Kimchi, who
explains by frangetur) rightly has κακωθήσεται. There is here a play
upon words; רעה means to tend (a flock), also in general to be
considerate about anything ([Pro
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#014); 44:20), to take care of
anything with the accusative of the person ([Pro
28:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#007); [Pro
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#003)), to hold intercourse with any
one: he who by preference seeks the society of fools, himself becomes
such (Jerome, similis efficietur), or rather, as ירוע expresses, he
comes always morally lower down. "A wicked companion leads his associate
into hell."

[Proverbs 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 13:21</span></span>

21 Evil pursueth sinners,

And the righteous is repaid with good.

To תּרדּף of the punishment which follows after sinners at their heels,
cf. [Nah 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#008). Greek art gives wings to
Nemesis in this sense. To translate 21b, with Lwenstein, "The pious, the
good rewards them," is untenable, for טוב, the good (e.g., [Pro
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#027)), never appears personified,
only טוב, goodness, [Psa 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#006),
according to which the lxx τοὺς δὲ δικαίους καταλήψεται (ישׂיג) ἀγαθά.
Still less is טוב meant personally, as the Venet. τὰ δὲ δίκαια ἀποδώσει
χρηστός, which probably means: righteous conduct will a good one, viz.,
God, reward. טוב .dr is an attribute of God, but never the name of God.
So the verb שׁלּם, after the manner of verbs of educating and leading
(גמל, עשׂה, עבד), is connected with a double accusative. The Syr.,
Targum, and Jerome translate passively, and so also do we; for while we
must think of God in the retribuet, yet the proverb does not name Him
any more than at [Pro 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#014), cf. [Pro
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#024); it is designedly constructed,
placing Him in the background, with vague generality: the righteous will
one, will they, reward with good - this expression, with the most
general personal subject, almost coincides with one altogether passive.

[Proverbs 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#022)

22 The good man leaveth behind him for his children's children,

And the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just.

As a commencing word, טוב signifies in the Mishle for the most part
bonum (prae); but here, as at [Pro
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#002), cf. [Pro
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#009); [Pro
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#004), it signifies bonus. As the
expression that God is טוב ([Psa 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#008),
etc.) of the O.T. is equivalent to the N.T. that He is ἀγάπη, so that
man who in his relation to others is determined by unselfish love is טוב
for the good man \[der Gtige\], i.e., the man who is willing to
communicate all good is truly good, because the essence of צדקה,
righteousness of life, is love. Such an one suffers no loss by his
liberality, but, according to the law, [Pro
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#025), by which a dispenser of
blessings is at the same time also a recipient of blessings, he has only
gain, so that he makes his children's children to inherit, i.e., leaves
behind him an inheritance extending even to his grandchildren (vid.,
regarding הנחיל, p. 182; here trans. as containing its object in itself,
as at [Deu 32:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#008) : to make to inherit,
to place in possession of an inheritance). The sinner, on the contrary
(חוטא sing. to חטּאים, ἁμαρτωλοί), loses his wealth, it is already
destined to pass over to the righteous who is worthy of it, and makes
use (cf. [Job 27:17](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#017)) of that which he
possesses in accordance with the will and appointment of God - a
revelation of justice appertaining to time, the exceptions to which the
old limited doctrine of requital takes no notice of. חיל, strength, then
like our "Vermgen" (cf. opes, facultates), that by means of which one is
placed in circumstances to accomplish much (Fl.); cf. regarding the
fundamental idea contorquere, compingere, p. 226, also regarding צפן,
properly condensare, then condere, p. 61.

[Proverbs 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 13:23</span></span>

Connected with [Pro 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#022) there now
follow two proverbs regarding sustenance, with one intervening regarding
education.

23 The poor man's fresh land gives food in abundance,

And many are destroyed by iniquity.

The Targ. and Theodotion (μέγας) translate רב, but the Masora has רב־
with short Kametz, as [Pro 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#006); [Ecc
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#008) (cf. Kimchi under רבב). The
rendering: multitudo cibi est ager pauperum, makes the produce the
property of the field (= frugum fertilis). ניר .)s is the new field
(novale or novalis, viz., ager), from ניר, to make arable, fruitful;
properly to raise up, viz., by grubbing and freeing of stones (סקּל).
But why, asks Hitzig, just the new field? As if no answer could be given
to this question, he changes ניר into ניב, and finds in 23a the
description of a rentier, "a great man who consumes the income of his
capital." But how much more intelligible is the new field of the poor
man than these capitals (ראשׁים) with their per cents (ניב)! A new field
represents to us severe labour, and as belonging to a poor man, a
moderate field, of which it is here said, that notwithstanding its
freshly broken up fallow, it yet yields a rich produce, viz., by virtue
of the divine blessing, for the proverb supposes the ora et labora.
Regarding ראשׁים = רשׁים, vid., at [Pro
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#004). Jerome's translation, patrum
(properly, heads), follows a false Jewish tradition. In the antithesis,
23b, one is tempted to interpret ישׁ in the sense of [Pro
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#021) \[substance, wealth\], as
Schultens, opulentia ipsa raditur quum non est moderamen, and Euchel:
that which is essentially good, badly managed, goes to ruin. But ישׁ and
וישׁ at the beginning of a proverb, or of a line of a proverb, in every
case means est qui. That a wealthy person is meant, the contrast shows.
נספּה, which denotes anything taken away or gathered up, has the same
meaning here as at [Sa1 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#001) : est qui
(Fl. quod, but the parallel does not demand this) abripiatur, i.e.,
quasi turbine auferatur et perdatur; the word reminds us of סופה,
whirlwind, but in itself it means only something smooth and altogether
carried off. The בּ is here as at [Gen
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#015); elsewhere בּלא משׁפּט means
with injustice (properly, not-right), [Pro
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#008), [Jer
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#013); [Eze
22:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#029); here it is not the ב of the
means, but of the mediate cause. While the (industrious and God-fearing)
poor man is richly nourished from the piece of ground which he
cultivates, many a one who has incomparably more than he comes by his
unrighteousness down to a state of beggary, or even lower: he is not
only in poverty, but along with this his honour, his freedom, and the
very life of his person perish.

[Proverbs 13:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 13:24</span></span>

24 He that spareth his rod hateth his son,

And he who loveth him visits him early with correction.

The paedagogic rule of God, [Pro 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#012),
avails also for men, [Pro 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#013)., [Pro
29:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#015). The rod represents here the
means of punishment, the patria potestas. He who spareth or avoideth
this, and who does this even from love, has yet no true right love for
his son; he who loveth him correcteth him early. With ἐπιμελῶς παιδεύει
of the lxx (cf. Sir. 30:1, ἐνδελεχήσει μάστιγας) the thought is in
general indicated, but the expression is not explained. Many erroneously
regard the suffix of שׁחרו as referring to the object immediately
following (de Dieu, Ewald, Bertheau, Zckler); Hitzig, on the contrary,
rightly remarks, that in this case we should expect the words to be,
after [Pro 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#022) (cf. [Exo
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#006)), את־המּוּסר. He himself, without
any necessity, takes שׁחר in the sense of the Arab. skhar, compescere.
Hofmann (Schriftbew. ii. 2. 402) is right in saying that "שׁחר is
connected with a double accusative as elsewhere קדּם occurs; and the
meaning is, that one ought much more to anticipate correction than
restrain it where it is necessary." שׁחר means to go out early to
anything, according to which a Greek rendering is ὀρθρίζει (Venet.
ὀρθριεῖ) αὐτῷ παιδείαν: maturat ei castigationem = mature eum castigat
(Fl.). שׁחר does not denote the early morning of the day (as Rashi,
לבקרים), but the morning of life (as Euchel, בשׁחר ימיו). "The earlier
the fruit, the better the training." A father who truly wishes well to
his son keeps him betimes under strict discipline, to give him while he
is yet capable of being influenced the right direction, and to allow no
errors to root themselves in him; but he who is indulgent toward his
child when he ought to be strict, acts as if he really wished his ruin.

[Proverbs 13:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">pro 13:25</span></span>

25 The righteous has to eat to the satisfying of his soul;

But the body of the godless must suffer want.

Jerome translates תחסר freely by insaturabilis (he has want = has never
enough), but in that case we would have expected תחסר תּמיד; also in 25a
עד־שׂבע would have been used. We have thus before us no commendation of
temperance and moderation in contrast to gluttony, but a statement
regarding the diversity of fortune of the righteous and the godless -
another way of clothing the idea of [Pro
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#003). שׂבע is a segolate form, thus an
infin. formation, formally different from the similar שׂבע, [Pro
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#010). Regarding בּטן, vid., Psychol.
p. 265f.; it is a nobler word than "Bauch" \[belly\], for it denotes not
the external arch, but, like κοιλία (R. בט, concavus), the inner body,
here like [Pro 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#020), as that which
receives the nourishment and changes it in succum et sanguinem. That God
richly nourishes the righteous, and on the contrary brings the godless
to want and misery, is indeed a rule with many exceptions, but
understood in the light of the N.T., it has deep inward everlasting
truth.
