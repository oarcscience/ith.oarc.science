### [Proverbs Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#001)

[Proverbs 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 21:1</span></span>

The group, like the preceding one, now closes with a proverb of the
king.

A king's heart in Jahve's hand is like brooks of water;

He turneth it whithersoever He will.

Brook and canal (the Quinta: ὑδραγωγοί) are both called פּלג, or פּלג,
[Job 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#017), Arab. falaj (from פּלג, to
divide, according to which Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion, διαρέσεις;
Venet. διανομαί; Jerome, divisiones); Jkt has the explanation of the
word: "falaj is the name given to flowing water, particularly the brook
from a spring, and every canal which is led from a spring out over flat
ground." Such brooks of water are the heart of a king, i.e., it is
compared to such, in Jahve's hand. The second line contains the point of
comparison: He inclines it, gives to it the direction (הטּה, causat. of
נטה, [Num 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#015)) toward whatever He
will (חפץ denotes willing, as a bending and inclining, viz., of the
will; vid., at [Pro 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#002)). Rightly
Hitzig finds it not accidental that just the expression "brooks of
water" is chosen as the figure for tractableness and subjection to
government. In [Isa 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#002), the princes
of Judah are compared to "rivers of water in a dry place" with reference
to the exhaustion of the land during the oppression of the Assyrian
invasion; the proverb has specially in view evidences of kindness
proceeding from the heart, as at [Pro
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#015) the favour of the king is
compared to clouds of latter rain emptying themselves in beneficent
showers, and at [Pro 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#012) to the dew
refreshing the plants. But the speciality of the comparison here is,
that the heart of the king, however highly exalted above his subjects,
and so removed from their knowledge he may be, has yet One above it by
whom it is moved by hidden influences, e.g., the prayer of the
oppressed; for man is indeed free, yet he acts under the influence of
divinely-directed circumstances and divine operations; and though he
reject the guidance of God, yet from his conduct nothing results which
the Omniscient, who is surprised by nothing, does not make subservient
to His will in the world-plan of redemption. Rightly the Midrash: God
gives to the world good or bad kings, according as He seeks to bless it
or to visit it with punishment; all decisions that go forth from the
king's mouth come לכתחלה, i.e., in their first commencement and their
last reason they come from the Holy One.

[Proverbs 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 21:2</span></span>

The next group extends from [Pro 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#002)
to [Pro 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#008), where it closes as it
began.

2 Every way of a man is right in his own eyes;

But a weigher of hearts is Jahve.

A proverb similar to [Pro 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#002) (where
דּרכי, for דּרך, זך for ישׁר, רוּחות for לבּות). God is also, [Pro
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#003), called a trier, בּחן, of hearts,
as He is here called a weigher, תּכן. The proverb indirectly admonishes
us of the duty of constant self-examination, according to the objective
norm of the revealed will of God, and warns us against the
self-complacency of the fool, of whom [Pro
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#015) says (as Trimberg in "Renner"):
"all fools live in the pleasant feeling that their life is the best,"
and against the self-deception which walks in the way of death and
dreams of walking in the way of life, [Pro
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#012) ([Pro
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#025)).

[Proverbs 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 21:3</span></span>

3 To practice justice and right

Hath with Jahve the pre-eminence above sacrifice.

We have already (vol. i. p. 42) shown how greatly this depreciation of
the works of the ceremonial cultus, as compared with the duties of moral
obedience, is in the spirit of the Chokma; cf. also at [Pro
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#008). Prophecy also gives its
testimony, e.g., [Hos 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#007), according
to which also here (cf. [Pro 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#008) with
[Isa 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#008)) the practising of צדקה
וּמשׁפּט (sequence of words as at [Gen
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#019); [Psa
33:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#005), elsewhere צדק ומשׁפט, and yet
more commonly משׁפט וצדקה) does not denote legal rigour, but the
practising of the justum et aequum, or much rather the aequum et bonum,
thus in its foundation conduct proceeding from the principle of love.
The inf. עשׂה (like קנה, [Pro 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#016))
occurs three times (here and at [Gen
50:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#020); [Psa
101:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#003)); once עשׂו is written ([Gen
31:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#018)), as also in the infin. absol.
the form עשׂה mro and עשׂו interchange (vid., Norzi at [Jer
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#004)); once עשׂהוּ for עשׂותו ([Exo
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#018)) occurs in the status
conjunctus.

[Proverbs 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 21:4</span></span>

4 Loftiness of eyes and swelling of heart -

The husbandry of the godless is sin.

If נר, in the sense of light, gives a satisfactory meaning, then one
might appeal to [Kg1 11:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#036) (cf. [Sa2
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#017)), where ניר appears to signify
lamp, in which meaning it is once ([Sa2
22:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#029)) written ניר (like חיק); or
since ניר = נר (ground-form, nawir, lightening) is as yet certainly
established neither in the Heb. nor Syr., one might punctuate נר instead
of נר, according to which the Greeks, Aram., and Luther, with Jerome,
translate. But of the lamp of the godless we read at [Pro
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#009) and elsewhere, that it goeth out.
We must here understand by נר the brilliant prosperity (Bertheau and
others) of the wicked, or their "proud spirit flaming and flaring like a
bright light" (Zckler), which is contrary to the use of the metaphor as
found elsewhere, which does not extend to a prosperous condition. We
must then try another meaning for נר; but not that of yoke, for this is
not Heb., but Aram.-Arab., and the interpretation thence derived by
Lagarde: "Haughtiness and pride; but the godless for all that bear their
yoke, viz., sin," seeks in vain to hide behind the "for all that" the
breaking asunder of the two lines of the verse. In Heb. נר means that
which lightens (burning) = lamp, נוּר, the shining (that which burns) =
fire, and ניר, [Pro 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#023), from ניר,
to plough up (Targ. [Sa1 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#012), למנר =
לחרשׁ) the fresh land, i.e., the breaking up of the fallow land;
according to which the Venet. as Kimchi: νέωμα ἀσεβῶν ἁμαρτία, which as
Ewald and Elster explain: "where a disposition of wicked haughtiness, of
unbridled pride, prevails, there will also sin be the first-fruit on the
field of action; נר, novale, the field turned up for the first time,
denotes here the first-fruits of sin." But why just the first-fruits,
and not the fruit in general? We are better to abide by the field
itself, which is here styled נר, not שׂדה (or as once in [Jer
39:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#010), יגב); because with this word,
more even than with שׂדה, is connected the idea of agricultural work, of
arable land gained by the digging up or the breaking up of one or more
years' fallow ground (cf. Pea ii. 1, ניר, Arab. siḳâḳ, opp. בור, Arab.
bûr, Menachoth 85a, שׂדות מניּרות, a fresh broken-up field, Erachin 29b,
נר ,, opp. הביר, to let lie fallow), so that נר רשׁעים may mean the
cultivation of the fields, and generally the husbandry, i.e., the whole
conduct and life of the godless. נר is here ethically metaph., but not
like [Hos 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#012); [Jer
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#003), where it means a new moral
commencement of life; but like חרשׁ, arare, [Job
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#008); [Hos
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#013); cf. [Pro
3:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#029). רחב is not adj. like [Pro
28:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#025), [Psa
101:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#005), but infin. like חסר, [Pro
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#021); and accordingly also רוּם is
not adj. like חוּם, or past like סוּג, but infin. like [Isa
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#012). And חטּאת is the pred. of the
complex subject, which consists of רוּם עינים, a haughty looking down
with the eyes, רחב־לב, breadth of heart, i.e., excess of
self-consciousness, and נר רשׁעים taken as an asyndeton summativum:
pride of look, and making oneself large of heart, in short, the whole
husbandry of the godless, or the whole of the field cultivated by them,
with all that grows thereon, is sin.

[Proverbs 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 21:5</span></span>

5 The striving of the diligent is only to advantage.

And hastening all \[excessive haste\] only to loss;

or in other words, and agreeably to the Heb. construction:

The thoughts of the industrious are (reach) only to gain,

And every one who hastens - it (this his hastening) is only to loss.

Vid., at [Pro 17:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#021). At [Pro
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#004), Luther translates "the hand of
the diligent," here "the plans of an expert \[endelichen\]," i.e., of
one actively striving ([Pro 22:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#029),
endelich = מהיר) to the end. The אץ, hastening overmuch, is contrasted
with the diligent: Luther well: but he who is altogether too
precipitant. Everywhere else in the Proverbs אץ has a closer definition
with it, wherefore Hitzig reads אצר, which must mean: he who collects
together; but אץ along with חרוץ is perfectly distinct. The thought is
the same as our "eile mit Weile" \[= festina lente\], and Goethe's

Wie das Gestirn ohne Hast,

Aber ohne Rast

Drehe sich jeder

Um die eigne Last.

"Like the stars, without haste but without rest, let every one carry
about his own burden," viz., of his calling that lies upon him. The
fundamental meaning of אוץ is to throng, to urge ([Exo
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#013)), here of impatient and
inconsiderate rashness. While on the side of the diligent there is
nothing but gain, such haste brings only loss; over-exertion does
injury, and the work will want care, circumspection, and thoroughness.
In the Book of Proverbs, the contrasts "gain" and "loss" frequently
occur, [Pro 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#024); [Pro
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#023); [Pro
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#016) : profit (the increase of
capital by interest), opp. loss (of capital, or of part thereof), as
commercial terms.

[Proverbs 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 21:6</span></span>

6 The gaining of treasures by a lying tongue

Is a fleeting breath of such as seek death.

One may, at any rate, after the free manner of gnomic resemblances and
comparisons, regard "fleeting breath" and "such as seek death" as two
separated predicates: such gain is fleeting breath, so those who gain
are seeking death (Caspari's Beitrge zu Jes. p. 53). But it is also
syntactically admissible to interpret the words rendered "seekers of
death" as gen.; for such interruptions of the st. constr., as here by
נדּף \[fleeting\], frequently occur, e.g., [Isa
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#001); [Isa
32:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#013); [Ch1
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#013); and that an idea, in spite of
such interruption, may be thought of as gen., is seen from the Arab.

(Note: Vid., Friedr. Philippi's Status constructus, p. 17, Anm. 3; and
cf. therewith such constructions as (Arab.) mân'u faḍlah âlmanhtâji,
i.e., a refuser of the needy, his beneficence = one who denies to the
needy his beneficence.)

But the text is unsettled. Symmachus, Syr., Targ., the Venet., and
Luther render the phrase מבקשׁי \[seekers\]; but the lxx and Jerome read
מוקשׁי \[snares\] (cf. [Ti1 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#009)); this
word Rashi also had before him (vid., Norzi), and Kennicott found it in
several Codd. Bertheau prefers it, for he translates: ...is fleeting
breath, snares of death; Ewald and Hitzig go further, for, after the
lxx, they change the whole proverb into: מות (בּמוקשׁי) הבל רדף
אל־מוקשׁי, with פּעל in the first line. But διώκει of the lxx is an
incorrect rendering of נדף, which the smuggling in of the ἐπὶ (παγίδας
θανάτου) drew after it, without our concluding therefrom that אל־מוקשׁי,
or למוקשׁי (Lagarde), lay before the translators; on the contrary, the
word which (Cappellus) lay before them, מוקשׁי, certainly deserves to be
preferred to מבקשׁי: the possession is first, in view of him who has
gotten it, compared to a fleeting (נדּף, as [Isa
42:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#002)) breath (cf. e.g., smoke, [Psa
68:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#003)), and then, in view of the
inheritance itself and its consequences, is compared to the snares of
death ([Pro 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#014); [Pro
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#027)); for in פּעל (here equivalent
to עשׂות, acquisitio, [Gen 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#001); [Deu
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#017)) lie together the ideas of him
who procures and of the thing that is procured or effected (vid., at
[Pro 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#011)).

[Proverbs 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 21:7</span></span>

7 The violence of the godless teareth them away,

For they have refused to do what is right.

The destruction which they prepare for others teareth or draggeth them
away to destruction, by which wicked conduct brings punishment on
itself; their own conduct is its own executioner (cf. [Pro
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#019)); for refusing to practise what
is right, they have pronounced judgment against themselves, and fallen
under condemnation. Rightly Jerome, detrahent, with Aquila, κατασπάσει =
j'gurrem (as [Hab 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#015)), from גּרר; on
the contrary, the lxx incorrectly, ἐπιξενωθήσεται, from גוּר, to dwell,
to live as a guest; and the Venet., as Luther, in opposition to the usus
loq.: δεδίξεται (fut. of δεδίσσεσθαι, to terrify), from גוּר, to dread,
fear, which also remains intrans., with the accus. following, [Deu
32:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#027). The Syr. and the Targ. freely:
robbery (Targ. רבּוּנא, perhaps in the sense of usury) will seize them,
viz., in the way of punishment. In Arab. jarr (jariyratn) means directly
to commit a crime; not, as Schultens explains, admittere crimen paenam
trahens, but attrahere (arripere), like (Arab.) jany (jinâytn),
contrahere crimen; for there the crime is thought of as violent
usurpation, here as wicked accumulation.

[Proverbs 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 21:8</span></span>

8 Winding is the way of a man laden with guilt;

But the pure - his conduct is right.

Rightly the accentuation places together "the way of a man" as subject,
and "winding" as predicate: if the poet had wished to say (Schultens,
Bertheau) "one crooked in his way" (quoad viam), he would have contented
himself with the phrase נחפּך דּרך. But, on the other hand, the
accentuation is scarcely correct (the second Munach is a transformed
Mugrash), for it interprets וזר as a second pred.; but וזר is adj. to
אישׁ. As הפכפּך (synon. פּתלתּל, עקלקל) is a hapax leg., so also vazar,
which is equivalent to (Arab.) mawzwr, crimine onustus, from wazria,
crimen committere, properly to charge oneself with a crime. The ancient
interpreters have, indeed, no apprehension of this meaning before them;
the lxx obtain from the proverb a thought reminding us of [Psa
18:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#027), in which vazar does not at all
appear; the Syr. and Targ. translate as if the vav of vazar introduces
the conclusion: he is a barbarian (nuchrojo); Luther: he is crooked;
Jerome also sets aside the syntax: perversa via viri aliena est; but,
syntactically admissible, the Venet. and Kimchi, as the Jewish
interpreters generally, διαστροφωτάτη ὁδὸς ἀνδρὸς καὶ ἀλλόκοτος.
Fleischer here even renounces the help of the Arab., for he translates:
Tortuosa est via viri criminibus onusti, qui autem sancte vivit, is
recte facit; but he adds thereto the remark that "vazar thus explained,
with Cappellus, Schultens, and Gesenius, would, it is true,
corresponding to the Arab. wazar, have first the abstract meaning of a
verbal noun from wazira;

(Note: The n. act formed from wazara is wazr, wizr, wizat. These three
forms would correspond to the Heb. vězěr, vēzěr, and zěrěth (z'rāh, cf.
rěděth, r'dah, [Gen 46:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#003)).)

the old explanation is therefore perhaps better: tortuosa est via viri
et deflectens (scil. a recta linea, thus devia est), when the 'viri' is
to be taken in the general sense of 'many, this and that one;' the
closer definition is reflected from the זך of the second clause." But
(1) זר as an adj. signifies peregrinus; one ought thus rather to expect
סר, degenerated, corrupt, although that also does not rightly accord;
(2) the verbal noun also, e.g., 'all, passes over into a subst. and adj.
signification (the latter without distinction of number and gender); (3)
וזר, after its adj. signification, is related to (Arab.) wazyr, as חכם
is to ḥakym, רזב to rahyb; it is of the same form as ענו, with which it
has in common its derivation from a root of similar meaning, and its
ethical signification. In 8b, וזך is rightly accented as subj. of the
complex pred. זך is the pure in heart and of a good conscience. The
laden with guilt (guilty) strikes out all kinds of crooked ways; but the
pure needs not stealthy ways, he does not stand under the pressure of
the bondage of sin, the ban of the guilt of sin; his conduct is
straightforward, directed by the will of God, and not by cunning policy.
Schultens: Integer vitae scelerisque purus non habet cur vacillet, cur
titubet, cur sese contorqueat. The choice of the designation וזך \[and
the pure\] may be occasioned by וזר (Hitzig); the expression 8b reminds
us of [Pro 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#011).

[Proverbs 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 21:9</span></span>

The group now following extends to [Pro
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#018), where a new one begins with a
variation of its initial verse.

9 Better to sit on the pinnacle of a house-roof,

Than a contentious wife and a house in common.

We have neither to supplement the second line: than with a contentious
wife... (Symmachus, Theodotion, Jerome, Luther), nor: than that one have
a contentious...; but the meaning is, that sitting on the roof-top
better befits one, does better than a quarrelsome wife and a common
house (rightly the Targ. and Venet.), i.e., in a common house; for the
connecting together of the wife and the house by vav is a Semitic
hendiadys, a juxtaposition of two ideas which our language would place
in a relation of subordination (Fleischer). This hendiadys would,
indeed, be scarcely possible if the idea of the married wife were
attached to אושׁת; for that such an one has with her husband a "house of
companionship, i.e., a common house," is self-evident. But may it not
with equal right be understood of the imperious positive mother-in-law
of a widower, a splenetic shrewish aunt, a sickly female neighbour
disputing with all the world, and the like? A man must live together
with his wife in so far as he does not divorce her; he must then escape
from her; but a man may also be constrained by circumstances to live in
a house with a quarrelsome mother-in-law, and such an one may, even
during the life of his wife, and in spite of her affection, make his
life so bitter that he would rather, in order that he might have rest,
sit on the pinnacle or ridge of a house-roof. פּנּהּ is the battlement
([Zep 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#016)) of the roof, the edge of
the roof, or its summit; he who sits there does so not without danger,
and is exposed to the storm, but that in contrast with the alternative
is even to be preferred; he sits alone. Regarding the Chethı̂b מדינים,
Kerı̂ מדינים, vid., at [Pro 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#014); and
cf. the figures of the "continual dropping" for the continual scolding
of such a wife, embittering the life of her husband, [Pro
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#013).

[Proverbs 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 21:10</span></span>

10 The soul of the godless hath its desire after evil;

His neighbour findeth no mercy in his eyes.

The interchange of perf. and fut. cannot be without intention. Lwenstein
renders the former as perf. hypotheticum: if the soul of the wicked
desires anything evil...; but the רשׁע wishes evil not merely now and
then, but that is in general his nature and tendency. The perf.
expresses that which is actually the case: the soul of the wicked has
its desire directed (write אוּתה with Munach, after Codd. and old Ed.,
not with Makkeph) toward evil, and the fut. expresses that which
proceeds from this: he who stands near him is not spared. יחן is, as at
[Isa 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#010), Hoph. of חנן, to incline,
viz., oneself, compassionately toward any one, or to bend to him. But in
what sense is בּעיניו added? It does not mean, as frequently, e.g., [Pro
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#002), according to his judgment, nor,
as at [Pro 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#008); [Pro
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#013) : with his eyes, but is to be
understood after the phrase מצא חן בּעיני: his neighbour finds no mercy
in his eyes, so that in these words the sympathy ruling within him
expresses itself: "his eyes will not spare his friends," vid., [Isa
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#018).

[Proverbs 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 21:11</span></span>

11 When the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise;

And when insight is imparted to a wise man, he receives knowledge.

The thought is the same as at [Pro
19:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#025). The mocker at religion and
virtue is incorrigible, punishment avails him nothing, but yet it is not
lost; for as a warning example it teaches the simple, who might
otherwise be easily drawn into the same frivolity. On the other hand,
the wise man needs no punishment, but only strengthening and
furtherance: if "instruction" is imparted to him, he embraces it, makes
it his own דּעת; for, being accessible to better insight, he gains more
and more knowledge. De Dieu, Bertheau, and Zckler make "the simple" the
subject also in 11b: and if a wise man prospers, he (the simple) gains
knowledge. But השׂכּיל ל, used thus impersonally, is unheard of;
wherefore Hitzig erases the ל before חכם erofeb ל eh: if a wise man has
prosperity. But השׂכיל does not properly mean to have prosperity, but
only mediately: to act with insight, and on that account with success.
The thought that the simple, on the one side, by the merited punishment
of the mocker; on the other, by the intelligent prosperous conduct of
the wise, comes to reflection, to reason, may indeed be entertained, but
the traditional form of the proverb does not need any correction.
השׂכּיל may be used not only transitively: to gain insight, [Gen
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#006); [Psa
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#010), and elsewhere, but also
causatively: to make intelligent, with the accus. following, [Pro
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#023); [Psa
32:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#008), or: to offer, present insight,
as here with the dat.-obj. following (cf. [Pro
17:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#026)). Instead of בּענשׁ־, the Kametz
of which is false, Codd. and good Edd. have, rightly, בּענשׁ־. Hitzig,
making "the wise" the subject to בהשׂכיל (and accordingly "the scorner"
would be the subject in 11a), as a correct consequence reads בּענשׁ =
בּהענשׁ. For us, with that first correction, this second one also fails.
"Both infinitivi constr.," Fleischer remarks, "are to be taken
passively; for the Semitic infin., even of transitive form, as it has no
designation of gender, time, and person, is an indeterminate modus, even
in regard to the generis verbi (Act. and Pass.)."

(Note: The Arab. National Grammarians, it is true, view the matter
otherwise. When ḳatlu zydn, the putting to death of Zeid, is used in the
sense of Zeid's becoming dead, according to their view the fâ'l (the
gen. subjecti) is omitted; the full expression would be ḳatlu 'amrn
zaydnâ. Since now 'amrn is omitted, zaydn has in the gen. form taken the
place of the fâ'l, but this gen. is the representative of the acc.
objecti. Without thus going round about, we say: it is the gen.
objecti.)

To this proverb with u-behaskil there is connected the one that follows,
beginning with maskil.

[Proverbs 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 21:12</span></span>

12 A righteous One marketh the house of the godless;

He hurleth the godless to destruction.

If we understand by the word צדּיק a righteous man, then 12a would
introduce the warning which he gives, and the unexpressed subject of 12b
must be God (Umbreit). But after such an introitus, יהוה ought not to be
wanting. If in 12a "the righteous man" is the subject, then it presents
itself as such also for the second parallel part. But the thought that
the righteous, when he takes notice of the house of the godless, shows
attention which of itself hurls the godless into destruction
(Lwenstein), would require the sing. רשׁע in the conclusion; also,
instead of מסלּף the fut. יסלּף would have been found; and besides, the
judicial סלּף (vid., regarding this word at [Pro
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#003); [Pro
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#003)) would not be a suitable word for
this confirmation in evil. Thus by צדיק the proverb means God, and מסלף
has, as at [Pro 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#012), [Job
12:19](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#019), this word as its subject. "A
righteous One" refers to the All-righteous, who is called, [Job
34:17](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#017), "the All-just One," and by
Rashi, under the passage before us, צדּיקו שׁל־עולם. Only do not
translate with Bertheau and Zckler: the Righteous One (All-righteous),
for (1) this would require הצּדּיק, and (2) הצדיק is never by itself
used as an attributive designation of God. Rightly, Fleischer and Ewald:
a Righteous One, viz., God. It is the indetermination which seeks to
present the idea of the great and dreadful: a Righteous One, and such a
Righteous One!

(Note: The Arabs call this indetermination âlnkrt lalt'ẓym wallthwyl.
Vid., under [Psa 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#012).)

השׂכיל with על, [Pro 16:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#020), or אל,
[Psa 41:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#002); [Neh
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#013), here with ל, signifies to give
attention to anything, to look attentively on it. The two participles
stand in the same line: animum advertit ... evertit. Hitzig changes
לבּית רשׁע into לבּיתו, and makes רשׁע the subject of 12b; but the
proverb as it lies before us is far more intelligible.

[Proverbs 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 21:13</span></span>

13 He that stoppeth his ear at the cry of the poor

he also calls and is not heard.

Only the merciful find mercy, [Mat
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#007); the unmerciful rich man, who has
no ear for the cry of the דל, i.e., of him who is without support and
means of subsistence, thus of one who is needing support, will also
remain unheard when he himself, in the time of need, calls upon God for
help. Cf. the parable of the unmerciful servant of the merciful king,
[Mat 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#023). מן in מזּעקת, as [Isa
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#015); [Gen
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#013); [Gen
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#001); no preposition of our \[German\]
language \[nor English\] expresses, as Fleischer here remarks, such a
fulness of meaning as this מן does, to which, after a verb of shutting
up such as אטם (cf. [Pro 17:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#028)), the
Arab. 'n would correspond, e.g., â'my 'n âltryḳ: blind, so that he does
not see the way.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 21:14</span></span>

14 A gift in secret turneth away anger;

And a bribe into the bosom violent wrath.

Hitzig reads with Symmachus, the Targ., and Jerome, יכבּה, and
translates: "extinguishes anger;" but it does not follow that they did
read יכבה; for the Talm. Heb. כּפה signifies to cover by turning over,
e.g., of a vessel, Sanhedrin 77a, which, when it is done to a candle or
a fire, may mean its extinction. But כפה of the post-bibl. Heb. also
means to bend, and thence to force out (Aram. כּפא, כּפי), according to
which Kimchi hesitates whether to explain: overturns = smothers, or:
bends = forces down anger. The Venet. follows the latter signification:
κάμψει (for Villoison's καλύψει rests on a false reading of the MS). But
there is yet possible another derivation from the primary signification,
curvare, flectere, vertere, according to which the lxx translates
ἀνατρέπει, for which ἀποτρέπει would be yet better: כפה, to bend away,
to turn off, ἀρκεῖν, arcere, altogether like the Arab. (compared by
Schultens) kfâ, and kfy, ἀρκεῖν, to prevent, whence, e.g., ikfı̂ni hada:
hold that away from me, or: spare me that (Fleischer); with the words
hafı̂ka sharran (Lat. defendaris semper a malo) princes were anciently
saluted; kfy signifies "to suffice," because enough is there, where
there is a keeping off of want. Accordingly we translate: Donum clam
acceptum avertit iram, which also the Syr. meant by mephadka (מפרק).
This verb is naturally to be supplied to 14b, which the lxx has
recognised (it translates: but he who spares gifts, excites violent
anger). Regarding שׂחד, vid., at [Pro
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#008); and regarding בּחק, at [Pro
17:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#023). Also here חק (חיק = חיק), like
Arab. jayb, 'ubb, חב, denotes the bosom of the garment; on the contrary
(Arab.) hijr, hiḍn, חצן, is more used of that of the body, or that
formed by the drawing together of the body (e.g., of the arm in carrying
a child). A present is meant which one brings with him concealed in his
bosom; perhaps 13b called to mind the judge that took gifts, [Exo
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#008) (Hitzig).

[Proverbs 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 21:15</span></span>

15 It is a joy to the just to do justice,

And a terror for them that work iniquity.

To act according to the law of rectitude is to these as unto death;
injustice has become to them a second nature, so that their heart
strives against rectitude of conduct; it also enters to little into
their plan of life, and their economy, that they are afraid of ruining
themselves thereby. So we believe, with Hitzig, Elster, Zckler, and
Luther, this must be explained in accordance with our interpretation of
[Pro 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#029). Fleischer and others
supplement the second parallel member from the first: וּפעל און מחתּה
לפעלי אין; others render 15b as an independent sentence: ruin falls on
those who act wickedly. But that ellipsis is hard and scarcely possible;
but in general מחתה, as contrasted correlate to שׂמחה, can scarcely have
the pure objective sense of ruin or destruction. It must mean a
revolution in the heart. Right-doing is to the righteous a pleasure (cf.
[Pro 10:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#023)); and for those who have
און, and are devoid of moral worth, and thus simply immoral as to the
aim and sphere of their conduct, right-doing is something which alarms
them: when they act in conformity with what is right, they do so after
an external impulse only against their will, as if it were death to
them.

[Proverbs 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 21:16</span></span>

16 A man who wanders from the way of understanding,

Shall dwell in the assembly of the dead.

Regarding השׂכּל, vid., [Pro 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#003); and
regarding רפאים, [Pro 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#018). The verb
נוּח means to repose, to take rest, [Job
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#013), and to dwell anywhere, [Pro
14:33](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#033); but originally like (Arab.)
nâkh and hadd, to lay oneself down anywhere, and there to come to rest;
and that is the idea which is here connected with ינוּח, for the
figurative description of יאבד or ימוּת is formed after the designation
of the subject, 16a: he who, forsaking the way of understanding, walks
in the way of error, at length comes to the assembly of the dead; for
every motion has an end, and every journey a goal, whether it be one
that is self-appointed or which is appointed for him. Here also it is
intimated that the way of the soul which loves wisdom and follows her
goes in another direction than earthwards down into hades; hades and
death, its background appear here as punishments, and it is true that as
such one may escape them.

17 He who loveth pleasure becometh a man of want;

He who loveth wine and oil doth not become rich.

In Arab. samh denotes the joyful action of the "cheerful giver," [Co2
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#007); in Heb. the joyful affection;
here, like farah, pleasure, delight, festival of joy. Jerome: qui
diligit epulas. For feasting is specially thought of, where wine was
drunk, and oil and other fragrant essences were poured (cf. [Pro
27:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#009); [Amo
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#006)) on the head and the clothes. He
who loves such festivals, and is commonly found there, becomes a man of
want, or suffers want (cf. [Jdg 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#002),
אישׁ ריב, a man of strife); such an one does not become rich (העשׁיר,
like [Pro 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#004), = עשׂה עשׁר, [Jer
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#011)); he does not advance, and thus
goes backwards.

[Proverbs 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 21:18</span></span>

18 The godless becometh a ransom for the righteous;

And the faithless cometh into the place of the upright.

The thought is the same as at [Pro
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#008). An example of this is, that the
same world-commotion which brought the nations round Babylon for its
destruction, put an end to Israel's exile: Cyrus, the instrument in
God's hands for inflicting punishment on many heathen nations, was
Israel's liberator, [Isa 43:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#003). Another
example is in the exchange of places by Haman and Mordecai, to which
Rashi refers. כּפר is equivalent to λύτρον, ransom; but it properly
signifies price of atonement, and generally, means of reconciliation,
which covers or atones for the guilt of any one; the poll-tax and
"oblations" also, [Exo 30:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#015)., [Num
31:50](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#050), are placed under this point of
view, as blotting out guilt: if the righteousness of God obtains
satisfaction, it makes its demand against the godless, and lets the
righteous go free; or, as the substantival clause 18b expresses, the
faithless steps into the place of the upright, for the wrath passes by
the latter and falls upon the former. Regarding בּוגד, vid., [Pro
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#022). Thus, in contrast to the ישׁר,
he is designated, who keeps faith neither with God nor man, and with
evil intention enters on deceitful ways - the faithless, the malicious,
the assassin.

[Proverbs 21:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 21:19</span></span>

With this verse, a doublet to [Pro
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#009) ([Pro
25:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#024)), the collector makes a new
addition; in [Pro 21:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#029) he reaches a
proverb which resembles the closing proverb of the preceding group, in
its placing in contrast the רשׁע and ישׁר; -

It is better to dwell in a waste land,

Than a contentious wife and vexation.

The corner of the roof, Hitzig remarks, has been made use of, and the
author must look further out for a lonely seat. But this is as piquant
as it is devoid of thought; for have both proverbs the same author, and
if so, were they coined at the same time? Here also it is unnecessary to
regard מאשׁת as an abbreviation for משּׁבת עם אשׁת. Hitzig supplies
שׁכן, by which אשׁת, as the accus.-obj., is governed; but it is not to
be supplied, for the proverb places as opposite to one another dwelling
in a waste land (read שׁבת בּארץ־מדבּר, with Codd. and correct Ed.) and
a contentious wife (Chethı̂b, מדונים, Kerı̂, מדינים) and vexation, and
says the former is better than the latter. For וכעס \[and vexation\] is
not, as translated by the ancients, and generally received, a second
governed genitive to אשׁת, but dependent on מן, follows "contentious
woman" (cf. 9b): better that than a quarrelsome wife, and at the same
time vexation.

20 Precious treasure and oil are in the dwelling of the wise;

And a fool of a man squanders it.

The wise spares, the fool squanders; and if the latter enters on the
inheritance which the former with trouble and care collected, it is soon
devoured. The combination אוצר נחמד ושׁמן \[desirable treasure and oil\]
has something inconcinnate, wherefore the accentuation places אוצר by
itself by Mehuppach Legarmeh; but it is not to be translated "a treasure
of that which is precious, and oil," since it is punctuated אוצר, and
not אוצר; and besides, in that case מחמדּים would have been used instead
of נחמד. Thus by אוצר נחמד, a desirable and splendid capital in gold and
things of value ([Isa 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#018); [Psa
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#011)); and by שׁמן, mentioned by way
of example, stores in kitchen and cellar are to be thought of, which
serve him who lives luxuriously, and afford noble hospitality, - a fool
of a man (כּסיל אדם, as at [Pro
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#020)), who finds this, devours it,
i.e., quickly goes through it, makes, in short, a tabula rasa of it; cf.
בּלע, [Isa 28:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#004), with בּלּע, [Sa2
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#026), and [Pro
19:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#028). The suffix of יבלּענּוּ refers
back to אוצר as the main idea, or distributively also both to the
treasure and the oil. The lxx (θησαυρὸς ἐπιθυμητὸς) ἀναπαύσεται ἐπὶ
στόματος σοφοῦ, i.e., ישׁכן בפה חכם, according to which Hitzig corrects;
but the fool, he who swallows down "the precious treasure with a wise
mouth," is a being we can scarcely conceive of. His taste is not at all
bad; why then a fool? Is it perhaps because he takes more in than he can
at one time digest? The reading of the lxx is corrected by 20b.

21 He that followeth after righteousness and kindness

Will obtain life, righteousness, and honour.

How we are to render צדקה וחסד is seen from the connection of [Pro
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#003) and [Hos
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#007) : tsedakah is conduct proceeding
from the principle of self-denying and compassionate love, which is the
essence of the law, [Mic 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#008); and
hesed is conduct proceeding from sympathy, which, placing itself in the
room of another, perceives what will benefit him, and sets about doing
it (cf. e.g., [Job 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#014) : to him who
is inwardly melted disheartened חסד is due from his neighbour). The
reward which one who strives thus to act obtains, is designated 21b by
חיּים and כּבוד. Honour and life stand together, [Pro
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#004), when עשׁר precedes, and here
צדקה stands between, which, [Pro 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#018),
[Psa 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#005), is thought of as that which
is distributed as a gift of heaven, [Isa
45:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#008), which has glory in its train,
[Isa 58:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#008); as Paul also says, "Whom He
justified, them He also glorified." The lxx has omitted tsedakah,
because it can easily appear as erroneously repeated from 21a. But in
reality there are three good things which are promised to those who are
zealous in the works of love: a prosperous life, enduring righteousness,
true honour. Life as it proceeds from God, the Living One, righteousness
as it avails the righteous and those doing righteously before God,
honour or glory ([Psa 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#003)) as it is
given ([Psa 84:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#012)) by the God of
glory. Cf. with חיים צדקה, [Pro 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#002),
and with צדקה, especially [Jam 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#013),

22 A wise man scaleth a city of the mighty;

And casteth down the fortress in which they trusted.

[Ecc 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#014). is a side-piece to this,
according to which a single wise man, although poor, may become the
deliverer of a city besieged by a great army, and destitute of the means
of defence. עלה, seq. acc., means to climb up, [Joe
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#007); here, of the scaling of a
fortified town, viz., its fortress. עז is that which makes it עיר עז,
[Isa 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#001) : its armour of protection,
which is designated by the genit. מבטחה, as the object and ground of
their confidence. The vocalization מבטחה, for mibtachcha (cf. [Jer
48:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#013) with [Job
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#014)), follows the rule Gesen. 27,

mappik, Michlol 30b; vid., regarding the various grounds of these formae
raphatae pro mappicatis, Bttcher, 418. If a city is defended by ever so
many valiant men, the wise man knows the point where it may be overcome,
and knows how to organize the assault so as to destroy the proud
fortress. With ויּרד, he brings to ruin, cf. עד רדתּהּ, [Deu

his mouth who does not speak when he does better to be silent; and he
guardeth his tongue who says no more than is right and fitting. The
troubles comprehend both external and internal evils, hurtful incidents
and (נפשׁ) צרות לבב, [Psa 25:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#017); [Psa
31:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#008), i.e., distress of conscience,
self-accusation, sorrow on account of the irreparable evil which one
occasions.

24 A proud and arrogant man is called mocker (free-spirit);

One who acteth in superfluity of haughtiness.

We have thus translated (vol. i. p. 39): the proverb defines almost in a
formal way an idea current from the time of Solomon: לץ (properly, the
distorter, vid., [Pro 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#007)) is an old
word; but as with us in the west since the last century, the names of
free-thinkers and esprits forts (cf. [Isa
46:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#012)) have become current for such as
subject the faith of the Church to destructive criticism, so then they
were called לצים, who mockingly, as men of full age, set themselves
above revealed religion and prophecy ([Isa
28:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#009)); and the above proverb gives the
meaning of this name, for it describes in his moral character such a
man. Thus we call one זד, haughty, and זד יהיר dna ,, i.e., destroying
himself, and thus thoughtlessly haughty, who בּעברת זדון acts in
superfluity or arrogance (vid., at [Pro
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#023)) of haughtiness; for not only
does he inwardly raise himself above all that is worthy of recognition
as true, of faith as certain, of respect as holy; but acting as well as
judging frivolously, he shows reverence for nothing, scornfully passing
sentence against everything. Abulwald (vid., Gesen. Thes.) takes יהיר in
the sense of obstinate; for he compares the Arab. jahr (jahar), which is
equivalent to lijâj, constancy, stubbornness. But in the Targ. and Talm.
(vid., at [Hab 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#005), Levy's Chald.
Wrterb. under יהיר) יהר in all its offshoots and derivations has the
sense of pride; we have then rather to compare the Arab. istaihara, to
be insane (= dhahb 'aḳlh, mens ejus alienata est), perhaps also to
hajjir, mutahawwir, being overthrown, praeceps, so that יהיר denotes one
who by his ὑπερφρονεῖν is carried beyond all σωφρονεῖν (vid., [Rom
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#003)), one who is altogether mad from
pride. The Syr. madocho (Targ. מריחא), by which יהיר (Targ. יהיר) is
rendered here and at [Hab 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#005), is its
synonym; this word also combines in itself the ideas foolhardy, and of
one acting in a presumptuous, mad way; in a word, of one who is
arrogant. Schultens is in the right way; but when he translates by
tumidus mole cava ruens, he puts, as it is his custom to do, too much
into the word; tumidus, puffed up, presents an idea which,
etymologically at least, does not lie in it. The Venet.: ἀκρατὴς θρασὺς
βωμολόχος τοὔνομά οἱ, which may be translated: an untractable reckless
person we call a fool \[homo ineptus\], is not bad.

[Proverbs 21:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">pro 21:25</span></span>

25 The desire of the slothful killeth him;

For his hands refuse to be active.

The desire of the עצל, Hitzig remarks, goes out first after meat and
drink; and when it takes this direction, as hunger, it kills him indeed.
But in this case it is not the desire that kills him, but the
impossibility of satisfying it. The meaning is simply: the inordinate
desire after rest and pleasure kills the slothful; for this always
seeking only enjoyment and idleness brings him at last to ruin. תּאוה
means here, as in Kibroth ha-tava, [Num
11:34](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#034), inordinate longing after
enjoyments. The proverb is connected by almost all interpreters (also
Ewald, Bertheau, Hitzig, Elster, Zckler) as a tetrastich with [Pro
21:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#025) : he (the slothful) always
eagerly desires, but the righteous giveth and spareth not. But (1)
although צדּיק, since it designates one who is faithful to duty, might
be used particularly of the industrious (cf. [Pro
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#019)), yet would there be wanting in
26a ואין, [Pro 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#004), cf. [Pro
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#004), necessary for the formation of
the contrast; (2) this older Book of Proverbs consists of pure distichs;
the only tristich, [Pro 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#007), appears
as the consequence of a mutilation from the lxx. Thus the pretended
tetrastich before us is only apparently such.

[Proverbs 21:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">pro 21:26</span></span>

26 One always desireth eagerly;

But the righteous giveth and holdeth not back.

Otherwise Fleischer: per totum diem avet avidus, i.e., avarus; but that
in התאוּה תּאוה the verb is connected with its inner obj. is manifest
from [Num 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#004); it is the mode of
expression which is called in the Greek syntax schema etymologicum, and
which is also possible without an adj. joined to the obj., as in the
ὕβριν θ ̓ ὑβρίζεις (Eurip. Herc. fur. 706), the Arab. mârâhu miryatn: he
had a strife with him. Euchel impossibly: necessities will continually
be appeased, which would have required תּתאוּה or מתאוּה. The
explanation also cannot be: each day presents its special demand, for
כּל־היּום does not mean each day, but the whole day, i.e., continually.
Thus we render התאוה with the most general subject (in which case the
national grammarians supply המּתאוּה): continually one longs longing,
i.e., there are demands, solicitations, wishes, importunate petitions;
but still the righteous is not embarrassed in his generosity, he gives
as unceasingly (cf. [Isa 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#006); [Isa
58:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#001)) as one asks. Thus the perf. is
explained, which is related hypothetically to the fut. following: though
one, etc.

[Proverbs 21:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 21:27</span></span>

27 The sacrifice of the godless is an abomination;

How much more if it is brought for evil!

Line first = [Pro 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#008). Regarding the
syllogistic אף כּי, vid., 12:31; [Pro
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#011); regarding זמּה, crime,
particularly the sin of lewdness (from זמם, to press together, to
collect the thoughts upon something, to contrive, cf. raffinement de la
volupt), at [Pro 10:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#023). בּזמּה is too
vaguely rendered in the lxx by παρονόμως, falsely by Jerome, ex scelere
(cf. ἐξ ἀδίκου, Sir. 31:18, with [Mal
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#013)). The ב is not meant, as at [Eze
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#011), of the way and manner; for that
the condition of life of the רשׁע is not a pure one, is not to be
supposed. It is as Hitzig, rightly, that of price: for a transgression,
i.e., to atone for it; one is hereby reminded, that he who had
intercourse with a betrothed bondmaid had to present an ascham
\[trespass-offering\], [Lev 19:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#020).
But frequently enough would it occur that rich sensualists brought
trespass-offerings, and other offerings, in order thereby to recompense
for their transgressions, and to purchase for themselves the connivance
of God for their dissolute life. Such offerings of the godless, the
proverb means, are to God a twofold and a threefold abomination; for in
this case not only does the godless fail in respect of repentance and a
desire after salvation, which are the conditions of all sacrifices
acceptable to God, but he makes God directly a minister of sin.

[Proverbs 21:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">pro 21:28</span></span>

28 A false witness shall perish;

But he who heareth shall always speak truth.

The lxx translate 28b by ἀνὴρ δὲ φυλασσόμενος λαλήσει. Cappellus
supposes that they read לנצר for לנצה, which, however, cannot mean
"taking care." Hitzig further imagines שׂמח for שׁמע, and brings out the
meaning: "the man that rejoiceth to deliver shall speak." But where in
all the world does נצר mean "to deliver"? It means, "to guard,
preserve;" and to reach the meaning of "to deliver," a clause must be
added with מן, as מרע. When one who speaks lies (עד כּזבים), and a man
who hears (אישׁ שּׁומע, plene, and with the orthophonic Dagesh), are
contrasted, the former is one who fancifully or malevolently falsifies
the fact, and the latter is one who before he speaks hears in order that
he may say nothing that he has not surely heard. As לב שׁמע, [Kg1
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#009), means an obedient heart, so here
אישׁ שּׁומע means a man who attentively hears, carefully proves. Such an
one will speak לנצח, i.e., not: according to the truth, and not: for
victory (Aquila, Symmachus, Theodotion, εἰς νῖκος), i.e., so that
accomplishes it (Oetinger); for the Heb. נצח has neither that Arab. nor
this Aram. signification; but, with the transference of the root meaning
of radiating or streaming over, to time, continuous existence (vid.,
Orelli, Synonyma der Zeit und Ewigkeit, pp. 96-97), thus: he will speak
for continuance, i.e., either: without ever requiring to be silent, or,
which we prefer: so that what he says stands; on the contrary, he who
testifies mere fictions, i.e., avers that they are truth, is destroyed
(28a = [Pro 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#009), cf. 5): he himself
comes to nothing, since his testimonies are referred to their
groundlessness and falsity; for שׁקר אין לו רגלים, the lie has no feet
on which it can stand, it comes to nothing sooner or later.

[Proverbs 21:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">pro 21:29</span></span>

Another proverb with אישׁ: -

A godless man showeth boldness in his mien;

But one that is upright-he proveth his way.

The Chethı̂b has יכין; but that the upright directeth, dirigit, his way,
i.e., gives to it the right direction (cf. [Ch2
27:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#006)), is not a good contrast to the
boldness of the godless; the Kerı̂, הבין דּרכּו, deserves the preference.
Aquila, Symmachus, the Syr., Targ., and Venet. adhere to the Chethı̂b,
which would be suitable if it could be translated, with Jerome, by
corrigit; Luther also reads the verb with כ, but as if it were יכּון
(whoever is pious, his way will stand) - only the lxx render the Kerı̂
(συνιεῖ); as for the rest, the ancients waver between the Chethı̂b דּרכיו
and the Kerı̂ דּרכּו: the former refers to manner of life in general; the
latter (as at [Pro 3:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#031) and elsewhere)
to the conduct in separate cases; thus the one is just as appropriate as
the other. In the circumstantial designation אישׁ רשׁע (cf. [Pro
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#007)) we have the stamp of the
distinction of different classes of men peculiar to the Book of
Proverbs. העז (to make firm, defiant) had, [Pro
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#013), פנים as accus.; the בּ here is
not that used in metaphoristic expressions instead of the accus. obj.,
which we have spoken of at [Pro 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#004);
[Pro 20:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#030), but that of the means; for
the face is thought of, not as the object of the action, but, after
Gesen. 138, 1, as the means of its accomplishment: the godless makes
(shows) firmness, i.e., defiance, accessibility to no admonition, which
is countenance; but the upright considers, i.e., proves ([Pro
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#008)), his way. בּין (הבין) means a
perceiving of the object in its specific peculiarity, an understanding
of its constituent parts and essential marks; it denotes knowing an
event analytically, as השׂכּיל, as well as synthetically (cf. Arab.
shakl), and is thus used as the expression of a perception, which
apprehends the object not merely immediately, but closely examines into
its circumstances.

[Proverbs 21:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">pro 21:30</span></span>

If we further seek for the boundaries, the proverbs regarding the rich
and the poor, [Pro 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#002), [Pro
22:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#007), [Pro
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#016), present themselves as such, and
this the more surely as [Pro 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#016) is
without contradiction the terminus. Thus we take first together
21:30-22:2.

[Pro 21:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#030)

30 No wisdom and no understanding,

And no counsel is there against Jahve.

The expression might also be 'לפני ה; but the predominating sense would
then be, that no wisdom appears to God as such, that He values none as
such. With לנגד the proverb is more objective: there is no wisdom which,
compared with His, can be regarded as such (cf. [Co1
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#019)), none which can boast itself
against Him, or can at all avail against Him (לנגד, as [Dan
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#012); Neh. 3:37); whence it follows
(as [Job 28:28](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#028)) that the wisdom of man
consists in the fear of God the Alone-wise, or, which is the same thing,
the All-wise. Immanuel interprets חכמה of theology, תּבוּנה of worldly
science, עצה of politics; but חכמה is used of the knowledge of truth,
i.e., of that which truly is and continues; תבונה of criticism, and עצה
of system and method; vid., at [Pro
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#002); [Pro
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#014), from which latter passage the
lxx has substituted here גבורה instead of תבונה. Instead of 'לנגד ה it
translates πρὸς τὸν ἀσεβῆ, i.e., for that which is 'נגד ה against Jahve.

[Pro 21:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#031)

31 The horse is harnessed for the day of battle;

But with Jahve is the victory,

i.e., it remains with Him to give the victory or not, for the horse is a
vain means of victory, [Isa 33:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#017); the
battle is the Lord's, [Sa1 17:47](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#047),
i.e., it depends on Him how the battle shall issue; and king and people
who have taken up arms in defence of their rights have thus to trust
nothing in the multitude of their war-horses (סוּס, horses, including
their riders), and generally in their preparations for the battle, but
in the Lord (cf. [Psa 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#008), and, on
the contrary, [Isa 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#001)). The lxx
translates התּשׁוּעה by ἡ βοήθεια, as if the Arab. name of victory,
naṣr, proceeding from this fundamental meaning, stood in the text;
תשׁועה (from ישׁע, Arab. ws', to be wide, to have free space for motion)
signifies properly prosperity, as the contrast of distress, oppression,
slavery, and victory (cf. e.g., [Psa
144:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#010), and ישׁוּעה, [Sa1
14:45](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#045)). The post-bibl. Heb. uses נצח
(נצּחון) for victory; but the O.T. Heb. has no word more fully covering
this idea than תשׁועה (ישׁועה).

(Note: In the old High German, the word for war is urlag (urlac), fate,
because the issue is the divine determination, and nt (as in "der
Nibelunge Not"), as binding, confining, restraint; this nt is the
correlate to תשׁועה, victory; מלחמה corresponds most to the French
guerre, which is not of Romanic, but of German origin: the Werre, i.e.,
the Gewirre \[complication, confusion\], for נלחם signifies to press
against one another, to be engaged in close conflict; cf. the Homeric
κλόνος of the turmoil of battle.)
