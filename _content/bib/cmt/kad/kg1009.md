### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#001)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 9:1</span></span>

The Answer of the Lord to Solomon's Dedicatory Prayer (cf. [Ch2
7:11-22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#011)). - [Kg1
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#001), [Kg1
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#002). When Solomon had finished the
building of the temple, and of his palace, and of all that he had a
desire to build, the Lord appeared to him the second time, as He had
appeared to him at Gibeon, i.e., by night in a dream (see [Kg1
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#005)), to promise him that his prayer
should be answered. For the point of time, see at [Kg1
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#001). כּל־חשׁק, all Solomon's desire or
pleasures, is paraphrased thus in the Chronicles: לב על כּל־הבּא, "all
that came into his mind," and, in accordance with the context, is very
properly restricted to these two principal buildings by the clause, "in
the house of Jehovah and in his own house."

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg1 9:3</span></span>

The divine promise to Solomon, that his prayer should be answered, is
closely connected with the substance of the prayer; but in our account
we have only a brief summary, whereas in the Chronicles it is given more
elaborately (vid., [Ch2 7:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#012)). "I
have sanctified this house which thou hast built, to put my name there."
For the expression, see [Deu 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#011).
The sanctifying consisted in the fact, that Jehovah put His name in the
temple; i.e., that by filling the temple with the cloud which visibly
displayed His presence, He consecrated it as the scene of the
manifestation of His grace. To Solomon's prayer, "May Thine eyes stand
open over this house" ([Kg1 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#029)), the
Lord replies, giving always more than we ask, "My eyes and my heart
shall be there perpetually."

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg1 9:4</span></span>

[Kg1 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#004), [Kg1
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#005) contain the special answer to [Kg1
8:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#025), [Kg1
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#026). - [Kg1
9:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#006) refer to the prayer for the
turning away of the curse, to which the Lord replies: If ye and your
children turn away from me, and do not keep my commandments, but worship
other gods, this house will not protect you from the curses threatened
in the law, but they will be fulfilled in all their terrible force upon
you and upon this temple. This threat follows the Pentateuch exactly in
the words in which it is expressed; [Kg1
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#007) being founded upon [Deu
28:37](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#037), [Deu
28:45](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#045), [Deu
28:63](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#063), and the curse pronounced upon
Israel in [Deu 29:23-26](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#023) being
transferred to the temple in [Kg1 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#008),
[Kg1 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#009). - פּני מעל שׁלּח, to
dismiss, i.e., to reject from before my face. "This house will be
עליון," i.e., will stand high, or through its rejection will be a lofty
example for all that pass by. The temple stood upon a high mountain, so
that its ruins could not fail to attract the attention of all who went
past. The expression עליון is selected with an implied allusion to [Deu
26:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#019) and [Deu
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#001). God there promises to make
Israel עליון, high, exalted above all nations. This blessing will be
turned into a curse. The temple, which was high and widely renowned,
shall continue to be high, but in the opposite sense, as an example of
the rejection of Israel from the presence of God.

(Note: The conjecture of Bttcher, Thenius, and Bertheau, that עליון
should be altered into עיּים, has no support in [Mic
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#012); [Jer
26:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#018), and [Psa
79:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#001), and has all the ancient versions
against it; for they all contain the Masoretic text, either in a verbal
translation (lxx), or in a paraphrase, as for example the Chaldee, "the
house that was high shall be destroyed;" the Syriac and Arabic, "this
house will be destroyed;" and the Vulgate, domus haec erit in exemplum.
- In [Ch2 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#021) the thought is somewhat
varied by the alteration of יהיה into היה אשׁר. For it would never enter
the mind of any sober critic to attribute this variation to a
misinterpretation of our text. Still less can it be an unsuccessful
attempt to explain or rectify our text, as Bttcher imagines, since the
assertion of this critic, that עליון is only used to signify an exalted
position, and never the exaltation of dignity or worth, is proved to be
erroneous by [Deu 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#019) and [Deu
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#001).)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg1 9:10</span></span>

The Means by which the Buildings were Erected. - In order that all which
still remained to be said concerning Solomon's buildings might be
grouped together, different notices are introduced here, namely, as to
his relation to Hiram, the erection of several fortresses, and the
tributary labour, and also as to his maritime expeditions; and these
heterogeneous materials are so arranged as to indicate the resources
which enabled Solomon to erect so many and such magnificent buildings.
These resources were: (1) his connection with king Hiram, who furnished
him with building materials ([Kg1
9:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#010)); (2) the tributary labour
which he raised in his kingdom ([Kg1
9:15-25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#015)); (3) the maritime expedition
to Ophir, which brought him great wealth ([Kg1
9:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#026)). But these notices are very
condensed, and, as a comparison with the parallel account in 2 Chron 8
shows, are simply incomplete extracts from a more elaborate history. In
the account of the tributary labour, the enumeration of the cities
finished and fortified ([Kg1 9:15-19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#015))
is interpolated; and the information concerning the support which was
rendered to Solomon in the erection of his buildings by Hiram ([Kg1
9:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#011)), is merely supplementary to
the account already given in [Kg1 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#005).
[Kg1 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#024), [Kg1
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#025) point still more clearly to an
earlier account, since they would be otherwise unintelligible. - In 2
Chron 8 the arrangement is a simpler one: the buildings are first of all
enumerated in [Ch2 8:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#001), and the
account of the tributary labour follows in [Ch2
8:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#007).

[Kg1 9:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#010)

The notices concerning Solomon's connection with Hiram are very
imperfect; for [Kg1 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#014) does not
furnish a conclusion either in form or substance. The notice in 2 Chron
8; 1:1-2:18 is still shorter, but it supplies an important addition to
the account before us.

[Kg1 9:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#010)

[Kg1 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#010), [Kg1
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#011) form one period. יתּן אז (then he
gave) in [Kg1 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#011) introduces the
apodosis to מק ויהי (and it came to pass, etc.) in [Kg1
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#010); and [Kg1
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#011) contains a circumstantial clause
inserted as a parenthesis. Hiram had supported Solomon according to his
desire with cedar wood and cypress wood, and with gold; and Solomon gave
him in return, after his buildings were completed, twenty cities in the
land of Galil. But these cities did not please Hiram. When he went out
to see them, he said, "What kind of cities are these (מה in a
contemptuous sense) which thou hast given me, my brother?" אחו as in
[Kg1 20:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#032), 1 Macc. 10:18; 11:30, 2
Macc. 11:22, as a conventional expression used by princes in their
intercourse with one another. "And he called the land Cabul unto this
day;" i.e., it retained this name even to later times. The land of Galil
is a part of the country which was afterwards known as Galilaea, namely,
the northern portion of it, as is evident from the fact that in [Jos
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#007); [Jos
21:32](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#032), Kedes in the mountains of
Naphtali, to the north-west of Lake Huleh, is distinguished from the
kadesh in southern Palestine by the epithet בּגּליל. It is still more
evident from [Kg2 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029) and [Isa
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#001) and Galil embraced the northern
part of the tribe of Naphtali; whilst the expression used by Isaiah,
הגּוים גּליל, also shows that this district was for the most part
inhabited by heathen (i.e., non-Israelites). The twenty cities in Galil,
which Solomon gave to Hiram, certainly belonged therefore to the cities
of the Canaanites mentioned in [Sa2
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#007); that is to say, they were cities
occupied chiefly by a heathen population, and in all probability they
were in a very bad condition. Consequently they did not please Hiram,
and he gave to the district the contemptuous name of the land of Cabul.
Of the various interpretations given to the word Cabul (see Ges. Thes.
p. 656), the one proposed by Hiller (Onomast. p. 435), and adopted by
Reland, Ges., Maurer, and others, viz., that it is a contraction of
כּהבּוּל, sicut id quod evanuit tanquam nihil, has the most to support
it, since this is the meaning required by the context. At the same time
it is possible, and even probable, that it had originally a different
signification, and is derived from כּבל = חבל in the sense of to pawn,
as Gesenius and Dietrich suppose. This is favoured by the occurrence of
the name Cabul in [Jos 19:27](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#027), where it
is probably derivable from כּבל, to fetter, and signifies literally a
fortress or castle; but in this instance it has no connection with the
land of Cabul, since it is still preserved in the village of Cabul to
the south-east of Acre (see the Comm. on Josh. l.c.). The "land of
Cabul" would therefore mean the pawned land; and in the mouths of the
people this would be twisted into "good for nothing." In this case
ויּקרא would have to be taken impersonally: "they called;" and the
notice respecting this name would be simply an explanation of the way in
which the people interpreted it. Hiram, however, did not retain this
district, but gave it back to Solomon, who then completed the cities
([Ch2 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#002)).

(Note: This simple method of reconciling the account before us with the
apparently discrepant notice in the Chronicles, concerning which even
Movers (die biblische Chronik, p. 159) observes, that the chronicler
interpolated it from a second (?) source, is so natural, that it is
difficult to conceive how Bertheau can object to it; since he admits
that the accounts in the books of Kings and Chronicles are incomplete
extracts from common and more elaborate sources.)

The only way in which we can give to [Kg1
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#014) a meaning in harmony with the
context, is by taking it as a supplementary explanation of
וּבזּהב...נשּׂא...חירם in [Kg1 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#011),
and so rendering ויּשׁלח as a pluperfect, as in [Kg1
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#013) : "Hiram had sent the king a
hundred and twenty talents of gold." If we reckon the value of gold as
being ten times the worth of silver, a hundred and twenty talents of
gold would be 3,141, 600 thalers (about 471,240: Tr.). This is no doubt
to be regarded as a loan, which Solomon obtained from Hiram to enable
him to complete his buildings. Although David may have collected
together the requisite amount of precious metals for the building of the
temple, and Solomon had also very considerable yearly revenues, derived
partly from tribute paid by subjugated nations and partly from trade,
his buildings were so extensive, inasmuch as he erected a large number
of cities beside the temple and his splendid palace ([Kg1
9:15-19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#015)), that his revenues might not
suffice for the completion of these costly works; and therefore, since
he would not apply the consecrated treasures of the temple to the
erection of cities and palaces, he might find himself compelled to
procure a loan from the wealthy king Hiram, which he probably intended
to cover by ceding to him twenty cities on the border of the Phoenician
territory. But as these cities did not please the king of Tyre and he
gave them back to Solomon, the latter will no doubt have repaid the
amount borrowed during the last twenty years of his reign.

[Kg1 9:15-23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#015)

Solomon's tribute service, and the building of the cities. (Cf. [Ch2
8:3-10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#003).) The other means by which
Solomon made it possible to erect so many buildings, was by compelling
the remnants of the Canaanitish population that were still in the land
to perform tributary labour. המּס דּבר יד, "this is the case with regard
to the tribute." For מס העלה compare [Kg1
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#013). To the announcement of the
object which Solomon had in view in raising tributary labourers, namely,
to build, etc., there is immediately appended a list of all the
buildings completed by him ([Kg1
9:15-19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#015)); and it is not till [Kg1
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#020) that we have more precise details
concerning the tribute itself. Millo, the wall of Jerusalem, and the
cities enumerated, are for the most part not new buildings, but simply
fortifications, or the completion of buildings already in existence.
David had already built the castle of Millo and the wall of Jerusalem
([Sa2 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#009)); so that Solomon's building
was in both cases merely fortifying more strongly. On Millo see the
fuller remarks at [Sa2 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#009); and on the
building of the wall, those at [Kg1
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#001) and [Kg1
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#027). As Solomon thereby closed the
breach of the city of David according to [Kg1
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#027), he probably extended the city
wall so as to enclose the temple mountain; and he may possibly have also
surrounded the lower city with a wall, since David had only built a
fortification round about the upper city upon Zion (see at [Sa2
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#009)). - Hazor: an old royal city of
the Canaanites above Lake Huleh, which has not yet been discovered (see
at [Jos 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#001)). Megiddo, i.e., Lejun
(see at [Kg1 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#012)). Gezer: also an old
Canaanitish royal city, which stood close to the Philistian frontier,
probably on the site of the present village of el Kubab (see at [Jos
10:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#033)).

[Kg1 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#016)

This city had been taken and burned down by the king of Egypt; its
Canaanitish inhabitants had been put to death; and the city itself had
been given as a marriage portion to his daughter who was married to
Solomon. Nothing is known concerning the occasion and object of
Pharaoh's warlike expedition against this city. The conjecture of
Thenius, that the Canaanitish inhabitants of Gezer had drawn upon
themselves the vengeance of Pharaoh, mentioned here, through a piratical
raid upon the Egyptian coast, is open to this objection, that according
to all accounts concerning its situation, Gezer was not situated near
the sea-coast, but very far inland.

[Kg1 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#017)

This city Solomon built: i.e., he not only rebuilt it, but also
fortified it. He did the same also to Lower Bethhoron, i.e., Beit-Ur
Tachta, on the western slope of the mountains, four hours' journey from
Gibeon. According to [Ch2 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#005), Solomon
also fortified Upper Bethhoron, which was separated by a deep wady from
Lower Bethhoron, that lay to the west (see Comm. on [Jos
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#010) and [Jos
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#003)). The two Bethhorons and Gezer
were very important places for the protection of the mountainous country
of Benjamin, Ephraim, and Judah against hostile invasions from the
Philistian plain. The situation of Megiddo on the southern edge of the
plain of Jezreel, through which the high road from the western coast to
the Jordan ran, was equally important; and so also was Hazor as a border
fortress against Syria in the northern part of the land.

[Kg1 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#018)

Solomon also built, i.e., fortified, Baalath and Tadmor in the desert.
According to [Jos 19:44](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#044), Baalath was a
city of Dan, and therefore, as Josephus (Ant. viii. 6, 1) justly
observes, was not far from Gezer; and consequently is not to be
identified with either Baalgad or Baalbek in Coele-syria (Iken, ich.
Rosenm.; cf. Robinson, Bibl. Res. p. 519). תמר (Chethb) is either to be
read תּמר, or according to Ewald (Gesch. iii. p. 344) תּמּר, palm, a
palm-city. The Keri requires תּדמר (Tadmor, after [Ch2
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#004)), a pronunciation which may
possibly have simply arisen from Aramaean expansion, but which is still
the name for the city current among the Arabs even in the present day
(Arabic tadmur, locus palmarum ferax). The Greeks and Romans called it
Palmyra. It was situated in what is certainly now a very desolate oasis
of the Syrian desert, on the caravan road between Damascus and the
Euphrates, - according to modern accounts, not more than seventeen
hours' journey from that river; and there are still magnificent ruins
which attest the former glory of this wealthy and, under queen Zenobia,
very powerful city (cf. Ritter, Erdk. xvii. 2, p. 1486ff., and E.
Osiander in Herzog's Cycl.). The correctness of this explanation of the
name is placed beyond all doubt by the words "in the wilderness;" and
consequently even Movers has given up his former opinion, viz., that it
was the city of Thamar in southern Judah ([Eze
47:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#019); [Eze
48:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#028)), which Thenius has since
adopted, and has decided in favour of Palmyra, without being led astray
by the attempt of Hitzig to explain the name from the Sanscrit (vid.,
Deutsche morgld. Ztschr. viii. p. 222ff.). The expression בּארץ appears
superfluous, as all the cities named before were situated in the land or
kingdom of Solomon, and Tadmor is sufficiently defined by בּמּדבּר (in
the desert). The text is evidently faulty, and either the name of the
land, namely Hamath (according to [Ch2
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#004)), has dropped out, or בּארץ is to
be taken in connection with what follows (according to the Cod. Al. of
the lxx), and the cop. ו before כּל־ערי את must be erased and inserted
before בּארץ ("and in the land of all the magazine-cities").

[Kg1 9:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#019)

The "magazine-cities" (המּסכּנות ערי) were fortified cities, in which
the produce of the land was collected, partly for provisioning the army,
and partly for the support of the rural population in times of distress
([Ch2 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#012); [Ch2
32:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#028)), similar to those which Pharaoh
had built in the land of Goshen ([Exo
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#011)). If they were situated on the
great commercial roads, they may also have served for storing provisions
for the necessities of travellers and their beasts of burden. The cities
for the war-chariots (הרכב) and cavalry (הפּרשׁים) were probably in part
identical with the magazine-cities, and situated in different parts of
the kingdom. There were no doubt some of these upon Lebanon, as we may
on the one hand infer from the general importance of the northern
frontier to the security of the whole kingdom, and still more from the
fact that Solomon had an opponent at Damascus in the person of Rezin
([Kg1 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#024)), who could easily stir up
rebellion in the northern provinces, which had only just been
incorporated by David into the kingdom; and as we may on the other hand
clearly gather from [Ch2 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#004),
according to which there were magazine-cities in the land of Naphtali.
Finally, the words "and what Solomon had a desire to build" embrace all
the rest of his buildings, which it would have occupied too much space
to enumerate singly. That the words חשׁק את are not to be so pressed as
to be made to denote simply "the buildings undertaking for pure
pleasure," like the works mentioned in [Ecc
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#004)., as Thenius and Bertheau suppose,
is evident from a comparison of [Kg1
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#001), where all Solomon's buildings
except the temple and palace, and therefore the fortifications as well
as others, are included in the expression "all his desire." - Fuller
particulars concerning the tributary workmen are given in [Kg1
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#020). The Canaanitish population that
was left in the land were made use of for this purpose, - namely, the
descendants of the Canaanites who had not been entirely exterminated by
the Israelites. "Their children," etc., supplies a more precise
definition of the expression "all the people," etc., in [Kg1
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#020).

[Kg1 9:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#022)

Solomon did not make Israelites into tributary slaves; but they were
warriors, ministers, and civil and military officers. עבדים are the
king's servants; שׂרים, the heads of the military and civil service;
שׁלשׁים, royal adjutants (see at [Sa2
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#008)); וּפרשׁיו רכבּו שׂרי, captains
over the royal war-chariots and cavalry. - For [Kg1
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#023) compare [Kg1
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#016).

[Kg1 9:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#024)

[Kg1 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#024), [Kg1
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#025) contain two notices, with which
the account of Solomon's buildings is brought to a close. Both verses
point back to [Kg1 3:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#001) (viz., [Kg1
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#024) to [Kg1
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#001), and [Kg1
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#025) to [Kg1
3:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#002)), and show how the incongruities
which existed at the commencement of Solomon's reign were removed by his
buildings. When Solomon married Pharaoh's daughter, he brought her into
the city of David ([Kg1 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#001)), until he
should have finished his palace and built her a house of her own within
it. After this building was completed, he had her brought up from the
city of David into it. עלה, came up, inasmuch as the palace stood upon
the loftier summit of Zion. אך is to be connected with אז which follows,
in the sense of only or just as: as soon as Pharaoh's daughter had gone
up into the house built for her, Solomon built Millo.

(Note: Nothing certain can be gathered from this notice as to the
situation of this castle. The remark made by Thenius, to the effect that
it must have joined that portion of the palace in which the harem was,
rests upon the assumption that Millo was evidently intended to shelter
the harem, - an assumption which cannot be raised into a probability, to
say nothing of a certainty. The building of Millo immediately after the
entrance of Pharaoh's daughter into the house erected for her, may have
arisen from the fact that David (? Solomon - Tr.) could not undertake
the fortification of Jerusalem by means of this castle till after his
own palace was finished, because he had not the requisite labour at
command for carrying on all these buildings at the same time.)

[Kg1 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#025)

After the building of the temple, the practice of sacrificing upon the
altars of the high places could be brought to an end ([Kg1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#002)). Solomon now offered
burnt-offerings and thank-offerings three times a year upon the altar
which he had built to the Lord, i.e., upon the altar of burnt-offering
in the temple, or as 2 Chron 8; 12 adds by way of explanation, "before
the porch." "Three times in the year:" i.e., at the three great yearly
feasts - passover, the feast of weeks, and the feast of tabernacles
([Ch2 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#013)). The words which follow,
אתּו והקטיר, "and indeed burning (the sacrifice) at the (altar) which
was before Jehovah," cannot be taken as parallel to the preceding
clause, and understood as referring to the incense, which was offered
along with the bleeding sacrifices, because הקטיר is not a preterite,
but an inf. absol., which shows that this clause merely serves as an
explanation of the preceding one, in the sense of, "namely, burning the
sacrifices at the altar which was before Jehovah." חקטיר is the
technical expression here for the burning of the portions of the
sacrificial flesh upon the altar, as in [Exo
29:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#018); [Lev
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#009), etc. On the use of אשׁר after
אתּו, which Thenius and Bttcher could not understand, and on which they
built up all kinds of conjectures, see Ewald, 333, a., note. - את־הבּית
ושׁלּם, "and made the house complete," i.e., he put the temple into a
state of completion by offering the yearly sacrifices there from that
time forward, or, as Bttcher explains it, gave it thereby its full worth
as a house of God and place of worship. ושׁלּם is to be taken
grammatically as a continuation of the inf. abs. הקטיר.

[Kg1 9:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#026)

He sends ships to Ophir. - Solomon built a fleet (אני is collective,
ships or fleet; the nom. unitatis is אניּה) at Eziongeber, near Eloth,
on the coast of the Red Sea (ים־סוּף: see at [Exo
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#019)), in the land of Edom; and Hiram
sent in the fleet "shipmen that had knowledge of the sea" along with
Solomon's servants to Ophir, whence they brought to king Solomon 420
talents of gold. Eziongeber, a harbour at the north-eastern end of the
Elanitic Gulf, was probably the "large and beautiful town of Asziun"
mentioned by Makrizi (see at [Num
33:35](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#035)), and situated on the great bay
of Wady Emrag (see Rppell, Reisen in Nubien, pp. 252-3). Eloth (lit.,
trees, a grove, probably so named from the large palm-grove in the
neighbourhood), or Elath ([Deu 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#008);
[Kg2 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#022) : see at [Gen
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#006)), the Aila and Aelana of the
Greeks and Romans, Arab. Aileh, was situated at the northern point of
the (Elanitic) gulf, which took its name from the town; and in the time
of the Fathers it was an important commercial town. It was not far from
the small modern fortress of Akaba, where heaps of rubbish still show
the spot on which it formerly stood (compare Rppell, Nub. p. 248, with
plates 6 and 7, and Robinson, Pal. i. p. 251ff.). - The corresponding
text, [Ch2 8:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#017), differs in many
respects from the account before us. The statement in the Chronicles,
that Solomon went to Eziongeber and Elath, is but a very unimportant
deviation; for the building of the fleet makes it a very probable thing
in itself that Solomon should have visited on that account the two towns
on the Elanitic Gulf, which were very near to one another, to make the
requisite arrangements upon the spot for this important undertaking.
There is apparently a far greater deviation in [Kg1
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#027), where, in the place of the
statement that Hiram sent בּאני, in the (or a) fleet, his servants as
sailors who had knowledge of the sea, the chronicler affirms that Hiram
sent by his servants ships and men who had knowledge of the sea. For the
only way in which Hiram could send ships to Eziongeber was either by
land or (as Ritter, Erdk. xiv. p. 365, supposes) out of the Persian
Gulf, supposing that the Tyrians had a fleet upon that sea at so early a
date as this. The statement in the Chronicles receives an apparent
confirmation from [Kg1 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#022), "The
king had a Tarshish fleet upon the sea with the fleet of Hiram," if
indeed this passage also refers to the trade with Ophir, as is generally
supposed; for then these words affirm that Hiram sent ships of his own
to Ophir along with those of Solomon. We do not think it probable,
however that the words "Hiram sent ships by his own men" are to be so
pressed as to be taken to mean that he had whole ships, or ships taken
to pieces, conveyed to Eziongeber either from Tyre or out of the
Mediterranean Sea, although many cases might be cited from antiquity in
support of this view.

(Note: Thus, for example, according to Arriani exped. Alex. l. v. p.
329, and vii. p. 485 (ed. Blanc), Alexander the Great had ships
transported from Phoenicia to the Euphrates, and out of the Indus into
the Hydaspes, the ships being taken to pieces for the land transport
(ἐτμήθησαν), and the pieces (τμήματα) afterwards joined together again.
Plutarch relates (vita Anton. p. 948, ed. Frkf. 1620) that Cleopatra
would have had her whole fleet carried across the isthmus which
separates Egypt from the Red Sea, and have escaped by that means, had
not the Arabs prevented the execution of her plan by burning the first
ships that were drawn up on the land. According to Thucydides, bell.
Pelop. iv. 8, the Peloponnesians conveyed sixty ships which lay at
Corcyra across the Leucadian isthmus. Compare also Polyaeni strateg. v.
2, 6, and Ammian. Marcell. xxiv. 7, and from the middle ages the account
of Makrizi in Burckhardt's Reisen in Syrien, p. 331.)

In all probability the words affirm nothing more than that Hiram
supplied the ships for this voyage, that is to say, that he had them
built at Eziongeber by his own men, and the requisite materials conveyed
thither, so far as they were not to be obtained upon the spot. At any
rate, Solomon was obliged to call the Tyrians to his help for the
building of the ships, since the Israelites, who had hitherto carried in
no maritime trade at all, were altogether inexperienced in shipbuilding.
Moreover, the country round Eziongeber would hardly furnish wood adapted
for the purpose, as there are only palms to be found there, whose spongy
wood, however useful it may be for the inside of houses, cannot be
applied to the building of ships. But if Hiram had ships built for
Solomon by his own men and sent him sailors who were accustomed to the
sea, he would certainly have some of his own ships engaged in this
maritime trade; and this explains the statement in [Kg1
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#022).

The destination of the fleet was Ophir, whence the ships brought 420 or
(according to the Chronicles) 450 talents of gold. The difference
between 420 and 450 may be accounted for from the substitution of the
numeral letter נ (50) for כ (20). The sum mentioned amounted to eleven
or twelve million dollars (from 1,600,000 to 1,800,000 - Tr.), and the
question arises, whether this is to be taken as the result of one
voyage, or as the entire profits resulting from the expeditions to
Ophir. The words admit of either interpretation, although they are more
favourable to the latter than to the former, inasmuch as there is no
allusion whatever to the fact that they brought this amount all at once
or on every voyage. (See also at [Kg1
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#014), [Kg1
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#022).) The question as to the
situation of Ophir has given rise to great dispute, and hitherto no
certain conclusion has been arrived at; in fact, it is possible that
there are no longer any means of deciding it. Some have endeavoured to
prove that it was in southern Arabia, others that it was on the eastern
coast of Africa, and others again that it was in Hither India.

(Note: Compare the thorough examination of the different views
concerning Ophir in C. Ritter's Erdk. xiv. pp. 348-431, with the briefer
collection made by Gesenius in his Thes. p. 141f. and in the Allgem.
Encyclop. der Wissenschaft u. Knste, 3 Sect. Bd. 4, p. 201ff., and by
Pressel, art. "Ophir," in Herzog's Cyclopaedia. - We need not dwell upon
the different opinions held by the earlier writers. But among modern
authors, Niebuhr, Gesenius, Rosenmller, and Seetzen decide in favour of
Arabia; Quatremre (Mmoire sur le pays d'Ophir in Mm. de l'Instit. roy.
1845, t. xv. P. ii. p. 350ff.) and Movers, who takes Ophir to be the
name of an emporium on the eastern coast of Africa, in favour of Sofala;
while Chr. Lassen (Indische Alterthumskunde, i. p. 537ff., ii. p.
552ff.) and C. Ritter are the principal supporters of India. On the
other hand, Albr. Roscher (Ptolemus und die Handelsstrassen in
Central-Africa, Gotha 1857, p. 57ff.) has attempted to connect together
all these views by assuming that the seamen of Hiram and Solomon fetched
the gold of Western Africa from the island of Dahlak in the Red Sea, and
having taken it to India to exchange, returned at the end of a three
years' voyage enriched with gold and the productions of India.)

The decision is dependent upon a previous question, whether [Kg1
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#022), "The king had a Tarshish fleet
upon the sea with the fleet of Hiram; once in three years came the
Tarshish fleet, bringing gold, silver," etc., also applies to the voyage
to Ophir. The expression "Tarshish fleet;" the word בּיּם ("on the
sea"), which naturally suggests that sea to which the Israelites applied
the special epithet היּם, namely the Mediterranean; and lastly, the
difference in the cargoes, - the ships from Ophir bringing gold and
algummim wood ([Kg1 9:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#028) and [Kg1
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#011)), and the Tarshish fleet
bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks ([Kg1
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#022)), - appear to favour the
conclusion that the Tarshish fleet did not sail to Ophir, but upon the
Mediterranean Sea to Tarshish, i.e., Tartessus in Spain; to which we may
add the fact that תרשׁישׁ אני is reproduced in [Ch2
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#021) by תּרשׁישׁ הלכות אניּות, "ships
going to Tarshish." Nevertheless, however plausible these arguments may
appear, after a renewed investigation of the subject I cannot regard
them as having decisive weight: for (1) the expression "Tarshish fleet"
is used in [Kg1 22:49](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#049) in connection
with ships that were intended to go to Ophir; (2) בּיּם (upon the sea)
might receive its more precise definition from what precedes; and (3)
the difference in the cargoes reduces itself to this, that in addition
to the gold, which was the chief production of Ophir, there are a few
other articles of trade mentioned, so that the account in [Kg1
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#022) is more complete than that in
[Kg1 9:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#028) and [Kg1
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#011). The statement concerning the
Tarshish fleet in [Kg1 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#022) contains
a passing remark, like that in [Kg1
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#011), from which we must infer that
both passages treat in the same manner simply of the voyage to Ophir,
and therefore that the term "Tarshish ships," like our Indiamen
(Indienfahrer), was applied to ships intended for long voyages. If, in
addition to the ships sailing to Ophir, Solomon had also had a fleet
upon the Mediterranean Sea which sailed with the Phoenicians to
Tartessus, this would certainly have been mentioned here ([Kg1
9:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#027)) at the same time as the Ophir
voyage. On all these grounds we can come to no other conclusion than
that the expression in [Ch2 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#021),
"ships going to Tarshish," is simply a mistaken exposition of the term
"Tarshish fleet," - a mistake which may easily be explained from the
fact, that at the time when the Chronicles were written, the voyages not
only of the Israelites but also of the Tyrians both to Ophir and
Tarshish had long since ceased, and even the geographical situation of
these places was then unknown to the Jews (see my Introduction to the
Old Test. p. 442, ed. 2).

The name Ophir occurs first of all in [Gen
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#029) among the tribes of Southern
Arabia, that were descended from Joktan, between Seba and Havilah, i.e.,
the Sabaeans and Chaulotaeans. Hence it appears most natural to look for
the gold-land of Ophir in Southern Arabia. But as there is still a
possibility that the Joktanide tribe of Ophir, or one branch of it, may
subsequently have emigrated either to the eastern coast of Africa or
even to Hither India, and therefore that the Solomonian Ophir may have
been an Arabian colony outside Arabia, the situation of this gold
country cannot be determined without further evidence from [Gen
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#029) alone; but before arriving at an
actual decision, we must first of all examine the arguments that may be
adduced in support of each of the three countries named. Sofala in
Eastern Africa, in the Mozambique Channel, has nothing in common with
the name Ophir, but is the Arabic suflah (Heb. שׁפלה), i.e., lowland or
sea-coast; and the old Portuguese accounts of the gold mines in the
district of Fura there, as well as the pretended walls of the queen of
Saba, have far too little evidence to support them, to have any bearing
upon the question before us. The supposed connection between the name
Ophir and the city of Σουπάρα mentioned by Ptolemaeus, or Οὔππαρα by
Periplus (Geogr. min. i. p. 30), in the neighbourhood of Goa, or the
shepherd tribe of Abhira, cannot be sustained. Σουπάρα or Sufra (Edrisi)
answers to the Sanscrit Supara, i.e., beautiful coast (cf. Lassen, Ind.
Alterthk. i. p. 107); and Οὔππαρα in Periplus is not doubt simply a
false reading for Σουπάρα, which has nothing in common with אופיר. And
the shepherd tribe of Abhira can hardly come into consideration, because
the country which they inhabited, to the south-east of the mouths of the
Indus, has no gold. - Again, the hypothesis that India is intended
derives just as little support from the circumstance that, with the
exception of [Gen 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#029), the lxx have
always rendered אופיר either Σωφιρά or Σουφίρ, which is, according to
the Coptic lexicographers, the name used by the Copts for India, and
that Josephus (Ant. viii. 6, 4), who used the Old Test. in the
Alexandrian version, has given India as the explanation of Ophir, as it
does from this supposed resemblance in the names. For, according to the
geographical ideas of the Alexandrians and later Greeks, India reached
to Ethiopia, and Ethiopia to India, as Letronne has conclusively proved
(see his Mmoire sur une mission arienne, etc., in Mm. de l'Instit. Acad.
des Inscript. et Bell. Lettres, t. x. p. 220ff.).

Greater stress has been laid upon the duration of the voyages to Ophir,
- namely, that the Tarshish fleet came once in three years, according to
[Kg1 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#022), and brought gold, etc. But
even Lassen, who follows Heeren, observes quite truly, that "this
expression need not be understood as signifying that three whole years
intervened between the departure and return, but simply that the fleet
returned once in the course of three years." Moreover, the stay in Ophir
is to be reckoned in as part of the time occupied in the voyage; and
that this is not to be estimated as a short one, is evident from the
fact that, according to Homer, Odyss. xv. 454ff., a Phoenician
merchantman lay for a whole year at one of the Cyclades before he had
disposed of his wares of every description, in return for their articles
of commerce, and filled his roomy vessel. If we add to this the slowness
of the voyage, - considering that just as at the present day the Arabian
coasters go but very slowly from port to port, so the combined fleet of
Hiram and Solomon would not be able to proceed with any greater
rapidity, inasmuch as the Tyrians were not better acquainted with the
dangerous Arabian Sea than the modern Arabians are, and that the
necessary provisions for a long voyage, especially the water for
drinking, could not be taken on board all at once, but would have to be
taken in at the different landing-places, and that on these occasions
some trade would be done, - we can easily understand how a voyage from
Eziongeber to the strait of Bab el Mandeb and the return might occupy
more than a year,

(Note: It is no proof to the contrary, that, according to the testimony
of ancient writer, as collected by Movers (Phniz. ii. 3, p. 190ff.), the
Phoenicians sailed almost as rapidly as the modern merchant ships; for
this evident simply applies to the voyages on the Mediterranean Sea with
which they were familiar, and to the period when the Phoenician
navigation had reached its fullest development, so that it has no
bearing upon the time of Solomon and a voyage upon the Arabian Sea, with
which the Phoenicians were hitherto quite unacquainted. - Again, the
calculation made by Lassen (ii. pp. 590-1), according to which a voyage
from Eziongeber to the mouth of the Indus could have been accomplished
in a hundred days, is founded upon the assumption that the Phoenicians
were already acquainted with the monsoon and knew what was the best time
for the navigation of the Red Sea, - an assumption which can neither be
proved nor shown to be probable.)

so that the time occupied in the voyage as given here cannot furnish any
decisive proof that the fleet sailed beyond Southern Arabia to the East
Indies.

And lastly, the same remarks apply to the goods brought from Ophir,
which many regard as decisive evidence in favour of India. The principal
article for which Ophir became so celebrated, viz., the gold, is not
found either in Sufra near Goa, or in the land of Abhira. Even if India
be much richer in gold than was formerly supposed (cf. Lassen, ii. p.
592), the rich gold country lies to the north of Cashmir (see Lassen,
ii. pp. 603-4). Moreover, not only is it impossible to conceive what
goods the Phoenicians can have offered to the Indian merchants for their
gold and the other articles named, since large sums of gold were sent to
India every year in the Roman times to pay for the costly wares that
were imported thence (see Roscher, pp. 53, 54); but it is still less
possible to comprehend how the shepherd tribe of Abhira could have come
into possession of so much gold as the Ophir fleet brought home. The
conjecture of Ritter (Erdk. xiv. p. 399) and Lassen (ii. p. 592), that
this tribe had come to the coast not very long before from some country
of their own where gold abounded, and that as an uncultivated shepherd
tribe they attached but very little value to the gold, so that they
parted with it to the Phoenicians for their purple cloths, their works
in brass and glass, and for other things, has far too little probability
to appear at all admissible. If the Abhira did not know the value of the
gold, they would not have brought it in such quantities out of their
original home into these new settlements. We should therefore be obliged
to assume that they were a trading people, and this would be at variance
with all the known accounts concerning this tribe. - As a rule, the gold
treasures of Hither Asia were principally obtained from Arabia in the
most ancient times. If we leave Havilah ([Gen
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#011)) out of the account, because its
position cannot be determined with certainty, the only other place
specially referred to in the Old Testament besides Ophir as being
celebrated as a gold country is Saba, in the south-western portion of
Yemen. The Sabaeans bring gold, precious stones, and incense ([Isa
60:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#006); [Eze
27:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#022)); and the queen of Saba
presented Solomon with 120 talents of gold, with perfumes and with
precious stones ([Kg1 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#010)). This
agrees with the accounts of the classical writers, who describe Arabia
as very rich in gold (cf. Strabo, xvi. 777f. and 784; Diod. Sic. ii. 50,
iii. 44; also Bochart, Phaleg, l. ii. c. 27). These testimonies, which
we have already given in part at [Exo
38:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#031), are far too distinct to be set
aside by the remark that there is no gold to be found in Arabia at the
present time. For whilst, on the one hand, the wealth of Arabia in gold
may be exhausted, just as Spain no longer yields any silver, on the
other hand we know far too little of the interior of Southern Arabia to
be able distinctly to maintain that there is no gold in existence there.
- Silver, the other metal brought from Ophir, was also found in the land
of the Nabataeans, according to Strabo, xvi. p. 784, although the wealth
of the ancient world in silver was chiefly derived from Tarshish or
Tartessus in Spain (cf. Movers, Phniz. ii. 3, p. 36ff., where the
different places are enumerated in which silver was found). - That
precious stones were to be found in Arabia is evident from the passages
cited above concerning the Sabaeans. - On the other hand, however, it
has been supposed that the remaining articles of Ophir could only have
been brought from the East Indies.

According to [Kg1 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#012), the Ophir
ships brought a large quantity of אלמגּים עצי (almuggim wood: [Ch2
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#007), אלגּמּים). According to Kimchi
(on [Ch2 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#007)), the אלמוּג or אלגוּם is
arbor rubri coloris, dicta lingua arabica albakam (Arabic ‛l-bqm), vulgo
brasilica. This tree, according to Abulfadl (Celsius, Hierob. i. p.
176), is a native of India and Ethiopia; and it is still a question in
dispute, whether we are to understand by this the Pterocarpus Santal.,
from which the true sandal-wood comes, and which is said to grow only in
the East Indies on Malabar and Java, or the Caesalpinia Sappan L., a
tree which grows in the East Indies, more especially in Ceylon, and also
in different parts of Africa, the red wood of which is used in Europe
chiefly for dyeing. Moreover the true explanation of the Hebrew name is
still undiscovered. The derivation of it from the Sanscrit Valgu, i.e.,
pulcher (Lassen and Ritter), has been set aside by Gesenius as
inappropriate, and mocha, mochta, which is said to signify sandal-wood
in Sanscrit, has been suggested instead. But no evidence has been
adduced in its favour, nor is the word to be found in Wilson's Sanscrit
Lexicon. If, however, this derivation were correct, אל would be the
Arabic article, and the introduction of this article in connection with
the word mocha would be a proof that the sandal-wood, together with its
name, came to the Hebrews through merchants who spoke Arabic. - The
other articles from Ophir mentioned in [Kg1
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#022) are שׁגהבּים, ὀδόντες
ἐλεφάντινοι (lxx), dentes elephantorum or ebur (Vulg.), דפיל ,).gluV(
שׁן, elephants' teeth (Targ.). But however certain the meaning of the
word may thus appear, the justification of this meaning is quite as
uncertain. In other cases ivory is designated by the simple term שׁן
([Kg1 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#018); [Kg1
22:39](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#039); [Psa
45:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#009); [Amo
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#015), etc.), whereas Ezekiel ([Eze
27:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#015)) calls the whole tusk קרנות שׁן,
horns of the tooth. הבּים is said to signify elephants here; and
according to Benary it is contracted from האבּים, the Sanscrit word
ibha, elephant; according to Ewald, from הלבּים, from the Sanscrit
Kalabha; and according to Hitzig, from נהבים = להבים, Libyi; or else
שׁגהבּים is a false reading for והבנים שׁן, ivory and ebony, according
to [Eze 27:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#015) (see Ges. Thes. p.
1453). Of these four derivations the first two are decidedly wrong: the
first, because ibha as a name for the elephant only occurs, according to
Weber, in the later Indian writings, and is never used in the earlier
writings in this sense (vid., Roediger, Addenda ad Ges. thes. p. 115);
the second, because Kalabha does not signify the elephant, but catulum
elephanti, before it possesses any teeth available for ivory. The third
is a fancy which its originator himself has since given up and the
fourth a conjecture, which is not raised to a probability even by the
attempt of Bttcher to show that הבּים is a case of backward assimilation
from הבנים, because the asyndeton הבּים שׁן between two couples
connected by ו is without any analogy, and the passages adduced by
Bttcher, viz., [Deu 29:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#022); [Jos
15:54](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#054)., and Even [Eze
27:33](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#033), are to be taken in quite a
different way. - The rendering of קפים by apes, and the connection of
the name not only with the Sanscrit and Malabar kapi, but also with the
Greek κῆπος and κῆβος, also κεῖβος, are much surer; but, on the other
hand, the assumption that the Greeks, like the Semitic nations, received
the word from the Indians along with the animals, is very improbable:
for κῆπος in Greek does not denote the ape (πίθηκος) generally, but
simply a species of long-tailed apes, the native land of which,
according to the testimony of ancient writers, was Ethiopia,

(Note: Compare Aristoteles, hist. animal. ii. 8: ἔστι δὲ ὁ μέν κῆβος

Solinus Polyh. says the same (Bochart, Hieroz. i. lib. iii. c. 31).

and the Ethiopian apes are hardly likely to have sprung from India. -
And lastly, even in the case of תּכּיּים, according to the ancient
versions peacocks, the derivation from the Malabaric or Tamul tgai or
tghai (cf. Roediger in Ges. Thes. p. 1502) is not placed beyond the
reach of doubt.

If, in conclusion, we look through all the articles of commerce that
were brought to Jerusalem from the Ophir voyages, apart from the gold
and silver, which were not to be found in the land of Abhira, the ivory
and ebony (supposing that we ought to read והבנים שׁן for שׁגהבּים)
furnish no evidence in support of India, inasmuch as both of them could
have been brought from Ethiopia, as even Lassen admits (ii. pp. 554).
And even if the words Almuggim, Kophim, and Tucchijim really came from
India along with the objects to which they belonged, it would by no
means follow with certainty from this alone that Ophir was situated in
India. - For since, for example, there are indisputable traces of very
early commercial intercourse between India and Hither Asia and Africa,
especially Southern Arabia and Ethiopia, reaching far beyond the time of
Solomon, the seamen of Hiram and Solomon may have obtained these
articles either in Arabia or on the Ethiopian coast. For even if the
statements of Herodotus and Strabo, to the effect that the Phoenicians
emigrated from the islands of the Erythraean Sea, Tylos (or Tyros?) and
Arados, to the Phoenician coast, do not prove that the Phoenicians had
already extended their commercial enterprise as far as India even before
the twelfth century, as Lassen (ii. 597 and 584-5) supposes; if the
Tyrians and Aradians, who were related to them by tribe, still continued
to dwell upon the islands of the Persian Gulf, from which they could
much more easily find the way to India by sea, - since the historical
character of these statement has been disputed by Movers (Phnizier, ii.
1, p. 38ff.) on very weighty grounds; yet it is evident that there was a
very early intercourse between East India and Africa, reaching far
beyond all historical testimony, from the following well-established
facts: that the Egyptians made use of indigo in the dyeing of their
stuffs, and this could only have been brought to them from India; that
muslins,which were likewise of Indian origin, are found among the
material sin which the mummies are enveloped; and that in the graves of
the kings of the eighteenth dynasty, who ceased to reign in the year
1476 b.c., there have been discovered vases of Chinese porcelain (cf.
Lassen, ii. p. 596). And the intercourse between the southern coast of
Arabia and Hither India may have been quite as old, if not older; so
that Indian productions may have been brought to Hither Asia by the
Sabaeans long before the time of Solomon (vid., Lassen, ii. pp. 593-4,
and Movers, Phniz. ii. 3, pp. 247,256). But the commercial intercourse
between Arabia and the opposite coast of Ethiopia, by which African
productions reached the trading inhabitants of Arabia, was
unquestionably still older than the trade with India. If we weigh well
all these points, there is no valid ground for looking outside Arabia
for the situation of the Solomonian Ophir. But we shall no doubt be
obliged to give up the hope of determining with any greater precision
that particular part of the coast of Arabia in which Ophir was situated,
inasmuch as hitherto neither the name Ophir nor the existence of
gold-fields in Arabia has been established by modern accounts, and
moreover the interior of the great Arabian peninsula is still for the
most part a terra incognita.

(Note: If the notice of Eupolemus contained in a fragment in Eusebius
(praepar. ev. ix. 30), to the effect that David (a mistake for Solomon)
sent miners to the island of Οὐρφῆ (for which Gesenius conjectures that
we should read Οὐφρῆ or Οὐφήρ) in the Red Sea, which was rich in gold
mines, and that they brought gold thence to Judaea, could be proved to
be historical through any earlier testimony, Ophir would have been an
island of the Erythraean Sea, either Dahlak inside Bab el Mandeb, or Diu
Zokatara (the Sanscrit Dwipa Sukhatara, i.e., the happy island) by the
present Cape Guardafui. But this notice is evidently simply a conjecture
founded upon the Old Testament, having no historical value.)
