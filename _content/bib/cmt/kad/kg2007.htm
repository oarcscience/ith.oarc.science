<p>Elisha announced to him the word of the Lord: "At the (this) time to-morrow a seah of wheaten flour (&#1505;&#1500;&#1514;, see at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#002">Kg1 5:2</A>) will be worth a shekel, and two seahs of barley a shekel in the gate, i.e., in the market, at Samaria." A seah, or a third of an ephah = a Dresden peck (Metze), for a shekel was still a high price; but in comparison with the prices given in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#025">Kg2 6:25</A> as those obtained for the most worthless kinds of food, it was incredibly cheap. The king's aide-de-camp (&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;: see at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#008">Sa2 23:8</A>; &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1503; &#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, an error in writing for &#1504;&#1513;&#1473; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#017">Kg2 7:17</A>, and for the explanation <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#018">Kg2 5:18</A>) therefore replied with mockery at this prophecy: "Behold (i.e., granted that) the Lord made windows in heaven, will this indeed be?" i.e., such cheapness take place. (For the construction, see Ewald, 357, b.) The ridicule lay more especially in the "windows in heaven," in which there is an allusion to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#011">Gen 7:11</A>, sc. to rain down a flood of flour and corn. Elisha answered seriously: "Behold, thou wilt see it with thine eyes, but not eat thereof" (see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#017">Kg2 7:17</A>.). The fulfilment of these words of Elisha was brought about by the event narrated in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#003">Kg2 7:3</A>.

<p>"Four men were before the gate as lepers," or at the gateway, separated from human society, according to the law in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#046">Lev 13:46</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#003">Num 5:3</A>, probably in a building erected for the purpose (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#005">Kg2 15:5</A>), just as at the present day the lepers at Jerusalem have their huts by the side of the Zion gate (vid., Strauss, Sinai u. Golgatha, p. 205, and Tobler, Denkbltter aus Jerus. p. 411ff.). These men being on the point of starvation, resolved to invade the camp of the Syrians, and carried out this resolution &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1507;, in the evening twilight, not the morning twilight (Seb. Schm., Cler., etc.), on account of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#012">Kg2 7:12</A>, where the king is said to have received the news of the flight of the Syrians during the night. Coming to "the end of the Syrian camp," i.e., to the outskirts of it on the city side, they found no one there. For (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#006">Kg2 7:6</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#007">Kg2 7:7</A>) "the Lord had caused the army of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots and horses, a noise of a great army," so that, believing the king of Israel to have hired the kings of the Hittites and Egyptians to fall upon them, they fled from the camp in the twilight &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, with regard to their life, i.e., to save their life only, leaving behind them their tents, horses, and asses, and the camp as it was. - The miracle, by which God delivered Samaria from the famine or from surrendering to the foe, consisted in an oral delusion, namely, in the fact that the besiegers thought they heard the march of hostile armies from the north and south, and were seized with such panic terror that they fled in the greatest haste, leaving behind them their baggage, and their beasts of draught and burden. It is impossible to decide whether the noise which they heard had any objective reality, say a miraculous buzzing in the air, or whether it was merely a deception of the senses produced in their ears by God; and this is a matter of no importance, since in either case it was produced miraculously by God. The kings of the Hittites are kings of northern Canaan, upon Lebanon and towards Phoenicia; &#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; in the broader sense for Canaanites, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#029">Kg1 10:29</A>. The plural, "kings of the Egyptians," is probably only occasioned by the parallel expression "kings of the Hittites," and is not to be pressed.

<p>When these lepers (these, pointing back to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#003">Kg2 7:3</A>.) came into the camp which the Syrians had left, they first of all satisfied their own hunger with the provisions which they found in the tents, and then took different valuables and concealed them. But their consciences were soon aroused, so that they said: We are not doing right; this day is a day of joyful tidings: if we are silent and wait till the morning light, guilt will overtake us; "for it is the duty of citizens to make known things relating to public safety" (Grotius). They then resolved to announce the joyful event in the king's palace, and reported it to the watchman at the city gate. &#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512; stands as a generic term in a collective sense for the persons who watched at the gate; hence the following plural &#1500;&#1492;&#1501;, and in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#011">Kg2 7:11</A> &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;. "And the gate-keepers cried out (what they had heard) and reported it in the king's palace." 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#012">4 Kings (2 Kings) 7:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">kg2 7:12</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The king imagined that the unexpected departure of the Syrians was only a ruse, namely, that they had left the camp and hidden themselves in the field, to entice the besieged out of the fortress, and then fall upon them and press into the city. &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1491;&#1492; according to later usage for &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1491;&#1492; (vid., Ewald, 244, a). In order to make sure of the correctness or incorrectness of this conjecture, one of the king's servants (counsellors) gave this advice: "Let them take (the Vav before &#1497;&#1511;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468; as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#041">Kg2 4:41</A>) five of the horses left in the city, that we may send and see how the matter stands." The words, "Behold they (the five horses) are as the whole multitude of Israel that are left in it (the city); behold they are as the whole multitude of Israel that are gone," have this meaning: The five horsemen (for horses stand for horsemen, as it is self-evident that it was men on horseback and not the horses themselves that were to be sent out as spies) can but share the fate of the rest of the people of Samaria, whether they return unhurt to meet death by starvation with the people that still remain, or fall into the hands of the enemy and are put to death, in which case they will only suffer the lot of those who have already perished. Five horses is an approximative small number, and is therefore not at variance with the following statement, that two pair of horses were sent out with chariots and men. The Chethb &#1492;&#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503; is not to be altered, since there are other instances in which the first noun is written with the article, though in the construct state (vid., Ewald, 290, e.); and the Keri is only conformed to the following &#1499;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503;. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#014">Kg2 7:14</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#015">Kg2 7:15</A>. They then sent out two chariots with horses, who pursued the flying enemy to the Jordan, and found the whole of the road full of traces of the hurried flight, consisting of clothes and vessels that had been thrown away. The Chethb &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1495;&#1508;&#1494;&#1501; is the only correct reading, since it is only in the Niphal that &#1495;&#1508;&#1494; has the meaning to fly in great haste (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#026">Sa1 23:26</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#006">Psa 48:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#007">Psa 104:7</A>).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">kg2 7:16</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>When the returning messengers reported this, the people went out and plundered the camp of the Syrians, and this was followed by the consequent cheapness of provisions predicted by Elisha. As the people streamed out, the unbelieving aide-de-camp, whom the king had ordered to take the oversight at the gate (&#1492;&#1508;&#1511;&#1497;&#1491;, to deliver the oversight) for the purpose of preserving order in the crowding of the starving multitude, was trodden down by the people, so that he died, whereby this prediction of Elisha was fulfilled. The exact fulfilment of this prediction appeared so memorable to the historian, that he repeats this prophecy in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#018">Kg2 7:18-20</A> along with the event which occasioned it, and refers again to its fulfilment.
