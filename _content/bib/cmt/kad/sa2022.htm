<p>David's Psalm of Thanksgiving for Victory over All His Enemies - 2 Samuel 22
<p>In the following psalm of thanksgiving, David praises the Lord as his deliverer out of all dangers during his agitated life and conflicts with his foes (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#002">Sa2 22:2-4</A>). In the first half he pictures his marvellous deliverance out of all the troubles which he passed through, especially in the time of Saul's persecutions, under the image of an extraordinary theophany (vv. 5-20), and unfolds the ground of this deliverance (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#021">Sa2 22:21-28</A>). In the second half he proclaims the mighty help of the Lord, and his consequent victories over the foreign enemies of his government (vv. 29-46), and closes with renewed praise of God for all His glorious deeds (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#047">Sa2 22:47-51</A>). The psalm is thus arranged in two leading divisions, with an introductory and concluding strophe. But we cannot discover any definite system of strophes in the further arrangement of the principal divisions, as the several groups of thoughts are not rounded off symmetrically.
<p>The contents and form of this song of praise answer to the fact attested by the heading, that it was composed by David in the later years of his reign, when God had rescued him from all his foes, and helped his kingdom to victory over all the neighbouring heathen nations. The genuineness of the psalm is acknowledged to be indisputable by all the modern critics, except J. Olshausen and Hupfeld,
<p>(Note: Even Hitzig observes (die Psalmen, i. p. 95): "There is no ground whatever for calling in question the Davidic authorship of the psalm, and therefore the statement made in the heading; and, in fact, there is all the more reason for adhering to it, because it is attested twice. The recurrence of the psalm as one of Davidic origin in 2 Samuel 22 is of some weight, since not the slightest suspicion attaches to any of the other songs of sayings attributed to David in the second book of Samuel (e.g., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#033">Sa2 3:33-34</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#008">Sa2 5:8</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#018">Sa2 7:18-29</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#001">Sa2 23:1-7</A>). Moreover, the psalm is evidently ancient, and suited to the classical period of the language and its poetry. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#031">Sa2 22:31</A> is quoted as early as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#005">Pro 30:5</A>, and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#034">Sa2 22:34</A> in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#019">Hab 3:19</A>. The psalm was also regarded as Davidic at a very early period, as the 'diaskeuast' of the second book of Samuel met with the heading, which attributes the psalm to David. No doubt this opinion might be founded upon <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#051">Sa2 22:51</A>; and with perfect justice if it were: for if the psalm was not composed by David, it must have been composed in his name and spirit; and who could have been this contemporaneous and equal poet?" Again, after quoting several thoroughly Davidic signs, he says at p. 96: "It is very obvious with how little justice the words of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#051">Sa2 22:51</A>, relating to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#012">Sa2 7:12-16</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#026">Sa2 7:26</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#029">Sa2 7:29</A>, have been pronounced spurious. Besides, the psalm can no more have concluded with &#1500;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1495;&#1493; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#051">Sa2 22:51</A>) than with <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#050">Sa2 22:50</A>; and if David refers to himself by name at the commencement in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#001">Sa2 23:1</A>, and in the middle in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#020">Sa2 7:20</A>, why should he not do the same at the close?")
<p>who, with hypercritical scepticism, dispute the Davidic origin of the psalm on subjective grounds of aesthetic taste. This psalm is found in the Psalter as Ps 18, though with many divergences in single words and clauses, which do not, however, essentially affect the meaning. Commentators are divided in opinion as to the relation in which the two different forms of the text stand to one another. The idea that the text of 2 Samuel. rests upon a careless copy and tradition must decidedly be rejected: for, on the one hand, by far the larger portion of the deviations in our text from that of the Psalter are not to be attributed to carelessness on the part of copyists, but are evidently alterations made with thoughtfulness and deliberation: e.g., the omission of the very first passage (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#001">Sa2 22:1</A>), "I will love Thee, O Lord, my strength;" the change of &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; &#1488;&#1500;&#1497; (my God, my strength, or rock) into &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497; (the God of my rock), as "the God of the rock" occurs again in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#047">Sa2 22:47</A> of the text before us; or the substitution of &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488; (He was seen, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#011">Sa2 22:11</A>) for &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1491;&#1488; (He did fly), etc. On the other hand, the original reading has undoubtedly been retained in many passages of our text, whilst simpler and more common forms have been substituted in that of the Psalms; e.g., in v. 5, &#1502;&#1493;&#1514; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; instead of &#1502;&#1493;&#1514; fo d &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;; in v. 8, &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1502;&#1493;&#1505;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514; (the foundations of the heavens) for &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1502;&#1493;&#1505;&#1491;&#1497; (the foundations of the hills); in v. 12, &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1514;&#1470;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; for &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1514;&#1470;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;; in v. 16, &#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1508;&#1497;&#1511;&#1497; for &#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1508;&#1497;&#1511;&#1497;; in v. 28, &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500; &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1512;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1493;&#1506;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498; for &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500; &#1512;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; &#1493;&#1506;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;; in v. 33, &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493; &#1514;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512; for &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1514;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503;; and in v. 44, &#1500;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1504;&#1497; for &#1500;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1502;&#1504;&#1497;, and several others. In general, however, the text of the Psalms bears the stamp of poetical originality more than the text before us, and the latter indicates a desire to give greater clearness and simplicity to the poetical style. Consequently neither of the two texts that have come down to us contains the original text of the psalm of David unaltered; but the two recensions have been made quite independently of each other, one for the insertion of the psalm in the Psalter intended for liturgical use, and the other when it was incorporated into the history of David's reign, which formed the groundwork of our books of Samuel. The first revision may have been made by David himself when he arranged his Psalms for liturgical purposes; but the second was effected by the prophetic historian, whose object it was, when inserting David's psalm of praise in the history of his reign, not so much to give it with diplomatic literality, as to introduce it in a form that should be easily intelligible and true to the sense.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">sa2 22:1</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The heading is formed precisely according to the introductory formula of the song of Moses in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#030">Deu 31:30</A>, and was no doubt taken from the larger historical work employed by the author of our books. It was probably also adopted from this into the canonical collection of the Psalter, and simply brought into conformity with the headings of the other psalms by the alteration of &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1491; &#1493;&#1497;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; (and David said) into &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1500;&#1491;&#1493;&#1491; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1500;&#1506;&#1489;&#1491; ("Of David, the servant of the Lord, who spake:" Eng. ver.), and the insertion of &#1500;&#1502;&#1504;&#1510;&#1468;&#1495; ("to the chief musician:" Eng. ver.) at the head (see Delitzsch on the Psalms). "In the day," i.e., at the time, "when Jehovah had delivered him." Deliverance "out of the hand of Saul" is specially mentioned, not because this was the last, but because it was the greatest and most glorious, - a deliverance out of the deepest misery into regal might and glory. The psalm is opened by &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; in both texts.

<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#002">Sa2 22:2-4</A> form the introduction.
<p>  2  Jehovah is my rock, my castle, and my deliverer to me;
<p>  3  My Rock-God, in whom I trust:
<p>My shield and horn of my salvation, my fortress and my refuge,
<p>My Saviour; from violence Thou redeemest me.
<p>  4  I call upon the praised one, Jehovah,
<p>And I am saved from my enemies.
<p>This introduction contains the sum and substance of the whole psalm, inasmuch as David groups the many experiences of divine deliverance in his agitated life into a long series of predicates, in all of which he extols God as his defence, refuge, and deliverer. The heaping up of these predicates is an expression both of liveliest gratitude, and also of hope for the future. The different predicates, however, are not to be taken as in apposition to Jehovah, or as vocatives, but are declarations concerning God, how He had proved himself faithful to the Psalmist in all the calamities of his life, and would assuredly do so still. David calls God &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1510;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497; &#1505;&#1500;&#1506;&#1497; (my rock, and my castle) in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#004">Psa 31:4</A> as well (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#004">Psa 71:4</A>). The two epithets are borrowed from the natural character of Palestine, where steep and almost inaccessible rocks afford protection to the fugitive, as David had often found at the time when Saul was pursuing him (vid., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#022">Sa1 24:22</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#005">Sa1 22:5</A>). But whilst David took refuge in rocks, he placed his hopes of safety not in their inaccessible character, but in God the Lord, the eternal spiritual rock, whom he could see in the earthly rock, so that he called Him his true castle. &#1500;&#1497; &#1502;&#1508;&#1500;&#1496;&#1497; (my deliverer to me) gives the real explanation of the foregoing figures. The &#1500;&#1497; (to me) is omitted in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#002">Psa 18:2</A>, and only serves to strengthen the suffix, "my, yea my deliverer.' "My Rock-God," equivalent to, God who is my Rock: this is formed after <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#004">Deu 32:4</A>, where Moses calls the Lord the Rock of Israel, because of His unchangeable faithfulness; for zur, a rock, is a figure used to represent immoveable firmness. In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#003">Psa 18:3</A> we find &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;, "my God" (strong one), "my rock," two synonyms which are joined together in our text, so as to form one single predicate of God, which is repeated in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#047">Sa2 22:47</A>. The predicates which follow, "my horn and my salvation-shield," describe God as the mighty protector and defender of the righteous. A shield covers against hostile attacks. In this respect God was Abraham's shield (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#001">Gen 15:1</A>), and the helping shield of Israel (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#029">Deu 33:29</A>; cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#004">Psa 3:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#012">Psa 59:12</A>). He is the "horn of salvation," according to Luther, because He overcomes enemies, and rescues from foes, and gives salvation. The figure is borrowed from animals, which have their strength and defensive weapons in their horns (see at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#001">Sa1 2:1</A>). "My fortress:" misgab is a high place, where a person is secure against hostile attacks (see at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#010">Psa 9:10</A>). The predicates which follow, viz., my refuge, etc., are not given in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#003">Psa 18:3</A>, and are probably only added as a rhythmical completion to the strophe, which was shortened by the omission of the introductory lines, "I love thee heartily, Jehovah" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#001">Psa 18:1</A>). The last clause, "My Saviour, who redeemest me from violence," corresponds to &#1488;&#1495;&#1505;&#1492;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493; in the first hemistich. In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#004">Psa 18:4</A>, David sums up the contents of his psalm of thanksgiving in a general sentence of experience, which may be called the theme of the psalm, for it embraces "the result of the long life which lay behind him, so full of dangers and deliverances." &#1502;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500;, "the praised one," an epithet applied to God, which occurs several times in the Psalms (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#002">Psa 48:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#004">Psa 96:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#003">Psa 113:3</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#003">Psa 145:3</A>). It is in apposition to Jehovah, and is placed first for the sake of emphasis: "I invoke Jehovah as the praised one." The imperfects &#1488;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488; and &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; are used to denote what continually happens. In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#005">Sa2 22:5</A> we have the commencement of the account of the deliverances out of great tribulations, which David had experienced at the hand of God.

<p>  5  For breakers of death had compassed me,
<p>Streams of wickedness terrified me.
<p>  6  Cords of hell had girt me about,
<p>Snares of death overtook me.
<p>  7  In my distress I called Jehovah,
<p>And to my God I called;
<p>And He heard my voice out of His temple,
<p>And my crying came into His ears.
<p>David had often been in danger of death, most frequently at the time when he was pursued by Saul, but also in Absalom's conspiracy, and even in several wars (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#016">Sa2 21:16</A>). All these dangers, out of which the Lord delivered him, and not merely those which originated with Saul, are included in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#005">Sa2 22:5</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#006">Sa2 22:6</A>. The figure "breakers or waves of death" is analogous to that of the "streams of Belial." His distress is represented in both of them under the image of violent floods of water. In the psalm we find &#1502;&#1493;&#1514; &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;, "snares of death," as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#003">Psa 116:3</A>, death being regarded as a hunger with a net and snare (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#003">Psa 91:3</A>): this does not answer to well to the parallel &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1497;, and therefore is not so good, since &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500; &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497; follows immediately. &#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; (Belial), uselessness in a moral sense, or worthlessness. The meaning "mischief," or injury in a physical sense, which many expositors give to the word in this passage on account of the parallel "death," cannot be grammatically sustained. Belial was afterwards adopted as a name for the devil (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#015">Co2 6:15</A>). Streams of wickedness are calamities that proceed from wickedness, or originate with worthless men. &#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1501;, to come to meet with a hostile intention, i.e., to fall upon (vid., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#027">Job 30:27</A>). &#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500;, the temple out of which Jehovah heard him, was the heavenly abode of God, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#004">Psa 11:4</A>; for, according to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#008">Sa2 22:8</A>., God came down from heaven to help him. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#008">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 22:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">sa2 22:8</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>  8  Then the earth swayed and trembled,
<p>The foundations of the heavens shook
<p>And swayed to and fro, because He was wroth.
<p>  9  Smoke ascended in His nose,
<p>And fire out of His mouth devoured,
<p>Red-hot coals burned out of Him.
<p>10  And He bowed the heavens and came down,
<p>And cloudy darkness under His feet.
<p>Jehovah came down from heaven to save His servant, as He had formerly come down upon Sinai to conclude His covenant with Israel in the midst of terrible natural phenomena, which proclaimed the wrath of the Almighty. The theophany under which David depicts the deliverance he had experienced, had its type in the miraculous phenomenon which accompanied the descent of God upon Sinai, and which suggested, as in the song of Deborah (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#004">Jdg 5:4-5</A>), the idea of a terrible storm. It is true that the deliverance of David was not actually attended by any such extraordinary natural phenomena; but the saving hand of God from heaven was so obviously manifested, that the deliverance experienced by him could be poetically described as a miraculous interposition on the part of God. When the Lord rises up from His heavenly temple to come down upon the earth to judgment, the whole world trembles at the fierceness of His wrath. Not only does the earth tremble, but the foundations of the heavens shake: the whole universe is moved. In the psalm we have "the foundations of the hills" instead of "the foundations of the heavens," - a weaker expression, signifying the earth to its deepest foundations. The Hithpael &#1497;&#1514;&#1490;&#1468;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;, lit., to sway itself, expresses the idea of continuous swaying to and fro. &#1500;&#1493; &#1495;&#1512;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, "for it (sc., wrath) burned to him," it flamed up like a fire; cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#022">Deu 32:22</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#019">Deu 29:19</A>. "Smoke," the forerunner of fire, "ascended in His nose." The figurative idea is that of snorting or violent breathing, which indicates the rising of wrath. Smoke is followed by fire, which devours out of the mouth, i.e., bursts forth devouring or consuming all that opposes it. The expression is strengthened still further by the parallel: "red-hot coals come out of Him," i.e., the flame of red-hot coals pours out of Him as out of a glowing furnace (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#017">Gen 15:17</A>). This description is based entirely upon <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#018">Exo 19:18</A>, where the Lord comes down upon Sinai in smoke and fire. We are not to picture to ourselves flashes of lightning; for all these phenomena are merely the forerunners of the appearance of God in the clouds, which is described in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#010">Sa2 22:10</A>, "He bowed the heavens" to come down. &#1506;&#1512;&#1508;&#1500;, which is frequently connected with &#1506;&#1504;&#1503;, signifies cloudy darkness, or dark clouds. The substratum of this description is the fact that in a severe storm the heavens seem to sink down upon the earth with their dark clouds. The Lord draws near riding upon black thunder-clouds, "that the wicked may not behold His serene countenance, but only the terrible signs of His fierce wrath and punishment" (J. H. Michaelis).

<p>11  He rode upon a cherub and flew hither,
<p>And appeared upon the wings of the wind.
<p>12  He made darkness round about Him as pavilions,
<p>Water-gathering, thick clouds.
<p>13  Out of the splendour before Him
<p>Burned red-hot coals of fire.
<p>These three verses are a further expansion of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#019">Sa2 22:19</A>, and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#011">Sa2 22:11</A> of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#010">Sa2 22:10</A>. The cherub is not a personified earthly creature, for cherubim are angels around the throne of God (see at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#022">Gen 3:22</A>). The poetical figure "riding upon the cherub" is borrowed from the fact that God was enthroned between the two cherubim upon the lid of the ark of the covenant, and above their outspread wings (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#020">Exo 25:20-21</A>). As the idea of His "dwelling between the cherubim" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#002">Sa2 6:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#004">Sa1 4:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#002">Psa 80:2</A>) was founded upon this typical manifestation of the gracious presence of God in the Most Holy place, so here David depicts the descent of Jehovah from heaven as "riding upon a cherub," picturing the cherub as a throne upon which God appears in the clouds of heaven, though without therefore imagining Him as riding upon a sphinx or driving in a chariot-throne. Such notions as these are precluded by the addition of the term &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1507;, "did fly." The "flying" is also suggested by the wings of the cherubim. As the divine "shechinah" was enthroned above the ark of the covenant upon the wings of the cherubim, David in his poetical description represents the cherub and his wings as carrying the throne of God, to express the thought that Jehovah came down from heaven as the judge and saviour of His servants in the splendour of His divine glory, surrounded by cherubim who stand as His highest servants around His throne, just as Moses in his blessing (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#002">Deu 33:2</A>) speaks of Jehovah as coming out of myriads of His holy angels. The elementary substratum of this was the wings of the wind, upon which He appeared. In the psalm we have &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1491;&#1488;, from &#1491;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492;, to soar (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#039">Deu 28:39</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#040">Jer 48:40</A>), which suggests the idea of flying better than &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488; (He was seen), though the latter gives the real explanation. In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#012">Sa2 22:12</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#013">Sa2 22:13</A>, the "cloudy darkness under His feet" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#010">Sa2 22:10</A>) is still further expanded, so as to prepare the way for the description of thunder and lightning in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#014">Sa2 22:14</A>. God in His wrath withdraws His face from man. He envelopes himself in clouds. The darkness round about him is the black thunder-cloud which forms His hut or tent. The plural succoth is occasioned by the plural &#1505;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493;, "His surroundings:" it is used with indefinite generality, and is more probably the original term than &#1505;&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493; in the psalm. The "darkness" is still further explained in the second clause, &#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1514;, water-gatherings. &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1492; (&#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;.) signifies, according to the Arabic, a gathering or collection. The expression used in the psalm is &#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1514;, water-darkness, which, if not less appropriate, is at any rate not the original term. &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501; &#1506;&#1489;&#1497;, clouds of clouds, i.e., the thickest clouds; a kind of superlative, in which a synonym is used instead of the same noun.

<p>The splendour of the divine nature enveloped in clouds breaks through the dark covering in burning coals of fire. The coals of fire which burst forth, i.e., which break out in flame from the dark clouds, are the lightning which shoots forth from the dark storm-clouds in streams of fire.

<p>14  Jehovah thundered from the heavens,
<p>And the Most High gave His voice.
<p>15  He sent arrows, and scattered them;
<p>Lightning, and discomfited them.
<p>16  Then the beds of the sea became visible;
<p>The foundations of the world were uncovered,
<p>Through the threatening of Jehovah,
<p>By the snorting of the breath of His nostrils.
<p>God sent lightning as arrows upon the enemies along with violent thunder, and threw them thereby into confusion. &#1492;&#1502;&#1501;, to throw into confusion, and thereby to destroy, is the standing expression for the destruction of the foe accomplished by the miraculous interposition of God (vid., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#024">Exo 14:24</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#027">Exo 23:27</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#010">Jos 10:10</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#015">Jdg 4:15</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#010">Sa1 7:10</A>). To the thunder there were added stormy wind and earthquake, as an effect of the wrath of God, whereby the foundations of the sea and land were laid bare, i.e., whereby the depth of the abyss and of the hell in the interior of the earth, into which the person to be rescued had fallen, were disclosed.
<p>(Note: In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#013">Sa2 22:13-16</A> the text of the Psalms deviates greatly and in many instances from that before us. In v. 13 we find &#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1493;&#1490;&#1495;&#1500;&#1497; &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491; &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; &#1506;&#1489;&#1497;&#1493; instead of &#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1490;&#1468;&#1495;&#1500;&#1497; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;; and after v. 14 &#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1493;&#1490;&#1495;&#1500;&#1497; &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491; is repeated in the psalm. In v. 15 we have &#1512;&#1489; &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501; for &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1511;, and in v. 16 &#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1508;&#1497;&#1511;&#1497; for &#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1508;&#1497;&#1511;&#1497;. The other deviations are inconsiderable. So far as the repetition of &#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1493;&#1490;&#1495;&#1500;&#1497; &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491; at the end of v. 14 is concerned, it is not only superfluous, but unsuitable, because the lightning following the thunder is described in v. 15, and the words repeated are probably nothing more than a gloss that has crept by an oversight into the text. The &#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1508;&#1497;&#1511;&#1497; in v. 16 is an obvious softening down of the &#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1508;&#1497;&#1511;&#1497; of the text before us. In the other deviations, however, the text of the Psalms is evidently the more original of the two; the abridgment of the second clause of v. 13 is evidently a simplification of the figurative description in the psalm, and &#1512;&#1489; &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501; in the 15th verse of the psalm is more poetical and a stronger expression than the mere &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1511; of our text.)

<p>17  He reached out of the height, He laid hold of me;
<p>Drew me out of great waters:
<p>18  Saved me from my enemy strong;
<p>From my haters, because they were too strong for me.
<p>19  They fell upon me in my day of calamity:
<p>Then Jehovah became my stay,
<p>20  And led me out into a broad place;
<p>Delivered me, because He had pleasure in me.
<p>The Lord stretched His hand from the height into the deep abysses, which had been uncovered through the threatening of the wrath of God, and drew out the sinking man. &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; without &#1497;&#1491; is used to denote the stretching out of the hand, and in the sense of reaching out to a thing (as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#006">Sa2 6:6</A>). &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1502;&#1497;&#1501; (great waters) does not refer to the enemy, but to the calamities and dangers (waves of death and streams of Belial, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#005">Sa2 22:5</A>) into which the enemies of the Psalmist had plunged him. &#1497;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;, from &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#010">Exo 2:10</A>), from which the name of Moses was derived, to whom there is probably an allusion made. As Moses was taken out of the waters of the Nile, so David was taken out of great (many) waters. This deliverance is still further depicted in a more literal terms in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#018">Sa2 22:18</A>. &#1506;&#1494; &#1488;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497;, my enemy strong, poetical for my strong enemy, does not refer to one single enemy, namely Saul; but, as the parallel "my haters" shows, is a poetical personification of all his enemies. They were stronger than David, therefore the Lord had to deliver him with an almighty hand. The "day of calamity" in which the enemy fell upon him (&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1501;: see at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#006">Sa2 22:6</A>) was the time when David wandered about in the desert helpless and homeless, fleeing from the pursuit of Saul. The Lord was then his support, or a staff on which he could support himself (vid., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#004">Psa 23:4</A>), and led him out of the strait into the broad, i.e., into a broad space where he could move freely, because God had pleasure in him, and had chosen him in His grace to be His servant. This reason for his deliverance is carried out still further in what follows.

<p>21  Jehovah rendered to me according to my righteousness,
<p>According to the cleanness of my hands He recompensed me.
<p>22  For I have observed the ways of Jehovah,
<p>And have not wickedly departed from my God.
<p>23  For all His rights are before my eyes;
<p>And His statutes,-I do not depart from them.
<p>24  And I was innocent towards Him,
<p>And kept myself from mine iniquity.
<p>&#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500; signifies to do to a person good or evil, like the Greek &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#834; and &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;. The righteousness and cleanness of hands, i.e., the innocence, which David attributed to himself, were not perfect righteousness or holiness before God, but the righteousness of his endeavours and deeds as contrasted with the unrighteousness and wickedness of his adversaries and pursuers, and consisted in the fact that he endeavoured earnestly and sincerely to walk in the ways of God and to keep the divine commandments. &#1502;&#1503; &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;, to be wicked from, is a pregnant expression, signifying to depart wickedly from God. &#1500;&#1504;&#1490;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;, i.e., as a standard before my eye. In the psalm we find &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493; &#1514;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, innocent in intercourse with the Lord, instead of &#1500;&#1493; &#1514;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; (see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#013">Deu 18:13</A>); and for the fact itself, David's own testimony in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#023">Sa1 26:23-24</A>, the testimony of God concerning him in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#008">Kg1 14:8</A>, and the testimony of history in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#005">Kg1 15:5</A>. &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;, from mine iniquity, i.e., from the iniquity which I might have committed.

<p>25  Thus Jehovah repaid me according to my righteousness,
<p>According to my cleanness before His eyes.
<p>26  Towards the pious Thou showest thyself pious,
<p>Towards the perfectly innocent Thou showest thyself innocent.
<p>27  Towards the genuine Thou showest thyself genuine,
<p>And towards the perverse Thou showest thyself crooked.
<p>28  And afflicted people Thou helpest,
<p>And Thine eyes are against the haughty; them Thou humblest.
<p>The motive for deliverance, which was expounded in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#021">Sa2 22:21-24</A>, is summed up briefly in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#025">Sa2 22:25</A>; and then in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#026">Sa2 22:26</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#027">Sa2 22:27</A> it is carried back to the general truth, that the conduct of God towards men is regulated according to the conduct of men towards God. The vav cons. in &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; expresses the logical consequence. &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497; is used instead of &#1497;&#1491;&#1497; &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#021">Sa2 22:21</A>, which is repeated in the psalm simply for the sake of variation. The truth that God treats every man in accordance with his conduct towards Him, is expounded in four parallel clauses, in which the conduct of God is expressed in verbs in the Hithpael, formed from the adjectives used to describe the conduct of men towards God. To the &#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1491;, the pious or devoted to God, He also shows himself pious; and innocent, blameless, to the &#1514;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;, the man strong in innocence, who walks in perfect innocence. &#1504;&#1489;&#1512;, a Niphal participle, from &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1512;, he who keeps himself pure, strives after purity of walk. &#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;, an anomalous contraction of &#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1512; (Ps.), analogous to the formation of &#1504;&#1489;&#1512; for &#1504;&#1489;&#1512;&#1512;. The form &#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500; for &#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1500;, to show one's self perverse of crooked, is still more anomalous. God shows himself so towards the perverse, by giving him up to his perverseness (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#028">Rom 1:28</A>). This general truth is applied in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#028">Sa2 22:28</A> to the congregation of God, in the contrast which it presents of humble and haughty, and is expounded from the conduct of God, as displayed in the history of Israel, towards these two classes of men, into which the nation was divided. In the psalm, therefore, we find &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, for which the simple &#1493; is substituted here, because the verse does not contain any actual reason for what goes before. &#1506;&#1504;&#1497; &#1506;&#1501;, afflicted people, is used to denote the pious and depressed in the nation; &#1512;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, the high, i.e., the haughty, or godless rich and mighty in the nation. &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500; is to be taken as a relative: whom Thou humblest (see Ewald, 332, b.; and for the thought, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#011">Isa 2:11</A>). In the psalm the unusual mode of expression in the second clause is changed into the more common phrase, "Thou bringest down high, i.e., proud looks" (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#017">Pro 6:17</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#004">Pro 21:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#013">Pro 30:13</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#001">Psa 131:1</A>, etc.).

<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#029">Sa2 22:29</A> commences the description of the help which David had already received from God in his conflict with the enemies of Israel, and which he would still receive.
<p>29  For Thou art my lamp, O Jehovah!
<p>And Jehovah maketh my darkness bright.
<p>30  For through Thee I run troops,
<p>And through my God I leap walls.
<p>31  God - innocent is His way.
<p>The word of Jehovah is refined,
<p>A shield is He to all who trust in Him.
<p>The explanatory &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, with which the new description of the divine mercy commences, refers to the thought implied in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#028">Sa2 22:28</A>, that David belonged to the "afflicted people," whom the Lord always helps. As the Lord delivered him out of the danger of death, because He took pleasure in him, so He also gave him power over all his enemies. For He was his lamp, i.e., He had lifted him out of a condition of depression and contempt into one of glory and honour (see at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#017">Sa2 21:17</A>), and would still further enlighten his darkness, i.e., "would cause the light of His salvation to shine upon him and his tribe in all the darkness of their distress" (Hengstenberg). In the psalm the verse reads thus: "For Thou lightest (makest bright) my lamp (or candle), Jehovah my God enlighteneth my darkness;" the bold figure "Jehovah the lamp of David" being more literally explained. The figure is analogous to the one in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#001">Psa 27:1</A>, "The Lord is my light;" whilst the form &#1504;&#1497;&#1512; is a later mode of writing &#1504;&#1512;.

<p>In the strength of his God he could run hostile troops and leap walls, i.e., overcome every hostile power. &#1488;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;, not from &#1512;&#1510;&#1509;, to smash in pieces, but from &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;, to run; construed with the accusative according to the analogy of verbs of motion.

<p>He derives this confidence from the acts of God, and also from His word. &#1492;&#1488;&#1500; (God) is written absolutely, like &#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#004">Deu 32:4</A>. The article points back to &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;. Jehovah is the God (&#1492;&#1488;&#1500;), whose way is perfect, without blemish; and His word is refined brass, pure silver (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#007">Psa 12:7</A>). He who trusts in Him is safe from all foes. The last two clauses occur again in Agur's proverbs (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#005">Pro 30:5</A>). The thought of the last clause is still further explained in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#032">Sa2 22:32</A>.

<p>32  For who is God save Jehovah,
<p>And who a rock save our God?
<p>33  This God is my strong fortress,
<p>And leads the innocent his way.
<p>34  He makes my feet like the hinds,
<p>And setteth me upon my high places;
<p>35  He teacheth my hands to fight,
<p>And my arms span brazen bows.
<p>There is no true God who can help, except or by the side of Jehovah (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#031">Deu 32:31</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#002">Sa1 2:2</A>). &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#002">Sa2 22:2</A>. This God is "my strong fortress:" for this figure, comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#005">Psa 31:5</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#001">Psa 27:1</A>. &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;, strength, might, is construed with &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;&#1497;, by free subordination: "my fortress, a strong one," like &#1506;&#1494; &#1502;&#1495;&#1505;&#1497; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#007">Psa 71:7</A>; cf. Ewald, 291, b.). &#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512; for &#1497;&#1514;&#1512;, from &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; (vid., Ges. 72; Olshausen, Gram. p. 579), in the sense of leading or taking round, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#026">Pro 12:26</A>. God leads the innocent his way, i.e., He is his leader and guide therein. The Keri &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497; rests upon a misunderstanding. There is an important difference in the reading of this verse in Ps 18, viz., "The God who girdeth me with strength, and makes my way innocent." The last clause is certainly an alteration which simplifies the meaning, and so is also the first clause, the thought of which occurs again, word for word, in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#040">Sa2 22:40</A>, with the addition of &#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1495;&#1502;&#1492;. &#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492; or &#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;, the hind, or female stag, is a figure of speech denoting swiftness in running. "Like the hinds:" a condensed simile for "like the hinds' feet," such as we frequently meet with in Hebrew (vid., Ges. 144, Anm.). The reference is to swiftness in pursuit of the foe (vid., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#018">Sa2 2:18</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#008">Ch1 12:8</A>). &#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;, his feet, for &#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497; (my feet) in the psalm, may be accounted for from the fact, that David had spoken of himself in the third person as the innocent one. "My high places" were not the high places of the enemy, that became his by virtue of conquest, but the high places of his own land, which he maintained triumphantly, so that he ruled the land for them. The expression is formed after <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#013">Deu 32:13</A>, and is imitated in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#019">Hab 3:19</A>. &#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1491; is generally construed with a double accusative: here it is written with an accusative and &#1500;, and signifies to instruct for the war. &#1504;&#1495;&#1514;, in the psalm &#1504;&#1495;&#1514;&#1492;, on account of the feminine &#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1506;&#1514;&#1497;, is not the Niphal of &#1495;&#1514;&#1514;, to be broken in pieces, but the Piel of &#1504;&#1495;&#1514;, to cause to go down, to press down the bow, i.e., to set it. The bow of brass is mentioned as being the strongest: setting such a bow would be a sign of great heroic strength. The two verses (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#034">Sa2 22:34</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#035">Sa2 22:35</A>) are simply a particularizing description of the power and might with which the Lord had endowed David to enable him to conquer all his foes.

<p>36  And Thou reachest me the shield of my salvation,
<p>And Thy hearing makes me great.
<p>37  Thou makest my steps broad under me,
<p>And my ankles have not trembled.
<p>The Lord bestows the true strength for victory in His salvation. The shield of salvation is the shield which consists of salvation, of the helping grace of the Lord. &#1506;&#1504;&#1514;&#1498;, for which we find in the psalm &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;&#1498;, thy humility, i.e., God's condescending grace, does not mean "thy humiliation," but "thy hearkening," i.e., that practical hearkening on the part of God, when called upon for help, which was manifested in the fact that God made his steps broad, i.e., provided the walker with a broad space for free motion, removing obstructions and stumbling-blocks out of the way. God had done this for David, so that his ankles had not trembled, i.e., he had not been wanting in the power to take firm and safe steps. In this strength of his God he could destroy all his foes.

<p>38  I will pursue my enemies and destroy them,
<p>I will not turn till they are consumed.
<p>39  I will consume them and dash them in pieces, that they may not arise,
<p>And may fall under my feet.
<p>40  And Thou girdest me with strength for war,
<p>Thou bowest mine adversaries under me.
<p>41  And Thou makest mine enemies turn the back to me;
<p>My haters, I root them out.
<p>The optative form &#1488;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1508;&#1492; serves to make the future signification of &#1488;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1507; (in the psalm) the more apparent. Consequently it is quite out of the question to take the other verbs as preterites. We are not compelled to do this by the interchange of imperfects c. vav consec. with simple imperfects, as the vav consec. is not used exclusively as expressive of the past. On the contrary, the substance of the whole of the following description shows very clearly that David refers not only to the victories he has already won, but in general to the defeat of all his foes in the past, the present, and the future; for he speaks as distinctly as possible not only of their entire destruction (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#038">Sa2 22:38</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#039">Sa2 22:39</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#043">Sa2 22:43</A>), but also of the fact that God makes him the head of the nations, and distant and foreign nations to him homage. Consequently he refers not only to his own personal dominion, but also, on the strength of the promise which he had received from God, to the increase of the dominion of the throne of his house, whilst he proclaims in the Spirit the ultimate defeat of all the enemies of the kingdom of God. This Messianic element in the following description comes out in a way that cannot be mistaken, in the praise of the Lord with which he concludes in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#047">Sa2 22:47-51</A>. &#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491;&#1501;, "I destroy them," is stronger than &#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1497;&#1490;&#1501;, "I reach them" (in the psalm). In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#039">Sa2 22:39</A> the words are crowded together, to express the utter destruction of all foes. In the psalm &#1493;&#1488;&#1499;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501; is omitted. &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;&#1504;&#1497; for &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1494;&#1468;&#1512;&#1504;&#1497; in the psalm is not a poetical Syriasm, and still less a "careless solecism" (Hupfeld), but a simple contraction, such as we meet with in many forms: e.g., &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1508;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; for &#1502;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1508;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#011">Job 35:11</A>; cf. Ewald, 232, b.). The form &#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; for &#1504;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; (in the psalm) is unusual, and the aphaeresis of the &#1504; can only be accounted for from the fact that this much-used word constantly drops its &#1504; as a radical sound in the imperfect (see Ewald, 195, c.). The phrase &#1506;&#1512;&#1507; &#1500;&#1468;&#1497; &#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; is formed after <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#027">Exo 23:27</A>. "Giving the enemy to a person's back" means causing them to turn the back, i.e., putting them to flight.

<p>42  They look out, but there is no deliverer;
<p>For Jehovah, but He answereth them not.
<p>43  And I rub in pieces as the dust of the earth,
<p>Like the mire of the streets I crush them and stamp upon them.
<p>The cry of the foe for help is not attended to; they are annihilated without quarter. &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;, to look out to God for help (with &#1488;&#1500; and &#1506;&#1500;; vid., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#007">Isa 17:7-8</A>), is more poetical than &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;, "they cry" (in the psalm); and &#1499;&#1468;&#1506;&#1508;&#1512;&#1470;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; is more simple than &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1470;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; &#1499;&#1468;&#1506;&#1508;&#1512; (in the psalm), "I crush them as dust before the wind," for the wind does not crush the dust, but carries it away. In the second clause of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#043">Sa2 22:43</A>, &#1488;&#1491;&#1511;&#1468;&#1501; is used instead of &#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1511;&#1501; in the psalm, and strengthened by &#1488;&#1512;&#1511;&#1506;&#1501;. &#1488;&#1491;&#1511;&#1468;&#1501;, from &#1491;&#1511;&#1511;, to make thin, to crush; so that instead of "I pour them out like mire of the streets which is trodden to pieces," the Psalmist simply says, "I crush and stamp upon them like mire of the streets." Through the utter destruction of the foe, God establishes the universal dominion to which the throne of David is to attain. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#044">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 22:44</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_044">sa2 22:44</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>44  And Thou rescuest me out of the strivings of my people,
<p>Preservest me to be the head of the heathen.
<p>People that I knew not serve me.
<p>45  The sons of the stranger dissemble to me,
<p>Upon hearsay they obey me.
<p>46  The sons of the stranger despair,
<p>And tremble out of their castles.
<p>By "the strivings of my people" the more indefinite expression in the psalm, "strivings of the people," is explained. The words refer to the domestic conflicts of David, out of which the Lord delivered him, such as the opposition of Ishbosheth and the rebellions of Absalom and Sheba. These deliverances formed the prelude and basis of his dominion over the heathen. Consequently &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1504;&#1497; (Thou preservest me to be the head of the nations) occurs quite appropriately in the second clause; and &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1502;&#1504;&#1497;, "Thou settest me," which occurs in the psalm, is a far less pregnant expression. &#1506;&#1501; before &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1500;&#1488; is used indefinitely to signify foreign nations. Toi king of Hamath (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#010">Sa2 8:10</A>) was an example, and his subjugation was a prelude of the future subjection of all the heathen to the sceptre of the Son of David, as predicted in Ps 72. In v. 45 the two clauses of the psalm are very appropriately transposed. The Hithpael &#1497;&#1514;&#1499;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;, as compared with &#1497;&#1499;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;, is the later form. In the primary passage (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#029">Deu 33:29</A>) the Niphal is used to signify the dissembling of friendship, or of involuntary homage on the part of the vanquished towards the victor. &#1488;&#1494;&#1503; &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493;&#1506;, "by the hearing of the ear," i.e., by hearsay, is a simple explanation of &#1488;&#1494;&#1503; &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;, at the rumour of the ears (vid., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#005">Job 42:5</A>), i.e., at the mere rumour of David's victories. The foreign nations pine away, i.e., despair of ever being able to resist the victorious power of David. &#1497;&#1495;&#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;, "they gird themselves," does not yield any appropriate meaning, even if we should take it in the sense of equipping themselves to go out to battle. The word is probably a misspelling of &#1497;&#1495;&#1512;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;, which occurs in the psalm, &#1495;&#1512;&#1490; being a &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. in the sense of being terrified, or trembling: they tremble out of their castles, i.e., they come trembling out of their castles (for the thought itself, see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#017">Mic 7:17</A>). It is by no means probable that the word &#1495;&#1512;&#1490;, which is so frequently met with in Hebrew, is used in this one passage in the sense of "to limp," according to Syriac usage.
<p>In conclusion, the Psalmist returns to the praise of the Lord, who had so highly favoured him.

<p>47  Jehovah liveth, and blessed is my rock,
<p>And the God of my refuge of salvation is exalted.
<p>48  The God who giveth me vengeance,
<p>And bringeth nations under me;
<p>49  Who leadeth me out from mine enemies,
<p>And exalteth me above mine adversaries,
<p>Delivereth me from the man of violence.
<p>The formula &#1495;&#1497;&#1470;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; does not mean "let Jehovah live," for the word &#1497;&#1495;&#1497; would be used for that (vid., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#016">Sa2 16:16</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#024">Sa1 10:24</A>), but is a declaration: "the Lord is living." The declaration itself is to be taken as praise of God, for "praising God is simply ascribing to Him the glorious perfections which belong to him; we have only to give Him what is His own" (Hengstenberg). The following clauses also contain simply declarations; this is evident from the word &#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;, since the optative &#1497;&#1512;&#1501; would be used to denote a wish. The Lord is living or alive when He manifests His life in acts of omnipotence. In the last clause, the expression &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; (rock) is intensified into &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1497; &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497; (the God of my refuge, or rock, of salvation), i.e., the God who is my saving rock (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#003">Sa2 22:3</A>). In the predicates of God in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#048">Sa2 22:48</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#049">Sa2 22:49</A>, the saving acts depicted by David in vv. 5-20 and 29-46 are summed up briefly. Instead of &#1502;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1491;, "He causes to go down under me," i.e., He subjects to me, we find in the psalm &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;, "He drives nations under me," and &#1502;&#1508;&#1500;&#1496;&#1497; instead of &#1502;&#1493;&#1510;&#1497;&#1488;&#1497;; and lastly, instead of &#1495;&#1502;&#1505; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; in the psalm, we have here &#1495;&#1502;&#1505;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#002">Psa 140:2</A>. Therefore the praise of the Lord shall be sounded among all nations.

<p>50  Therefore will I praise Thee, O Jehovah, among the nations,
<p>And sing praise to Thy name.
<p>51  As He who magnifies the salvation of His king,
<p>And showeth grace to His anointed,
<p>To David, and his seed for ever.
<p>The grace which the Lord had shown to David was so great, that the praise thereof could not be restricted to the narrow limits of Israel. With the dominion of David over the nations, there spread also the knowledge, and with this the praise, of the Lord who had given him the victory. Paul was therefore perfectly justified in quoting the verse before us (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#050">Sa2 22:50</A>) in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#009">Rom 16:9</A>, along with <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#043">Deu 32:43</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa117.htm#001">Psa 117:1</A>, as a proof that the salvation of God was intended for the Gentiles also. The king whose salvation the Lord had magnified, was not David as an individual, but David and his seed for ever-that is to say, the royal family of David which culminated in Christ. David could thus sing praises upon the ground of the promise which he had received (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#012">Sa2 7:12-16</A>), and which is repeated almost verbatim in the last clause of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#051">Sa2 22:51</A>. The Chethib &#1502;&#1490;&#1491;&#1497;&#1500; is the Hiphil participle &#1502;&#1490;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;, according to Ps. 18:51; and the Keri &#1502;&#1490;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1500;, "tower of the fulness of salvation," is a singular conjecture.
