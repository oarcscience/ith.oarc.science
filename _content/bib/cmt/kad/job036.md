### [Job Chapter 36](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#001)

[Job 36:1](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 36:1</span></span>

1 Then Elihu continued and said:

2 Suffer me a little, and I will inform thee,

For there is something still to be said for Eloah.

3 I will fetch my knowledge from afar,

And to my Creator will I ascribe right.

4 For truly my words are not lies,

One perfect in knowledge stands before thee.

Elihu's preceding three speeches were introduced by ויּען; this fourth,
in honour of the number three, is introduced only as a continuation of
the others. Job is to wait yet a little while, for he still has (= עוד
לּי), or: there still are, words in favour of Eloah; i.e., what may be
said in vindication of God against Job's complaints and accusations is
not yet exhausted. This appears to be the only instance of the Aramaic
כּתּר being taken up as Hebr.; whereas הוּה, nunciare (Arab. wḥâ, I,
IV), is a poetic Aramaism occurring even in [Psa
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#003) (comp. on the construction [Job
32:6](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#006)); and זעיר (a diminutive form,
after the manner of the Arab. zu‛air) belongs in [Isa
28:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#010), [Isa
28:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#013) to the popular language (of
Jerusalem), but is here used poetically. The verb נשׂא, [Job
36:3](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#003), is not to be understood
according to נשׂא משׁל, but according to [Kg1
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#011); and למרחוק signifies, as also
[Job 39:29](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#029); [Isa
37:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#026), e longinquo, viz., out of the
wide realm of history and nature. The expression נתן צדק follows the
analogy of (עז) נתן כבוד. דּעה, [Job
36:4](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#004), interchanges with the דּע which
belongs exclusively to Elihu, since Elihu styles himself תּמים דּעות, as
[Job 37:16](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#016) God תּמים דּעים (comp. [Sa1
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#003), אל דּעות). תמים in this
combination with דעות cannot be intended of purity of character; but as
Elihu there attributes absolute perfection of knowledge in every
direction to God, so here, in reference to the theodicy which he opposes
to Job, he claims faultlessness and clearness of perception.

[Job 36:5](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 36:5</span></span>

5 Behold, God is mighty, and yet doth not act scornfully,

Mighty in power of understanding.

6 He preserveth not the life of the ungodly,

And to the afflicted He giveth right.

7 He withdraweth not His eyes from the righteous,

But with kings on the throne

He establisheth them for ever, and they are exalted.

The obj. that must be mentally supplied to ימאס ולא is, as in [Job
42:6](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#006), to be derived from the
connection. The idea of the verb is, as in [Job
8:20](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#020) : He is exalted, without however
looking down disdainfully (non despicit) from His height, or more
definitely: without setting Himself above the justice due to even the
meanest of His creatures - great in power of heart (comp. [Job
34:33](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#033) אנשׁי לבב, Arab. ûlû-l-elbâb),
i.e., understanding (νοῦς πνεῦμα), to see through right and wrong
everywhere and altogether. [Job 36:6](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#006),
[Job 36:7](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#007) describe how His rule among
men evinces this not merely outward but spiritual superiority coupled
with condescension to the lowly. The notion of the object, ואת־מלכים
לכּסּא (as [Isa 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#011) the subject),
becomes the more distinctly prominent by virtue of the fut. consec.
which follows like a conclusion, and takes it up again. Ewald thinks
this explanation contrary to the accents and the structure of the
sentence itself; but it is perfectly consistent with the former, and
indisputably syntactic (Ges. 129, 2, b, and Ew. himself, 344, b). [Psa
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#005), comp. [Psa
132:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#012), [Isa
47:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#001), shows how לכסא is intended (He
causes them to sit upon the throne). [Job
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#011); [Sa1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#008); [Psa
113:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#007). are parallel passages.

[Job 36:8](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 36:8</span></span>

8 And if they are bound with chains,

Holden in cords of affliction:

9 Then He declareth to them their doing

And their transgressions, that they have been vainglorious;

10 Then He openeth their ear to warning,

And commandeth them to turn from iniquity.

The subj. is in no case the רשׁעים (Hahn), but the צדיקים, or those who
are as susceptible to discipline as it is needful to them, just as in Ps
107, which in general presents many instances for an extensive
comparison with the speeches of Elihu. The chains, [Job
36:8](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#008), are meant literally, and the
bands, [Job 36:8](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#008), figuratively; the
Psalmist couples both in אסירי עני וברזל, [Psa
107:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#010). The conclusion begins with
[Job 36:9](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#009), and is repeated in another
application, [Job 36:10](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#010). פּעל in the
sense of maleficium, as Arab. fa‛alat, recalls מעשׂה, facinus, [Job
33:17](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#017). כּי, [Job
36:9](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#009), as in [Job
36:10](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#010), an objective quod. It is not
translated, however, quod invaluerint (Rosenm.), which is opposed to the
most natural sense of the Hithpa., but according to [Job
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#025) : quod sese extulerint. מוּסר,
παιδεία, disciplina, interchanges here with the more rare מסר used in
[Job 33:16](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#016); there we have already also
met with the phrase גּלה אזן, to uncover the ear, i.e., to open. אמר כּי
corresponds to the Arab. amara an (bi-an), to command that. The
fundamental thought of Elihu here once again comes unmistakeably to
view: the sufferings of the righteous are well-meant chastisements,
which are to wean them from the sins into which through carnal security
they have fallen - a warning from God to penitence, designed to work
their good.

[Job 36:11](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 36:11</span></span>

11 If they hear and yield,

They pass their days in prosperity

And their years in pleasure.

12 And if they hear not,

They pass away by the bow

And expire in lack of knowledge.

Since a declaration of the divine will has preceded in [Job
36:10](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#010), it is more natural to take
ויעבדוּ in the sense of obsequi, to do the will of another (as [Kg1
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#007), comp. מעבּד from עבד in the
generalized sense of facere), than, with Umbr., in the sense of colere
scil. Deum (as [Isa 19:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#023), Arab.
‛âbid, one who reveres God, a godly person). Instead of יבלּוּ, [Isa
65:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#022) (on which the Masora observes
לית, i.e., "nowhere else") and [Job
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#013) Chethb, 'it is here without
dispute יכלּוּ (Targ. ישׁלּמוּן, peragent, as [Eze
43:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#027)). נעימים is, as [Psa
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#006), a neutral masc.: amoena. On עבר
בשׁלח, to precipitate one's self into the weapon, i.e., to incur
peremptory punishment, comp. [Job
33:18](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#018). On בבלי דעת comp. [Job
35:16](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#016); [Job
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#021). Impenitence changes affliction,
which is intended to be a means of rescue, into total destruction; yet
there are some who will not be warned and affrighted by it.

[Job 36:13](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 36:13</span></span>

13 Yet the hypocrites in heart cherish wrath,

They cry not when He hath chained them.

14 Thus their soul dieth in the vigour of youth,

And their life is like that of the unclean.

15 Yet He delivereth the sufferer by his affliction,

And openeth their ear by oppression.

He who is angry with God in his affliction, and does not humbly pray to
Him, shows thereby that he is a חנף, one estranged from God (on the idea
of the root, vid., i. 216), and not a צדיק. This connection renders it
natural to understand not the divine wrath by אף: θησαυρίζουσιν ὀργήν
(Rosenm. after [Rom 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#005)), or: they
heap up wrath upon themselves (Wolfson, who supplies עליהם), but the
impatience, discontent, and murmuring of man himself: they cherish or
harbour wrath, viz., בּלבּם (comp. [Job
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#022), where שׁים בלב signifies to
take to heart, but at the same time to preserve in the heart). Used thus
absolutely, שׂים signifies elsewhere in the book, to give attention to,
[Job 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#020); [Job
24:12](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#012); [Job
34:23](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#023), or (as Arab. wḍ‛) to lay down a
pledge; here it signifies reponunt s. recondunt (with an implied in
ipsis), as also Arab. šâm, fut. i, to conceal with the idea of sinking
into (immittentem), e.g., the sword in the sheath. With תּמת, for ותּמת
([Isa 50:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#002)) or ותמת, the punishment
which issues forth undistinguished from this frustration of the divine
purpose of grace follows ἀσυνδέτως, as e.g., [Hos
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#016). חיּה interchanges with נפשׁ, as
[Job 33:22](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#022), [Job
33:28](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#028); נער (likewise a favourite word
with Elihu) is intended just as [Job
33:25](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#025), and in the [Psa
88:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#016), which resembles both the Elihu
section and the rest of the book. The Beth of בּקּדשׁים has the sense of
aeque ac (Targ. היך), as [Job 34:36](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#036),
comp. תּחת, [Job 34:26](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#026). Jer.
translates inter effeminatos; for קדשׁים (heathenish, equivalent to
קדושׁים, as כּמרים, heathenish, equivalent to כּהנים) are the
consecrated men, who yielded themselves up, like the women in honour of
the deity, to passive, prematurely-enervating incontinence (vid., Keil
on [Deu 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#018)), a heathenish
abomination prevailing now and again even in Israel ([Kg1
14:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#024); [Kg1
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#012); [Kg1
22:47](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#047)), which was connected with the
worship of Astarte and Baal that was transferred from Syria, and to
which allusion is here made, in accordance with the scene of the book.
For the sufferer, on the other hand, who suffers not merely of
necessity, but willingly, this his suffering is a means of rescue and
moral purification. Observe the play upon the words יחלּץ and בּלחץ. The
Beth in both instances is, in accordance with Elihu's fundamental
thought, the Beth instrum.

[Job 36:16](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 36:16</span></span>

16 And He even bringeth thee out of the jaws of distress

To a broad place, whose ground hath no straitness,

And the adorning of thy table shall be full of fatness.

17 Yet thou art become full of the judging of the evil-doer:

Judging and judgment lay hold on one another!

18 For let not anger indeed entice thee to scorning,

And let not the greatness of the ransom mislead thee.

With [Job 36:16](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#016) Elihu passes over to
the application to Job of what he said in the preceding strophe. Since
it is usual to place אף (like גּם and אך) at the beginning of the
sentence, although not belonging to the member of the sentence which
immediately follows, ואף הסיתך for והסית אף אתך cannot be remarkable.
The praet. הסיתך is not promissory, but Elihu says with what design God
has decreed the present suffering for Job. הסית מן is like [Ch2
18:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#031) : out of distress (צר for צר by
Rebia magnum), which has him in its jaws, and threatens to swallow him,
God brings him away to great prosperity; a thought which Elihu expresses
in the imagery of the Psalms of a broad place and a bountiful table
(comp. e.g., [Psa 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#002); [Psa
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#005)). רחב is locative, and לא־מוּצק
תּחתּיה is either a relative clause: whose beneath (ground) is not
straitened, no-straitness (in which case מוּצק would not be constr. from
the n. hophal. מוּצק, Isa.[Isa 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#001),
but absol. after the form מחנק, [Job
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#015), Ew. 160, c, Anm. 4), Saad. Arab.
lâ ḍı̂q fı̂ mûḍ‛hâ (cujus in loco non angustiae); or it is virtually an
adj.: without (לא = בּלא, as [Job
34:24](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#024)), comp. on [Job
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#024)) straitness of what is beneath
them, eorum quae sub se habet (comp. on [Job
28:5](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#005)). רחב is fem., like רחוב, [Dan
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025). A special clause takes the place
of the locative, [Job 36:16](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#016) : and the
settling or spreading, i.e., the provision (from נוּח, to come down
gradually, to seat one's self) of thy table shall be full of fatness.
מלא (whether it be adj. or verb) is treated by attraction, according to
the gender of the governed noun; and it is unnecessary, with Rosenm. and
others, to derive נחת from נחת (Aram. for ירד).

In [Job 36:17](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#017), דּין is intended of
Job's negative judgment concerning God and His dealings (comp. [Psa
76:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#009), where it signifies a judicial
decision, and [Pro 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#010), where it
signifies a wrangling refusal of a fair decision). [Job
36:17](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#017) is not a conditional clause
(Hahn), in which case the praet. hypothet. would have a prominent
position, but an adversative predicative clause: but (nevertheless) thou
art full of the judging of the evil-doer (evil judging); after which,
just as ἀσυνδέτως as [Job 36:14](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#014), the
sad issue in which this judging after the manner of evil-doers results
is expressed: such judging and judgment border closely upon one another.
Rd., Dietr., and Schlottm. have wrongly reproduced this idea, discerned
by Ges., when they translate: judgment and sentence (guilt and
punishment) shall seize thee. יתמכוּ, prehendunt scil. se (Ebr.: put
forth the hand), is used like the Aram. סמך, to draw nearer, fasten
together (Rabb. סמוּך, near at hand), Arab. tamâsaka (from Arab. msk =
סמך, as e.g., hanash = נחשׁ). In [Job
36:18](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#018) we leave the signification thick
milk or cream (חמה = חמאה, as [Job
29:6](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#006)) to those who persuade themselves
that cream can be metaphorically equivalent to superfluity (Ew., Hirz.,
Vaih., Hlgst.). Renan's translation: N'espre pas dtourner la colre de
Dieu par une amende, we also leave as a simple puzzle to its discoverer,
who, with this one exception, is destitute of thoughts proper to the
book of Job. In general, the thought, "do not imagine by riches, by a
great ransom, to be able to satisfy the claims of God," is altogether
out of place here. Moreover, חמה, which, as e.g., דּאגה, [Pro
12:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#025) (Ew. 174, g), is construed as
masc., cannot be understood of God's wrath, since the poet by הסית will
not at one time have ascribed to God a well-meant incitation, at another
an enticement in malam partem. That which allures is Job's own חמה, and
that not the excitement of his affliction (Hahn), but of his passion;
comp. אף, [Job 36:13](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#013). שׂפק is,
however, to be explained according to [Job
34:37](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#037), comp. [Job
27:23](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#023) (clapping of hands = derision);
and כּפר signifies reconciliation or expiation, as [Job
33:24](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#024). Elihu admonishes Job not to
allow himself to be drawn by the heat of passion into derision, or to
deride; nor to be allured from the right way by the ransom which is
required of him as the price of restoration to happiness, viz., humble
submission to the divine chastisement, as though this ransom were
exceeding great. The connection is clear: an adverse verdict (דּין) and
condemnation (משׁפּט) are closely connected; for (כּי) hastiness of
temper, let it not (פּן( ton ti ) lead thee astray ... thou wouldst not
escape the judgment of God!

[Job 36:19](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 36:19</span></span>

19 Shall thy crying place thee beyond distress,

And all the efforts of strength?

20 Long not for the night to come,

Which shall remove people from their place!

21 Take heed, incline not to evil;

For this thou hast desired more than affliction.

Those expositors who found in [Job
36:18](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#018) the warning, that Job should not
imagine that he would be able to redeem himself from judgment by a large
ransom, go on to explain: will He esteem thy riches? (Farisol, Rosenm.,
Umbr., Carey, Ebr., and others); or: will thy riches suffice? (Hirz.,
Schlottm.); or some other way (Ew.). But apart from the want of
connection of this insinuation, which is otherwise not mentioned in the
book, and apart from the violence which must be done to היערך to
accommodate it to it, שׁוּע, although it might, as the abstract of שׁוע,
[Job 34:19](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#019), signify wealth (comp.
Arab. sa‛at, amplitudo), is, however, according to the usage of the
language (vid., [Job 30:24](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#024)), so far as
we can trace it, a secondary form of שׁוע (שׁועה), a cry for help; and
[Job 35:9](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#009)., [Job
36:13](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#013), and other passages, also point
to this signification. What follows is still less appropriate to this
thought of ransom; Hirz. translates: Oh, not God and all the treasures
of wealth! But בּצר is nowhere equivalent to בּצר, [Job
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#024); but צר, [Job
36:16](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#016), signifies distress; and the
expression לא בצר, in a condition devoid of distress, is like לא בחכמה,
[Job 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#021), and לא ביד, [Job
34:20](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#020). Finally, אמּיץ כּח signifies
mighty in physical strength, [Job 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#004),
[Job 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#019), and מאמצּי־כח strong proofs
of strength, not "treasures of wealth." Stick. correctly interprets:
"Will thy wild raging cry, then, and all thine exertions, as a warrior
puts them forth in the tumult of battle to work his way out, put thee
where there is an open space?" but the figure of a warrior is, with
Hahn, to be rejected; ערך is only a nice word for שׁית שׂים, to place,
set up, [Job 37:19](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#019).

[Job 36:20](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#020)

Elihu calls upon Job to consider the uselessness of his vehement
contending with God, and then warns him against his dreadful provocation
of divine judgment: ne anheles ([Job
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#002)) noctem illam (with the emphatic
art.) sublaturam populos loco suo. לעלות is equivalent to futuram (ההוה
or העתידה) ut tollat = sublaturam (vid., on [Job
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#011), לשׂוּם, collocaturus; [Job
30:6](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#006), לשׁכּן, habitandum est),
syncopated from להעלות, in the sense of [Psa
102:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#025); and תּחתּם signifies, as [Job
40:12](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#012) (comp. on [Hab
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#016)), nothing but that just where
they are, firmly fixed without the possibility of escape, they are
deprived of being. If whole peoples are overtaken by such a fate, how
much less shall the individual be able to escape it! And yet Job presses
forward on to the tribunal of the terrible Judge, instead of humbling
himself under His mighty hand. Oh that in time he would shrink back from
this absolute wickedness (און), for he has given it the preference
before עני, quiet, resigned endurance. בּחר על signifies, [Sa2
19:39](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#039), to choose to lay anything on
any one; here as בחר בּ, elsewhere to extend one's choice to something,
to make something an object of choice; perhaps also under the influence
of the phrase התענּג על, and similar phrases. The construction is
remarkable, since one would sooner have expected על־עני זה בחרת, hanc
elegisti prae toleratione.

[Job 36:22](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 36:22</span></span>

22 Behold, God acteth loftily in His strength;

Who is a teacher like unto Him?

23 Who hath appointed Him His way,

And who dare say: Thou doest iniquity!?

24 Remember that thou magnify His doing,

Which men have sung.

25 All men delight in it,

Mortal man looketh upon it from afar.

Most modern expositors, after the lxx δυνάστης, give אמת the
signification lord, by comparing the Arab. mar-un (imru-un), Syr. mor
(with the art. moro) or more (with the art. morjo), Chald. מרא, Talmud.
מר (comp. Philo, ii. 522, ed. Mangey: οὃτως, viz., μάριν φασὶ τὸν κύριον
ὀνομάζεστηαι παρὰ Σύροις), with it; but Rosenm., Arnh., Lwenthal,
Wolfson, and Schlottm., after the Targ., Syr., and Jer., rightly abide
by the signification: teacher. For (1) אמת (from הורה, [Psa
25:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#008), [Psa
25:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#012); [Psa
32:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#008)) has no etymological connection
with mr (of מרא, Arab. maru'a, opimum, robustum esse); (2) it is,
moreover, peculiar to Elihu to represent God as a teacher both by dreams
and dispensations of affliction, [Job
33:14](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#014), [Job
34:32](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#032), and by His creatures, [Job
35:11](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#011); and (3) the designation of God
as an incomparable teacher is also not inappropriate here, after His
rule is described in [Job 36:22](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#022) as
transcendently exalted, which on that very account commands to human
research a reverence which esteems itself lightly. [Job
36:23](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#023) is not to be translated: who
overlooketh Him in His way? (פּקד with על of the personal and acc. of
the neutral obj.), which is without support in the language; but: who
has prescribed to Him (פקד על as [Job
34:13](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#013)) His way? i.e., as Rosenm.
correctly interprets: quis ei praescripsit quae agere deberet, He is no
mandatory, is responsible to no one, and under obligation to no one, and
who should dare to say (quis dixerit; on the perf. comp. on [Job
35:15](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#015)): Thou doest evil? - man shall
be a docile learner, not a self-satisfied, conceited censurer of the
absolute One, whose rule is not to be judged according to the laws of
another, but according to His own laws. Thus, then, shall Job remember
(memento = cura ut) to extol (תשׂגּיא, [Job
12:23](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#023)) God's doings, which have been
sung (comp. e.g., [Psa 104:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#022)) by
אנשׁים, men of the right order ([Job
37:24](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#024)); Jer. de quo cecinerunt viri.
שׁרר nowhere has the signification intueri (Rosenm., Umbr.); on the
other hand, Elihu is fond of direct ([Job
33:27](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#027); [Job
35:10](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#010)) and indirect allusions to the
Psalms. All men - he continues, with reference to God's פּעל, working -
behold it, viz., as בו implies, with pleasure and astonishment; mortals
gaze upon it (reverentially) from afar, - the same thought as that which
has already ([Job 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#014)) found the
grandest expression in Job's mouth.

[Job 36:26](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">job 36:26</span></span>

26 Behold, God is exalted-we know Him not entirely;

The number of His years, it is unsearchable.

27 For He draweth down the drops of water,

They distil as rain in connection with its mist,

28 Which the clouds do drop,

Distil upon the multitude of men.

29 Who can altogether understand the spreadings of the clouds,

The crash of His tabernacle?

The Waw of the quasi-conclusion in [Job
36:26](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#026) corresponds to the Waw of the
train of thought in [Job 36:26](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#026) (Ges.
145, 2). מספּר שׁניו is, as the subject-notion, conceived as a
nominative (vid., on [Job 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#006)), not as
in similar quasi-antecedent clauses, e.g., [Job
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#012), as an acc. of relation. שׂגּיא
here and [Job 37:23](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#023) occurs otherwise
only in Old Testament Chaldee. In what follows Elihu describes the
wondrous origin of rain. "If Job had only come," says a Midrash (Jalkut,
518), "to explain to us the matter of the race of the deluge (vid.,
especially [Job 22:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#015)), it had been
sufficient; and if Elihu had only come to explain to us the matter of
the origin of rain (מעשׂה ירידת גשׁמים), it had been enough." In
Gesenius' Handwrterbuch, [Job 36:27](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#027) is
translated: when He has drawn up the drops of water to Himself, then,
etc. But it is יגרע, not גּרע; and גּרע neither in Hebr. nor in Arab.
signifies attrahere in sublime (Rosenm.), but only attrahere (root גר)
and detrahere; the latter signification is the prevailing one in Hebr.
([Job 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#008); [Job
36:7](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#007)). With כּי the transcendent
exaltation of the Being who survives all changes of creation is shown by
an example: He draws away (draws off, as it were) the water-drops, viz.,
from the waters that are confined above on the circle of the sky, which
pass over us as mist and cloud (vid., Genesis, S. 107); and these
water-drops distil down (זקק, to ooze, distil, here not in a transitive
but an intransitive signification, since the water-drops are the rain
itself) as rain, לאדו, with its mist, i.e., since a mist produced by it
([Gen 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#006)) fills the expanse (רקיע),
the downfall of which is just this rain, which, as [Job
36:28](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#028) says, the clouds (called שׁחקים
on account of its thin strata of air, in distinction from the next
mist-circle) cause to flow gently down upon the multitude of men, i.e.,
far and wide over the mass of men who inhabit the district visited by
the rain; both verbs are used transitively here, both נזל as [Isa
45:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#008), and רעף, as evidently [Pro
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#020). אף אם, [Job
36:29](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#029), commences an intensive
question: moreover, could one understand = could one completely
understand; which certainly, according to the sense, is equivalent to:
how much less (אף כּי). אם is, however, the interrogative an, and אף אם
corresponds to האף in the first member of the double question, [Job
34:17](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#017); [Job
40:8](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#008). מפרשׂי are not the burstings,
from פּרשׂ = פּרס, frangere, findere, but spreadings, as [Eze
27:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#007) shows, from פּרשׂ, expandere,
[Psa 105:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#039), comp. supra on [Job
36:9](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#009). It is the growth of the
storm-clouds, which collect often from a beginning "small as a man's
hand" ([Kg1 18:44](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#044)), that is intended;
majestic omnipotence conceals itself behind these as in a סכּה ([Psa
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#012)) woven out of thick branches;
and the rolling thunder is here called the crash (תּשׁאות, as [Job
39:7](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#007), is formed from שׁוא, to rumble,
whence also שׁואה, if it is not after the form גּולה, migration, exile,
from שׁאה morf ,, vid., on [Job 30:3](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#003))
of this pavilion of clouds in which the Thunderer works.

[Job 36:30](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">job 36:30</span></span>

30 Behold, He spreadeth His light over Himself,

And the roots of the sea He covereth.

31 For thereby He judgeth peoples,

He giveth food in abundance.

32 Both hands He covereth over with light,

And directeth it as one who hitteth the mark.

33 His noise announceth Him,

The cattle even that He is approaching.

A few expositors (Hirz., Hahn, Schlottm.) understand the celestial
ocean, or the sea of the upper waters, by ים, [Job
36:30](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#030); but it is more than
questionable (vid., on [Job 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#008))
whether ים is used anywhere in this sense. Others as (Umbr., Ew.) the
masses of water drawn up to the sky out of the depths of the sea, on
which a Persian passage cited by Stick. (who, however, regards the Waw
of ושׁרשׁי as Waw adaequationis) from Schebisteri may be compared: "an
exhalation rises up out of the sea, and comes down at God's command upon
the deserts." In both cases כּסּה would be equivalent to כסה עליו,
obtegit se, which in and of itself is possible. But he who has once
witnessed a storm in the neighbourhood of the sea, will decide in favour
of one of the three following explanations: (1.) He covereth the
uprooted ground of the sea (comp. [Psa
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#015).) with the subsiding waves
(Blumenf.); but then [Job 36:30](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#030) would
require to be understood of the light of the brightening sky following
the darkness of the storm, which is improbable in respect of [Job
36:32](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#032). (2.) While the sky is
brilliantly lighted up by the lightning, the abysses of the ocean are
veiled in a so much deeper darkness; the observation is correct, but not
less so another, that the lightning by a thunder-storm, especially when
occurring at night, descends into the depths of the sea like snares that
are cast down (פּחים, [Psa 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#006)), and
the water is momentarily changed as it were into a sea of flame;
accordingly it may be explained, (3.) Behold, He spreadeth over Himself
His light (viz., the light which incessantly illumines the world), and
the roots of the sea, i.e., the sea down to its depths, He covers with
it, since He makes it light through and through (Stuhlm. Wolfs.). Thus,
as it appears, Jerome also interprets: Et (si voluerit) fulgurare lumine
suo desuper, cardines quoque maris operiet.

(Note: The Targ. translates אור, [Job
36:30](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#030), [Job
36:32](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#032), by מטרא, pluvia, according to
the erroneous opinion of R. Jochanan: כל אורה שׁנאמר באליהוא אינו אלא
בירידת גשׁמים. Aben-Ezra and Kimchi explain even עלי־אור, [Isa
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#004), according to this passage. The
lxx translates [Job 36:30](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#030): ἰδοὺ
ἐκτενεῖ ἐπ ̓ αὐτὸν ἠδώ (Cod. Alex. επ αυτον το τοξον; Cod. Sinait. επ
αυτην ηωδη (with the corrections ηδω and τοξον), probably according to
the reading אידו for אורו. But what connection have ἠδώ and rainbow?)

This, that He makes the light of the lightning His manifestation (פּרשׂ
עליו), and that He covers the earth down to the roots of the sea beneath
with this light, is established in [Job
36:31](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#031) from the design, partly
judicial, partly beneficial, which exists in connection with it. בּם
refers as neuter (like בּהם, [Job
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#021)) to the phenomena of the storm;
מכבּיר (with the adverbial ל like לרב, [Job
26:3](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#003)), what makes great = a making
great, abundance (only here), is n. hiphil. after the form משׁהית,
perdens = perditio. In [Job 36:32](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#032) God
is represented under a military figure as a slinger of lightnings: He
covers light over both hands, i.e., arms both completely with light
(comp. סכסך and Arab. škk, totum se operire armis), and directs it (עליה
referring to אור as fem. like [Jer
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#016), and sometimes in the Talmud).
But what is the meaning of בּמפגּיע? Hahn takes מפגיע as n. hiphil. like
מכביר: an object of attack; but what then becomes of the original Hiphil
signification? It ought to be בּמפגּע ([Job
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#020)), as Olsh. wishes to read it.
Ew., Hirz., and others, after the example of Theod. (lxx), Syr., Jer.,
translate: against the adversary; מפגיע ;yrasre signifies indeed the
opposite in [Isa 49:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#016) : intercessor
(properly, one who assails with prayers); however, it would be possible
for this word, just as פגע c. acc. (which signifies usually a hostile
meeting, [Exo 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#003) and freq., but
sometimes also a friendly, [Isa 47:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#003);
[Isa 64:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#004)), to be an ἐναντιόσημον. We
prefer to abide by the usage of the language as we have it, according to
which הפגיע signifies facere ut quid incurset s. petat, [Isa
53:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#006); מפגיע therefore is one who hits,
in opposition to one who misses the mark. The Beth is the Beth essentiae
(vid., on [Job 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#013)), used here like
[Exo 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#003); [Psa
55:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#019); [Isa
40:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#010). With both hands He seizes the
substance of the lightning, fills them with it so that they are
completely covered by it, and gives it the command (appoints it its
goal), a sure aimer!

[Job 36:33](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#033)

Targ., Syr., Symm., Theod. (from which [Job
36:32](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#032) is supplied in the lxx),

(Note: Vid., Bickel, De indole ac ratione versionis Alex. in
interpretando l. Iobi, p. 50. Cod. Sinait. has, like Cod. Vat.:
αναγγελει περι αυτου φιλον (corr. φιλος) αυτου κς κτησις και περι
αδικαις.)

Jer., Luther, and others destroy the idea, since they translate רעו =
רעהוּ, "his friend (companion)." Among moderns, only Umbr. and Schlottm.
adopt this signification; Bttch. and Welte, after the example of
Cocceius, Tingstad, and others, attempt it with the signification
"thought = determination;" but most expositors, from Ew. to Hahn, decide
in favour of the rendering as simple as it is consistent with the usage
of the language and the connection: His noise (רעו as [Exo
32:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#017)) gives tidings concerning Him
(announces Him). In [Job 36:33](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#033) Theod.
(lxx), Syr., and Jer. point מקנה like our text, but translate possessio,
with which we can do nothing. It seems that in the three attempts of the
Targ. to translate [Job 36:33](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#033), the
translators had קנאה and קנּא before their mind, according to which Hahn
translates: the arousing of anger (announces) the comer, which assumes
מקנה instead of מקנה; and Schlottm.: fierce wrath (goes forth) over evil
(according to Symm. ζῆλον περὶ ἀδικίας), which assumes the reading עולה
(עולה), ἀδικία, adopted also by Syr., Theod. (lxx). Schultens even
renders similarly: rubedinem flammantem nasi contra elatum, and
Tingstad: zelum irae in iniquitatem. But it is not probable that the
language was acquainted with a subst. מקנה, exciting, although in [Eze
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#003) המּקנה is equivalent to המּקניא,
so that one might more readily be tempted (vid., Hitz. in loc.) to read
מקנה אף, "one who excites anger against evil," it one is not willing to
decide with Berg, and recently Bleek, in favour of (מקנּה) מקנּא אף
בּעולה, excandescens (zelans) ira= contra iniquitatem. But does the text
as it stands really not give an appropriate idea? Aben-Ezra and Duran
have understood it of the foreboding of an approaching thunder-storm
which is manifested by cattle, מקנה. Accordingly Ew. translates: His
thunder announces Him, the cattle even, that He is approaching; and
peculiarly new (understanding יגיד not of a foreboding but of a thankful
lowing) is Ebrard's rendering; also the cattle at fresh sprouting grass.
But such a change of the position of אף is without precedent. Hirz. and
Ges.: His rumble (rumble of thunder) announces Him to the herds, Him,
and indeed as Him who rises up (approaches). But this new interpunction
destroys the division of the verse and the syntax. Better Rosenm. like
Duran: pecus non tantum pluviam proximam, sed et antequam nubes in
sublime adscenderint adscensuras praesagit, according to Virgil, Georg.
i. 374f.:

illum (imbrem) surgentem vallibus imis

Aeriae fugere grues.

But עליו refers to God, and therefore על־עולה also, viz., Him who leads
forth the storm-clouds ([Jer 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#013);
[Jer 51:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#016); [Psa
135:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#007)), and Himself rising up in them;
or, what עלה frequently signifies, coming on as to battle. It is to be
interpreted: His thunder-clap announces Him (who is about to reveal
Himself as a merciful judge), the cattle even (announce) Him at His
first rising up, since at the approach of a storm they herd together
affrighted and seek shelter. The speakers are Arabian, and the scene is
laid in the country: Elihu also refers to the animal world in [Job
35:11](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#011); this feature of the picture,
therefore, cannot be surprising.
