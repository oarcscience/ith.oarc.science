<p>Alphabetical Song in Praise of Those Who Fear God
<p>The alphabetical Hallelujah <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#001">Psa 111:1-10</A>, which celebrated the government of God, is now followed by another coinciding with it in structure (CTYXOC KB, i.e., 22 &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;, as the Coptic version correctly counts), which celebrates the men whose conduct is ordered after the divine pattern. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#001">Psalms 112:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">psa 112:1</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>As in the preceding Psalm. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#001">Psa 112:1</A> here also sets forth the theme of that which follows. What is there said in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#003">Psa 112:3</A> concerning the righteousness of God, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#003">Psa 112:3</A> here says of the righteousness of him who fears God: this also standeth fast for ever, it is indeed the copy of the divine, it is the work and gift of God (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#005">Psa 24:5</A>), inasmuch as God's salutary action and behaviour, laid hold of in faith, works a like form of action and behaviour to it in man, which, as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#009">Psa 112:9</A> says, is, according to its nature, love. The promise in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#004">Psa 112:4</A> sounds like <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#002">Isa 60:2</A>. Hengstenberg renders: "There ariseth in the darkness light to the upright who is gracious and compassionate and just." But this is impossible as a matter of style. The three adjectives (as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#004">Psa 111:4</A>, pointing back to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#006">Exo 34:6</A>, cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#008">Psa 145:8</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#005">Psa 116:5</A>) are a mention of God according to His attributes. &#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503; and &#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; never take the article in Biblical Hebrew, and &#1510;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511; follows their examples here (cf. on the contrary, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#027">Exo 9:27</A>). God Himself is the light which arises in darkness for those who are sincere in their dealings with Him; He is the Sun of righteousness with wings of rays dispensing "grace" and "tender mercies," <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#002">Mal 4:2</A>. The fact that He arises for those who are compassionate as He is compassionate, is evident from <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#005">Psa 112:5</A>. &#1496;&#1493;&#1489; being, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#010">Isa 3:10</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#017">Jer 44:17</A>, intended of well-being, prosperity, &#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; is here equivalent to &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, which is rendered &#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1492;&#1468; &#1491;&#1468;&#1490;&#1489;&#1512;&#1488; in Targumic phrase. &#1495;&#1493;&#1504;&#1503; signifies, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#026">Psa 37:26</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#021">Psa 37:21</A>, one who charitably dispenses his gifts around. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#005">Psa 112:5</A> is not an extension of the picture of virtue, but, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#005">Psa 127:5</A>, a promissory prospect: he will uphold in integrity (&#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#002">Psa 72:2</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#007">Isa 9:7</A>, and frequently), or rather (= &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;) in the cause (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#002">Psa 143:2</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#023">Pro 24:23</A>, and frequently), the things which depend upon him, or with which he has to do; for &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;, sustinere, signifies to sustain, i.e., to nourish, to sustain, i.e., endure, and also to support, maintain, i.e., carry through. This is explanatorily confirmed in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#006">Psa 112:6</A> : he stands, as a general thing, imperturbably fast. And when he dies he becomes the object of everlasting remembrance, his name is still blessed (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#007">Pro 10:7</A>). Because he has a cheerful conscience, his heart too is not disconcerted by any evil tidings (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#023">Jer 49:23</A>): it remains &#1504;&#1499;&#1493;&#1503;, erect, straight and firm, without suffering itself to bend or warp; &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1495; &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;, full of confidence (passive, "in the sense of a passive state after a completed action of the person himself," like &#1494;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#014">Psa 103:14</A>); &#1505;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498;, stayed in itself and established. The last two designations are taken from <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#003">Isa 26:3</A>, where it is the church of the last times that is spoken of. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#008">Psa 91:8</A> gives us information with reference to the meaning of &#1512;&#1488;&#1492; &#1489;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493;; &#1506;&#1491;, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#013">Psa 94:13</A>, of the inevitable goal, on this side of which he remains undismayed. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#009">Co2 9:9</A>, where Paul makes use of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#009">Psa 112:9</A> of the Psalm before us as an encouragement to Christian beneficence, shows how little the assertion "his righteousness standeth for ever" is opposed to the New Testament consciousness. &#1508;&#1468;&#1494;&#1468;&#1512; of giving away liberally and in manifold ways, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#024">Pro 11:24</A>. &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#009">Psa 112:9</A>, stands in opposition to the egoistical &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#005">Psa 75:5</A> as a vegetative sprouting up (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#017">Psa 132:17</A>). The evil-doer must see this, and confounded, vex himself over it; he gnashes his teeth with the rage of envy and chagrin, and melts away, i.e., loses consistency, becomes unhinged, dies off (&#1504;&#1502;&#1505;, 3d praet. Niph. as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#021">Exo 16:21</A>, pausal form of &#1504;&#1502;&#1505; = &#1504;&#1502;&#1505;). How often has he desired the ruin of him whom he must now see in honour! The tables are turned; this and his ungodly desire in general come to nought, inasmuch as the opposite is realized. On &#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, with its self-evident object, cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#010">Mic 7:10</A>. Concerning the pausal form &#1493;&#1499;&#1506;&#1505;, vid., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#001">Psa 93:1</A>. Hupfeld wishes to read &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1514; after <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#019">Psa 9:19</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#028">Pro 10:28</A>. In defence of the traditional reading, Hitzig rightly points to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#024">Pro 10:24</A> together with <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#028">Pro 10:28</A>.
