Call of All the World to the Service of the True God

This Psalm closes the series of deutero-Isaianic Psalms, which began
with Ps 91. There is common to all of them that mild sublimity, sunny
cheerfulness, unsorrowful spiritual character, and New Testament
expandedness, which we wonder at in the second part of the Book of
Isaiah; and besides all this, they are also linked together by the
figure anadiplosis, and manifold consonances and accords.

The arrangement, too, at least from [Psa
93:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#001) onwards, is Isaianic: it is
parallel with the relation of [Isa
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#001) to [Psa
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#001). Just as the former cycle of
prophecies closes that concerning the nations, after the manner of a
musical finale, so the Psalms celebrating the dominion of God, from [Psa
93:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#001) onwards, which vividly portray
the unfolded glory of the kingship of Jahve, have Jubilate and Cantate
Psalms in succession.

From the fact that this last Jubilate is entirely the echo of the first,
viz., of the first half of [Psa
95:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#001), we see how ingenious the
arrangement is. There we find all the thoughts which recur here. There
it is said in [Psa 95:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#007), He is our
God, and we are the people of His pasture and the flock of His hand. And
in [Psa 95:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#002), Let us come before His
face with thanksgiving (בּתודה), let us make a joyful noise unto Him in
songs!

This תודה is found here in the title of the Psalm, מזמור לתּודה. Taken
in the sense of a "Psalm for thanksgiving," it would say but little. We
may take לתודה in a liturgical sense (with the Targum, Mendelssohn,
Ewald, and Hitzig), like ליום השׁבת, [Psa
92:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#001), in this series, and like להזכיר
in [Psa 38:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#001); [Psa
70:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#001). What is intended is not merely
the tôda of the heart, but the shelamı̂m-tôda, תּודה זבח, [Psa
107:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#022); [Psa
116:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#017), which is also called
absolutely תודה in [Psa 56:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#013), [Ch2
29:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#031). That kind of shelamı̂m is thus
called which is presented על־תודה, i.e., as thankful praise for divine
benefits received, more particularly marvellous protection and
deliverance (vid., Ps 107).

[Psalms 100:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa100.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 100:1</span></span>

The call in [Psa 100:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa100.htm#001) sounds like
[Psa 98:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#004); [Psa
66:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#001). כּל־הארץ are all lands, or
rather all men belonging to the earth's population. The first verse,
without any parallelism and in so far monostichic, is like the signal
for a blowing of the trumpets. Instead of "serve Jahve with gladness
(בּשׂמחה)," it is expressed in [Psa
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#011), "serve Jahve with fear
(בּיראה)." Fear and joy do not exclude one another. Fear becomes the
exalted Lord, and the holy gravity of His requirements; joy becomes the
gracious Lord, and His blessed service. The summons to manifest this joy
in a religious, festive manner springs up out of an all-hopeful,
world-embracing love, and this love is the spontaneous result of living
faith in the promise that all tribes of the earth shall be blessed in
the seed of Abraham, and in the prophecies in which this promise is
unfolded. דּעוּ (as in [Psa 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#004))
Theodoret well interprets δι ̓ αὐτῶν μάθετε τῶν πραγμάτων. They are to
know from facts of outward and inward experience that Jahve is God: He
hath made us, and not we ourselves. Thus runs the Chethξb, which the lxx
follows, αὐτὸς ἔποήσεν ἡμᾶς καὶ οὐχ ἡμεῖς (as also the Syriac and
Vulgate); but Symmachus (like Rashi), contrary to all possibilities of
language, renders αὐτὸς ἐποίησεν ἡμᾶς οὐκ ὄντας. Even the Midrash
(Bereshith Rabba, ch. c. init.) finds in this confession the reverse of
the arrogant words in the mouth of Pharaoh: "I myself have made myself"
([Eze 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#003)). The Ker, on the other
hand, reads לו,

(Note: According to the reckoning of the Masora, there are fifteen
passages in the Old Testament in which לא is written and לו is read,
viz., [Exo 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#008); [Lev
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#021); [Lev
25:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#030); [Sa1
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#003); [Sa2
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#018); [Kg2
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#010); [Isa
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#002); [Isa
63:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#009); [Psa
100:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa100.htm#003); [Psa
139:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#016); [Job
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#015) cf. the note there, [Psa
41:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#004); [Pro
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#007); [Pro
26:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#002); [Ezr
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#002). Because doubtful, [Isa
49:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#005); [Ch1
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#020) are not reckoned with these.)

which the Targum, Jerome, and Saadia follow and render: et ipsius nos
sumus. Hengstenberg calls this Ker quite unsuitable and bad; and
Hupfeld, on the other hand, calls the Chethb an "unspeakable
insipidity." But in reality both readings accord with the context, and
it is clear that they are both in harmony with Scripture. Many a one has
drawn balsamic consolation from the words ipse fecit nos et non ipsi
nos; e.g., Melancthon when disconsolately sorrowful over the body of his
son in Dresden on the 12th July 1559. But in ipse fecit nos et ipsius
nos sumus there is also a rich mine of comfort and of admonition, for
the Creator of also the Owner, His heart clings to His creature, and the
creature owes itself entirely to Him, without whom it would not have had
a being, and would not continue in being. Since, however, the parallel
passage, [Psa 95:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#007), favours ולו rather
than ולא; since, further, ולא ,reh is the easier reading, inasmuch as
הוּא leads one to expect that an antithesis will follow (Hitzig); and
since the "His people and the sheep of His pasture" that follows is a
more natural continuation of a preceding ולו אנחנו than that it should
be attached as a predicative object to עשׂנוּ over a parenthetical ולא
אנחנו: the Ker decidedly maintains the preference. In connection with
both readings, עשׂה has a sense related to the history of redemption, as
in [Sa1 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#006). Israel is Jahve's work
(מעשׂה), [Isa 29:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#023); [Isa
60:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#021), cf. [Deu
32:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#006), [Deu
32:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#015), not merely as a people, but as
the people of God, who were kept in view even in the calling of Abram.

[Psalms 100:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa100.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 100:4</span></span>

Therefore shall the men of all nations enter with thanksgiving into the
gates of His Temple and into the courts of His Temple with praise ([Psa
96:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#008)), in order to join themselves in
worship to His church, which - a creation of Jahve for the good of the
whole earth - is congregated about this Temple and has it as the place
of its worship. The pilgrimage of all peoples to the holy mountain is an
Old Testament dress of the hope for the conversion of all peoples to the
God of revelation, and the close union of all with the people of this
God. His Temple is open to them all. They may enter, and when they enter
they have to look for great things. For the God of revelation (52:11;
54:8) is "good" ([Psa 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#008); [Psa
34:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#009)), and His loving-kindness and
faithfulness endure for ever - the thought that recurs frequently in the
later Hallelujah and Hodu Psalms and is become a liturgical formula
([Jer 33:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#011)). The mercy of
loving-kindness of God is the generosity, and His faithfulness the
constancy, of His love.
