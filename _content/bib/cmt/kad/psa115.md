### [Psalms Chapter 115](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 115:0</span></span>

Call to the God of Israel, the Living God, to Rescue the Honour of His
Name

This Psalm, which has scarcely anything in common with the preceding
Psalm except that the expression "house of Jacob," [Psa
114:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#001), is here broken up into its
several members in [Psa 115:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#012)., is
found joined with it, making one Psalm, in the lxx, Syriac, Arabic and
Aethiopic versions, just as on the other hand Ps 116 is split up into
two. This arbitrary arrangement condemns itself. Nevertheless Kimchi
favours it, and it has found admission into not a few Hebrew
manuscripts.

It is a prayer of Israel for God's aid, probably in the presence of an
expedition against heathen enemies. The two middle strophes of the four
are of the same compass. Ewald's conjecture, that whilst the Psalm was
being sung the sacrifice was proceeded with, and that in [Psa
115:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#012) the voice of a priest proclaims
the gracious acceptance of the sacrifice, is pleasing. But the change of
voices begins even with [Psa 115:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#009), as
Olshausen also supposes.

[Psalms 115:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 115:1</span></span>

It has to do not so much with the honour of Israel, which is not worthy
of the honour ([Eze 36:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#022).) and has to
recognise in its reproach a well-merited chastisement, as with the
honour of Him who cannot suffer the reproaching of His holy name to
continue long. He willeth that His name should be sanctified. In the
consciousness of his oneness with this will, the poet bases his
petition, in so far as it is at the same time a petition on behalf of
Israel, upon God's cha'ris and alee'theia as upon two columns. The
second על, according to an express note of the Masora, has no Waw before
it, although the lxx and Targum insert one. The thought in [Psa
115:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#002) is moulded after [Psa
79:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#010), or after [Joe
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#017), cf. [Psa
42:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#004); [Mic
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#010). איּה־נא is the same style as
נגדּה־נּא in [Psa 116:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#018), cf. in the
older language אל־נא, אם־נא, and the like.

[Psalms 115:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 115:3</span></span>

The poet, with "And our God," in the name of Israel opposes the scornful
question of the heathen by the believingly joyous confession of the
exaltation of Jahve above the false gods. Israel's God is in the
heavens, and is therefore supramundane in nature and life, and the
absolutely unlimited One, who is able to do all things with a freedom
that is conditioned only by Himself: quod vult, valet ([Psa
115:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#003) = [Psa
135:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#006), Wisd. 12:18, and frequently).
The carved gods (עצב, from עצב, cogn. חצב, קצב) of the heathen, on the
contrary, are dead images, which are devoid of all life, even of the
sensuous life the outward organs of which are imagined upon them. It
cannot be proved with [Ecc 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#016) that
ידיהם and רגליחם are equivalent to ידים להם, רגלים. They are either
subjects which the Waw apodosis cf. [Gen
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#024); [Pro
23:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#024); [Hab
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#005)) renders prominent, or casus
absoluti (Ges. ֗145, 2), since both verbs have the idols themselves as
their subjects less on account of their gender (יד and רגל are feminine,
but the Hebrew usage of genders is very free and not carried out
uniformly) as in respect of [Psa
115:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#007): with reference to their hands,
etc. ימישׁוּן is the energetic future form, which goes over from משׁשׁ
into מוּשׁ, for ימשּׁוּ. It is said once again in [Psa
115:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#007) that speech is wanting to them;
for the other negations only deny life to them, this at the same time
denies all personality. The author might know from his own experience
how little was the distinction made by the heathen worship between the
symbol and the thing symbolized. Accordingly the worship of idols seems
to him, as to the later prophets, to be the extreme of self-stupefaction
and of the destruction of human consciousness; and the final destiny of
the worshippers of false gods, as he says in [Psa
115:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#008), is, that they become like to
their idols, that is to say, being deprived of their consciousness,
life, and existence, they come to nothing, like those their
nothingnesses ([Isa 44:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#009)). This whole
section of the Psalm is repeated in Ps 135 ([Psa
115:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#006), [Psa
115:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#015)).

[Psalms 115:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 115:9</span></span>

After this confession of Israel there now arises a voice that addresses
itself to Israel. The threefold division into Israel, the house of
Aaron, and those who fear Jahve is the same as in [Psa
118:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#002). In Ps 135 the "house of Levi"
is further added to the house of Aaron. Those who fear Jahve, who also
stand in the last passage, are probably the proselytes (in the Acts of
the Apostles σεβόμενοι τὸν Θεόν, or merely σεβόμενοι)

(Note: The appellation φοβούμενοι does not however occur, if we do not
bring [Act 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#002) in here; but in Latin
inscriptions in Orelli-Hentzen No. 2523, and in Auer in the Zeitschrift
fr katholische Theologie 1852, S. 80, the proselyte (religionis
Judaicae) is called metuens.))

at any rate these are included even if Israel in [Psa
115:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#009) is meant to signify the laity,
for the notion of "those who fear Jahve" extends beyond Israel. The fact
that the threefold refrain of the summons does not run, as in [Psa
33:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#020), our help and shield is He, is
to be explained from its being an antiphonal song. In so far, however,
as the Psalm supplicates God's protection and help in a campaign the
declaration of confident hope, their help and shield is He, may, with
Hitzig, be referred to the army that is gone or is going forth. It is
the same voice which bids Israel to be of good courage and announces to
the people the well-pleased acceptance of the sacrifice with the words
"Jahve hath been mindful of us" (זכרנוּ ה, cf. עתּה ידעתּי, [Psa
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#007)), perhaps simultaneously with the
presentation of the memorial portion (אזכרה) of the meat-offering ([Psa
38:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#001)). The יברך placed at the head is
particularized threefold, corresponding to the threefold summons. The
special promise of blessing which is added in [Psa
115:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#014) is an echo of [Deu
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#011), as in [Sa2
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#003). The contracted future יסף we
take in a consolatory sense; for as an optative it would be too isolated
here. In spite of all oppression on the part of the heathen, God will
make His people ever more numerous, more capable of offering resistance,
and more awe-inspiring.

[Psalms 115:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 115:15</span></span>

The voice of consolation is continued in [Psa
115:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#015), but it becomes the voice of
hope by being blended with the newly strengthened believing tone of the
congregation. Jahve is here called the Creator of heaven and earth
because the worth and magnitude of His blessing are measured thereby. He
has reserved the heavens to Himself, but given the earth to men. This
separation of heaven and earth is a fundamental characteristic of the
post-diluvian history. The throne of God is in the heavens, and the
promise, which is given to the patriarchs on behalf of all mankind, does
not refer to heaven, but to the possession of the earth ([Psa
37:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#022)). The promise is as yet limited
to this present world, whereas in the New Testament this limitation is
removed and the κληρονομία embraces heaven and earth. This Old Testament
limitedness finds further expression in [Psa
115:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#017), where דּוּמה, as in [Psa
94:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#017), signifies the silent land of
Hades. The Old Testament knows nothing of a heavenly ecclesia that
praises God without intermission, consisting not merely of angels, but
also of the spirits of all men who die in the faith. Nevertheless there
are not wanting hints that point upwards which were even better
understood by the post-exilic than by the pre-exilic church. The New
Testament morn began to dawn even upon the post-exilic church. We must
not therefore be astonished to find the tone of [Psa
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#006); [Psa
30:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#010); [Psa
88:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#011), struck up here, although the
echo of those earlier Psalms here is only the dark foil of the
confession which the church makes in [Psa
115:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#018) concerning its immortality. The
church of Jahve as such does not die. That it also does not remain among
the dead, in whatever degree it may die off in its existing members, the
psalmist might know from [Isa 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#019);
[Isa 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#008). But the close of the Psalm
shows that such predictions which light up the life beyond only
gradually became elements of the church's consciousness, and, so to
speak, dogmas.
