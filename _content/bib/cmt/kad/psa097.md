### [Psalms Chapter 97](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 97:0</span></span>

The Breaking Through of the Kingdom of God, the Judge and Saviour

This Psalm, too, has the coming of Jahve, who enters upon His kingdom
through judgment, as its theme, and the watchword "Jahve is King" as its
key-note. The lxx inscribes it: τῷ Δαυίδ ὅτε ἡ γῆ αὐτοῦ καθίσταται
(καθίστατο); Jerome: quando terra ejus restituta est. The τῷ Δαυίδ is
worthless; the time of restoration, from which it takes its rise, is the
post-exilic, for it is composed, as mosaic-work, out of the earlier
original passages of Davidic and Asaphic Psalms and of the prophets,
more especially of Isaiah, and is entirely an expression of the
religious consciousness which resulted from the Exile.

[Psalms 97:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 97:1</span></span>

We have here nothing but echoes of the older literature: [Psa
97:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#001), cf. [Isa
42:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#010); [Isa
51:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#005); [Psa
97:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#002), cf. [Psa
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#010), [Psa
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#012); [Psa
97:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#002) = [Psa
89:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#015); [Psa
97:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#003), cf. [Psa
50:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#003); [Psa
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#009); [Psa
97:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#003), cf. [Isa
42:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#025). Beginning with the visible
coming of the kingdom of God in the present, with מלך ה the poet takes
his stand upon the standpoint of the kingdom which is come. With it also
comes rich material for universal joy. תּגל is indicative, as in [Psa
96:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#011) and frequently. רבּים are all,
for all of them are in fact many (cf. [Isa
52:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#015)). The description of the
theophany, for which the way is preparing in [Psa
97:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#002), also reminds one of Hab. 3.
God's enshrouding Himself in darkness bears witness to His judicial
earnestness. Because He comes as Judge, the basis of His royal throne
and of His judgment-seat is also called to mind. His harbinger is fire,
which consumes His adversaries on every side, as that which broke forth
out of the pillar of cloud once consumed the Egyptians.

[Psalms 97:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 97:4</span></span>

Again we have nothing but echoes of the older literature: [Psa
97:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#004) = [Psa
77:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#019); [Psa
97:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#004), cf. [Psa
77:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#017); [Psa
97:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#005), cf. [Mic
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#004); [Psa
97:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#005), cf. [Mic
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#013); [Psa
97:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#006) = [Psa
50:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#006); [Psa
97:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#006), cf. [Isa
35:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#002); [Isa
40:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#005); [Isa
52:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#010); [Isa
66:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#018). The poet goes on to describe
that which is future with historical certainty. That which [Psa
77:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#019) says of the manifestation of God
in the earlier times he transfers to the revelation of God in the last
time. The earth sees it, and begins to tremble in consequence of it. The
reading ותּחל, according to Hitzig (cf. Ew. ֗232, b) traditional, is,
however, only an error of pointing that has been propagated; the correct
reading is the reading of Heidenheim and Baer, restored according to
MSS, ותּחל (cf. [Sa1 31:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#003)), like
ותּבן, ותּקם, ותּרם, and ותּשׂם. The figure of the wax is found even in
[Psa 68:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#003); and Jahve is also called
"Lord of the whole earth" in [Zac
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#014); [Zac
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#005). The proclamation of the heavens
is an expression of joy, [Psa 96:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#011).
They proclaim the judicial strictness with which Jahve, in accordance
with His promises, carries out His plan of salvation, the realization of
which has reached its goal in the fact that all men see the glory of
God.

[Psalms 97:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 97:7</span></span>

When the glory of Jahve becomes manifest, everything that is opposed to
it will be punished and consumed by its light. Those who serve idols
will become conscious of their delusion with shame and terror, [Isa
42:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#017); [Jer
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#014). The superhuman powers (lxx
ἄγγελοι), deified by the heathen, then bow down to Him who alone is
Elohim in absolute personality. השׁתּחווּ is not imperative (lxx,
Syriac), for as a command this clause would be abrupt and
inconsequential, but the perfect of that which actually takes place. The
quotation in [Heb 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#006) is taken from
[Deu 32:43](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#043), lxx. In [Psa
97:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#008) (after [Psa
48:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#012)) the survey of the poet again
comes back to his own nation. When Zion hears that Jahve has appeared,
and all the world and all the powers bow down to Him, she rejoices; for
it is in fact her God whose kingship has come to the acknowledge. And
all the daughter-churches of the Jewish land exult together with the
mother-church over the salvation which dawns through judgments.

[Psalms 97:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 97:9</span></span>

This distichic epiphonema ([Psa 97:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#009) =
Ps 83:19; [Psa 97:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#009), cf. [Psa
47:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#003), 10) might close the Psalm; there
follows still, however, a hortatory strophe (which was perhaps not added
till later on).

[Psalms 97:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 97:10</span></span>

It is true [Psa 97:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#012) is = [Psa
32:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#011), [Psa
97:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#012) = [Psa
30:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#005), and the promise in [Psa
97:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#010) is the same as in [Psa
37:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#028); [Psa
34:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#021); but as to the rest,
particularly [Psa 97:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#011), this strophe
is original. It is an encouraging admonition to fidelity in an age in
which an effeminate spirit of looking longingly towards lit. ogling
heathenism was rife, and stedfast adherence to Jahve was threatened with
loss of life. Those who are faithful in their confession, as in the
Maccabaean age (Ἀσιδαῖοι), are called חסדיו. The beautiful figure in
[Psa 97:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#011) is misapprehended by the
ancient versions, inasmuch as they read זרח ([Psa
112:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#004)) instead of זרע. זרע does not
here signify sown = strewn into the earth, but strewn along his life's
way, so that he, the righteous one, advances step by step in the light.
Hitzig rightly compares ki'dnatai ski'dnatai, used of the dawn and of
the sun. Of the former Virgil also says, Et jam prima novo spargebat
lumine terras.
