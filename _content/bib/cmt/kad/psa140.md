Prayer for Protection against Wicked, Crafty Men

The close of the preceding Psalm is the key to David's position and mood
in the presence of his enemies which find expression in this Psalm. He
complains here of serpent-like, crafty, slanderous adversaries, who are
preparing themselves for war against him, and with whom he will at
length have to fight in open battle. The Psalm, in its form more bold
than beautiful, justifies its לדוד in so far as it is Davidic in
thoughts and figures, and may be explained from the circumstances of the
rebellion of Absalom, to which as an outbreak of Ephraimitish jealousy
the rebellion of Sheba ben Bichri the Benjamite attached itself. [Psa
58:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#001) and [Psa
64:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#001) are very similar. The close of
all three Psalms sounds much alike, they agree in the use of rare forms
of expression, and their language becomes fearfully obscure in style and
sound where they are directed against the enemies.

[Psalms 140:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 140:1</span></span>

The assimilation of the Nun of the verb נצר is given up, as in [Psa
61:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#008); [Psa
78:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#007), and frequently, in order to make
the form more full-toned. The relative clause shows that אישׁ חמסים is
not intended to be understood exclusively of one person. בּלב
strengthens the notion of that which is deeply concealed and
premeditated. It is doubtful whether יגוּרוּ signifies to form into
troops or to stir up. But from the fact that גּוּר in [Psa
56:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#007); [Psa
59:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#004), [Isa
54:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#015), signifies not congregare but se
congregare, it is to be inferred that גּוּר in the passage before us,
like גּרה (or התגּרה in [Deu 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#009), [Deu
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#024)), in Syriac and Targumic גּרג,
signifies concitare, to excite (cf. שׂוּר together with שׂרה, [Hos
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#004).). In [Psa
140:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#004) the Psalm coincides with [Psa
64:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#004); [Psa
58:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#005). They sharpen their tongue, so
that it inflicts a fatal sting like the tongue of a serpent, and under
their lips, shooting out from thence, is the poison of the adder (cf.
[Sol 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#011)). עכשׁוּב is a ἅπαξ λεγομ.
not from כּשׁב (Jesurun, p. 207), but from עכשׁ, Arab. ‛ks and ‛kš, root
‛k (vid., Fleischer on [Isa 59:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#005),
עכּבישׁ), both of which have the significations of bending, turning, and
coiling after the manner of a serpent; the Beth is an organic addition
modifying the meaning of the root.

(Note: According to the original Lexicons Arab. ‛ks signifies to bend
one's self, to wriggle, to creep sideways like the roots of the vine, in
the V form to move one's self like an adder (according to the Ḳamûs) and
to walk like a drunken man (according to Neshwn); but Arab. ‛kš
signifies to be intertwined, knit or closely united together, said of
hairs and of the branches of trees, in the V form to fight hand to hand
and to get in among the crowd. The root is apparently expanded into
עכשׁוב by an added Beth which serves as a notional speciality, as in
Arab. ‛rqûb the convex bend of the steep side of a rock, or in the case
of the knee of the hind-legs of animals, and in Arab. charnûb (in the
dialect of the country along the coast of Palestine, where the tree is
plentiful, in Neshwn churnûb), the horn-like curved pod of the
carob-tree (Ceratonia Siliqua), syncopated Arab. charrûb, charrûb (not
charûb), from Arab. charn, cogn. qarn, a horn, cf. Arab. chrnâyt, the
beak of a bird of prey, Arab. chrnûq, the stork \[vid. on [Psa
104:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#017)\], Arab. chrnı̂n, the rhinoceros
\[vid. on [Psa 29:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#006)\], Arab. chrnuı̂t,
the unicorn \[vid. ibid.\]. - Wetzstein.)

[Psalms 140:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 140:4</span></span>

The course of this second strophe is exactly parallel with the first.
The perfects describe their conduct hitherto, as a comparison of [Psa
140:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#003) with [Psa
140:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#003) shows. פּעמים is poetically
equivalent to רגלים, and signifies both the foot that steps ([Psa
57:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#005); [Psa
58:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#011)) and the step that is made by
the foot (Ps 85:14; [Psa 119:133](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#133)), and
here the two senses are undistinguishable. They are called גּאים on
account of the inordinate ambition that infatuates them. The metaphors
taken from the life of the hunter ([Psa
141:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#009); [Psa
142:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#004)) are here brought together as it
were into a body of synonyms. The meaning of ליד־מעגּל becomes
explicable from [Psa 142:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#004); ליד, at
hand, is equivalent to "immediately beside" ([Ch1
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#017); [Neh
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#024)). Close by the path along which
he has to pass, lie gins ready to spring together and ensnare him when
he appears.

[Psalms 140:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 140:6</span></span>

Such is the conduct of his enemies; he, however, prays to his God and
gets his weapons from beside Him. The day of equipment is the day of the
crisis when the battle is fought in full array. The perfect סכּותה
states what will then take place on the part of God: He protects the
head of His anointed against the deadly blow. Both [Psa
140:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#008) and [Psa
140:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#008) point to the helmet as being
מעוז ראשׁ, [Psa 60:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#009); cf. the
expression "the helmet of salvation" in [Isa
59:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#017). Beside מאויּי, from the ἅπ.
λεγ. מאוה, there is also the reading מאויי, which Abulwald found in his
Jerusalem codex (in Saragossa). The regular form would be מאוי, and the
boldly irregular ma'awajjê follows the example of מחשׁכּי, מחמדּי, and
the like, in a manner that is without example elsewhere. זממז for מזמּתו
is also a hapaxlegomenon; according to Gesenius the principal form is
זמם, but surely ore correctly זמם (like קרב), which in Aramaic signifies
a bridle, and here a plan, device. The Hiph. חפיק (root פק, whence נפק,
Arab. nfq) signifies educere in the sense of reportare, [Pro
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#013); [Pro
8:35](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#035); [Pro
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#002); [Pro
18:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#022), and of porrigere, [Psa
144:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#013), [Isa
58:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#010). A reaching forth of the plan is
equivalent to the reaching forth of that which is projected. The choice
of the words used in this Psalm coincides here, as already in מעגּל,
with Proverbs and Isaiah. The future ירוּמוּ expresses the consequence
(cf. [Psa 61:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#008)) against which the poet
wishes to guard.

[Psalms 140:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 140:9</span></span>

The strophic symmetry is now at an end. The longer the poet lingers over
the contemplation of the rebels the more lofty and dignified does his
language become, the more particular the choice of the expressions, and
the more difficult and unmanageable the construction. The Hiph. הסב
signifies, causatively, to cause to go round about ([Exo
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#018)), and to raise round about ([Ch2
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#006)); here, after [Jos
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#011), where with an accusative
following it signifies to go round about: to make the circuit of
anything, as enemies who surround a city on all sides and seek the most
favourable point for assault; מסבּי from the participle מסב. Even when
derived from the substantive מסב (Hupfeld), "my surroundings" is
equivalent to איבי סביבותי in [Psa
27:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#006). Hitzig, on the other hand,
renders it: the head of my slanderers, from סבב, to go round about,
Arabic to tell tales of any one, defame; but the Arabic sbb, fut. u, to
abuse, the IV form (Hiphil) of which moreover is not used either in the
ancient or in the modern language, has nothing to do with the Hebrew
סבב, but signifies originally to cut off round about, then to clip
(injure) any one's honour and good name.

(Note: The lexicographer Neshwn says, i. 279b: Arab. 'l-sbb 'l - šatm
w-qı̂l an aṣl 'l-sbb 'l - qaṭ‛ ṯm ṣâr 'l - štm, "sebb is to abuse; still,
the more original signification of cutting off is said to lie at the
foundation of this signification." That Arab. qṭ‛ is synonymous with it,
e.g., Arab. lı̂štqt‛fı̂nâ, why dost thou cut into us? i.e., why dost thou
insult our honour? - Wetzstein.)

The fact that the enemies who surround the psalmist on every side are
just such calumniators, is intimated here in the word שׂפתימו. He wishes
that the trouble which the enemies' slanderous lips occasion him may
fall back upon their own head. ראשׁ is head in the first and literal
sense according to [Psa 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#017); and
יכסּימו (with the Jod of the groundform kcy, as in [Deu
32:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#026); [Kg1
20:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#035); Chethb יכסּוּמו,

(Note: Which is favoured by [Exo 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#005),
jechasjûmû with mû instead of mô, which is otherwise without example.)

after the attractional schema, [Sa2
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#004); [Isa
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#011), and frequently; cf. on the
masculine form, [Pro 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#002); [Pro
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#021)) refers back to ראשׁ, which is
meant of the heads of all persons individually. In [Psa
140:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#011) ימיטוּ (with an indefinite
subject of the higher punitive powers, Ges. 137, note), in the
signification to cause to descend, has a support in [Psa
55:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#004), whereas the Niph. נמוט, fut.
ימּט, which is preferred by the Ker, in the signification to be made to
descend, is contrary to the usage of the language. The ἅπ. λεγ. מהמרות
has been combined by Parchon and others with the Arabic hmr, which,
together with other significations (to strike, stamp, cast down, and the
like), also has the signification to flow (whence e.g., in the Koran,
mâ' munhamir, flowing water). "Fire" and "water" are emblems of perils
that cannot be escaped, [Psa 66:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#012),
and the mention of fire is therefore appropriately succeeded by places
of flowing water, pits of water. The signification "pits" is attested by
the Targum, Symmachus, Jerome, and the quotation in Kimchi: "first of
all they buried them in מהמורות; when the flesh was consumed they
collected the bones and buried them in coffins." On בּל־יקוּמוּ cf. [Isa
26:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#014). Like [Psa
140:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#010), [Psa
140:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#012) is also not to be taken as a
general maxim, but as expressing a wish in accordance with the excited
tone of this strophe. אישׁ לשׁון is not a great talker, i.e., boaster,
but an idle talker, i.e., slanderer (lxx ἀνὴρ γλωσσώδης, cf. Sir. 8:4).
According to the accents, אישׁ חמס רע is the parallel; but what would be
the object of this designation of violence as worse or more malignant?
With Sommer, Olshausen, and others, we take רע as the subject to
יצוּדנּוּ: let evil, i.e., the punishment which arises out of evil, hunt
him; cf. [Pro 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#021), חטּאים תּרדּף
רעה, and the opposite in [Psa 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#006). It
would have to be accented, according to this our construction of the
words, אישׁ חמס רע יצודני למדחפת. The ἅπ. λεγ. למדחפת we do not render,
with Hengstenberg, Olshausen, and others: push upon push, with repeated
pushes, which, to say nothing more, is not suited to the figure of
hunting, but, since דּחף always has the signification of precipitate
hastening: by hastenings, that is to say, forced marches.

[Psalms 140:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 140:12</span></span>

With [Psa 140:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#013) the mood and language
now again become cheerful, the rage has spent itself; therefore the
style and tone are now changed, and the Psalm trips along merrily as it
were to the close. With reference to ידעת for ידעתי (as in [Job
42:2](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#002)), vid., [Psa
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#002). That which David in [Psa
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#005) confidently expects on his own
behalf is here generalized into the certain prospect of the triumph of
the good cause in the person of all its representatives at that time
oppressed. אך, like ידעתּי, is an expression of certainty. After seeming
abandonment God again makes Himself known to His own, and those whom
they wanted to sweep away out of the land of the living have an ever
sure dwelling-place with His joyful countenance ([Psa
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#011)).
