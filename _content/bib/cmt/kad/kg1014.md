[3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 14:1</span></span>

Reign of Jeroboam. - Vv. 1-18. Ahijah's prophecy against Jeroboam and
the kingdom of Israel. - As Jeroboam did not desist from his idolatry
notwithstanding the threatened punishment, the Lord visited him with the
illness of his son, and directed the prophet Ahijah, to whom his wife
had gone to ask counsel concerning the result of the illness, to predict
to him not only the cutting off of his house and the death of his sick
son, but also the thrusting away of Israel out of the land of its
fathers beyond the Euphrates, and in confirmation of this threat caused
the sick son to die when the returning mother crossed the threshold of
her house again.

[Kg1 14:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#001)

When his son fell sick, Jeroboam said to his wife: Disguise thyself,
that thou mayest not be known as the wife of Jeroboam, and go to Shiloh
to the prophet Ahijah, who told me that I should be king over this
people; he will tell thee how it will fare with the boy. השׁתּנּה, from
שׁנה, to alter one's self, i.e., to disguise one's self. She was to go
to Shiloh disguised, so as not to be recognised, to deceive the old
prophet, because otherwise Jeroboam did not promise himself any
favourable answer, as he had contemptuously neglected Ahijah's
admonition ([Kg1 11:38-39](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#038)). But he
turned to this prophet because he had spoken concerning him למלך, to be
king, i.e., that he would become king, over this people. למלך stands for
מלך להיות, with which the infinitive esse can be omitted (vid., Ewald,
336, b.). As this prophecy, which was so favourable to Jeroboam, had
come to pass ([Kg1 11:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#029)), he hoped
that he might also obtain from Ahijah a divine revelation concerning the
result of his son's illness, provided that he did not know who it was
who came to seek counsel concerning her sick son. To complete the
deception, she was to take with her as a present for the prophet (cf.,
[Sa1 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#008)) "ten loaves and crumbs" and
a jar with honey, i.e., a trifling gift such as a simple citizen's wife
might take. According to the early versions and the context, a kind of
plain cake, κολλυρίδα (lxx), crustulam (Vulg.). It is different in [Jos
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#005).

[Kg1 14:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#004)

Ahijah could no longer see, because his eyes were blinded with age.
עיניו קמוּ as in [Sa1 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#015), an
expression applied to the black cataract, amaurosis. It was therefore
all the less possible for him to recognise in a natural manner the woman
who was coming to him. But before her arrival the Lord had not only
revealed to him her coming and her object, but had also told him what he
was to say to her if she should disguise herself when she came. וכזה
כּזה; see at [Jdg 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#004), וגו כבאהּ
ויהי, "let it be if she comes and disguises herself;" i.e., if when she
comes she should disguise herself.

[Kg1 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#006)

When Ahijah heard the sound of her feet entering the door (the
participle בּאה, according to the number and gender, refers to the אשּׁה
implied in רגליה, vid., Ewald, 317, c.), he addressed her by her name,
charged her with her disguise of herself, and told her that he was
entrusted with a hard saying to her. קשׁה (cf., [Kg1
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#013)) is equivalent to קשׁה חזוּת;
for the construction, compare Ewald, 284, c.

[Kg1 14:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#007)

The saying was as follows: "Therefore, because thou hast exalted thyself
from the people, and I have made thee prince over my people Israel (cf.,
[Kg1 11:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#031)), ... but thou hast not
been as my servant David, who kept my commandments...(cf., [Kg1
11:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#034)), and hast done worse than all
who were before thee (judices nimirum et duces Israelis - Cler.), and
hast gone and hast made thyself other gods (contrary to the express
command in [Exo 20:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#002)), ... and hast
cast me behind thy back: therefore I bring misfortune upon the house of
Jeroboam," etc. The expression, to cast God behind the back, which only
occurs here and in [Eze 23:35](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#035), denotes
the most scornful contempt of God, the strict opposite of "keeping God
before the eyes and in the heart." בּקיר משׁתּין, every male person; see
at [Sa1 25:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#022). A synonymous expression
is ועזוּב עצוּר, the fettered (i.e., probably the married) and the free
(or single); see at [Deu 32:36](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#036). "In
Israel," i.e., in the kingdom of the ten tribes. The threat is
strengthened by the clause in [Kg1
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#010), "and I will sweep out after the
house of Jeroboam, as one sweepeth out dung, even to the end," which
expresses shameful and utter extermination; and this threat is still
further strengthened in [Kg1 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#011) by
the threat added from [Deu 28:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#026), that
of those cut off not one is to come to the grave, but their bodies are
to be devoured by the dogs and birds of prey, - the worst disgrace that
could befall the dead. Instead of wild beasts ([Deu
28:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#026)) the dogs are mentioned here,
because in the East they wander out in the streets without owners, and
are so wild and ravenous that they even devour corpses (vid., Harmar,
Beobachtungen, i. p. 198). לירבעם with ל of relationship, equivalent to
of those related to Jeroboam. It is the same in [Kg1
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#013).

[Kg1 14:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#012)

After this announcement of the judgment upon the house of Jeroboam,
Ahijah gave the wife information concerning her sick son. He would die
as soon as she entered the city, and of all the male members of the
house of Jeroboam he only would receive the honour of a proper burial,
because in him there was some good thing towards Jehovah found. Ewald
(247, b.) regards the form בּבאה as standing for בּבאהּ, and refers the
suffix to the following word העיר (vid., Ewald, 309, c.). But as this
use of the suffix would be very harsh, the question arises whether בּאה
is not to be regarded as a feminine form of the infinitive, after the
analogy of דּעה in [Exo 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#004) and לדה in
[Kg2 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#003), etc. From the fulfilment of
this declaration in [Kg1 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#017), [Kg1
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#018) Jeroboam was to learn that the
threatened destruction of his royal house would also be just as
certainly fulfilled. The sick son appears to have been the
heir-presumptive to the throne. This may be inferred partly from the
lamentation of all Israel at his death ([Kg1
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#018)), and partly from what follows
here in the next verse. אליהוה means in his relation to Jehovah.

[Kg1 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#014)

"Jehovah will raise Himself up a king over Israel, who will cut off the
house of Jeroboam this day; but what (sc., do I say)? even now," sc.,
has He raised him up. This appears to be the simplest explanation of the
last words of the verse, of which very various interpretations have been
given. יד is placed before היּום, to give it the stronger emphasis, as
in [Exo 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#001) (compare [Jos
9:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#012), and Ewald, 293, b.; and for
עתּה גּם compare Delitzsch on Job, i. p. 290, transl.).

[Kg1 14:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#015)

But in order that not only Jeroboam, but also the people who had joined
in his idolatry, might perceive the severity of the divine judgment,
Ahijah also announced to the nation its banishment into exile beyond the
Euphrates. "Jehovah will smite Israel, as the reed shakes in the water,"
is an abbreviated phrase for: Jehovah will smite Israel in such a manner
that it will sway to and fro like a reed in the water moved by a strong
wind, which has not a sufficiently firm hold to resist the violence of
the storm. "And will thrust them out of the good land," etc., as Moses
threatened the transgressors of the law ([Deu
29:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#027)), "and scatter them beyond the
river (Euphrates)," i.e., banish them among the heathen, from whom God
brought out and chose their forefather ([Jos
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#003)), "because they have made
themselves Ashera-idols, to provoke Jehovah." אשׁרים is used for idols
generally, among which the golden calves are reckoned. ויתּן, that He
may deliver up Israel, on account of the idolatrous forms of worship
introduced by Jeroboam. For the fulfilment see [Kg2
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029); [Kg2
17:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#023), and [Kg2
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#011). - In [Kg1
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#017), [Kg1
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#018) the exact fulfilment of Ahijah's
announcement concerning the death of Jeroboam's sick son is described.
According to [Kg1 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#017), Jeroboam was
then residing at Thirza, whereas he had at first resided at Shechem
([Kg1 12:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#025)). Thirza is probably the
present Talluza, on the north of Shechem (see at [Jos
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#024)).

[Kg1 14:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#019)

End of Jeroboam's reign. Of the wars, which were described in the annals
of the kings, the war with Abijam of Judah is the only one of which we
have any account ([Ch2 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#002).). See
also the Comm. on [Kg1 14:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#030). He was
followed on the throne by his son Nadab.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg1 14:21</span></span>

Reign of Rehoboam in Judah (compare 2 Chron 11:5-12:16). - [Kg1
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#021). Rehoboam, who ascended the
throne at the age of forty-one, was born a year before the accession of
Solomon (see at [Kg1 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#024)). In the
description of Jerusalem as the city chosen by the Lord (cf., [Kg1
11:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#036)) there is implied not so much an
indirect condemnation of the falling away of the ten tribes, as the
striking contrast to the idolatry of Rehoboam referred to in [Kg1
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#023). The name of his mother is
mentioned (here and in [Kg1 14:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#031)),
not because she seduced the king to idolatry (Ephr. Syr.), but generally
on account of the great influence which the queen-mother appears to have
had both upon the king personally and upon his government, as we may
infer from the fact that the mother's name is given in the case of every
king of Judah (vid., [Kg1 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#002), [Kg1
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#013); [Kg1
22:42](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#042), etc.).

[Kg1 14:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#022)

The general characteristics of Rehoboam's reign are supplied and more
minutely defined in the account in the Chronicles. According to 2 Chron
11:5-12:1, he appears to have been brought to reflection by the
announcement of the prophet, that the falling away of the ten tribes had
come from the Lord as a punishment for Solomon's idolatry ([Kg1
12:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#023); [Ch2
11:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#002)); and in the first years of his
reign to have followed the law of God with earnestness, and to have been
occupied in the establishment of his government partly by the
fortification of different cities ([Ch2
11:5-12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#005)), and partly by setting in
order his domestic affairs, placing his numerous sons, who were born of
his many wives and concubines, in the fortified cities of the land, and
thus providing for them, and naming Abijam as his successor ([Ch2
11:18-22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#018)); while his kingdom was still
further strengthened by the priests, Levites, and pious Israelites who
emigrated to Judah and Jerusalem from the ten tribes ([Ch2
11:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#013)). But this good beginning
only lasted three years ([Ch2 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#017)).
When he thought that he had sufficiently fortified his kingdom, he
forsook the law of the Lord, and all Israel (i.e., all the covenant
nation) with him ([Ch2 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#001)). "Judah
did that which was displeasing in the sight of the Lord; they provoked
Him to jealousy more than all that their fathers (sc., under the Judges)
had done with their sins." קנּא, to provoke to jealousy ([Num
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#014)), is to be explained, when it
refers to God, from the fact that the relation in which God stood to His
people was regarded under the figure of a marriage, in which Jehovah
appears as the husband of the nation, who is angry at the unfaithfulness
of his wife, i.e., at the idolatry of the nation. Compare the remarks on
קנּא אל in the Comm. on [Exo 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#005).

[Kg1 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#023)

They also (the Judaeans as well as the Israelites) built themselves
bamoth, altars of high places (see at [Kg1
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#003)), monuments and Ashera-idols.
מצּבות are not actual images of gods, but stones set up as memorials
([Gen 31:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#013); [Gen
35:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#020); [Exo
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#004)), more especially stone monuments
set up in commemoration of a divine revelation ([Gen
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#018), [Gen
28:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#022); [Gen
35:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#014)). Like the bamoth, in connection
with which they generally occur, they were originally dedicated to
Jehovah; but even under the law they were forbidden, partly as places of
divine worship of human invention which easily degenerated into
idolatry, but chiefly because the Canaanites had erected such monuments
to Baal by the side of his altars ([Exo
23:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#024); [Exo
34:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#013); [Deu
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#005), etc.), whereby the worship of
Jehovah was unconsciously identified with the worship of Baal, even when
the mazzeboth were not at first erected to the Canaanitish Baal. As the
מצּבות of the Canaanites were dedicated to Baal, so were the אשׁרים to
Astarte, the female nature-deity of those tribes. אשׁרה, however, does
not mean a grove (see the Comm. on [Deu
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#021)), but an idol of the Canaanitish
nature-goddess, generally most likely a lofty wooden pillar, though
sometimes perhaps a straight trunk of a tree, the branches and crown of
which were lopped off, and which was planted upon heights and in other
places by the side of the altars of Baal. The name אשׁרה was transferred
from the idol to the goddess of nature ([Kg1
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#013); [Kg1
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#019); [Kg2
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#007), etc.), and was used of the image
or column of the Phoenician Astarte ([Kg1
16:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#033); [Kg2
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#006); [Kg2
17:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#016), etc.), just as אשׁרות in [Jdg
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#007) alternates with עשׁתּרות in [Jdg
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#013). These idols the Israelites (?
Judaeans - Tr.) appear to have also associated with the worship of
Jehovah; for the external worship of Jehovah was still maintained in the
temple, and was performed by Rehoboam himself with princely pomp ([Kg1
14:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#028)). "On every high hill," etc.;
see at [Deu 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#002).

[Kg1 14:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#024)

"There were also prostitutes in the land." קדּשׁ is used collectively as
a generic name, including both male and female hierodylae, and is
exchanged for the plural in [Kg1
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#012). The male קדשׁים had emasculated
themselves in religious frenzy in honour of the Canaanitish goddess of
nature, and were called Galli by the Romans. They were Canaanites, who
had found their way into the land of Judah when idolatry gained the
upper hand (as indicated by וגם). "They appear here as strangers among
the Israelites, and are those notorious Cinaedi more especially of the
imperial age of Rome who travelled about in all directions, begging for
the Syrian goddess, and even in the time of Augustine went about asking
for alms in the streets of Carthage as a remnant of the Phoenician
worship (de civ. Dei, vii. 26)." - Movers, p. 679. On the female קדשׁות
see the Comm. on [Gen 38:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#021) and [Deu
23:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#018).

This sinking into heathen abominations was soon followed by the
punishment, that Judah was given up to the power of the heathen.

[Kg1 14:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#025)

King Shishak of Egypt invaded the land with a powerful army, conquered
all the fortified cities, penetrated to Jerusalem, and would probably
have put an end to the kingdom of Judah, if God had not had compassion
upon him, and saved him from destruction, in consequence of the
humiliation of the king and of the chiefs of the nation, caused by the
admonition of the prophet Shemaiah, so that after the conquest of
Jerusalem Shishak contented himself with withdrawing, taking with him
the treasures of the temple and of the royal palace. Compare the fuller
account of this expedition in [Ch2
12:2-9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#002). Shishak (שׁישׁק) was the first
king of the twenty-second (or Bubastitic) dynasty, called Sesonchis in
Jul. Afric., Sesonchosis in Eusebius, and upon the monuments on which
Champollion first deciphered his name, Sheshonk or Sheshenk. Shishak has
celebrated his expedition against Judah by a bas-relief on the outer
wall of the pillar-hall erected by him in the first palace at Karnak, in
which more than 130 figures are led in cords by Ammon and the goddess
Muth with their hands bound upon their backs. The lower portion of the
figures of this long row of prisoners is covered by escutcheons, the
border of which being provided with battlements, shows that the
prisoners are symbols of conquered cities. About a hundred of these
escutcheons are still legible, and in the names upon them a large number
of the names of cities in the kingdom of Judah have been deciphered with
tolerable certainty.

(Note: Compare Max Duncker, Gesch. des Alterthums, Bd. i. p. 909, ed. 3,
and for the different copies of this bas-relief in the more recent works
upon Egypt, Reutschi in Herzog's Cycl. (art. Rehoboam). The latest
attempts at deciphering are those by Brugsch, Geogr. Inschriften in den
gypt. Denkmltern, ii. p. 56ff., and O. Blau, Sisaqs Zug gegen Juda aus
dem Denkmale bei Karnak erlutert, in the Deutsch. morgenl. Ztschr. xv.
p. 233ff. Champollion's interpretation of one of these escutcheons, in
his Prcis du systme hierogl. p. 204, viz., Juda hammalek, "the king of
Judah," has been rejected by Lepsius and Brugsch as philologically
inadmissible. Brugsch writes the name thus: Judh malk or Joud-hamalok,
and identifies Judh with Jehudijeh, which Robinson (Pal. iii. p. 45)
supposes to be the ancient Jehud ([Jos
19:45](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#045)). This Jehud in the tribe of
Dan, Blau (p. 238) therefore also finds in the name; and it will not
mislead any one that this city is reckoned as belonging to the tribe of
Dan, since in the very same chapter ([Jos
19:42](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#042)) Ajalon is assigned to Dan,
though it was nevertheless a fortress of Rehoboam ([Ch2
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#010)). But Blau has not given any
explanation of the addition malk or malok, whereas Gust. Roesch takes it
to be מלך, and supposes it to mean "Jehud of the king, namely, of
Rehoboam or of Judah, on account of its being situated in Dan, which
belonged to the northern kingdom." But this is certainly incorrect. For
where could the Egyptians have obtained this exact knowledge of the
relation in which the tribes of the nation of Israel stood to one
another?)

Shishak was probably bent chiefly upon the conquest and plundering of
the cities. But from Jerusalem, beside other treasures of the temple and
palace, he also carried off the golden shields that had been made by
Solomon ([Kg1 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#016)), in the place of
which Rehoboam had copper ones made for his body-guard. The guard, רצים,
runners, are still further described as המּלך בּית פּתח בּית ה השּׁמרים,
"who kept the door of the king's house," i.e., supplied the sentinels
for the gate of the royal palace.

[Kg1 14:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#028)

Whenever the king went into the house of Jehovah, the runners carried
these shields; from which we may see that the king was accustomed to go
to the temple with solemn pomp. These shields were not kept in the
state-house of the forest of Lebanon ([Kg1
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#017)) as the golden shields were, but
in the guard-chamber (תּא; see at [Eze
40:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#007)) of the runners.

[Kg1 14:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#029)

Further particulars are given in 2 Chron 11 and 12 concerning the rest
of the acts of Rehoboam. "There was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam
the whole time (of their reign)." As nothing is said about any open war
between them, and the prophet Shemaiah prohibited the attack which
Rehoboam was about to make upon the tribes who had fallen away ([Kg1
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#023).), מלחמה can only denote the
hostile feelings and attitude of the two rulers towards one another.

[Kg1 14:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#031)

Death and burial of Rehoboam: as in the case of Solomon ([Kg1
11:43](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#043)). The name of the queen-mother
has already been given in [Kg1 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#021),
and the repetition of it here may be explained on the supposition that
in the original sources employed by the author of our books it stood in
this position. The son and successor of Rehoboam upon the throne is
called Abijam (אביּם) in the account before us; whereas in the
Chronicles he is always called Abijah (אביּה, [Ch2
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#016); [Ch2
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#001), etc., or אביּהוּ, [Ch2
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#021)). אביּם, i.e., father of the
sea, is unquestionably the older form of the name, which was reduced to
אביּה, and then identified with the formation from אבי and יה = יהוּ
(from יהוה).
