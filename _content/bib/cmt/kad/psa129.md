### [Psalms Chapter 129](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 129:0</span></span>

The End of the Oppressors of Zion

Just as [Psa 124:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#001) with the words
"let Israel say" was followed by [Psa
125:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#001) with "peace be upon Israel,"
so [Psa 128:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#001) with "peace be upon
Israel" is followed by [Psa 129:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#001)
with "let Israel say." This [Psa
129:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#001) has not only the call "let
Israel say," but also the situation of a deliverance that has been
experienced (cf. [Psa 129:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#004) with [Psa
124:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#006).), from which point it looks
gratefully back and confidently forward into the future, and an Aramaic
tinge that is noticeable here and there by the side of all other
classical character of form, in common with [Psa
124:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#001).

[Psalms 129:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 129:1</span></span>

Israel is gratefully to confess that, however much and sorely it was
oppressed, it still has not succumbed. רבּת, together with רבּה, has
occurred already in [Psa 65:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#010); [Psa
62:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#003), and it becomes usual in the
post-exilic language, [Psa 120:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#006); [Psa
123:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa123.htm#004), [Ch2
30:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#018); Syriac rebath. The expression
"from my youth" glances back to the time of the Egyptian bondage; for
the time of the sojourn in Egypt was the time of Israel's youth ([Hos
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#017), [Hos
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001), [Jer
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#002); [Eze
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#003)). The protasis [Psa
129:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#001) is repeated in an interlinked,
chain-like conjunction in order to complete the thought; for [Psa
129:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#002) is the turning-point, where גּם,
having reference to the whole negative clause, signifies "also" in the
sense of "nevertheless," ὅμως (synon. בּכל־בּכל), as in [Eze
16:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#028); [Ecc
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#007), cf. above, [Psa
119:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#024) : although they oppressed me
much and sore, yet have they not overpowered me (the construction is
like [Num 13:30](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#030), and frequently).

[Psalms 129:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 129:3</span></span>

Elsewhere it is said that the enemies have driven over Israel ([Psa
66:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#012)), or have gone over its back
([Isa 51:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#023)); here the customary
figurative language חרשׁ און in [Job
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#008) (cf. [Hos
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#013)) is extended to another figure
of hostile dealing: without compassion and without consideration they
ill-treated the stretched-forth back of the people who were held in
subjection, as though it were arable land, and, without restraining
their ferocity and setting a limit to their spoiling of the enslaved
people and country, they drew their furrow-strip (מעניתם, according to
the Ker מענותם) long. But מענה does not signify (as Keil on [Sa1
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#014) is of opinion, although
explaining the passage more correctly than Thenius) the furrow (= תּלם,
גּדוּד), but, like Arab. ma‛nât, a strip of arable land which the
ploughman takes in hand at one time, at both ends of which consequently
the ploughing team (צמד) always comes to a stand, turns round, and
ploughs a new furrow; from ענה, to bend, turn (vid., Wetzstein's
Excursus II p. 861). It is therefore: they drew their furrow-turning
long (dative of the object instead of the accusative with Hiph., as
e.g., in [Isa 29:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#002), cf. with Piel in
[Psa 34:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#004); [Psa
116:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#016), and Kal [Psa
69:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#006), after the Aramaic style,
although it is not unhebraic). Righteous is Jahve - this is an universal
truth, which has been verified in the present circumstances; - He hath
cut asunder the cords of the wicked (עבות as in [Psa
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#003); here, however, it is suggested by
the metaphor in [Psa 129:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#003), cf. [Job
39:10](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#010); lxx αὐχένας, i.e., ענוק), with
which they held Israel bound. From that which has just been experienced
Israel derives the hope that all Zion's haters (a newly coined name for
the enemies of the religion of Israel) will be obliged to retreat with
shame and confusion.

[Psalms 129:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 129:6</span></span>

The poet illustrates the fate that overtakes them by means of a picture
borrowed from Isaiah and worked up ([Psa
37:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#027)): they become like "grass of the
housetops," etc. שׁ is a relative to יבשׁ (quod exarescit), and קדמת,
priusquam, is Hebraized after מן־קדמת דּנה in [Dan
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#011), or מקּדמת דּנה in [Ezr
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#011). שׁלף elsewhere has the
signification "to draw forth" of a sword, shoe, or arrow, which is
followed by the lxx, Theodotion, and the Quinta: πρὸ τοῦ ἐκσπασθῆναι,
before it is plucked. But side by side with the ἐκσπασθῆναι of the lxx
we also find the reading exanthee'sai; and in this sense Jerome renders
(statim ut) viruerit, Symmachus ἐκκαυλῆσαι (to shoot into a stalk),
Aquila ἀνέθαλεν, the Sexta ἐκστερεῶσαι (to attain to full solidity). The
Targum paraphrases שׁלף in both senses: to shoot up and to pluck off.
The former signification, after which Venema interprets: antequam se
evaginet vel evaginetur, i.e., antequam e vaginulis suis se evolvat et
succrescat, is also advocated by Parchon, Kimchi, and Aben-Ezra. In the
same sense von Ortenberg conjectures שׁחלף. Since the grass of the
house-tops or roofs, if one wishes to pull it up, can be pulled up just
as well when it is withered as when it is green, and since it is the
most natural thing to take חציר as the subject to שׁלף, we decide in
favour of the intransitive signification, "to put itself forth, to
develope, shoot forth into ear." The roof-grass withers before it has
put forth ears of blossoms, just because it has no deep root, and
therefore cannot stand against the heat of the sun.

(Note: So, too, Geiger in the Deutsche Morgenlndische Zeitschrift, xiv.
278f., according to whom Arab. slf (šlf) occurs in Saadia and Abu-Said
in the signification "to be in the first maturity, to blossom," - a
sense שׁלף may also have here; cf. the Talmudic שׁלופפי used of unripe
dates that are still in blossom.)

The poet pursues the figure of the grass of the house-tops still
further. The encompassing lap or bosom (κόλπος) is called elsewhere חצן
([Isa 49:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#022); [Neh
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#013)); here it is חצן, like the Arabic
ḥiḍn (diminutive ḥoḍein), of the same root with מחוז, a creek, in [Psa
107:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#030). The enemies of Israel are as
grass upon the house-tops, which is not garnered in; their life closes
with sure destruction, the germ of which they (without any need for any
rooting out) carry within themselves. The observation of Knapp, that any
Western poet would have left off with [Psa
129:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#006), is based upon the error that
[Psa 129:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#007) are an idle
embellishment. The greeting addressed to the reapers in [Psa
129:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#008) is taken from life; it is not
denied even to heathen reapers. Similarly Boaz ([Rut
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#004)) greets them with "Jahve be with
you," and receivers the counter-salutation, "Jahve bless thee." Here it
is the passers-by who call out to those who are harvesting: The blessing
(בּרכּת) of Jahve happen to you (אליכם,

(Note: Here and there עליכם is found as an error of the copyist. The
Hebrew Psalter, Basel 1547, 12mo, notes it as a various reading.)

as in the Aaronitish blessing), and (since "we bless you in the name of
Jahve" would be a purposeless excess of politeness in the mouth of the
same speakers) receive in their turn the counter-salutation: We bless
you in the name of Jahve. As a contrast it follows that there is before
the righteous a garnering in of that which they have sown amidst the
exchange of joyful benedictory greetings.
