### [Esther Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#001)

[Esther](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">est 9:0</span></span>

The Jews Avenged of Their Enemies. The Feast of Purim Instituted -
Esther 9

On the day appointed by both edicts, the Jews assembled in the towns and
provinces of the kingdom to slay all who sought their hurt, and being
supported by the royal officials, inflicted a great defeat upon their
enemies ([Est 9:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#001)). At the queen's
desire, the king granted permission to the Jews in Susa to fight against
their enemies on the following day also ([Est
9:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#011)), while in the other towns and
districts of the kingdom they fought for their lives only on the 13th of
Adar; so that in these places they rested on the 14th, but in Susa not
till the 15th, and consequently kept in the latter the one day, in the
former the other, as a day of feasting and rejoicing ([Est
9:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#016)). The observance of this day
of resting as a festival, under the name of Purim, by all the Jews in
the Persian monarchy, was then instituted by Esther and Mordochai ([Est
9:20-32](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#020)).

[Esther 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">est 9:1</span></span>

The Jews avenged of their enemies. - [Est
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#001). In the twelfth month, on the
thirteenth day of the same - the Jews gathered themselves together in
their cities, etc. Several parenthetical clauses succeed this definition
of time, so that the statement of what then took place does not follow
till נקהלוּ, [Est 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#002). These
parenthetical clauses state not only the meaning of the day just named,
but also give a general notice of the conflict between the Jews and
their enemies. The first runs: "when the word of the king drew nigh and
his decree to be done," i.e., when the execution of the royal decree
approached. The second is: "on the day that the enemies of the Jews
hoped to have the mastery of them, and it was changed (i.e., the
contrary occurred), that the Jews had the mastery over them that hated
them." בּ שׁלט, to rule, to have the mastery over. נהפוך is infin. abs.,
used instead of the imperf. הוּא is referred by Bertheau to יום: the day
was changed from a day of misfortune to a day of prosperity for the
Jews, alluding to [Est 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#022); but it is
not a change of the day which is here spoken of, but a change of the
hope of the enemies into its opposite; hence we must regard הוּא as
neuter: it was changed, i.e., the contrary occurred. The pronoun המּה
serves to emphasize the subject; comp. Ewald, 314, a, who in this and
similar cases takes הוּא המּה in the sense of ipse, ipsi.

[Est 9:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#002)

בּעריהם, in their cities, i.e., the cities in which they dwelt in all
the dominions of the king. יד לשׁלח, to stretch out the hand (as also in
[Est 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#021); [Est
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#006), for the purpose of killing)
against those who sought their hurt, i.e., sought to destroy them. "And
no one stood before them (בּפני עמד, like [Jos
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#008); [Jos
21:42](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#042), and elsewhere), because the
fear of them fell upon all people (see rem. on [Est
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#017)). And all the rulers of the
provinces, and the satraps and governors (comp. [Est
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#009)), and those that did the king's
business (המּלאכה עשׁי, see rem. on [Est
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#009)), supported the Jews (נשּׂא like
[Ezr 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#004)), because the fear of
Mordochai fell upon them."

[Est 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#004)

"For Mordochai was great in the king's house (was much esteemed by the
king), and his fame went through all the provinces (שׁמעו as in [Jos
6:27](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#027); [Jos
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#009); [Jer
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#024)); for this man Mordochai became
continually greater;" comp. [Ch2
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#012), where the partic. גּדל stands
instead of the inf. abs. גּדול.

[Est 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#005)

Thus supported, the Jews inflicted defeat upon their enemies with the
sword, and with slaughter and destruction. הכּה with בּ, to deal a blow
upon or against some one, to cause or bring about upon enemies a defeat;
comp. e.g., [Sa2 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#010); [Sa2
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#017); [Num
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#006). The notion is strengthened by
וגו מכּת־חרב, literally, to strike a stroke of the sword, and of
slaughter, and of destruction, in accordance with the decree, [Est
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#011). "And did according to their will
to those that hated them," i.e., retaliated upon their enemies at their
discretion.

[Est 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#006)

In the citadel of Susa they destroyed (in round numbers) 500 men.

[Est 9:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#007)

Also they slew the ten sons of Haman, whose names are given, [Est
9:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#007);

(Note: The peculiar position of the names of the sons of Haman in
editions of the Bible, grounded as it is upon the ancient mode of
writing, must originally have been intended merely to give prominence to
the names, and facilitate their computation. The later Rabbis, however,
have endeavoured to discover therein some deeper meaning. This mode of
writing the names has been said to be signum voti, ut a ruina sua
nunquam amplius resurgant, or also a sign quod sicut hi decem filii in
linea perpendiculari, unus supra alterum, suspensi fuerint. Comp.
Buxtorf, Synagoga jud. pp. 157-159 of the Basle edit. 1580. What is
indicated by the smaller forms of the letters ת, שׁ, and ז, in the
first, seventh, and tenth names, is not known; the larger ו in the tenth
may have been meant to give prominence, by the character employed, to
this name as the last.)

but on the spoil they laid not their hand, though this was allowed to
them, [Est 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#011), as it had been
commanded to their enemies by Haman's edict, [Est
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#013), ut ostenderent, se non aliud
quam vitae suae incolumitatem quaerere; hanc enim perdere volebant ii
qui occidebantur. C. a Lapide.

[Esther 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">est 9:11</span></span>

When on the same day an account was given to the king of the result of
the conflict, and the number of those slain in Susa reported, he
announced to Queen Esther: the Jews have slain in the citadel of Susa
500 men and the ten sons of Haman; "what have they done in the rest of
the king's provinces?" i.e., if they have killed 500 men in Susa, how
many may they not have slain in other parts of the kingdom? and then
asked her what else she wished or required. With respect to the words,
comp. [Est 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#006), and [Est
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/est007.htm#002).

[Esther 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">est 9:13</span></span>

Esther requested: "let it be granted to the Jews which are in Susa to do
to-morrow also according to the decree of to-day (i.e., exactly as
to-day), and let the ten sons of Haman be hanged upon the tree," i.e.,
their dead bodies nailed on crosses - majoris infamiae causa, according
to Hebrew and Persian custom; comp. [Deu
21:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#022) and the explanation of [Ezr
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#011). On the motive for this request,
see above, p. 194.

[Esther 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">est 9:14</span></span>

The king commanded it so to be done. "Then was a decree given at Susa,
and they hanged the ten sons of Haman." The decree given in Susa does
not refer to the hanging of the sons of Haman, but to the permission
given to the Jews to fight against their enemies on the morrow also.
This is required not only by a comparison of [Est
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#013), but also by the connection of
the present verse; for in consequence of this decree the Jews assembled
on the 14th Adar (comp. ויּקּהלוּ, then they assembled themselves, [Est
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#015)), while the hanging of the sons
of Haman, on the contrary, is related in an accessory clause by a simple
perfect, תּלוּ.

[Esther 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">est 9:15</span></span>

On this second day the Jews slew 300 more; comp. [Est
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#010). - [Est
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#016). The rest of the Jews in the
provinces, i.e., the Jews in the other parts of the kingdom, assembled
themselves and stood for their lives, and had rest from their enemies,
and slew of their foes 75,000, but upon the spoil they laid not their
hand. על עמד like [Est 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#011). The
מאיביהם ונוח inserted between על נ ועמד and והרוג is striking; we should
rather have expected the resting or having rest from their enemies after
the death of the latter, as in [Est
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#017) and [Est
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#018), where this is plainly stated to
have taken place on the day after the slaughter. The position of these
words is only explained by the consideration, that the narrator desired
at once to point out how the matter ended. The narrative continues in
the infin. abs. instead of expressing this clause by the infin. constr.,
and so causing it to be governed by what precedes. Thus - as Ew. 351, c,
remarks - all the possible hues of the sentence fade into this grey and
formless termination (viz., the use of the infin. absol. instead of the
verb. fin.). This inaccuracy of diction does not justify us, however, in
assuming that we have here an interpolation or an alteration in the
text. The statement of the day is given in [Est
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#017), and then the clause following is
again added in the inf. absol.: "and they rested on the 14th day of the
same (of Adar), and made it a day of feasting and gladness."

[Esther 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">est 9:18</span></span>

The Jews in Susa, on the other hand, who were both on the 13th and 14th
Adar still fighting against their enemies, and did not rest till the
15th, made this latter their day of rejoicing. - In [Est
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#019) it is again stated that the Jews
in the country towns and villages made the 14th their day of gladness,
and this statement is appended by על־כּן to make this appear the result
of what precedes. The Chethiv הפּרוזים is perhaps an Aramaic expression
for פּרזים, [Deu 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#005) and [Sa1
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#018). פּרוזי means the inhabitants of
the open, i.e., unfortified, towns and villages of the plains in
contrast to the fortified capital; see on [Deu
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#005). On פּרזות, compare [Eze
38:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#011); [Zac
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#008). וגו מנות משׁלוח, and of mutual
sending of gifts, i.e., portions of food; comp. [Neh
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#010), [Neh
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#012).

[Esther 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">est 9:20</span></span>

The feast of Purim instituted by letters from Mordochai and Esther. [Est
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#020). Mordochai wrote these things,
and sent letters to all the Jews, etc. האלּה הדּברים does not mean the
contents of the present book but the events of the last days, especially
the fact that the Jews, after overcoming their enemies, rested in Susa
on the 15th, in the other provinces on the 14th Adar, and kept these
days as days of rejoicing. This is obvious from the object of these
letters, [Est 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#021) : וגו עליהם לקיּם,
to appoint among them "that they should keep the 14th day of the month
Adar and the 15th day of the same yearly, as the days on which the Jews
rested from their enemies, and as the month which was turned unto them
from sorrow to joy, and from mourning into a glad day, that they should
keep them as days of feasting and joy, and of mutual sending of portions
one to another, and gifts to the poor." יום עשׂה, to keep, to celebrate
a day. The עשׂים להיות, [Est 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#021), is
after long parentheses taken up again in אותם לעשׂות. קיּם, to establish
a matter, to authorize it, comp. [Rut
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#007). Both the 14th and 15th Adar were
made festivals because the Jews on them had rest from their enemies, and
celebrated this rest by feasting, some on the former, some on the latter
day.

[Esther 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">est 9:23</span></span>

And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordochai had
written to them. They had begun, as [Est
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#022) tells us, by keeping both days,
and Mordochai wrote to them that they should make this an annual custom.
This they agreed to do in consequence of Mordochai's letters. The reason
of their so doing is given in [Est
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#024) and [Est
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#025), and the name of this festival is
explained, [Est 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#026), by a brief
recapitulation of the events which gave rise to it. Then follows, [Est
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#026) and [Est
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#027), another wordy statement of the
fact, that it was by reason of this letter, and on account of what they
had seen, i.e., experienced, that the annual celebration of this feast
was instituted for a perpetual memorial to all Jews at all times ([Est
9:28](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#028) and [Est
9:29](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#029)).

[Esther 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">est 9:24</span></span>

For Haman, the enemy of all the Jews, had devised against the Jews to
destroy them (comp. [Est 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#001), [Est
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#006).), and had cast Pur, that is the
lot (see on [Est 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#007)), to consume them
and to destroy them. המם, mostly used of the discomfiture with which God
destroys the enemies, [Exo 14:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#024); [Deu
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#015), and elsewhere.

[Esther 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">est 9:25</span></span>

וּבבאהּ, and when it (the matter), not when she, Esther, came before the
king, - for Esther is not named in the context, - he commanded by
letters ([Est 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#008)), i.e., he gave the
written order: let the wicked device which he devised against the Jews
return upon his own head; and they hanged him and his sons upon the
tree.

[Esther 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">est 9:26</span></span>

Wherefore they called these days Purim after the name Pur. This first
על־כּן refers to what precedes and states the reason, resulting from
what has just been mentioned, why this festival received the name of
Purim. With the second על־כּן begins a new sentence which reaches to
[Est 9:28](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#028), and explains how it
happened that these feast-days became a general observance with all
Jews; namely, that because of all the words of this letter (of
Mordochai, [Est 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#020)), and of what
they had seen concerning the matter (על־כּכה, concerning so and so), and
what had come upon them (therefore for two reasons: (1) because of the
written injunction of Mordochai; and (2) because they had themselves
experienced this event), the Jews established, and took upon themselves,
their descendants, and all who should join themselves unto them
(proselytes), so that it should not fail (i.e., inviolably), to keep (to
celebrate) these two days according to the writing concerning them and
the time appointed thereby year by year.

[Esther 9:28](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">est 9:28</span></span>

And that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every
generation, every family, every province, and every city; and these days
of Purim are not to pass away among the Jews, nor their remembrance to
cease among their seed. The participles ונעשׂים נזכּרים still depend on
להיות, [Est 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#027). Not till the last
clause does the construction change in להיות לא to the temp. finit.
יעבור ולא is a periphrasis of the adverb: imperishably, inviolably.
כּכתבם, secundum scriptum eorum, i.e., as Mordochai had written
concerning them ([Est 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#023)). כּזמנּם,
as he had appointed their time. מן סוּף, to come to an end from, i.e.,
to cease among their descendants.

[Esther 9:29](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">est 9:29</span></span>

A second letter from Queen Esther and Mordochai to appoint fasting and
lamentation on the days of Purim. [Est
9:29](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#029). And Esther the queen and
Mordochai the Jew wrote with all strength, that is very forcibly, to
appoint this second letter concerning Purim, i.e., to give to the
contents of this second letter the force of law. הזּאת refers to what
follows, in which the contents of the letter are briefly intimated. The
letter is called השּׁנית with reference to the first letter sent by
Mordochai, [Est 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#020).

[Est 9:30-32](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#030)

And he (Mordochai) sent letters, i.e., copies of the writing mentioned
[Est 9:29](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#029), to all the Jews in the 127
provinces (which formed) the kingdom of Ahashverosh, words of peace and
truth, i.e., letters containing words of peace and truth ([Est
9:31](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#031)), to appoint these days of Purim
in their portions of time according as Mordochai the Jew and Esther the
queen had appointed, and as they (the Jews) had appointed for themselves
and for their descendants, the things (or words = precepts) of the
fastings and their lamentations. בּזמנּיהם, in their appointed times; as
the suffix relates to the days of Purim, the זמנּים can mean only
portions of time in these days. The sense of [Est
9:29-31](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#029) is as follows: According to
the injunctions of Esther and Mordochai, the Jews appointed for
themselves and their descendants times also of fasting and lamentation
in the days of Purim. To make this appointment binding upon all the Jews
in all provinces of the Persian monarchy, Esther and Mordochai published
a second letter, which was sent by Mordochai throughout the whole realm
of King Ahashverosh. To this is added, [Est
9:32](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#032), that the decree of Esther
appointed these matters of Purim, i.e., the injunction mentioned vv.
29-31, also to fast and weep during these days, and it was written in
the book. הסּפר, the book in which this decree was written, cannot mean
the writing of Esther mentioned. [Est
9:29](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#029), but some written document
concerning Purim which has not come down to us, though used as an
authority by the author of the present book. The times when the fasting
and lamentation were to take place in the days of Purim, are not stated
in this verse; this could, however, only be on the day which Haman had
appointed for the extermination of the Jews, viz., the 13th Adar. This
day is kept by the Jews as אסתּר תּענית, Esther's fast.

(Note: According to 2 Macc. 15:36, the victory over Nicanor was to be
celebrated on the 13th Adar, but, according to a note of Dr. Cassel in
Grimm's kurzgef. exeget. Handb. zu den Apokryphen, on 2 Macc. 15:36, the
festival of Nicanor is mentioned in Jewish writings, as Megillat Taanit,
c. 12, in the Babylonian Talmud, tr. Taanit, f. 18b, in Massechet Sofrim
17, 4, but has been by no means observed for at least the last thousand
years. The book Scheiltot of R. Acha (in the 9th century) speaks of the
13th Adar as a fast-day in memory of the fast of Esther, while even at
the time of the Talmud the "Fast of Esther" is spoken of as a three days
fast, kept, however, after the feast of Purim. From all this it is
obvious, that a diversity of opinions prevailed among the Rabbis
concerning the time of this fast of Esther.)
