### [Psalms Chapter 144](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 144:0</span></span>

Taking Courage in God before a Decisive Combat

Praised be Jahve who teacheth me to fight and conquer ([Psa
144:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#001), [Psa
144:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#002)), me the feeble mortal, who am
strong only in Him, [Psa 144:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#003). May
Jahve then be pleased to grant a victory this time also over the
boastful, lying enemies, [Psa 144:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#005);
so will I sing new songs of thanksgiving unto Him, the bestower of
victory, [Psa 144:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#009). May He be
pleased to deliver me out of the hand of the barbarians who envy us our
prosperity, which is the result of our having Jahve as our God, [Psa
144:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#011). A glance at this course of
the thought commends the additional inscription of the lxx (according to
Origen only "in a few copies"), πρὸς τὸν Γολιάδ, and the Targumist's
reference of the "evil sword" in [Psa
144:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#010) to the sword of Goliath (after
the example of the Midrash). Read [Sa1
17:47](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#047). The Psalm has grown out of this
utterance of David. In one of the old histories, just as several of
these lie at the foundation of our Books of Samuel as sources of
information that are still recognisable, it was intended to express the
feelings with which David entered upon the single-handed combat with
Goliath and decided the victory of Israel over the Philistines. At that
time he had already been anointed by Samuel, as both the narratives
which have been worked up together in the First Book of Samuel assume:
see [Sa1 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#013); [Sa1
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#001). And this victory was for him a
gigantic stride to the throne.

If אשׁר in [Psa 144:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#012) is taken as eo
quod, so that envy is brought under consideration as a motive for the
causeless (שׁוא), lyingly treacherous rising (ימין שׁקר) of the
neighbouring peoples, then the passage [Psa
144:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#012) can at any rate be
comprehended as a part of the form of the whole. But only thus, and not
otherwise; for אשׁר cannot be intended as a statement of the aim or
purpose: in order that they may be...(Jerome, De Wette, Hengstenberg,
and others), since nothing but illustrative substantival clauses follow;
nor do these clauses admit of an optative sense: We, whose sons, may
they be...(Maurer); and אשׁר never has an assuring sense (Vaihinger). It
is also evident that we cannot, with Saadia, go back to [Psa
144:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#009) for the interpretation of the
אשׁר (Arab. asbh 'lâ mâ). But that junction by means of eo quod is
hazardous, since envy or ill-will (קנאה) is not previously mentioned,
and וימינם ימין שׁקר expresses a fact, and not an action. If it is
further considered that nothing is wanting in the way of finish to the
Psalm if it closes with [Psa 144:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#011),
it becomes all the more doubtful whether [Psa
144:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#012) belonged originally to the
Psalm. And yet we cannot discover any Psalm in its immediate
neighbourhood to which this piece might be attached. It might the most
readily, as Hitzig correctly judges, be inserted between [Psa
147:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#013) and [Psa
147:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#014) of Ps 147. But the rhythm and
style differ from this Psalm, and we must therefore rest satisfied with
the fact that a fragment of another Psalm is here added to [Psa
144:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#001), which of necessity may be
accounted as an integral part of it; but in spite of the fact that the
whole Psalm is built up on a gigantic scale, this was not its original
corner-stone, just as one does not indeed look for anything further
after the refrain, together with the mention of David in [Psa
144:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#010)., cf. Ps 18:51.

[Psalms 144:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 144:1</span></span>

The whole of this first strophe is an imitation of David's great song of
thanksgiving, Ps 18. Hence the calling of Jahve "my rock," [Psa
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#003), [Psa
18:47](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#047); hence the heaping up of other
appellations in [Psa 144:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#002), in which
[Psa 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#003) is echoed; but וּמפלּטי־לי
(with Lamed deprived of the Dagesh) follows the model of [Sa2
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#002). The naming of Jahve with חסדּי
is a bold abbreviation of אלהי חסדּי in [Psa
59:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#011), 18, as also in [Jon
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jon002.htm#008) the God whom the idolatrous ones
forsake is called הסדּם. Instead of מלחמה the Davidic Psalms also
poetically say קרב, [Psa 55:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#022), cf.
[Psa 78:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#009). The expression "who
traineth my hands for the fight" we have already read in [Psa
18:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#035). The last words of the strophe,
too, are after [Psa 18:48](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#048); but instead
of ויּדבּר this poet says הרודד, from רדד = רדה (cf. [Isa
45:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001); [Isa
41:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#002)), perhaps under the influence of
uwmoriyd in [Sa2 22:48](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#048). In [Psa
18:48](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#048) we however read עמּים, and the
Masora has enumerated [Psa 144:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#002),
together with [Sa2 22:44](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#044); [Lam
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#014), as the three passages in which
it is written עמי, whilst one expects עמים (ג דסבירין עמים), as the
Targum, Syriac, and Jerome (yet not the lxx) in fact render it. But
neither from the language of the books nor from the popular dialect can
it be reasonably expected that they would say עמּי for עמּים in such an
ambiguous connection. Either, therefore, we have to read עמים,

(Note: Rashi is acquainted with an otherwise unknown note of the Masora:
תחתיו קרי; but this Ker is imaginary.)

or we must fall in with the strong expression, and this is possible:
there is, indeed, no necessity for the subduing to be intended of the
use of despotic power, it can also be intended to God-given power, and
of subjugating authority. David, the anointed one, but not having as yet
ascended the throne, here gives expression to the hope that Jahve will
grant him deeds of victory which will compel Israel to submit to him,
whether willingly or reluctantly.

[Psalms 144:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 144:3</span></span>

It is evident that [Psa 144:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#003) is a
variation of [Psa 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#005) with the use of
other verbs. ידע in the sense of loving intimacy; חשּׁב, properly to
count, compute, here rationem habere. Instead of כּי followed by the
future there are consecutive futures here, and בּן־אדם is aramaizingly
(בּר אנשׁ) metamorphosed into בּן־אנושׁ. [Psa
144:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#004) is just such another imitation,
like a miniature of [Psa 39:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#006)., [Psa
39:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#011), cf. [Psa
62:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#010). The figure of the shadow is the
same as in [Psa 102:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#012), cf. [Psa
109:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#023). The connection of the third
stanza with the second is still more disrupt than that of the second
with the first.

[Psalms 144:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 144:5</span></span>

The deeds of God which Ps 18 celebrates are here made an object of
prayer. We see from [Psa 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#010) that
ותרד, [Psa 144:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#005), has Jahve and not
the heavens as its subject; and from [Psa
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#015) that the suffix em in [Psa
144:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#006) is meant in both instances to be
referred to the enemies. The enemies are called sons of a foreign
country, i.e., barbarians, as in [Psa
18:45](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#045). The fact that Jahve stretches
forth His hand out of the heavens and rescues David out of great waters,
is taken verbatim from [Psa 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#017); and
the poet has added the interpretation to the figure here. On [Psa
144:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#008) cf. [Psa
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#003); [Psa
41:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#007). The combination of words "right
hand of falsehood" is the same as in [Psa
109:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#002). But our poet, although so great
an imitator, has, however, much also that is peculiar to himself. The
verb בּרק, "to send forth lightning;" the verb פּצה in the
Aramaeo-Arabic signification "to tear out of, rescue," which in David
always only signifies "to tear open, open wide" (one's mouth), [Psa
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#014); [Psa
66:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#014); and the combination "the right
hand of falsehood" (like "the tongue of falsehood" in [Psa
109:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#002)), i.e., the hand raised for a
false oath, are only found here. The figure of Omnipotence, "He toucheth
the mountains and they smoke," is, as in [Psa
104:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#032), taken from the mountains that
smoked at the giving of the Law, [Exo
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#018); [Exo
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#015). The mountains, as in [Psa
68:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#017) (cf. [Psa
76:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#005)), point to the worldly powers.
God only needs to touch these as with the tip of His finger, and the
inward fire, which will consume them, at once makes itself known by the
smoke, which ascends from them. The prayer for victory is followed by a
vow of thanksgiving for that which is to be bestowed.

[Psalms 144:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 144:9</span></span>

With the exception of [Psa 108:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#001),
which is composed of two Davidic Elohim-Psalms, the Elohim in [Psa
144:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#009) of this strophe is the only one
in the last two Books of the Psalter, and is therefore a feeble attempt
also to reproduce the Davidic Elohimic style. The "new song" calls to
mind [Psa 33:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#003); [Psa
40:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#004); and נבל עשׂור also recalls [Psa
33:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#002) (which see). The fact that David
mentions himself by name in his own song comes about in imitation of Ps
18:51. From the eminence of thanksgiving the song finally descends again
to petition, [Psa 144:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#007), being
repeated as a refrain. The petition developes itself afresh out of the
attributes of the Being invoked ([Psa
144:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#010)), and these are a pledge of its
fulfilment. For how could the God to whom all victorious kings owe their
victory ([Psa 33:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#016), cf. [Kg2
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#001); [Sa1
17:47](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#047)) possibly suffer His servant
David to succumb to the sword of the enemy! חרב רעה is the sword that is
engaged in the service of evil.

[Psalms 144:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 144:12</span></span>

With reference to the relation of this passage to the preceding, vid.,
the introduction. אשׁר (it is uncertain whether this is a word belonging
originally to this piece or one added by the person who appended it as a
sort of clasp or rivet) signifies here quoniam, as in [Jdg
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#017); [Jer
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#013), and frequently. lxx ὢν οἱ υίοὶ
(אשׁר בניהם); so that the temporal prosperity of the enemies is pictured
here, and in [Psa 144:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#015) the spiritual
possession of Israel is contrasted with it. The union becomes
satisfactorily close in connection with this reading, but the reference
of the description, so designedly set forth, to the enemies is
improbable. In [Psa 144:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#012) we hear
a language that is altogether peculiar, without any assignable earlier
model. Instead of נטעים we read נטעים elsewhere; "in their youth"
belongs to "our sons." מזוינוּ, our garners or treasuries, from a
singular מזו or מזוּ (apparently from a verb מזה, but contracted out of
מזוה), is a hapaxlegomenon; the older language has the words אסם, אוצר,
ממּגוּרה instead of it. In like manner זן, genus (vid., Ewald, Lehrbuch,
S. 380), is a later word (found besides only in [Ch2
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#014), where וּזנים signifies et varia
quidem, Syriac zenonoje, or directly spices from species); the older
language has miyn for this word. Instead of אלּוּפים, kine, which
signifies "princes" in the older language, the older language says אלפים
in [Psa 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#008). The plena scriptio
צאוננוּ, in which the Waw is even inaccurate, corresponds to the later
period; and to this corresponds שׁ = אשׁר in [Psa
144:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#015), cf. on the other hand [Psa
33:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#012). Also מסבּלים, laden = bearing,
like the Latin forda from ferre (cf. מעבּר in [Job
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#010)), is not found elsewhere. צאן is
(contrary to [Gen 30:39](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#039)) treated as a
feminine collective, and אלּוּף (cf. שׁור in [Job
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#010)) as a nomen epicaenum. Contrary
to the usage of the word, Maurer, Kצster, Von Lengerke, and F׬rst render
it: our princes are set up (after [Ezr
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#003)); also, after the mention of
animals of the fold upon the meadows out-of-doors, one does not expect
the mention of princes, but of horned cattle that are to be found in the
stalls.

זוית elsewhere signifies a corner, and here, according to the prevailing
view, the corner-pillars; so that the elegant slender daughters are
likened to tastefully sculptured Caryatides - not to sculptured
projections (Luther). For (1) זוית does not signify a projection, but a
corner, an angle, Arabic Arab. zâwyt, zâwia (in the terminology of the
stone-mason the square-stone = אבן פּנּהּ, in the terminology of the
carpenter the square), from Arab. zwâ, abdere (cf. e.g., the proverb:
fı̂'l zawâjâ chabâjâ, in the corners are treasures). (2) The upstanding
pillar is better adapted to the comparison than the overhanging
projection. But that other prevailing interpretation is also doubtful.
The architecture of Syria and Palestine - the ancient, so far as it can
be known to us from its remains, and the new - exhibits nothing in
connection with which one would be led to think of "corner-pillars." Nor
is there any trace of that signification to be found in the Semitic
זוית. On the other hand, the corners of large rooms in the houses of
persons of position are ornamented with carved work even in the present
day, and since this ornamentation is variegated, it may be asked whether
מחתּבות does here signify "sculptured," and not rather "striped in
colours, variegated," which we prefer, since חטב (cogn. חצב) signifies
nothing more than to hew firewood;

(Note: In every instance where חטב (cogn. חצב) occurs, frequently side
by side with שׁאב מים (to draw water), it signifies to hew wood for
kindling; wherefore in Arabic, in which the verb has been lost, Arab.
ḥaṭab signifies firewood (in distinction from Arab. chšb, wood for
building, timber), and not merely this, but fuel in the widest sense,
e.g., in villages where wood is scarce, cow-dung (vid., Job, at [Job
20:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#006), note), and the hemp-stalk, or
stalk of the maize, in the desert the Arab. b‛rt, i.e., camel-dung
(which blazes up with a blue flame), and the perennial steppe-plant or
its root. In relation to Arab. ḥaṭab, aḥṭb signifies lopped, pruned,
robbed of its branches (of a tree), and Arab. ḥrb ḥâtb a pruning war,
which devastates a country, just as the wood-gathering women of a
settlement (styled Arab. 'l-ḥâťbât or 'l-ȟwâṭt) with their small hatchet
(Arab. miḥṭab) lay a district covered with tall plants bare in a few
days. In the villages of the Merg' the little girls who collect the dry
cow-dung upon the pastures are called Arab. bnât ḥâṭbât, בּנות הטבות. -
Wetzstein.)

and on the other side, the signification of the Arabic chaṭiba, to be
striped, many-coloured (IV to become green-striped, of the
coloquintida), is also secured to the verb חטב side by side with that
signification by [Pro 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#016). It is
therefore to be rendered: our daughters are as corners adorned in varied
colours after the architecture of palaces.

(Note: Corners with variegated carved work are found even in the present
day in Damascus in every reception-room (the so-called Arab. qâ‛t) or
respectable houses cf. Lane, Manners and Customs of the Modern
Egyptians, Introduction). An architectural ornament composed with much
good taste and laborious art out of wood carvings, and glittering with
gold and brilliant colours, covers the upper part of the corners, of
which a ḳâ‛a may have as many as sixteen, since three wings frequently
abut upon the bêt el-baḥǎra, i.e., the square with its marble basin.
This decoration, which has a most pleasing effect to the eye, is a great
advantage to saloons from two to three storeys high, and is evidently
designed to get rid of the darker corners above on the ceiling, comes
down from the ceiling in the corners of the room for the length of six
to nine feet, gradually becoming narrower as it descends. It is the
broadest above, so that it there also covers the ends of the horizontal
corners formed by the walls and the ceiling. If this crowning of the
corners, the technical designation of which, if I remember rightly, is
Arab. 'l-qrnyt, ḳornı̂a, might be said to go back into Biblical
antiquity, the Psalmist would have used it as a simile to mark the
beauty, gorgeous dress, and rich adornment of women. Perhaps, too,
because they are not only modest and chaste (cf. Arabic mesturât, a
veiled woman, in opposition to memshushât, one shone on by the sun), but
also, like the children of respectable families, hidden from the eyes of
strangers; for the Arabic proverb quoted above says, "treasures are
hidden in the corners," and the superscription of a letter addressed to
a lady of position runs: "May it kiss the hand of the protected lady and
of the hidden jewel." - Wetzstein.)

The words האליף, to bring forth by thousands, and מרבּב (denominative
from רבבה), which surpasses it, multiplied by tens of thousands, are
freely formed. Concerning חוּצות, meadows, vid., on [Job
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#017). פּרץ, in a martial sense a
defeat, clades, e.g., in [Jdg 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#015),
is here any violent misfortune whatever, as murrain, which causes a
breach, and יוצאת any head of cattle which goes off by a single
misfortune. The lamentation in the streets is intended as in [Jer
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#002). שׁכּכה is also found in [Sol
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#009); nor does the poet, however,
hesitate to blend this שׁ with the tetragrammaton into one word. The Jod
is not dageshed (cf. [Psa 123:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa123.htm#002)),
because it is to be read שׁאדני, cf. מיהוה = מאדני in [Gen
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#014). Luther takes [Psa
144:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#015) and [Psa
144:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#015) as contrasts: Blessed is the
people that is in such a case, But blessed is the people whose God is
the Lord. There is, however, no antithesis intended, but only an
exceeding of the first declaration by the second. For to be allowed to
call the God from whom every blessing comes his God, is still infinitely
more than the richest abundance of material blessing. The pinnacle of
Israel's good fortune consists in being, by the election of grace, the
people of the Lord ([Psa 33:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#012)).
