### [Joshua Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#001)

[Joshua 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 20:1</span></span>

After the distribution of the land by lot among the tribes of Israel,
six towns were set apart, in accordance with the Mosaic instructions in
Num 35, as places of refuge for unintentional manslayers. Before
describing the appointment and setting apart of these towns, the writer
repeats in [Jos 20:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#001) the main points
of the Mosaic law contained in Num 35:9-29 and [Deu
19:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#001), with reference to the
reception of the manslayers into these towns. לכם תּנוּ, "give to you,"
i.e., appoint for yourselves, "cities of refuge," etc. In [Jos
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#006), the two regulations, "until he
stand before the congregation for judgment," and "until the death of the
high priest," are to be understood, in accordance with the clear
explanation given in [Num 35:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#024), as
meaning that the manslayer was to live in the town till the congregation
had pronounced judgment upon the matter, and either given him up to the
avenger of blood as a wilful murderer, or taken him back to the city of
refuge as an unintentional manslayer, in which case he was to remain
there till the death of the existing high priest. For further
particulars, see at Num 35.

[Joshua 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jos 20:7</span></span>

List of the cites: Levitical cities were chosen, for the reasons
explained in the Commentary on the Pentateuch.

[Jos 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#007)

In the land on this side (viz., Canaan) they sanctified the following
cities. In the north, Kedesh (see at [Jos
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#022)), in Galil, on the mountains of
Naphtali. Galil (a circle) was a district in the northern part of the
subsequent province of Galilee; it is called הגּוים גּליל, circle of the
heathen, in [Isa 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#001), because an
unusually large number of heathen or Gentiles were living there. In the
centre of the land, Shechem, upon the mountains of Ephraim (see at [Jos
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#007)). And in the south, Kirjath-arba,
i.e., Hebron, upon the mountains of Judah (see at [Jos
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#003)).

[Jos 20:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#008)

The cities in the land on the other side had already been appointed by
Moses ([Deu 4:41-43](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#041)). For the sake of
completeness, they are mentioned here again: viz., Bezer, Ramoth in
Gilead, and Golan (see at [Deu 4:43](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#043)).
The subject is brought to a close in [Jos
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#009). המּוּעדה ערי signifies neither
urbes congregationis (Kimchi) nor urbes asyli (Gesenius), but cities of
appointment, - those which received the appointment already given and
repeated again in what follows.
