<p>When Moses had restored the covenant bond through his intercession (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#014">Exo 33:14</A>), he was directed by Jehovah to hew out two stones, like the former ones which he had broken, and to come with them the next morning up the mountain, and Jehovah would write upon them the same words as upon the first, 
<p>(Note: Namely, the ten words in Ex 20:2-17, not the laws contained in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#012">Exo 34:12-26</A> of this chapter, as Gthe and Hitzig suppose. See Hengstenberg, Dissertations ii. p. 319, and Kurtz on the Old Covenant iii. 182ff.)
<p>and thus restore the covenant record. It was also commanded, as in the former case (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#012">Exo 19:12-13</A>), that no one should go up the mountain with him, or be seen upon it, and that not even cattle should feed against the mountain, i.e., in the immediate neighbourhood (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#003">Exo 34:3</A>). The first tables of the covenant were called "tables of stone" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#012">Exo 24:12</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#018">Exo 31:18</A>); the second, on the other hand, which were hewn by Moses, are called "tables of stones" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#001">Exo 34:1</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#004">Exo 34:4</A>); and the latter expression is applied indiscriminately to both of them in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#013">Deu 4:13</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#019">Deu 5:19</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#009">Deu 9:9-11</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#001">Deu 10:1-4</A>. This difference does not indicate a diversity in the records, but may be explained very simply from the fact, that the tables prepared by Moses were hewn from two stones, and not both from the same block; whereas all that could be said of the former, which had been made by God Himself, was that they were of stone, since no one knew whether God had used one stone or two for the purpose. There is apparently far more importance in the following distinction, that the second tables were delivered by Moses and only written upon by God, whereas in the case of the former both the writing and the materials came from God. This cannot have been intended either as a punishment for the nation (Hengstenberg), or as "the sign of a higher stage of the covenant, inasmuch as the further the reciprocity extended, the firmer was the covenant" (Baumgarten). It is much more natural to seek for the cause, as Rashi does, in the fact, that Moses had broken the first in pieces; only we must not regard it as a sign that God disapproved of the manifestation of anger on the part of Moses, but rather as a recognition of his zealous exertions for the restoration of the covenant which had been broken by the sin of the nation. As Moses had restored the covenant through his energetic intercession, he should also provide the materials for the renewal of the covenant record, and bring them to God, for Him to complete and confirm the record by writing the covenant words upon the tables.
<p>On the following morning, when Moses ascended the mountain, Jehovah granted him the promised manifestation of His glory (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#005">Exo 34:5</A>.). The description of this unparalleled occurrence is in perfect harmony with the mysterious and majestic character of the revelation. "Jehovah descended (from heaven) in the cloud, and stood by him there, and proclaimed the name of Jehovah; and Jehovah passed by in his sight, and proclaimed Jehovah, Jehovah God, merciful and gracious," etc. What Moses saw we are not told, but simply the words in which Jehovah proclaimed all the glory of His being; whilst it is recorded of Moses, that he bowed his head toward the earth and worshipped. This "sermon on the name of the Lord," as Luther calls it, disclosed to Moses the most hidden nature of Jehovah. It proclaimed that God is love, but that kind of love in which mercy, grace, long-suffering, goodness, and truth are united with holiness and justice. As the merciful One, who is great in goodness and truth, Jehovah shows mercy to the thousandth, forgiving sin and iniquity in long-suffering and grace; but He does not leave sin altogether unpunished, and in His justice visits the sin of the fathers upon the children and the children's children even unto the fourth generation. The Lord had already revealed Himself to the whole nation from Mount Sinai as visiting sin and showing mercy (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#005">Exo 20:5</A>.). But whereas on that occasion the burning zeal of Jehovah which visits sin stood in the foreground, and mercy only followed afterwards, here grace, mercy, and goodness are placed in the front. And accordingly all the words which the language contained to express the idea of grace in its varied manifestations to the sinner, are crowded together here, to reveal the fact that in His inmost being God is love. But in order that grace may not be perverted by sinners into a ground of wantonness, justice is not wanting even here with its solemn threatenings, although it only follows mercy, to show that mercy is mightier than wrath, and that holy love does not punish til sinners despise the riches of the goodness, patience, and long-suffering of God. As Jehovah here proclaimed His name, so did He continue to bear witness of it to the Israelites, from their departure from Sinai till their entrance into Canaan, and from that time forward till their dispersion among the heathen, and even now in their exile showing mercy to the thousandth, when they turn to the Redeemer who has come out of Zion.

<p>On this manifestation of mercy, Moses repeated the prayer that Jehovah would go in the midst of Israel. It is true the Lord had already promised that His face should go with them (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#014">Exo 33:14</A>); but as Moses had asked for a sign of the glory of the Lord as a seal to the promise, it was perfectly natural that, when this petition was granted, he should lay hold of the grace that had been revealed to him as it never had been before, and endeavour to give even greater stability to the covenant. To this end he repeated his former intercession on behalf of the nation, at the same time making this confession, "For it is a stiff-necked people; therefore forgive our iniquity and our sin, and make us the inheritance." Moses spoke collectively, including himself in the nation in the presence of God. The reason which he assigned pointed to the deep root of corruption that had broken out in the worship of the golden calf, and was appropriately pleaded as a motive for asking forgiveness, inasmuch as God Himself had assigned the natural corruption of the human race as a reason why He would not destroy it again with a flood (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#021">Gen 8:21</A>). Wrath was mitigated by a regard to the natural condition. - &#1504;&#1495;&#1500; in the Kal, with an accusative of the person, does not mean to lead a person into the inheritance, but to make a person into an inheritance; here, therefore, to make Israel the possession of Jehovah (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#020">Deu 4:20</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#026">Deu 9:26</A>, cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#012">Zac 2:12</A>). Jehovah at once declared (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#010">Exo 34:10</A>) that He would conclude a covenant, i.e., restore the broken covenant, and do marvels before the whole nation, such as had not been done in all the earth or in any nation, and thus by these His works distinguish Israel before all nations as His own property (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#016">Exo 33:16</A>). The nation was to see this, because it would be terrible; terrible, namely, through the overthrow of the powers that resisted the kingdom of God, every one of whom would be laid prostrate and destroyed by the majesty of the Almighty. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#011">Exodus 34:11</A></p>

<p>To recall the duties of the covenant once more to the minds of the people, the Lord repeats from among the rights of Israel, upon the basis of which the covenant had been established (ch. 21-23), two of the leading points which determined the attitude of the nation towards Him, and which constituted, as it were, the main pillars that were to support the covenant about to be renewed. These were, first, the warning against every kind of league with the Canaanites, who were to be driven out before the Israelites (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#011">Exo 34:11-16</A>); and, secondly, the instructions concerning the true worship of Jehovah (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#017">Exo 34:17-26</A>). The warning against friendship with the idolatrous Canaanites (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#011">Exo 34:11-16</A>) is more fully developed and more strongly enforced than in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#023">Exo 23:23</A>. The Israelites, when received into the covenant with Jehovah, were not only to beware of forming any covenant with the inhabitants of Canaan (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#032">Exo 23:32-33</A>), but were to destroy all the signs of their idolatrous worship, such as altars, monuments (see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#024">Exo 23:24</A>), and asherim, the idols of Astarte, the Canaanitish goddess of nature, which consisted for the most part of wooden pillars (see my Comm. on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#023">Kg1 14:23</A>), and to worship no other god, because Jehovah was called jealous, i.e., had revealed Himself as jealous (see at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#005">Exo 20:5</A>), and was a jealous God. This was commanded, that the Israelites might not suffer themselves to be led astray by such an alliance; to go a whoring after their gods, and sacrifice to them, to take part in their sacrificial festivals, or to marry their sons to the daughters of the Canaanites, by whom they would be persuaded to join in the worship of idols. The use of the expression "go a whoring" in a spiritual sense, in relation to idolatry, is to be accounted for on the ground, that the religious fellowship of Israel with Jehovah was a covenant resembling the marriage tie; and we meet with it for the first time, here, immediately after the formation of this covenant between Israel and Jehovah. The phrase is all the more expressive on account of the literal prostitution that was frequently associated with the worship of Baal and Astarte (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#007">Lev 17:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#005">Lev 20:5-6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#033">Num 14:33</A>, etc.). We may see from <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#001">Num 25:1</A>. how Israel was led astray by this temptation in the wilderness. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#017">Exodus 34:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">exo 34:17</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The true way to worship Jehovah is then pointed out, first of all negatively, in the prohibition against making molten images, with an allusion to the worship of the golden calf, as evinced by the use of the expression &#1502;&#1505;&#1468;&#1499;&#1492; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;, which only occurs again in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#004">Lev 19:4</A>, instead of the phrase "gods of silver and gold" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#023">Exo 20:23</A>); and then positively, by a command to observe the feast of Mazzoth and the consecration of the first-born connected with the Passover (see at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#002">Exo 13:2</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#011">Exo 13:11</A>, and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#012">Exo 13:12</A>), also the Sabbath (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#021">Exo 34:21</A>), the feasts of Weeks and Ingathering, the appearance of the male members of the nation three times a year before the Lord (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#022">Exo 34:22</A>, see at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#014">Exo 23:14-17</A>), together with all the other instructions connected with them (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#025">Exo 34:25</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#026">Exo 34:26</A>). Before the last, however, the promise is introduced, that after the expulsion of the Canaanites, Jehovah would enlarge the borders of Israel (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#031">Exo 23:31</A>), and make their land so secure, that when they went up to the Lord three times in the year, no one should desire their land, sc., because of the universal dread of the might of their God (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#027">Exo 23:27</A>). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#027">Exodus 34:27</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_027">exo 34:27</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Moses was to write down these words, like the covenant rights and laws that had been given before (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#004">Exo 24:4</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#007">Exo 24:7</A>), because Jehovah had concluded the covenant with Moses and Israel according to the tenor of them. By the renewed adoption of the nation, the covenant in ch. 24 was eo ipso restored; so that no fresh conclusion of this covenant was necessary, and the writing down of the fundamental conditions of the covenant was merely intended as a proof of its restoration. It does not appear in the least degree "irreconcilable," therefore, with the writing down of the covenant rights before Knobel).
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#028">Exo 34:28</A>
<p>Moses remained upon the mountain forty days, just as on the former occasion (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#018">Exo 24:18</A>). "And He (Jehovah) wrote upon the tables the ten covenant words" (see at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#001">Exo 34:1</A>).
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#029">Exo 34:29-35</A>
<p>The sight of the glory of Jehovah, though only of the back or reflection of it, produced such an effect upon Moses' face, that the skin of it shone, though without Moses observing it. When he came down from the mountain with the tables of the law in his hand, and the skin of his face shone &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493; &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;, i.e., on account of his talking with God, Aaron and the people were afraid to go near him when they saw the brightness of his face. But Moses called them to him, - Viz. first of all Aaron and the princes of the congregation to speak to them, and then all the people to give them the commandments of Jehovah; but on doing this (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#033">Exo 34:33</A>), he put a veil upon (before) his face, and only took it away when he went in before Jehovah to speak with Him, and then, when he came out (from the Lord out of the tabernacle, of course after the erection of the tabernacle), he made known His commands to the people. But while doing this, he put the veil upon his face again, and always wore it in his ordinary intercourse with the people (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#034">Exo 34:34</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#035">Exo 34:35</A>). This reflection of the splendour thrown back by the glory of God was henceforth to serve as the most striking proof of the confidential relation in which Moses stood to Jehovah, and to set forth the glory of the office which Moses filled. The Apostle Paul embraces this view in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#007">Co2 3:7</A>., and lays stress upon the fact that the glory was to be done away, which he was quite justified in doing, although nothing is said in the Old Testament about the glory being transient, from the simple fact that Moses died. The apostle refers to it for the purpose of contrasting the perishable glory of the law with the far higher and imperishable glory of the Gospel. At the same time he regards the veil which covered Moses' face as a symbol of the obscuring of the truth revealed in the Old Testament. But this does not exhaust the significance of this splendour. The office could only confer such glory upon the possessor by virtue of the glory of the blessings which it contained, and conveyed to those for whom it was established. Consequently, the brilliant light on Moses' face also set forth the glory of the Old Covenant, and was intended both for Moses and the people as a foresight and pledge of the glory to which Jehovah had called, and would eventually exalt, the people of His possession.
