[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 13:1</span></span>

Reign of Jehoahaz. - Jehu was followed by Jehoahaz his son, "in the
twenty-third year of Joash of Judah." This synchronistic statement is
not only at variance with [Kg2 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#010),
but cannot be very well reconciled with [Kg2
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#001). If Jehoahaz began to reign in
the twenty-third year of Joash king of Judah, and reigned seventeen
years, his son cannot have followed him after his death in the
thirty-seventh year of Joash of Judah, as is stated in [Kg2
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#010), for there are only fourteen
years and possibly a few months between the twenty-third and
thirty-seventh years of Joash; and even if he ascended the throne at the
commencement of the twenty-third year of the reign of Joash and died at
the end of the thirty-seventh, they could only be reckoned as fifteen
and not as seventeen years. Moreover, according to [Kg2
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#001), Joash of Judah began to reign in
the seventh year of Jehu, and therefore Athaliah, who ascended the
throne at the same time as Jehu, reigned fully six years. If, therefore,
the first year of Joash of Judah coincides with the seventh year of
Jehu, the twenty-eighth year of Jehu must correspond to the
twenty-second year of Joash of Judah; and in this year of Joash not only
did Jehu die, but his son Jehoahaz ascended the throne. Consequently we
must substitute the twenty-second year of Joash, or perhaps, still more
correctly, the twenty-first year (Josephus), for the twenty-third.

(Note: On the other hand, Thenius, who follows des Vignoles and Winer,
not only defends the correctness of the account "in the twenty-third
year of Joash," because it agrees with the twenty-eight years' reign of
Jehu ([Kg2 10:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#036)), but also holds fast
the seventeen years' duration of the reign of Jehoahaz on account of its
agreement with [Kg2 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#001); for 6 years
(Athaliah) + 40 years (Joash) = 46 years, and 28 years (Jehu) + 17 years
(Jehoahaz) = 45 years; so that, as is there affirmed, Amaziah the son of
Joash ascended the throne in the second year of Joash the son of
Jehoahaz. But to arrive at this result he assumes that there is an error
in [Kg2 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#010), namely, that instead of
the thirty-seventh year we ought to read the thirty-ninth year there,
according to the edit. Aldina of the lxx. But apart from the fact that,
as we have shown above in the text, the datum "in the twenty-third year
of Joash" does not harmonize with the twenty-eight years' reign of Jehu,
this solution of the difference is overthrown by the circumstance that,
in order to obtain this agreement between [Kg2
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#001) and [Kg2
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#014), Thenius reckons the years of
the reigns not only of Athaliah and Joash, but also of Jehu and
Jehoahaz, as full years (the former 16 + 40, the latter 28 + 17);
whereas, in order to bring the datum in [Kg2
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#001) (in the twenty-third year of
Joash) into harmony with the emendation proposed in [Kg2
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#010) (in the thirty-ninth year of
Joash), he reckons the length of the reign of Jehoahaz as only sixteen
years (instead of seventeen). For example, if Jehoahaz reigned seventeen
years, supposing that he ascended the throne in the twenty-third year of
Joash of Judah, he died in the fortieth year of Joash (not the
thirty-ninth), and his son began to reign the same year. In that case
Amaziah would have begun to reign in the first year of Jehoash of
Israel, and not in the second, as is stated in [Kg2
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#001). - The reading of the lxx (ed.
Ald. v. 10), "in the thirty-ninth year," is therefore nothing but a
mistaken emendation resorted to for the purpose of removing a
discrepancy, but of no critical value.)

If Jehu died in the earliest months of the twenty-eighth year of his
reign, so that he only reigned twenty-seven years and one or two months,
his death and his son's ascent of the throne might fall even in the
closing months of the twenty-first year of the reign of Joash of Judah.
And from the twenty-first to the thirty-seventh year of Joash, Jehoahaz
may have reigned sixteen years and a few months, and his reign be
described as lasting seventeen years.

[Kg2 13:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#002)

As Jehoahaz trod in the footsteps of his forefathers and continued the
sin of Jeroboam (the worship of the calves), the Lord punished Israel
during his reign even more than in that of his predecessor. The longer
and the more obstinately the sin was continued, the more severe did the
punishment become. He gave them (the Israelites) into the power of the
Syrian king Hazael and his son Benhadad כּל־היּמים, "the whole time,"
sc. of the reign of Jehoahaz (vid., [Kg2
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#022)); not of the reigns of Hazael
and Benhadad, as Thenius supposes in direct opposition to [Kg2
13:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#024) and [Kg2
13:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#025). According to [Kg2
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#007), the Syrians so far destroyed the
Israelitish army, that only fifty horsemen, ten war-chariots, and ten
thousand foot soldiers were left.

[Kg2 13:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#004)

In this oppression Jehoahaz prayed to the Lord (יי פּני חלּה as in [Kg1
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#006)); and the Lord heard this prayer,
because He saw their oppression at the hands of the Syrians, and gave
Israel a saviour, so that they came out from the power of the Syrians
and dwelt in their booths again, as before, i.e., were able to live
peaceably again in their houses, without being driven off and led away
by the foe. The saviour, מושׁיע, was neither an angel, nor the prophet
Elisha, nor quidam e ducibus Joasi, as some of the earlier commentators
supposed, nor a victory obtained by Jehoahaz over the Syrians, nor
merely Jeroboam (Thenius); but the Lord gave them the saviour in the two
successors of Jehoahaz, in the kings Jehoash and Jeroboam, the former of
whom wrested from the Syrians all the cities that had been conquered by
them under his father ([Kg2 13:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#025)),
while the latter restored the ancient boundaries of Israel ([Kg2
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#025)). According to [Kg2
13:22-25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#022), the oppression by the
Syrians lasted as long as Jehoahaz lived; but after his death the Lord
had compassion upon Israel, and after the death of Hazael, when his son
Benhadad had become king, Jehoash recovered from Benhadad all the
Israelitish cities that had been taken by the Syrians. It is obvious
from this, that the oppression which Benhadad the son of Hazael
inflicted upon Israel, according to [Kg2
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#003), falls within the period of his
father's reign, so that it was not as king, but as commander-in-chief
under his father, that he oppressed Israel, and therefore he is not even
called king in [Kg2 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#003).

[Kg2 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#006)

"Only they departed not," etc., is inserted as a parenthesis and must be
expressed thus: "although they departed not from the sin of Jeroboam."

[Kg2 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#007)

"For (כּי) he had not left," etc., furnishes the ground for [Kg2
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#005) : God gave them a saviour, ...
although they did not desist from the sin of Jeroboam, ... for Israel
had been brought to the last extremity; He (Jehovah) had left to
Jehoahaz people (עם, people of war), only fifty horsemen, etc. For החטי
instead of החטיא ([Kg2 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#006)), see at
[Kg1 21:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#021). The suffix בּהּ in [Kg2
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#006) refers to הטּאת, just as that in
ממּנּה in [Kg2 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#002) (see at [Kg2
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#003)). "And even the Asherah was
(still) standing at Samaria," probably from the time of Ahab downwards
([Kg1 16:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#033)), since Jehu is not said
to have destroyed it ([Kg2 10:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#026).).
וגו וישׂמם "and had made them like dust for trampling upon," - an
expression denoting utter destruction.

[Kg2 13:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#008)

Close of the reign of Jehoahaz. Jehoahaz had probably shown his might in
the war with the Syrians, although he had been overcome.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg2 13:10</span></span>

Reign of Jehoash or Joash of Israel. - On the commencement of his reign
see at [Kg2 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#001). He also walked in
the sins of Jeroboam (compare [Kg2
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#011) with [Kg2
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#002) and [Kg2
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#006)). The war with Amaziah referred
to in [Kg2 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#012) is related in the
history of this king in [Kg2 14:8-14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#008);
and the close of the reign of Joash is also recorded there ([Kg2
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#015) and [Kg2
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#016)) with the standing formula. And
even here it ought not to be introduced till the end of the chapter,
instead of in [Kg2 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#012) and [Kg2
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#013), inasmuch as the verses which
follow relate several things belonging to the reign of Joash. But as
they are connected with the termination of Elisha's life, it was quite
admissible to wind up the reign of Joash with [Kg2
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#013).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg2 13:14</span></span>

Illness and Death of the Prophet Elisha. - [Kg2
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#014). When Elisha was taken ill with
the sickness of which he was to die, king Joash visited him and wept
over his face, i.e., bending over the sick man as he lay, and exclaimed,
"My father, my father! the chariot of Israel and horsemen thereof!" just
as Elisha had mourned over the departure of Elijah ([Kg2
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#012)). This lamentation of the king at
the approaching death of the prophet shows that Joash knew how to value
his labours. And on account of this faith which was manifested in his
recognition of the prophet's worth, the Lord gave the king another
gracious assurance through the dying Elisha, which was confirmed by
means of a symbolical action.

[Kg2 13:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#015)

"Take-said Elisha to Joash-bow and arrows, ... and let thy hand pass
over the bow" (הרכּב), i.e., stretch the bow. He then placed his hands
upon the king's hands, as a sign that the power which was to be given to
the bow-shot came from the Lord through the mediation of the prophet. He
then directed him to open the window towards the east and shoot, adding
as he shot off the arrow: "An arrow of salvation from the Lord, and an
arrow of salvation against the Syrians; and thou wilt smite the Syrians
at Aphek (see at [Kg1 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#026)) to
destruction." The arrow that was shot off was to be a symbol of the help
of the Lord against the Syrians to their destruction. This promise the
king was then to appropriate to himself through an act of his own.
Elisha therefore directed him ([Kg2
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#018)) to "take the arrows;" and when
he had taken them, said: ארצה הך, "strike to the earth," i.e., shoot the
arrows to the ground, not "smite the earth with the bundle of arrows"
(Thenius), which neither agrees with the shooting of the first arrow,
nor admits of a grammatical vindication; for הכּה, when used of an
arrow, signifies to shoot and to strike with the arrow shot off, i.e.,
to wound or to kill (cf. [Kg2 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#024);
[Kg1 22:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#034)). The shooting of the
arrows to the earth was intended to symbolize the overthrow of the
Syrians. "And the king shot three times, and then stood (still)," i.e.,
left off shooting.

[Kg2 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#019)

Elisha was angry at this, and said: "Thou shouldst shoot five or six
times, thou wouldst then have smitten the Syrians to destruction; but
now thou wilt smite them three times." להכּות: it was to shoot, i.e.,
thou shouldst shoot; compare Ewald, 237, c.; and for הכּית אז, then
hadst thou smitten, vid., Ewald, 358, a. As the king was told that the
arrow shot off signified a victory over the Syrians, he ought to have
shot off all the arrows, to secure a complete victory over them. When,
therefore, he left off after shooting only three times, this was a sign
that he was wanting in the proper zeal for obtaining the divine promise,
i.e., in true faith in the omnipotence of God to fulfil His promise.

(Note: "When the king reflected upon the power of the kings of Syria,
since he had not implicit faith in Elisha, he thought that it was enough
if he struck the earth three times, fearing that the prophecy might not
be fulfilled if he should strike more blows upon the ground." -
Clericus.)

Elisha was angry at this weakness of the king's faith, and told him that
by leaving off so soon he had deprived himself of a perfect victory over
the Syrians.

[Kg2 13:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#020)

Elisha then died at a great age. As he had been called by Elijah to be a
prophet in the reign of Ahab and did not die till that of Joash, and
forty-one years elapsed between the year that Ahab died and the
commencement of the reign of Joash, he must have held his prophetical
office for at least fifty years, and have attained the age of eighty.
"And they buried him must as marauding bands of Moabites entered the
land. And it came to pass, that at the burial of a man they saw the
marauding bands coming, and placed the dead man in the greatest haste in
the grave of Elisha," for the purpose of escaping from the enemy. But
when the (dead) man touched the bones of Elisha, he came to life again,
and rose up upon his feet. וגו מואב וּגדוּדי is a circumstantial clause.
The difficult expression שׁנה בּא, "a year had come," can only have the
meaning given by the lxx and Chald.: "when a year had come," and
evidently indicates that the burial of Elisha occurred at the time when
the yearly returning bands of Moabitish marauders invaded the land.
Ewald (Krit. Gramm. p. 528) would therefore read בּוא, a coming of the
year, in which case the words would be grammatically subordinate to the
main clause. Luther renders it "the same year," in ipso anno, after the
Vulgate and Syriac, as if the reading had been שׁנה בּהּ. הם, they, the
people who had just buried a man. ישׁליכוּ, not threw, but placed
hastily. ויּגּע ויּלך: and the man went and touched. ויּלך serves as a
pictorial delineation of the thought, that as soon as the dead man
touched the bones of Elisha he came to life. הלך is not only applied to
the motion of inanimate objects, but also to the gradual progress of any
transaction. The conjecture of Thenius and Hitzig, ויּלכוּ, "and they
went away," is quite unsuitable. The earlier Israelites did not bury
their dead in coffins, but wrapped them in linen cloths and laid them in
tombs hewn out of the rock. The tomb was then covered with a stone,
which could easily be removed. The dead man, who was placed thus
hurriedly in the tomb which had been opened, might therefore easily come
into contact with the bones of Elisha. The design of this miracle of the
restoration of the dead man to life was not to show how even in the
grave Elisha surpassed his master Elijah in miraculous power (Ephr. Syr.
and others), but to impress the seal of divine attestation upon the
prophecy of the dying prophet concerning the victory of Joash over the
Syrians (Wis. 48:13, 14), since the Lord thereby bore witness that He
was not the God of the dead, but of the living, and that His spirit was
raised above death and corruptibility. - The opinion that the dead man
was restored to life again in a natural manner, through the violent
shaking occasioned by the fall, or through the coolness of the tomb,
needs no refutation.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg2 13:22</span></span>

The prophecy which Elisha uttered before his death is here followed
immediately by the account of its fulfilment, and to this end the
oppression of the Israelites by Hazael is mentioned once more, together
with that turn of affairs which took place through the compassion of God
after the death of Hazael and in the reign of his son Benhadad. לחץ is a
pluperfect: "Hazael had oppressed" (for the fact itself compare [Kg2
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#004) and [Kg2
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#007)). For the sake of the covenant
made with the patriarchs the Lord turned again to the Israelites, and
would not destroy them, and did not cast them away from His face עתּה עד
("till now"), as was the case afterwards, but delivered them from the
threatening destruction through the death of Hazael. For in the reign of
his son and successor Benhadad, Joash the son of Jehoahaz took from him
again (ויּשׁב is to be connected with ויּקּה) the cities which he
(Hazael) had taken from Jehoahaz in the war. These cities which Hazael
had wrested from Jehoahaz were on this side of the Jordan, for Hazael
had conquered all Gilead in the time of Jehu ([Kg2
10:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#032)). Joash recovered the former
from Benhadad, whilst his son Jeroboam reconquered Gilead also (see at
[Kg2 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#025)).
