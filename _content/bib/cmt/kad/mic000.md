Micah

Introduction

Person of the Prophet. - Micah, מיכה, an abbreviated form of מיכיה
(Micaiah), as he is called in [Jer
26:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#018), which is also a contraction of
מיכיהוּ, "who is as Jehovah?" - i.e., one dedicated to Jehovah the
incomparable God (Greek, Μιχαίας; Vulg. Michaeas or Micha, [Neh
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#017)) - is called hammorashtı̄, the
Morashitite, i.e., sprung from Moresheth-gath in the plain of Judah (see
at [Mic 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#014)), to distinguish him from
the elder prophet Micah the son of Imlah ([Kg1
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#008).), as well as from other persons
of the same name, of whom ten are met with in the Old Testament, apart
from Maacah the wife of Rehoboam, a grand-daughter of Absalom ([Kg1
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#002), [Kg1
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#010), [Kg1
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#013); [Ch2
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#020).), who is also called מכיהוּ in
[Ch2 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#002) (see Caspari on Micha, p.
3ff.). Our Micah was therefore a Judaean, and prophesied, according to
the heading to his book, in the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah,
kings of Judah; so that he was contemporaneous with Isaiah. He
prophesied "concerning Samaria and Jerusalem," the capitals of the two
kingdoms, that is to say, concerning all Israel, the fate of which was
determined by the circumstances and fates of the two capitals. The
correctness of this statement, and at the same time the genuineness of
the heading, are confirmed by the contents of the book. Micah not only
predicts, in [Mic 1:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#006), the
destruction of Samaria, which took place in the sixth year of Hezekiah;
but he also mentions Asshur, the great enemy of Israel at that time, as
the representative of the power of the world in its hostility to the
kingdom of God ([Mic 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#004)); and he
agrees so thoroughly with Isaiah in his description of the prevailing
moral corruption, as well as in his Messianic prophecies, that we are
warranted in inferring the contemporaneous labours of the two prophets
(compare Mich. [Isa 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#011) with [Isa
28:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#007); Mich. [Mic
3:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#005) with [Isa
29:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#009); Mich. [Mic
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#012) with [Isa
32:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#013); and Mich. [Mic
4:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#001) with [Isa
2:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002); [Mic
5:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#002) with [Isa
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014) and [Isa
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#005)). To this we may add the account
in [Jer 26:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#018), that certain men of
the elders of Judah, when seeking to vindicate Jeremiah, who was
condemned to death on account of his prophecies concerning the
destruction of Jerusalem, quoted word for word [Mic
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#012), to show that in the days of
Hezekiah Micah had predicted the destruction of Jerusalem, without
having been put to death by king Hezekiah and all Judah. It is true that
Hitzig, Ewald, and others, have founded an argument upon this against
the correctness of the heading to our book, according to which Micah
prophesied not only under Hezekiah, but also under Jotham and Ahaz,
interpreting it as meaning that the elders of Judah knew from good
historical tradition the time when the particular words in Micah 3-5 had
first been uttered. But they are wrong in this. For even if Micah had
uttered this prophecy for the first time in the reign of Hezekiah, it
would by no means follow that he had not also prophesied before that,
namely, in the reign of Hezekiah. The relation in which [Mic
4:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#001) stands to [Isa
2:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002) is sufficient of itself to point
to the times of Jotham (see at [Mic
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#001)). Again, [Mic
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#016) does not suit the times of
Hezekiah, but only those of Ahaz, who walked to such an extent in the
ways of the kings of Israel ([Kg2
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#003); [Ch2
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#002)), that Judah could be charged
with holding by the statutes of Omri and all the deeds of the house of
Ahab. Moreover, the assumption that the elders of Judah in the time of
Jehoiakim knew from good traditional authority the precise time in which
Micah uttered that threat, is quite an unfounded one. They simply knew
that Micah's prophetic writings sprang from the time of Hezekiah; and of
the kings under whom Micah prophesied according to the statement of the
writings themselves ([Mic 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#001)), they
mention only Hezekiah, because he was the only one who "constituted a
spiritual authority" (Hengstenberg). But the fact that Micah's
prophecies were committed to writing in the time of Hezekiah by no means
precludes the supposition that either the prophecies themselves, or
certain portions of them, were uttered orally to the people before that
time. Hitzig's attempt to prove that all the three addresses in our book
were composed in the time of Hezekiah, is founded upon a false
historical interpretation, and upon unscriptural ideas of the nature of
prophecy.

We know nothing more about the circumstances of Micah's life, than what
may be gathered from his writings. According to these, he no doubt
prophesied in Jerusalem, the capital of his native land. This is evident
from the fact that he chiefly condemns the moral corruption of the great
and mighty men of the kingdom, and makes Zion and Jerusalem for the most
part the centre of his prophecies. There is not sufficient ground for
Ewald's assertion, that there are many signs which indicate an
inhabitant of the plain. The introduction of the names of particular
places in Judah in [Mic 1:10-15](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#010)
furnishes no proof of any "peculiar interest in the Jewish country, more
especially the Jewish lowland, as being his home." Only a portion of the
places mentioned in this passage were situated in the lowland. Moreover,
Isaiah also enumerates a whole list of places in Judah ([Isa
10:28-32](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#028)), and is minutely acquainted
with the circumstances of Zebulun and Naphtali, and the neighbourhood of
the Sea of Galilee ([Isa 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#001)),
although he was settled in Jerusalem, and had probably been born there.
Still more precarious is the inference that has been drawn from Micah's
somewhat rough and rugged style. For all that can be adduced in support
of this is confined to the rapid and abrupt transitions from threatening
to promise, in which he resembles Hosea (vid., [Mic
2:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#001); [Mic
3:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#009); [Mic
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#001).), and generally from one subject
to another (e.g., [Mic 7:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#001), [Mic
7:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#011)), but more especially from one
person to another, or from one number and gender to another ([Mic
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#010); [Mic
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#016); [Mic
7:15-19](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#015)). This may be all explained
from the vivacity of his won individuality, and the excited state of his
mind; and simply indicaters the boldness of his words, but not any want
of culture in his style. His words are never deficient in clearness or
evenness; whilst in abundance of figures, similes ([Mic
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#008), [Mic
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#016); [Mic
2:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#012); [Mic
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#009), etc.), and rhetorical tropes, as
well as in speciality, paronomasia, in play upon words ([Mic
1:10-15](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#010)), and dialogue ([Mic
2:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#007); [Mic
6:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#001); [Mic
7:7-20](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#007), his style resembles that of
his highly cultivated contemporary Isaiah. The traditional accounts
respecting his descent from the tribe of Ephraim, his death, and his
grave, contained in Ps. Dorotheus and Ps. Epiphanius (collected in
Carpzovii, Introd. iii. pp. 373-4), have partly originated in the
confounding of our Micah with the elder Micah the son of Imlah, who
lived in the reign of Ahab, and are partly inferences from the heading
to our book.

2\. The Book of Micah. - The contents of the book consist of three
prophetic addresses, which are clearly distinguished from one another in
form by similarity of introduction (all three commencing with שׁמעוּ,
[Mic 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#002); [Mic
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#001); [Mic
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#001)), and substantially by their
contents, which pass through the various stages of reproof, threat, and
promise, and are thereby rounded off; so that all attempts at any other
division, such as that of Ewald to connect [Mic
3:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#001) with the first address, or to
arrange the book in two parts (ch. 1-5 and [Mic
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#001), [Mic
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#001)), are obviously arbitrary. [Mic
3:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#001) can only be connected with ch.
1 and [Mic 2:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#001) so as to form one
address, on the groundless assumption that [Mic
2:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#012) are a later gloss that has
crept into the text; and though the ואמר before שׁמעוּ־נא in [Mic
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#001) does indeed connect the second
address more closely with the first than with the third, it by no means
warrants our dividing the whole book into two parts. In the three
addresses, ch. 1, [Mic 2:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#001), 3-5,
and [Mic 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#001), [Mic
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#001), we have not "three prophecies of
Micah, delivered to the people at three different times," as Hitzig and
Maurer still suppose, but merely a condensation rhetorically arranged of
the essential contents of his verbal utterances, as committed to
writings by Micah himself at the end of his prophetic course in the time
of Hezekiah. For these addresses are proved to be merely portions or
sections of a single whole, by the absence of all reference to the
concrete circumstances of any particular portion of time, and still more
by their organic combination, as seen in the clearly marked and
carefully planned progressive movement apparent in their contents. In
the first address, after a general announcement of judgment on account
of the sins of Israel ([Mic 1:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#002)),
Micah predicts the destruction of Samaria ([Mic
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#006), [Mic
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#007)), and the devastation of Judah
with the deportation of its inhabitants ([Mic
1:8-16](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#008)), and justifies this threat by
an earnest and brief reproof of the existing acts of injustice and
violence on the part of the great men ([Mic
2:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#001)), and a sharp correction of
their abettors the false prophets. ([Mic
2:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#006)); after which this address
closes with a brief promise of the eventual restoration of the remnant
of Israel to favour ([Mic 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#012), [Mic
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#013)). The second address closes with
a brief promise of the eventual restoration of the remnant of Israel to
favour ([Mic 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#012), [Mic
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#013)). The second address spreads
itself out still more elaborately in the first half ([Mic
3:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#001)) over the sins and crimes of
the heads of the nation, viz., the princes, the false prophets, the
unjust judges and bad priests; and because of these sins threatens the
destruction and utter devastation of Zion, and the temple hill. As an
antithesis to this threat, the second half ([Mic
4:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#001) and [Mic
5:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#001)) contains a promise, commencing
with the opening of a prospect of the glorification of Zion and Israel
at the end of the days ([Mic 4:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#001)),
advancing to an assurance of the restoration of the former dominion of
the daughter of Zion, after the people have first been carried away to
Babel, and rescued again out of the hand of their enemies, and of her
triumph in the last conflict with the nations of the world ([Mic
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#008) -14), and culminating in the
announcement of the birth of the great Ruler in Israel, who will arise
out of Bethlehem, and feed His people in the majesty of Jehovah ([Mic
5:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#001)), and not only protect the
rescued remnant of Jacob against the attacks of the imperial kingdom,
but exalt it into a beneficent, and at the same time fearful, power to
the heathen nations ([Mic 5:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#006)), and
establish a kingdom of blessed peace ([Mic
5:9-14](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#009)). The third address sets forth
the way to salvation in the dramatic dress of a law-suit between Jehovah
and His people, by exhibiting the divine benefits for which Israel had
repaid its God with ingratitude, and by a repeated allusion to the
prevailing sins and unrighteousness which God must punish (ch. 6), and
also by showing how the consciousness of misery will lead to the
penitential confession of guilt and to conversion, and by encouraging to
believing trust in the compassion upon His people, rebuild Zion, and
humble the foe, and by renewing the miracles of the olden time fill all
nations with fear of His omnipotence (Micah 7:1-17); after which the
prophet closes his book with praise for the sin-forgiving grace of the
Lord ([Mic 7:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#018)).

From this general survey of the contents of the three addresses, their
internal connection may be at once perceived. In the first the
threatening of judgment predominates; in the second the announcement of
the Messianic salvation; in the third there follows the paraenesis or
admonition to repentance and humiliation under the chastising hand of
the Lord, in order to participate in the promised salvation. As this
admonition rests upon the threat of judgment and promise of salvation in
the two previous addresses, so does the allusion to the judgment
contained in the words, "Then will they cry to Jehovah, and He will not
answer them" ([Mic 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#004)), presuppose
the announcement in ch. 1 of the judgment about to burst upon the land,
without which it would be perfectly unintelligible. Consequently there
can be no doubt whatever that Micah has simply concentrated the
quintessence of his oral discourses into the addresses contained in his
book. This quintessence, moreover, shows clearly enough that our prophet
was not at all behind his contemporary Isaiah, either in the clearness
and distinctness of his Messianic announcements, or in the power and
energy with which he combated the sins and vices of the nation. There is
simply this essential difference, so far as the latter point is
concerned, that he merely combats the religious and moral corruptness of
the rulers of the nation, and does not touch upon their conduct on its
political side. (For the exegetical literature, see my Lehrbuch der
Einleitung, p. 296.)
