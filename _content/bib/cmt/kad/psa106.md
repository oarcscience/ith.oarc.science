Israel's Unfaithfulness from Egypt Onwards, and God's Faithfulness Down
to the Present Time

With this anonymous Psalm begins the series of the strictly
Hallelujah-Psalms, i.e., those Psalms which have הללו־יה for their
arsis-like beginning and for their inscription (Ps 106, 111-113, [Psa
117:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/psa117.htm#001), 135, 146-150). The chronicler
in his cento, [Ch1 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#008)., and in fact
in [Ch1 16:34-36](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#034), puts the first and
last verses of this Psalm ([Psa 106:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#001),
[Psa 106:47](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#047)), together with the
Beracha ([Psa 106:48](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#048)) which closes the
Fourth Book of the Psalms, into the mouth of David, from which it is to
be inferred that this Psalm is no more Maccabaean than [Psa
96:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001) and Ps 105 (which see), and
that the Psalter was divided into five books which were marked off by
the doxologies even in the time of the chronicler. The Beracha, [Psa
106:48](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#048), appears even at that period to
have been read as an integral part of the Psalm, according to liturgical
usage. The Hallelujah Psalms 106, like the Hodu Ps 105 and the Asaph Ps
78, recapitulates the history of the olden times of the Israelitish
nation. But the purpose and mode of the recapitulation differ in each of
these three Psalms. In Ps 78 it is didactic; in Ps 105 hymnic; and here
in Psalms 106 penitential. It is a penitential Psalm, or Psalm of
confession, a ודּוּי (from התודּה to confess, [Lev
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#021)). The oldest types of such
liturgical prayers are the two formularies at the offering of the
first-fruits, Deut. 26, and Solomon's prayer at the dedication of the
Temple, 1 Kings 8. And to this kind of tephilla, the Vidduj, belong,
beyond the range of the Psalter, the prayer of Daniel, [Dan
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#001) (vid., the way in which it is
introduced in [Dan 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#004)), and the
prayer (Neh 9:5-38) which eight Levites uttered in the name of the
people at the celebration of the fast-day on the twenty-fourth of
Tishri. It is true Psalms 106 is distinguished from these prayers of
confession in the prose style as being a Psalm; but it has three points
in common with them and with the liturgical tephilla in general, viz.,
(1) the fondness for inflexional rhyming, i.e., for rhyming terminations
of the same suffixes; (2) the heaping up of synonyms; and (3) the
unfolding of the thoughts in a continuous line. These three
peculiarities are found not only in the liturgical border, [Psa
106:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#001), [Psa
106:47](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#047), but also in the middle
historical portion, which forms the bulk of the Psalm. The law of
parallelism, is, it is true, still observed; but apart from these
distichic wave-like ridges of the thoughts, it is all one direct,
straight-line flow without technical division.

[Psalms 106:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 106:1</span></span>

The Psalm begins with the liturgical call, which has not coined for the
first time in the Maccabaean age (1 Macc. 4:24), but was already in use
in Jeremiah's time ([Psa 33:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#011)). The
lxx appropriately renders טּוב by χρηστός, for God is called "good" not
so much in respect of His nature as of the revelation of His nature. The
fulness of this revelation, says [Psa
106:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#002) (like [Psa
40:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006)), is inexhaustible. גּבוּרות are
the manifestations of His all-conquering power which makes everything
subservient to His redemptive purposes ([Psa
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#007)); and תּהלּה is the glory (praise
or celebration) of His self-attestation in history. The proclaiming of
these on the part of man can never be an exhaustive echo of them. In
[Psa 106:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#003) the poet tells what is the
character of those who experience such manifestations of God; and to the
assertion of the blessedness of these men he appends the petition in
[Psa 106:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#004), that God would grant him a
share in the experiences of the whole nation which is the object of
these manifestations. עמּך beside בּרצון is a genitive of the object:
with the pleasure which Thou turnest towards Thy people, i.e., when Thou
again (cf. [Psa 106:47](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#047)) showest
Thyself gracious unto them. On פּקד cf. [Psa
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#005); [Psa
80:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#015), and on ראה ב, [Jer
29:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#032); a similar Beth is that beside
לשׂמח (at, on account of, not: in connection with), [Psa
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#002); [Psa
122:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#001). God's "inheritance" is His
people; the name for them is varied four times, and thereby גּוי is also
exceptionally brought into use, as in [Zep
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#009).

[Psalms 106:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 106:6</span></span>

The key-note of the vidduj, which is a settled expression since [Kg1
8:47](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#047) ([Dan
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#005), cf. Bar. 2:12), makes itself
heard here in [Psa 106:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#006); Israel is
bearing at this time the punishment of its sins, by which it has made
itself like its forefathers. In this needy and helpless condition the
poet, who all along speaks as a member of the assembly, takes the way of
the confession of sin, which leads to the forgiveness of sin and to the
removal of the punishment of sin. רשׁע, [Kg1
8:47](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#047), signifies to be, and the Hiph.
to prove one's self to be, a רשׁע. עם in [Psa
106:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#006) is equivalent to aeque ac, as in
[Ecc 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#016); [Job
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#026). With [Psa
106:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#007) the retrospect begins. The
fathers contended with Moses and Aaron in Egypt ([Exo
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#021)), and gave no heed to the
prospect of redemption ([Exo 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#009)). The
miraculous judgments which Moses executed ([Exo
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#020)) had no more effect in bringing
them to a right state of mind, and the abundant tokens of
loving-kindness ([Isa 63:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#007)) amidst
which God redeemed them made so little impression on their memories that
they began to despair and to murmur even at the Red Sea ([Exo
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#011).). With על, [Psa
106:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#007), alternates בּ (as in [Eze
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#015), בּנהר); cf. the alternation of
prepositions in [Joe 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#008). When they
behaved thus, Jahve might have left their redemption unaccomplished, but
out of unmerited mercy He nevertheless redeemed them. [Psa
106:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#008) are closely dependent upon
Ex. 14. [Psa 106:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#011) is a transposition
(cf. [Psa 34:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#021); [Isa
34:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#016)) from [Exo
14:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#028). On the other hand, [Psa
106:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#009) is taken out of [Isa
63:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#013) (cf. Wisd. 19:9); Isa.
63:7-64:12 is a prayer for redemption which has a similar
ground-colouring. The sea through which they passed is called, as in the
Tפra, ים־סוּף, which seems, according to [Exo
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#003); [Isa
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#003), to signify the sea of reed or
sedge, although the sedge does not grow in the Red Sea itself, but only
on the marshy places of the coast; but it can also signify the sea of
sea-weed, mare algosum, after the Egyptian sippe, wool and sea-weed
(just as Arab. ṣûf also signifies both these). The word is certainly
Egyptian, whether it is to be referred back to the Egyptian word sippe
(sea-weed) or seebe (sedge), and is therefore used after the manner of a
proper name; so that the inference drawn by Knobel on [Exo
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#018) from the absence of the article,
that סוּף is the name of a town on the northern point of the gulf, is
groundless. The miracle at the sea of sedge or sea-weed - as [Psa
106:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#012) says - also was not without
effect. [Exo 14:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#031) tells us that they
believed on Jahve and Moses His servant, and the song which they sang
follows in Ex. 15. But they then only too quickly added sins of
ingratitude.

[Psalms 106:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 106:13</span></span>

The first of the principal sins on the other side of the Red Sea was the
unthankful, impatient, unbelieving murmuring about their meat and drink,
[Psa 106:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#013). For what [Psa
106:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#013) places foremost was the root of
the whole evil, that, falling away from faith in God's promise, they
forgot the works of God which had been wrought in confirmation of it,
and did not wait for the carrying out of His counsel. The poet has
before his eye the murmuring for water on the third day after the
miraculous deliverance ([Exo 15:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#022))
and in Rephidim ([Exo 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#002)). Then the
murmuring for flesh in the first and second years of the exodus which
was followed by the sending of the quails (Ex. 16 and Num. 11), together
with the wrathful judgment by which the murmuring for the second time
was punished (Kibrôth ha-Ta'avah, [Num
11:33-35](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#033)). This dispensation of wrath
the poet calls רזון (lxx, Vulgate, and Syriac erroneously πλησμονήν,
perhaps מזון, nourishment), inasmuch as he interprets [Num
11:33-35](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#033) of a wasting disease, which
swept away the people in consequence of eating inordinately of the
flesh, and in the expression (cf. [Psa
78:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#031)) he closely follows [Isa
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#016). The "counsel" of God for which
they would not wait, is His plan with respect to the time and manner of
the help. חכּה, root Arab. ḥk, a weaker power of Arab. ḥq, whence also
Arab. ḥkl, p. 111, ḥkm, p. 49 note 1, signifies prop. to make firm,
e.g., a knot (cf. on [Psa 33:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#020)), and
starting from this (without the intervention of the metaphor moras
nectere, as Schultens thinks) is transferred to a firm bent of mind, and
the tension of long expectation. The epigrammatic expression ויּתאוּוּ
תאוה (plural of ויתאו, [Isa 45:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#012), for
which codices, as also in [Pro 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#003),
[Pro 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#006); [Pro
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#001), the Complutensian, Venetian
1521, Elias Levita, and Baer have ויתאו without the tonic lengthening)
is taken from [Num 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#004).

The second principal sin was the insurrection against their superiors,
[Psa 106:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#016). The poet has [Num
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#001) in his eye. The rebellious ones
were swallowed up by the earth, and their two hundred and fifty noble,
non-Levite partisans consumed by fire. The fact that the poet does not
mention Korah among those who were swallowed up is in perfect harmony
with [Num 16:25](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#025)., [Deu
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#006); cf. however [Num
26:10](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#010). The elliptical תפתּה in [Psa
106:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#017) is explained from [Num
16:32](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#032); [Num
26:10](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#010).

The third principal sin was the worship of the calf, [Psa
106:19-23](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#019). The poet here glances back
at Ex. 32, but not without at the same time having [Deu
9:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#008) in his mind; for the expression
"in Horeb" is Deuteronomic, e.g., [Deu
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#015); [Deu
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#002), and frequently. [Psa
106:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#020) is also based upon the Book of
Deuteronomy: they exchanged their glory, i.e., the God who was their
distinction before all peoples according to [Deu
4:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#006); [Deu
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#021) (cf. also [Jer
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#011)), for the likeness (תּבנית) of a
plough-ox (for this is pre-eminently called שׁוּר, in the dialects
תּור), contrary to the prohibition in [Deu
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#017). On [Psa
106:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#021) cf. the warning in [Deu
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#012). "Land of Cham" = Egypt, as in
[Psa 78:51](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#051); [Psa
105:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#023), [Psa
105:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#027). With ויאמר in [Psa
106:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#023) the expression becomes again
Deuteronomic: [Deu 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#025), cf. [Exo
32:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#010). God made and also expressed the
resolve to destroy Israel. Then Moses stepped into the gap (before the
gap), i.e., as it were covered the breach, inasmuch as he placed himself
in it and exposed his own life; cf. on the fact, besides Ex. 32, also
[Deu 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#018)., [Psa
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#010), and on the expression, [Eze
22:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#030) and also [Jer
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#020).

[Psalms 106:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">psa 106:24</span></span>

The fact to which the poet refers in [Psa
106:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#024), viz., the rebellion in
consequence of the report of the spies, which he brings forward as the
fourth principal sin, is narrated in Num 13, Num 14. The appellation ארץ
חמדּה is also found in [Jer 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#019); [Zac
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#014). As to the rest, the expression
is altogether Pentateuchal. "They despised the land," after [Num
14:31](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#031); "they murmured in their tents,"
after [Deu 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#027); "to lift up the land"
= to swear, after [Exo 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#008); [Deu
32:40](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#040); the threat להפּיל, to make them
fall down, fall away, after [Num
14:29](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#029), [Num
14:32](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#032). The threat of exile is founded
upon the two great threatening chapters, Lev 26; [Deu
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#001); cf. more particularly [Lev
26:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#033) (together with the echoes in
[Eze 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#012); [Eze
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#014), etc.), [Deu
28:64](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#064) (together with the echoes in
[Jer 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#015); [Eze
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#015), etc.). [Eze
20:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#023) stands in a not accidental
relationship to [Psa 106:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#026).; and
according to that passage, וּלהפיל is an error of the copyist for
וּלהפיץ (Hitzig).

Now follows in [Psa 106:28-31](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#028) the
fifth of the principal sins, viz., the taking part in the Moabitish
worship of Baal. The verb נצמד (to be bound or chained), taken from [Num
25:3](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#003), [Num
25:5](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#005), points to the prostitution with
which Baal Per, this Moabitish Priapus, was worshipped. The sacrificial
feastings in which, according to [Num
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#002), they took part, are called
eating the sacrifices of the dead, because the idols are dead beings
(nekroi', Wisd. 13:10-18) as opposed to God, the living One. The catena
on [Rev 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#014) correctly interprets: τὰ
τοῖς εἰδώλοις τελεσθέντα κρέα.

(Note: In the second section of Aboda zara, on the words of the Mishna:
"The flesh which is intended to be offered first of all to idols is
allowed, but that which comes out of the temple is forbidden, because it
is like sacrifices of the dead," it is observed, fol. 32b: "Whence, said
R. Jehuda ben Bethra, do I know that that which is offered to idols
(תקרובת לעבדה זרה) pollutes like a dead body? From [Psa
106:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#028). As the dead body pollutes
everything that is under the same roof with it, so also does everything
that is offered to idols." The Apostle Paul declares the objectivity of
this pollution to be vain, cf. more particularly [Co1
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#028).)

The object of "they made angry" is omitted; the author is fond of this,
cf. [Psa 106:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#007) and [Psa
106:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#032). The expression in [Psa
106:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#029) is like [Exo
19:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#024). The verb עמד is chosen with
reference to [Num 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#013). The result is
expressed in [Psa 106:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#030) after [Num
25:8](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#008), [Num
25:18](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#018)., [Num
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#013). With פּלּל, to adjust, to judge
adjustingly (lxx, Vulgate, correctly according to the sense, ἐξιλάσατο),
the poet associates the thought of the satisfaction due to divine right,
which Phinehas executed with the javelin. This act of zeal for Jahve,
which compensated for Israel's unfaithfulness, was accounted unto him
for righteousness, by his being rewarded for it with the priesthood unto
everlasting ages, [Num 25:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#010). This
accounting of a work for righteousness is only apparently contradictory
to [Gen 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#005).: it was indeed an act
which sprang from a constancy in faith, and one which obtained for him
the acceptation of a righteous man for the sake of this upon which it
was based, by proving him to be such.

In [Psa 106:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#032), [Psa
106:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#033) follows the sixth of the
principal sins, viz., the insurrection against Moses and Aaron at the
waters of strife in the fortieth year, in connection with which Moses
forfeited the entrance with them into the Land of Promise ([Num
20:11](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#011)., [Deu
1:37](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#037); [Deu
32:51](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#051)), since he suffered himself to
be carried away by the persevering obstinacy of the people against the
Spirit of God (המרה mostly providing the future for מרה, as in [Psa
106:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#007), [Psa
106:43](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#043), [Psa
78:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#017), [Psa
78:40](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#040), [Psa
78:56](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#056), of obstinacy against God; on
את־רוּחו cf. [Isa 63:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#010)) into uttering
the words addressed to the people, [Num
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#010), in which, as the smiting of the
rock which was twice repeated shows, is expressed impatience together
with a tinge of unbelief. The poet distinguishes, as does the narrative
in Num. 20, between the obstinacy of the people and the transgression of
Moses, which is there designated, according to that which lay at the
root of it, as unbelief. The retrospective reference to [Num
27:14](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#014) needs adjustment accordingly.

[Psalms 106:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">psa 106:34</span></span>

The sins in Canaan: the failing to exterminate the idolatrous peoples
and sharing in their idolatry. In [Psa
106:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#034) the poet appeals to the
command, frequently enjoined upon them from [Exo
23:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#032). onwards, to extirpate the
inhabitants of Canaan. Since they did not execute this command (vid.,
[Jdg 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#001)), that which it was intended
to prevent came to pass: the heathen became to them a snare (mowqeesh),
[Exo 23:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#033); [Exo
34:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#012); [Deu
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#016). They intermarried with them, and
fell into the Canaanitish custom in which the abominations of heathenism
culminate, viz., the human sacrifice, which Jahve abhorreth ([Deu
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#031)), and only the demons (שׁדים,
[Deu 32:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#017)) delight in. Thus then the
land was defiled by blood-guiltiness (חנף, [Num
35:33](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#033), cf. [Isa
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#005); [Isa
26:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#021)), and they themselves became
unclean ([Eze 20:43](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#043)) by the whoredom
of idolatry. In [Psa 106:40-43](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#040) the
poet (as in [Neh 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#026).) sketches the
alternation of apostasy, captivity, redemption, and relapse which
followed upon the possession of Canaan, and more especially that which
characterized the period of the judges. God's "counsel" was to make
Israel free and glorious, but they leaned upon themselves, following
their own intentions (בּעצתם); wherefore they perished in their sins.
The poet uses מכך (to sink down, fall away) instead of the נמק (to
moulder, rot) of the primary passage, [Lev
26:39](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#039), retained in [Eze
24:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#023); [Eze
33:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#010), which is no blunder (Hitzig),
but a deliberate change.

[Psalms 106:44](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">psa 106:44</span></span>

The poet's range of vision here widens from the time of the judges to
the history of the whole of the succeeding age down to the present; for
the whole history of Israel has essentially the same fundamental
character, viz., that Israel's unfaithfulness does not annul God's
faithfulness. That verifies itself even now. That which Solomon in [Kg1
8:50](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#050) prays for on behalf of his people
when they may be betrayed into the hands of the enemy, has been
fulfilled in the case of the dispersion of Israel in all countries ([Psa
107:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#003)), Babylonia, Egypt, etc.: God
has turned the hearts of their oppressors towards them. On ראה ב, to
regard compassionately, cf. [Gen
29:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#032); [Sa1
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#011). בּצּר לחם belong together, as in
[Psa 107:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#006), and frequently. רנּה is a
cry of lamentation, as in [Kg1 8:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#028) in
Solomon's prayer at the dedication of the Temple. From this source comes
[Psa 106:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#006), and also from this source
[Psa 106:46](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#046), cf. [Kg1
8:50](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#050) together with [Neh
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#011). In ויּנּחם the drawing back of
the tone does not take place, as in [Gen
24:67](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#067). חסדו beside כּרב is not pointed
by the Kerמ חסדּו, as in [Psa 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#008);
[Psa 69:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#014), but as in [Lam
3:32](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#032), according to [Psa
106:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#007), [Isa
63:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#007), חסדו: in accordance with the
fulness (riches) of His manifold mercy or loving-kindness. The
expression in [Psa 106:46](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#046) is like [Gen
43:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#014). Although the condition of the
poet's fellow-countrymen in the dispersion may have been tolerable in
itself, yet this involuntary scattering of the members of the nation is
always a state of punishment. The poet prays in [Psa
106:47](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#047) that God may be pleased to put
an end to this.

[Psalms 106:47](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#047)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">psa 106:47</span></span>

He has now reached the goal, to which his whole Psalm struggles forth,
by the way of self-accusation and the praise of the faithfulness of God.
השׁתּבּח (found only here) is the reflexive of the Piel, to account
happy, [Ecc 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#002), therefore: in order
that we may esteem ourselves happy to be able to praise Thee. In this
reflexive (and also passive) sense השׁתבח is customary in Aramaic and
post-biblical Hebrew.

[Psalms 106:48](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#048)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">psa 106:48</span></span>

The closing doxology of the Fourth Book. The chronicler has ואמרוּ
before [Psa 106:47](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#047) (which with him
differs only very slightly), an indispensable rivet, so to speak, in the
fitting together of [Psa 106:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#001) ([Psa
107:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#001)) and [Psa
106:47](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#047). The means this historian, who
joins passages together like mosaic-work, calls to his aid are palpable
enough. He has also taken over. [Psa
106:48](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#048) by transforming and let all the
people say Amen, Hallelujah! in accordance with his style (cf. [Ch1
25:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#003); [Ch2
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#013), and frequently, [Ezr
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#011)), into an historical clause:
ויּאמרוּ כל־העם אמן והלּל ליהוה. Hitzig, by regarding the echoes of the
Psalms in the chronicler as the originals of the corresponding Psalms in
the Psalter, and consequently [Ch1
16:36](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#036) as the original of the Beracha
placed after our Psalm, reverses the true relation; vid., with reference
to this point, Riehm in the Theolog. Literat. Blatt, 1866, No. 30, and
Kצhler in the Luther. Zeitschrift, 1867, S. 297ff. The priority of Ps
106 is clear from the fact that [Psa
106:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#001) gives a liturgical key-note that
was in use even in Jeremiah's time ([Psa
33:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#011)), and that [Psa
106:47](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#047) reverts to the tephilla-style
of the introit, [Psa 106:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#004). And the
priority of [Psa 106:48](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#048) as a
concluding formula of the Fourth Book is clear from the fact that is has
been fashioned, like that of the Second Book ([Psa
72:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#018).), under the influence of the
foregoing Psalm. The Hallelujah is an echo of the Hallelujah-Psalm, just
as there the Jahve Elohim is an echo of the Elohim-Psalm. And "let all
the people say Amen" is the same closing thought as in [Psa
106:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#006) of Ps, which is made into the
closing doxology of the whole Psalter. Ἀμὴν ἀλληλούΐα together ([Rev
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#004)) is a laudatory confirmation.
