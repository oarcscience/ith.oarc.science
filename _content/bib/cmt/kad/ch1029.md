### [1 Chronicles Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#001)

[1 Chronicles 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 29:1</span></span>

Contributions of the collected princes for the building of the temple. -
David then turns to the assembled princes to press upon them the
furthering of the building of the temple. After referring to the youth
of his son, and to the greatness of the work to be accomplished ([Ch1
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#001)), he mentions what materials he
has prepared for the building of the temple ([Ch1
29:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#002)); then further states what he has
resolved to give in addition from his private resources ([Ch1
29:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#004)); and finally, after this
introduction, calls upon those present to make a voluntary collection
for this great work ([Ch1 29:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#005)). The
words, "as only one hath God chosen him," form a parenthesis, which is
to be translated as a relative sentence for "my son, whom alone God hath
chosen." ורך נער as in [Ch1 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#005). The
work is great, because not for man the palace, scil. is intended, i.e.,
shall be built, but for Jahve God. הבּירה, the citadel, the palace; a
later word, generally used of the residence of the Persian king ([Est
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#002), [Est
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#005); [Est
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#003); [Neh
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#001)), only in [Neh
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#008) of the citadel by the temple; here
transferred to the temple as the glorious palace of Jahve, the God-king
of Israel. With [Ch1 29:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#002), cf. [Ch1
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#014). וגו לזּהב הזּהב, the gold for
the golden, etc., i.e., for the vessels and ornaments of gold, cf. [Ch1
28:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#014). וּמלּוּאים שׁהם אבני as in [Exo
25:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#007); [Exo
35:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#009), precious stones for the ephod
and choshen. שׁהם, probably beryl. מּלּוּאים אבני, stones of filling,
that is, precious stones which are put in settings. פּוּך אבני, stones
of pigment, i.e., ornament, conjecturally precious stones which, from
their black colour, were in appearance like פּוּך, stibium, a common eye
pigment (see [Kg2 9:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#030)). רקמה אבני,
stones of variegated colour, i.e., with veins of different colours. יקרה
אבן, precious stones, according to [Ch2
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#006), for ornamenting the walls. שׁישׁ
אבני, white marble stones.

[1 Chronicles 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch1 29:3</span></span>

"And moreover, because I have pleasure in the house of my God, there is
to me a treasure of gold and silver; it have I appointed for the house
of my God over and above all that..." הכינותי with כּל without the
relative, cf. [Ch1 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#012).

[1 Chronicles 29:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch1 29:4</span></span>

Gold 3000 talents, i.e., about 13 1/2, or, reckoning according to the
royal shekel, 6 3/4 millions of pounds; 7000 talents of silver, circa 2
1/2 or 1 1/4 millions of pounds: see on [Ch1
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#014). Gold of Ophir, i.e., the
finest, best gold, corresponding to the pure silver. לטוּח, to overlay
the inner walls of the houses with gold and silver leaf. הבּתים as in
[Ch1 28:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#011), the different buildings of
the temple. The walls of the holy place and of the most holy, of the
porch and of the upper chambers, were overlaid with gold (cf. [Ch2
3:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#004), [Ch2
3:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#008)), and probably only the inner
walls of the side buildings.

[1 Chronicles 29:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch1 29:5</span></span>

לזּהב לזּהב, for every golden thing, etc., cf. [Ch1
29:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#002). וּלכל־מלאכה, and in general for
every work to be wrought by the hands of the artificer. וּמי, who then
is willing (uw expressing it as the consequence). To fill one's hand to
the Lord, means to provide oneself with something which one brings to
the Lord; see on [Exo 32:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#029). The
infinitive מלּאות occurs also in [Exo
31:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#005) and [Dan
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#004), and along with מלּא, [Ch2
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#009).

[1 Chronicles 29:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 29:6</span></span>

The princes follow the example, and willingly respond to David's call.
האבות שׂרי = האבות ראשׁי, [Ch1 24:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#031);
[Ch1 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#001), etc. הם מלאכת ולשׂרי, and
as regards the princes of the work of the king. The למּלך וּמקנה רכוּשׁ
שׂרי, [Ch1 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#001), the officials
enumerated in [Ch1 27:25-31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#025) are meant;
on ל see on [Ch1 28:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#021). They gave 5000
talents of gold (22 1/2 or 11 1/2 millions of pounds), and 1000 darics =
11 1/2 millions of pounds. אדרכּון, with א prosth. here and in [Ezr
8:27](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#027), and דּרכּמון, [Ezr
2:69](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#069); [Neh
7:70](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#070)., does not correspond to the
Greek δραχμή, Arab. dirhem, but to the Greek δαρεικός, as the Syrian
translation derîkônā', [Ezr 8:27](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#027),
shows; a Persian gold coin worth about 22s. 6d. See the description of
these coins, of which several specimens still exist, in Cavedoni bibl.
Numismatik, bers. von A. Werlhof, S. 84ff.; J. Brandis, das Mnz-Mass und
Gewishtssystem in Vorderasien (1866), S. 244; and my bibl. Archol. 127,
3. "Our historian uses the words used in his time to designate the
current gold coins, without intending to assume that there were darics
in use in the time of David, to state in a way intelligible to his
readers the amount of the sum contributed by the princes" (Bertheau).
This perfectly correct remark does not, however, explain why the author
of the Chronicle has stated the contribution in gold and that in silver
in different values, in talents and in darics, since the second cannot
be an explanation of the first, the two sums being different. Probably
the sum in darics is the amount which they contributed in gold pieces
received as coins; the talents, on the other hand, probably represent
the weight of the vessels and other articles of gold which they brought
as offerings for the building. The amount contributed in silver is not
large when compared with that in gold: 10,000 talents = 3,500,000, or
one half that amount. The contribution in copper also, 18,000 talents,
is not very large. Besides these, those who had stones, i.e., precious
stones, also brought them. אתּו הנּמצא, that was found with him, for:
that which he (each one) had of stones they gave. The sing. אתּו is to
be taken distributively, and is consequently carried on in the plural,
נתנוּ; cf. Ew. 319, a. אבנים is accus. of subordination. יד על נתן, to
give over for administration (Ew. 282, b). יחיאל, the Levite family of
this name which had the oversight of the treasures of the house of God
([Ch1 26:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#021).).

[1 Chronicles 29:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch1 29:9</span></span>

The people and the king rejoiced over this willingness to give. שׁלם
בּלב, as in [Ch1 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#009).

[1 Chronicles 29:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch1 29:10</span></span>

David's thanksgiving prayer. - David gives fitting expression to his joy
on the success of the deepest wish of his heart, in a prayer with which
he closes the last parliament of his reign. Since according to the
divine decree, not he, the man of war, but his son, the peace-king
Solomon, was to build a temple to the Lord, David had taken it upon
himself to prepare as far as possible for the carrying out of the work.
He had also found the princes and chiefs of the people willing to
further it, and to assist his son Solomon in it. In this the pious and
grey-haired servant of the Lord saw a special proof of the divine
favour, for which he must thank God the Lord before the whole
congregation. He praises Jahve, "the God of Israel our father," [Ch1
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#010), or, as it is in [Ch1
29:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#018), "the God of Abraham, of Isaac,
and of Jacob, our fathers." Jahve had clearly revealed himself to David
and his people as the God of Israel and of the patriarchs, by fulfilling
in so glorious a manner to the people of Israel, by David, the promises
made to the patriarchs. God the Lord had not only by David made His
people great and powerful, and secured to them the peaceful possession
of the good land, by humbling all their enemies round about, but He had
also awakened in the heart of the people such love to and trust in their
God, that the assembled dignitaries of the kingdom showed themselves
perfectly willing to assist in furthering the building of the house of
God. In this God had revealed His greatness, power, glory, etc., as
David (in [Ch1 29:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#011), [Ch1
29:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#012)) acknowledges with praise:
"Thine, Jahve, is the greatness," etc. הנּצח, according to the Aramaic
usage, gloria, splendour, honour. כל כּי, yea all, still dependent on לך
at the commencement of the sentence, so that we do not need to supply לך
after כּי. "Thine is the dominion, and the raising of oneself to be head
over all." In His ממלכה God reveals His greatness, might, glory, etc.
ממנשּׂא is not a participle requiring אתּה, "thou art," to be supplied
(Berth.), but an appellative, an Aramaic infinitive, - the raising
oneself (Ew. 160, e).

[1 Chronicles 29:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch1 29:12</span></span>

"From Thee came the riches and the glory ..., and in Thy hand is it (it
lies) to make all things great and strong."

[1 Chronicles 29:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch1 29:13</span></span>

For this we must thank God, and sing praise to His holy name. By the
partic. מודים, from הודה, confess, praise, the praising of God is
characterized as an enduring praise, always rising anew.

[1 Chronicles 29:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch1 29:14</span></span>

For man of himself can give nothing: "What am I, and what is my people,
that we should be able to show ourselves so liberal?" כּוח עצר כּוח, to
hold strength together; both to have power to do anything (here and [Ch2
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#005); [Ch2
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#009)), and also to retain strength
([Ch2 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#020); [Dan
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#008), [Dan
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#016); [Dan
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#006)), only found in Daniel and in the
Chronicle. התנדּב, to show oneself willing, especially in giving. כּזאת
refers to the contribution to the building of the temple ([Ch1
29:3-8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#003)). From Thy hand, i.e., that
which is received from Thee, have we given.

[1 Chronicles 29:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch1 29:15</span></span>

For we are strangers (as [Psa 39:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#013)),
i.e., in this connection we have no property, no enduring possession,
since God had only given them the usufruct of the land; and as of the
land, so also of all the property of man, it is only a gift committed to
us by God in usufruct. The truth that our life is a pilgrimage ([Heb
11:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#012)), is presented to us by the
brevity of life. As a shadow, so swiftly passing away, are our days upon
the earth (cf. [Job 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#009); [Psa
90:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#009)., [Psa
102:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#012); [Psa
144:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#004)). מקוה ואין, and there is no
trust, scil. in the continuance of life (cf. [Jer
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#008)).

[1 Chronicles 29:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch1 29:16</span></span>

All the riches which we have prepared for the building of the temple
come from the hand of God. The Keth. הוּא is neuter, the Keri הוּא
corresponds to ההמון.

[1 Chronicles 29:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch1 29:17</span></span>

Before God, who searches the heart and loves uprightness, David can
declare that he has willingly given in uprightness of heart, and that
the people also have, to his joy, shown equal willingness. כּל־אלּה, all
the treasures enumerated ([Ch1
29:3-8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#003)). The plural הנּמצאוּ refers to
עמּך, and the demonstrative ה stands for אשׁר as in [Ch1
26:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#028).

[1 Chronicles 29:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch1 29:18</span></span>

He prays that God may enable the people ever to retain this frame of
heart. זאת is more closely defined by מח ליצר, viz., the frame of the
thoughts of the heart of Thy people. "And direct their heart (the
people's heart) to Thee," cf. [Sa1
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#003).

[1 Chronicles 29:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch1 29:19</span></span>

And to Solomon may God give a whole (undivided) heart, that he may keep
all the divine commands and do them, and build the temple. שׁלם לב as in
[Ch1 29:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#009). הכּל לעשׂות, that he may do
all, scil. that the commands, testimonies, and statutes require. For
הבּירה, see [Ch1 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#001).

[1 Chronicles 29:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch1 29:20</span></span>

Close of the public assembly. - [Ch1
29:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#020). At the conclusion of the
prayer, David calls upon the whole assembly to praise God; which they
do, bowing before God and the king, and worshipping. וישׁתּחווּ יקּדוּ,
connected as in [Exo 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#031); [Gen
43:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#028), etc.

[Ch1 29:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#021)

To seal their confession, thus made in word and deed, the assembled
dignitaries prepared a great sacrificial feast to the Lord on the
following day. They sacrificed to the Lord sacrifices, viz., 1000
bullocks, 1000 rams, and 1000 lambs as burnt-offering, with
drink-offerings to correspond, and sacrifices, i.e., thank-offerings
(שׁלמים), in multitude for all Israel, i.e., so that all those present
could take part in the sacrificial meal prepared from these sacrifices.
While זבהים in the first clause is the general designation of the bloody
offerings as distinguished from the meat-offerings, in the last clause
it is restricted by the contrast with עלות and the שׁלמים, from which
joyous sacrificial meals were prepared.

[Ch1 29:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#022)

On this day they made Solomon king a second time, anointing him king to
the Lord, and Zadok to be priest, i.e., high priest. The שׁנית refers
back to [Ch1 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#001), and the first
anointing of Solomon narrated in [Kg1
1:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#032). ליהיה, not: before Jahve, which
ל cannot signify, but: "to Jahve," in accordance with His will expressed
in His choice of Solomon ([Ch1 28:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#004)).
The ל before צדוק is nota accus., as in לשׁלמה. From the last words we
learn that Zadok received the high-priesthood with the consent of the
estates of the kingdom.

[1 Chronicles 29:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ch1 29:23</span></span>

Solomon's accession and David's death, with a statement as to the length
of his reign and the sources of the history. - [Ch1
29:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#023). The remarks on Solomon's
accession and reign contained in these verses are necessary to the
complete conclusion of a history of David's reign, for they show how
David's wishes for his son Solomon, whom Jahve chose to be his
successor, were fulfilled. On יהוה על־כּסּא see the commentary on [Ch1
28:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#005). ויּצלח, he was prosperous,
corresponds to the hope expressed by David ([Ch1
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#013)), which was also fulfilled by
the submission of all princes and heroes, and also of all the king's
sons, to King Solomon ([Ch1 29:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#024)).
There can hardly, however, be in these last words a reference to the
frustrating of Adonijah's attempted usurpation of the throne (cf. [Kg1
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#015).). תּחת יד נתן = to submit. But
this meaning is not derived (Rashi) from the custom of taking oaths of
fidelity by clasping of hands, for this custom cannot be certainly
proved to have existed among the Israelites; still less can it have
arisen from the ancient custom mentioned in [Gen
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#002), [Gen
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#009); [Gen
47:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#029), of laying the hand under the
thigh of the person to whom one swore in making promises with oath. The
hand, as the instrument of all activity, is here simply a symbol of
power.

[1 Chronicles 29:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">ch1 29:25</span></span>

Jahve made Solomon very great, by giving him the glory of the kingdom,
as no king before him had had it. כּל is to be taken along with לא,
nullus, and does not presuppose a number of kings before Solomon; it
involves only more than one. Before him, Saul, Ishbosheth, and David had
been kings, and the kingship of the latter had been covered with glory.

[1 Chronicles 29:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">ch1 29:26</span></span>

כּל־ישׂראל על (as in [Ch1 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#001); [Ch1
12:38](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#038)), referring to the fact that
David had been for a time king only over Judah, but had been recognised
at a later time by all the tribes of Israel as king. The length of his
reign as in [Kg1 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#011). In Hebron seven
years; according to [Sa2 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#005), more
exactly seven years and six months.

[1 Chronicles 29:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">ch1 29:28</span></span>

On וכבוד עשׁר cf. [Kg1 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#013); [Ch2
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#005).

[1 Chronicles 29:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">ch1 29:29</span></span>

On the authorities cited see the Introduction. וגו כּל־מלכוּתו עם goes
with כּתוּבים הנּם: the acts of David ... are written ... together with
his whole reign and his power, and the times which went over him.
העתּים, the times, with their joys and sorrows, as in [Psa
31:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#016); [Job
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#001). The kingdoms of the lands (cf.
[Ch2 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#008); [Ch2
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#010); [Ch2
20:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#029)) are the kingdoms with which the
Israelites under David came into contact-Philistia, Edom, Moab, Ammon,
Aram.
