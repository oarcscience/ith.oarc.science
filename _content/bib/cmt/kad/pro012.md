### [Proverbs Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#001)

[Proverbs 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 12:1</span></span>

Three proverbs on knowledge, the favour of God, firmness and the means
thereto.

1 He loveth correction who loveth knowledge,

And he hateth instruction who is without reason.

It is difficult in such cases to say which is the relation of the ideas
that is intended. The sequence of words which lies nearest in the
Semitic substantival clause is that in which the predicate is placed
first; but the subject may, if it is to be made prominent, stand at the
head of the sentence. Here, 1b, the placing of the subject in advance
recommends itself: one who hates instruction is devoid of reason. But
since we have no reason in 1a to invert the order of the words as they
lie together, we take the conceptions placed first in both cases as the
predicates. Thus: he who loves knowledge shows and proves that he does
so by this, that he willingly puts himself in the place of a learner;
and devoid of reason is he who with aversion rejects reproof, which is
designed to guard him from future mistakes and false steps. Regarding
the punctuation דעת אהב (with Mercha on the ante-penult. and the
העמדה-sign on the penult.), vid., at [Pro
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#026)., [Pro
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#019). In 1b the Munach in תוכחת is
transformed from Mugrash (Accentssystem, xviii. 2), as in [Pro
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#010). בּער (cf. [Pro
30:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#002)) is a being who is stupid as the
brute cattle (בּעיר, from בּער, to graze, cattle of all kinds; Arab.
b'ayr, the beast κατ ̓ ἐξ., i.e., the camel); as a homo brutus is
compared to a בּהמּה (Ps. 49:21), 73:22), and is called Arab. behymt,
from bahym, "shut up" (spec. dabb, a bear; thwr, an ox; ḥamâr, an ass)
(Fl.).

[Proverbs 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 12:2</span></span>

2 A good man obtaineth favour with Jahve,

But the man of wicked devices He condemns.

He who is an אישׁ מזמּות ([Pro 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#017),
cf. [Psa 37:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#007)) is defined in [Pro
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#008) : he is a man of devices, namely,
that are wicked, one who contrives evil against his neighbour. The
meaning of the subject-conception טוב is defined according to this,
although in itself also it is clear, for טוב, used of God (e.g., [Psa
73:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#001); [Psa
86:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#005)) and of men ([Pro
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#022); [Pro
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#014)), denotes the good (bonus) in
the sense of the benevolent (benignus); the Scripture truths, that God
is love, that love is the essence of goodness and is the fulfilling of
the law, are so conformed to reason, that they stamp themselves as
immediate component parts of the human consciousness. A טוב is thus a
man who acts according to the ruling motive of self-sacrificing love;
such an one obtains (vid., on יפיק, educit = adipiscitur, at [Pro
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#013)) the favour of God, He is and
shows Himself kind to him, while on the contrary He condemns the wicked
intriguer. Hitzig translates: the former of intrigues is punishable (as
the Syr.: is condemned; Targ.: his contrivance is shattered to pieces);
but to become a רשׁע = reus הרשׁיע does not denote, but either to
practise רשׁע, [Job 34:12](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#012), or to set
forth as רשׁע = to condemn, [Isa 50:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#009).
Taken in the former signification (Jerome, impie agit), a declaration is
made which is not needed, since the moral badness already lies in the
reference of the subject: thus ירשׁיע will be used also of Jahve. In
proof that the poet did not need to say ואת־אישׁ, Zckler rightly points
to [Pro 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#006); [Job
22:29](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#029).

[Proverbs 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 12:3</span></span>

3 A man does not stand by wickedness,

But the root of the righteous remains unmoved.

In רשׁע there lies the idea of want of inward stay (vid., at [Psa
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)); in a manner of thought and of
conduct which has no stay in God and His law, there can be expected no
external endurance, no solidity. The righteous, on the contrary, have
their root in God; nothing can tear them from the ground in which they
are rooted, they are as trees which no storm outroots. The very same
thought is clothed in other words in [Pro
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#025), and another statement regarding
the root of the righteous is found at [Pro
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#012).

[Proverbs 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 12:4</span></span>

We now place together [Pro 12:4-12](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#004).
One proverb concerning the house-wife forms the beginning of this group,
and four regarding the management of the house and business form the
conclusion.

4 A good brave wife is the crown of her husband,

But as rottenness in his bones is one that causeth shame.

As [Pro 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#016) says of אושׁת חן, the
pleasant wife (חן = χάρις), that she obtaineth honour, so this proverb
of אושׁת חיל, the good wife (חיל = ἀρετή, virtus), that she raises her
husband to higher honour: she is for his self-consciousness στέφανος
καυχήσεως ([Th1 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#019)), and is also to
him such a crown of honour before the world (cf. [Pro
31:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#023)). On the contrary, a מבישׁה,
conducting herself shamefully (cf. regarding the double meaning of this
Mishle word, which only here occurs in the fem., at [Pro
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#005)), is to her husband instar cariei
in ossibus. רקב (רקב, [Pro 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#007))
denotes both the caries and the worm-hole (cf. [Job
41:19](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#019), עץ רקּבון, worm-eaten wood).
Like as the caries slowly but continuously increases, till at last the
part of the body which the bone bears and the whole life of the man
falls to ruin; so an unhappy marriage gnaws at the marrow of life, it
destroys the happiness of life, disturbs the pursuit, undermines the
life of the husband.

[Proverbs 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 12:5</span></span>

5 The thoughts of the righteous are justice,

The counsels of the godless are deceit.

They are so, that is, in their contents and their aim. To the righteous
are ascribed מחשׁבות, namely, simple and clear; to the godless, תּחבּות,
carefully thought out, prudently thought through schemes and measures,
but on that very account not simple, because with a tendency; for the
righteous have an objective rule, namely, that which is right in the
sight of God and of men, but the godless have only a selfish purpose,
which they seek to attain by deceiving, and at the cost of, their
neighbour.

[Proverbs 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 12:6</span></span>

6 The word of the godless is to lie in wait for the blood of others,

But the mouth of the upright delivereth them.

Our editions have דברי רשׁעים, but the right sequence of the accents (in
Cod. 1294 and elsewhere) is דברי רשׁעים; the logical relation in this
transformation, which is only rhythmically conditioned, remains the
same. The vocalization wavers between ארב־, which would be imper., and
ארב־, which is infin., like אמר־, [Pro
25:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#007), ענשׁ־, [Pro
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#011), אכל־, [Gen
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#011). However one punctuates it, the
infin. is intended in any case, in which the expression always remains
sketchy enough: the words of the godless are lying in wait for blood,
i.e., they are calculated to bring others to this, into the danger of
their lives, e.g., before the tribunal by false charges and false
witness. דּם is the accus. of the object; for instead of ארב לדם ([Pro
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#011)), to lurk for blood, a shorter
expression, ארב דּם, is used (Ewald, 282a). The suffix of יצּילם

(Note: Elias Levita, in his note to the root פה in Kimchi's Wrterbuch,
reads תּצּילם, and so also do 6 codd. in Kennicot. But פּה is
masculine.)

might appear, after [Pro 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#006), to
refer back to the ישׁרים; but the thought that their mouth saves the
upright, that they thus know to speak themselves out of the danger, is
by far less appropriate (vid., on the contrary, בדעת, [Pro
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#009)) than the thought that the mouth
of the upright delivereth from danger those whose lives are threatened
by the godless, as is rightly explained by Ewald, Bertheau, Elster. The
personal subject or object is in the Mashal style often to be evolved
from the connection, e.g., [Pro 14:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#026);
[Pro 19:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#023).

[Proverbs 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 12:7</span></span>

7 The godless are overturned and are no more,

But the house of the righteous stands.

Bertheau and Zckler explain: The wicked turn about, then are they no
more; i.e., as we say: it is over with them "in the turning of a hand."
The noun in the inf. absol. may certainly be the subject, like [Pro
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#012), as well as the object (Ewald,
328c), and הפך may be used of the turning about of oneself, [Psa
78:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#009); [Kg2
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#026); [Ch2
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#012). That explanation also may claim
for itself that הפך nowhere occurs with a personal object, if we except
one questionable passage, [Isa 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#007).
But here the interpretation of the רשׁעים as the object lies near the
contrast of בית, and moreover the interpretation of the הפך, not in the
sense of στρέφεσθαι (lxx), but of καταστρέφειν (Syr., Targ., Jerome,
Graec. Venet., Luther), lies near the contrast of יעמד. The inf. absol.
thus leaves the power from which the catastrophe proceeds indefinite, as
the pass. יהפפכוּ would also leave it, and the act designedly presented
in a vague manner to connect with ו the certain consequences therewith,
as [Pro 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#004)., as if to say: there
comes only from some quarter an unparalleled overthrow which overwhelms
the godless; thus no rising up again is to be thought on, it is all over
with them; while, on the contrary, the house of the righteous withstands
the storm which sweeps away the godless.

[Proverbs 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 12:8</span></span>

8 According to the measure of his intelligence is a man praised,

And whoever is of a perverse mind is despised.

Everywhere in the Mishle שׂכל has no other meaning than intellectus. The
praise which is given to a man measures itself לפי שׂכלו (punctuate
לפי־שׂכלו, according to Torath Emeth, p. 41, Accentssystem, xx. 1),
i.e., according to the measure (so לפי is used in the oldest form of the
language) of his intelligence, or as we may also say, of his culture;
for in these proverbs, which make the fear of God the highest principle,
שׂכל means also understanding of moral excellence, not merely the
intellectual superiority of natural gifts. הלּל is here a relative
conception of manifold gradations, but it does not mean renown in
general, but good renown. Parallel with שׂכלו, לב refers to the
understanding (νοῦς); the rendering of Lwenstein, "who is of false
heart," is defective. נעוה (synon. of נפתּל and עקּשׁ, but nowhere else
interchanging with it) means here a vero et recto detortus et aversus
(Fl.). Such a man who has not a good understanding, nor any certain rule
of judgment, falls under contempt (Graec. Venet. τῷ ὀντωτῇ εἰς μυσαγμόν,
after the false reading of יהוה instead of יהיה), i.e., he defames
himself by his crooked judgment of men, of things and their relations,
and is on this account in no position rightly to make use of them.

[Proverbs 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 12:9</span></span>

9 Better is he who is lowly and has a servant,

Than he that makes himself mighty and is without bread.

This proverb, like [Pro 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#017),
commends the middle rank of life with its quiet excellences. נקלה (like
[Sa1 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#023)), from קלה, cognate with
קלל, Syr. 'kly, to despise, properly levi pendere, levem habere (whence
קלון, scorn, disgrace), here of a man who lives in a humble position and
does not seek to raise himself up. Many of the ancients (lxx, Symmachus,
Jerome, Syr., Rashi, Luther, Schultens) explain ועבד לו by, and is a
servant to himself, serves himself; but in that case the words would
have been עבד לנפשׁו (Syr. דּמשׁמּשׁ נפשׁהּ), or rather ועבדּו הוּא.
ועבד לו would be more appropriate, as thus pointed by Ziegler, Ewald,
and Hitzig. But if one adheres to the traditional reading, and
interprets this, as it must be interpreted: et cui servus (Targ., Graec.
Venet.), then that supplies a better contrast to וחסר־לחם, for "the
first necessity of an oriental in only moderate circumstances is a
slave, just as was the case with the Greeks and Romans" (Fl.). A man of
lowly rank, who is, however, not so poor that he cannot support a slave,
is better than one who boasts himself and is yet a beggar ([Sa2
3:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#029)). The Hithpa. often expresses a
striving to be, or to wish to appear to be, what the adj. corresponding
to the verb states, e.g., התגּדּל, התעשּׁר; like the Greek middles,
εζεσθαι, αζεσθαι, cf. התחכּם and σοφίζεσθαι. So here, where with
Fleischer we have translated: who makes himself mighty, for כבד, gravem
esse, is etymologically also the contrast of קלה. The proverb, Sirach
10:26: κρείσσων ἐργαζόμενος καὶ περισσεύων ἐν πᾶσιν, ἢ δοξαζόμενος καὶ
ἀπορῶν ἄρτων (according to the text of Fritzsche), is a half
remodelling, half translation of this before us.

[Proverbs 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 12:10</span></span>

10 The righteous knows how his cattle feel,

And the compassion of the godless is cruel.

The explanation: the righteous taketh care for the life of his beast
(Fl.), fails, for 10a is to be taken with [Exo
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#009); נפשׁ signifies also the state of
one's soul, the frame of mind, the state of feeling; but ידע has, as in
the related proverb, [Pro 27:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#023), the
meaning of careful cognizance or investigation, in conformity with which
one acts. If the Tor includes in the law of the Sabbath ([Exo
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#010); [Exo
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#012)) useful beasts and cattle, which
are here especially meant, and secures to them the reward of their
labour ([Deu 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#004)); if it forbids the
mutilation, and generally the giving of unnecessary pain, to beasts; if
it enjoins those who take a bird's nest to let the dam escape ([Deu
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#006).) - these are the prefigurations
of that דעת נפש בהמה, and as the God of the Tor thus appears at the
close of the Book of Jonah, this wonderful apology (defensio) of the
all-embracing compassion, the God also of the world-history in this
sympathy for the beasts of the earth as the type of the righteous.

In 10b most interpreters find an oxymoron: the compassion of the godless
is compassionless, the direct opposite of compassion; i.e., he possesses
either altogether no compassion, or he shows such as in its principle,
its expression, and in its effects is the opposite of what it ought to
be (Fl.). Bertheau believes that in the sing. of the predicate אכזרי he
is justified in translating: the compassion of the wicked is a tyranny.
And as one may speak of a loveless love, i.e., of a love which in its
principle is nothing else than selfishness, so also of a compassionless
compassion, such as consists only in gesture and speech without truth of
feeling and of active results. But how such a compassionless compassion
toward the cattle, and one which is really cruel, is possible, it may be
difficult to show. Hitzig's conjecture, רחמי, sprang from this thought:
the most merciful among sinners are cruel - the sinner is as such not
רחוּם. The lxx is right in the rendering, τὰ δὲ σπλάγχνα τῶν ἀσεβῶν
ἀνελεήμονα. The noun רחמים means here not compassion, but, as in [Gen
43:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#030) (lxx ἔντερα or ἔγκατα) and [Kg1
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#026) (lxx μήτρα), has the meaning the
bowels (properly tender parts, cf. Arab. rakhuma, to be soft, tender,
with rḥm), and thus the interior of the body, in which deep emotions,
and especially strong sympathy, are wont to be reflected (cf. [Hos
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#008)). The singular of the predicate
אכזרי arises here from the unity of the subject-conception: the inwards,
as [Jer 50:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#012), from the reference of
the expression to each individual of the many.

[Proverbs 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 12:11</span></span>

11 He that tilleth his own ground is satisfied with bread,

And he that followeth after vain pursuits is devoid of understanding.

Yet more complete is the antithetic parallelism in the doublette, [Pro
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#019) (cf. also Sir. 20:27a). The
proverb recommends the cultivation of the field as the surest means of
supporting oneself honestly and abundantly, in contrast to the grasping
after vain, i.e., unrighteous means of subsistence, windy speculations,
and the like (Fl.). ריקים are here not persons (Bertheau), but things
without solidity and value (lxx μάταια; Aquila, Theodotion, κενά), and,
in conformity with the contrast, not real business. Elsewhere also the
mas. plur. discharges the function of a neut. noun of multitude, vid.,
נגידים, principalia, [Pro 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#006), and
זדים, [Psa 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#014) - one of the many
examples of the imperfect use of the gender in Hebr.; the speaker has in
ריקים, vana et inania, not אנשׁים ([Jdg
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#004)), but דברים ([Deu
32:47](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#047)) in view. The lxx erroneously at
[Pro 28:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#019), and Symmachus and Jerome
at both places understand ריקים of slothfulness.

[Proverbs 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 12:12</span></span>

12 The godless lusteth after the spoil of evil-doers;

But the root of the righteous shoots forth.

This translation is at the same time an explanation, and agrees with
Fleischer's "the godless strives by unrighteous gain like the wicked
([Pro 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#014)) to enrich himself, namely,
as must be understood from the antithetic members of the parallelism, in
vain, without thereby making progress and gaining anything certain. The
preterite, as [Pro 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#002), [Pro
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#008), etc., places the general true
proposition as a separate historic principle derived from experience. In
12b יתּן stands elliptically or pregnantly: edet, scil. quod radix edere
solet, sobolem stirpis, ramorum, etc., as in the Arab. natan and ânatan
are specially used without an obj. of the spontaneousness of an odour."
מצוד (from צוּד, to spy, to hunt) is elsewhere the instrument of the
hunt (a net), here the object and end of it. If the words had been
מצוּדי רעים, then we would explain after מלאכי רעים, [Psa
78:49](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#049) (vid., comm. on), and אושׁת רע,
[Pro 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#024); but in the difference of
number, רעים will not be the qualitative but the subjective personal
genitive: capturam qualem mali captant. Ewald, who understands ריקים,
11b, of good-for-nothing-fellows, interprets רעים here, on the contrary,
as neuter (172b): the desire of the wicked is an evil net, i.e., wherein
he catches all manner of evil for himself. The lxx has here two
proverbs, in which מצוד occurs in the plur. and in the sense of
ὀχυρώματα; 12b of the Hebr. text is rendered: αἱ δὲ ῥίζαι τῶν εὐσεβῶν ἐν
ὀχρυώμασι, which Schleusner explains immotae erunt. The Hebr. text can
gain nothing from this variation. That the lxx read ושׁרשׁ צדיקים איתן
is not probable, since they nowhere thus translate איתן. But Reiske and
Ziegler have, like Ewald and Hitzig, combined יתּן of this proverb with
יתן from איתן (Arab. wâtin), firmum, perennem esse. Hitzig translates
the distich, after emending the text of 12a by the help of the lxx and
the Arab.: the refuge of the wicked is crumbling clay, but the root of
the righteous endures (יתן from יתן). Bttcher also reads חמר instead of
חמד, and translates (vid., p. 192, l. 11): the refuge of the wicked is
miry clay, but the root of the righteous holdeth fast (יתן = Arab.
wâtin). But this derivation of a verb יתן is not necessary. The Graec.
Venet. rightly, ῥίζα δὲ δικαίων δώσει. The obj. is self-evident. Rashi
reads מה שהוא ראוי ליתן והוא הפרי. So also Schultens. The root giveth,
is equivalent to, it is productive in bringing forth that which lies in
its nature. That the root of the righteous endures (Targ. נתקיּם) is
otherwise expressed, [Pro 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#003).

[Proverbs 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 12:13</span></span>

Proverbs regarding injurious and beneficial words, wise hearing and
prudent silence.

13 In the transgression of the lips there lies a dangerous snare;

The righteous escapeth from trouble.

The consecutive modus (ויּצא) is here of greater weight than e.g., at
[Pro 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#008), where the connection
follows without it (ויּבא) from the idea of the change of place. The
translation: but the righteous ... restores ויצא (ויצא), and ignores the
syllogistic relation of the members of the proverb, which shows itself
here (cf. the contrary, [Pro 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#009)) to
a certain degree by ויּצא. Ewald displaces this relation, for he
paraphrases: "any one may easily come into great danger by means of
inconsiderate words; yet it is to be hoped that the righteous may
escape, for he will guard himself against evil from the beginning." He
is right here in interpreting צרה and מוקשׁ רע as the designation of
danger into which one is betrayed by the transgressions of his lips, but
"inconsiderate words" are less than פּשׁע שׂפתים. One must not be misled
into connecting with פּשׁע the idea of missing, or a false step, from
the circumstance that פּשׁע means a step; both verbs have, it is true,
the common R. פש with the fundamental idea of placing apart or
separating, but פּשׁע has nothing to do with פּשׁע (step = placing apart
of the legs), but denotes (as Arab. fusuwḳ fisḳ, from the primary
meaning diruptio, diremtio) a sinning, breaking through and breaking off
the relation to God (cf. e.g., [Pro
28:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#024)), or even the restraints of
morality ([Pro 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#019)). Such a sinning,
which fastens itself to, and runs even among the righteous, would not be
called פשׁע, but rather חטּאת ([Pro
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#009)). According to this the proverb
will mean that sinful words bring into extreme danger every one who
indulges in them - a danger which he can with difficulty escape; and
that thus the righteous, who guards himself against sinful words,
escapes from the distress (cf. with the expression, [Ecc
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#018)) into which one is thereby
betrayed. רע is the descriptive and expressive epithet to מוקשׁ (cf.
[Ecc 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#012)): a bad false trap, a
malicious snare, for מוקשׁ is the snare which closes together and
catches the bird by the feet. This proverb is repeated at [Pro
29:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#006), peculiarly remodelled. The lxx
has after [Pro 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#013) another distich:

He who is of mild countenance findeth mercy;

He who is litigious oppresseth souls.

(נפשׁות, or rather, more in accordance with the Hebrew original:
oppresseth himself, נפשׁו.)

[Proverbs 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 12:14</span></span>

14 From the fruit which the mouth of the man bringeth forth is he
satisfied with good,

And what the hands of the man accomplish returns back to him.

The proverb finds its final verification in the last judgment (cf. [Mat
12:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#037)), but it is also illustrated in
the present life. If the mouth of a man bringeth forth fruit - namely,
the fruit of wholesome doctrine, of right guidance, of comforting
exhortation, of peace-bringing consolation for others - this fruit is
also to his own advantage, he richly enjoys the good which flows out of
his own mouth, the blessing he bestows is also a blessing for himself.
The same also is the case with the actions of a man. That which is done,
or the service which is rendered by his hands, comes back to him as a
reward or as a punishment. גּמוּל signifies primarily accomplishment,
execution, and is a twofold, double-sided conception: a rendering of
good or evil, and merit on the side of men (whether merited reward or
merited punishment), as well as recompense, requital on the side of God.
The first line is repeated, somewhat altered, at [Pro
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#002); [Pro
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#020). The whole proverb is
prophetically echoed in [Isa 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#010). The
Kerı̂ ישׁיב has Jahve as the subject, or rather the subject remains
undefined, and "one requites him" is equivalent to: it is requited to
him. The Chethı̂b seems to us more expressive; but this use of the active
with the undefined subject, instead of the passive, is certainly as much
in the Mishle style (cf. [Pro 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#021))
as the development of the subject of the clause from a foregoing
genitive.

15 The way of the fool is right in his own eyes,

But the wise listeneth to counsel.

Other proverbs, like [Pro 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#002), say
that generally the judgment of a man regarding his character does not go
beyond a narrow subjectivity; but there are objective criteria according
to which a man can prove whether the way in which he walks is right; but
the fool knows not other standard than his own opinion, and however
clearly and truly one may warn him that the way which he has chosen is
the wrong way and leads to a false end, yet he obstinately persists;

(Note: Vid., kindred proverbs by Carl Schulze, Die bibl. Sprichwrter der
deutschen Sprache (1860), p. 50, and M. C. Wahl's Das Sprichwort in der
heb.-aram. Literatur, u.s.w. (1871), p. 31.)

while a wise man is not so wise in his own eyes ([Pro
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#007)) as not to be willing to listen to
well-meant counsel, because, however careful he may be regarding his
conduct, yet he does not regard his own judgment so unerring as not to
be inclined ever anew to try it and let it stand the test. Ewald has
falsely construed: yet whoever hears counsel is wise. In consequence of
the contrast, אויל and חכם are the subject ideas, and with ושׁמע לעצה is
brought forward that which is in contrast to the self-complacency of the
fool, the conduct of the wise man.

[Proverbs 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 12:16</span></span>

The relations of the subject and the predicate are the same as in the
preceding verse.

The fool makes known his vexation on the same day \[at once\],

On the contrary, the prudent man hideth the offence.

Very frequently in these proverbs the first line is only defined by the
adducing of the second, or the second holds itself in the light of the
first. A post-bibl. proverb says that a man is known by three things: by
his כוס (his behaviour in drinking), his כיס (his conduct in money
transactions), and his כעס (his conduct under deep inward excitement).
So here: he is a fool who, if some injury is done to him, immediately
shows his vexation in a passionate manner; while, on the contrary the
prudent man maintains silence as to the dishonour that is done to him,
and represses his displeasure, so as not to increase his vexation to his
own injury. Passionless retaliation may in certain cases be a duty of
self-preservation, and may appear to be necessary for the protection of
truth, but passionate self-defence is always of evil, whether the injury
which is inflicted be justifiable or unjustifiable. Regarding ערוּם,
callidus, vid., p. 56; Schultens' comparison of the Greek γεγυμνασμένος
is only a conceit in want of better knowledge. Regarding כּסה (only here
and at [Pro 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#023)) with מכסּה, as שׁחר
(only [Pro 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#027)) with משׁחר, vid.,
Ewald, 170a. בּיּום signifies on the self-same day = without delay,
immediately, and is well translated by the lxx αὐθήμερον. With another
object, 16b is repeated in 23a.

Most of the remaining parables of this section refer to the right use
and the abuse of the tongue.

17 He that breathes the love of truth, utters that which is right;

But a lying tongue, deceit

This verse is similar in meaning to [Pro
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#005) (where 5b = [Pro
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#019)); the second line of the distich
= [Pro 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#025). Everywhere else יפיח
כּזבים stand together, only here יפיח is joined to אמוּנה; vid.,
regarding this יפיח forming an attributive clause, and then employed as
an adjective, but with distinct verbal force, at [Pro
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#019). Viewed superficially, the
proverb appears tautological; it is not so, however, but places in
causal connection the internal character of men and their utterances:
whoever breathes אמוּנה, truth or conscientiousness (the property of the
אמוּן, vid., at [Psa 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#002)), i.e., lets
the voice of this be heard in his utterances, such an one speaks צדק,
i.e., uprightness, integrity, that which is correct, right ([Isa
45:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#019), cf. [Isa
41:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#026)), in relation to truth in
general, and to the present case in particular; but he who עד שׁקרים,
i.e., he who, against better knowledge and the consciousness of untruth,
confirms by his testimony (from עוּד, revertere, to say again and
again), therewith gives utterance to his impure character, his wicked
intention, proceeding from delight in doing evil or from self-interest,
and diverted towards the injury of his neighbour. As אמונה and מרמה
correspond as statements of the contents of the utterances, so צדק and
שקרים as statements of their motive and aim. מרמה is obj. accus. of the
יגּיד (from הגּיד, to bring to light, cf. נגד, visibility) to be
supplied, not the pred. nom. dolorum structor, as Fleischer poetically
finds.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 12:18</span></span>

18 There is that babbleth like the thrusts of a sword,

But the tongue of the wise is healing.

The second (cf. [Pro 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#024)) of the
proverbs beginning with ישׁ. The verb בּטה (בּטא), peculiar to the
Hebr., which in the modern Hebr. generally means "to speak out" (מבטא in
the grammar: the pronunciation) (according to which the lxx, Syr., and
Targ. translate it by אמר), means in biblical Hebr., especially with
reference to the binding of oneself by an oath ([Lev
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#004)), and to solemn protestations
([Num 30:7](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#007), [Num
30:9](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#009), according to which Jerome,
promittit): to utter incautiously in words, to speak without thought and
at random, referred erroneously by Gesenius to the R. בט, to be hollow,
probably a word imitative of the sound, like the Greek βατταρίζειν, to
stammer, and βαττολογεῖν, to babble, which the lexicographers refer to a
talkative person of the name of Βάττος, as our "salbadern" \[= to talk
foolishly\] owes its origin to one Jenaer Bader on the Saal. Theod. and
the Graec. Venet. give the false reading בּוטח (πεποιθώς). כּמדקרות חרב
stands loco accusativi, the כּ being regarded as a noun: (effutiens
verba) quae sunt instar confossionum gladii (Fl.). We also call such a
man, who bridles his loquacity neither by reflection nor moderates it by
indulgent reference to his fellow-men, a Schwertmaul (sword-mouth) or a
Schandmaul (a mouth of shame = slanderer), and say that he has a tongue
like a sword. But on the other hand, the tongue of the wise, which is in
itself pure gentleness and a comfort to others, since, far from
wounding, rather, by means of comforting, supporting, directing
exhortation, exercises a soothing an calming influence. Regarding רפא,
whence מרפּא, Dietrich in Gesenius' Lex. is right. The root-meaning of
the verb רפא (cognate רפה, to be loose, Hiph. to let go, Hithpa. [Pro
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#009), to show oneself slothful) is, as
the Arab. kindred word rafâ, rafa, raf, rawf (râf) shows, that of
stilling, softening, soothing, whence arises the meaning of healing (for
which the Arab. has ṭabb and 'alkh); the meaning to repair, to mend,
which the Arab. rafâ and rafa have, does not stand in a prior relation
to to heal, as might appear from [Job
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#004), but is a specializing of the
general idea of reficere lying in mitigare, just as the patcher is
called ἀκέστρια = ἠπήτρια,

(Note: Whether ῥάπτειν, explained neither by Curtius nor by Flick,
stands in a relation to it, we leave out of view.)

from ἀκέομαι, which means equally to still and to heal. Since thus in
רפא the meanings of mitigating and of healing are involved, it is plain
that מרפא, as it means healing (the remedy) and at the same time (cf.
θεραπεία, [Rev 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#002)) the preservation
of health, [Pro 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#022); [Pro
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#015); [Pro
16:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#024); [Pro
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#001), so also may mean mildness (here
and [Pro 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#004)), tranquillity ([Pro
14:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#030); [Ecc
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#004), calm patience in contrast to
violent passion), and refreshing ([Pro
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#017)). Oetinger and Hitzig translate
here "medicine;" our translation, "healing (the means of healing)," is
not essentially different from it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 12:19</span></span>

19 The lip of truth endures for ever,

But the lying tongue only while I wink with the eye.

None of the old translators understood the phrase ועד־ארגּיעה; the
Venet. also, which follows Kimchi's first explanation, is incorrect: ἕως
ῥήξεως, till I split (shatter) it (the tongue). Abulwald is nearer the
correct rendering when he takes ארגיעה as a noun = רגע with He parag.
Ahron b. Joseph is better in rendering the phrase by: until I make a
רגע, and quite correct if רגע (from רגע = Arab. raj', which is used of
the swinging of the balance) is taken in the sense of a twinkling of the
eye (Schultens: vibramen); cf. Orelli's Die hebr. Synonyme der Zeit und
Ewigkeit, p. 27f., where the synonyms for a twinkling of the eye, a
moment, are placed together. עד (properly progress) has in this phrase
the meaning, while, so long as, and the cohortative signifies, in
contradistinction to ארגיע, which may also denote an unwilling movement
of the eyelids, a movement proceeding from a free determination, serving
for the measurement of a short space of time, Ewald, 228a. ארגיעה, [Jer
49:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#019); [Jer
50:44](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#044), where Ewald takes כי ארגיעה
(when I...) in the same sense as אד־ארגיעה here, which is more
appropriate than the explanation of Hitzig, who regards כי as opening
the principal clause, and attaches to הרגיע the quite too pregnant
signification "to need (for an action) only a moment." The lip of truth,
i.e., the lip which speaketh truth, endures for ever (for truth, אמת =
אמנתּ, is just the enduring); but the tongue of falsehood is only for a
moment, or a wink of the eye, for it is soon convicted, and with
disgrace brings to silence; for a post-bibl. Aram. proverb says: קוּשׁטא
קאי שׁקרא לא קאי, the truth endures, the lie endures not (Schabbath
104a), and a Hebrew proverb: השּׁקר אין לו רגלים, the lie has no feet
(on which it can stand).

[Proverbs 12:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pro 12:20</span></span>

20 Deceit is in the heart of him who deviseth evil,

But those who devise peace cause joy.

Regarding the figure of forging, fabricating (lxx, Aquila, Symmachus,
and Theodotion, τεκταίνειν), or of ploughing, which underlies the phrase
חרשׁ רע, moliri malum, vid., at [Pro
3:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#029). That deceit is in the heart of
him who deviseth evil (בּלב־חרשׁי רע, as is correctly punctuated e.g.,
by Norzi) appears to be a platitude, for the חרשׁ רע is as such directed
against a neighbour. But in the first place, 20a in itself says that the
evil which a man hatches against another always issues in a fraudulent,
malicious deception of the same; and in the second place, it says, when
taken in connection with 20b, where שׂמחה is the parallel word to מרמה,
that with the deception he always at the same time prepares for him
sorrow. The contrast to חרשׁי רע is יועצי שׁלום si ח, and thus denotes
not those who give counsel to contending parties to conclude peace, but
such as devise peace, viz., in reference to the neighbour, for יעץ means
not merely to impart counsel, but also mentally to devise, to resolve
upon, to decree, [Ch2 25:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#016); [Isa
32:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#007).; cf. יעץ על, [Jer
49:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#030). Hitzig and Zckler give to שׁלום
the general idea of welfare (that which is salutary), and interpret the
שׂמחה as the inner joy of the good conscience. Certainly שלום (R. של,
extrahere, in the sense of deliverance from trouble) means not only
peace as to the external relationship of men with each other, but also
both internal and external welfare. Thus it is here meant of external
welfare; Hitzig rightly compares [Jer
29:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#011) with [Nah
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#011) to the contrast between שׁלום and
רע. But as מרמה is not self-deception, but the deception of another, so
also שׂמחה is not the joy of those who devise the device in their hearts
for the deception of others, but the joy they procure for others.
Thoughts of peace for one's neighbour are always thoughts of procuring
joy for him, as thoughts of evil are thoughts of deceit, and thus of
procuring sorrow for him. Thus וליועצי is an abbreviated expression for
ובלב יועצי.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 12:21</span></span>

21 No evil befalls the righteous,

But the godless are full of evil.

Hitzig translates און "sorrow," and Zckler "injury;" but the word
signifies evil as ethical wickedness, and although it may be used of any
misfortune in general (as in בּן־אוני, opp. בּנימין); thus it denotes
especially such sorrow as is the harvest and product of sin, [Pro
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#008); [Job
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#008); [Isa
59:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#004), or such as brings after it
punishment, [Hab 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#007); [Jer
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#015). That it is also here thus meant
the contrast makes evident. The godless are full of evil, for the moral
evil which is their life-element brings out of itself all kinds of evil;
on the contrary, no kind of evil, such as sin brings forth and produces,
falls upon the righteous. God, as giving form to human fortune ([Exo
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#013)), remains in the background (cf.
[Psa 91:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#010) with [Psa
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#001).); vid., regarding אנה, the weaker
power of ענה, to go against, to meet, to march against, Fleischer,

The frame of the distich is like [Pro
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#001), [Pro
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#020). אמוּנה is probity as the
harmony between the words and the inward thoughts. The lxx, which
translates ὁ δὲ ποιῶν πίστεις, had in view עשה אמונים (עשׂה אמוּנים, cf.
[Isa 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#002)); the text of all other
translations agrees with that commonly received.

[Proverbs 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 12:23</span></span>

23 A prudent man conceals knowledge,

And a heart-fool proclaims imbecility.

In 23a [Pro 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#016) is repeated, only a
little changed; also 16a corresponds with 23a, for, as is there said,
the fool knows not how to keep his anger to himself, as here, that a
heart-fool (cf. the lying mouth, 22a) proclaims (trumpets forth), or as
[Pro 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#016) says, displays folly
without referring to himself the si tacuisses. To this forward charlatan
blustering, which intends to preach wisdom and yet proclaims in the
world mere folly, i.e., nonsense and imbecility, and thereby makes
itself troublesome, and only to be laughed at and despised, stands in
contrast the relation of the אדם ערוּם, homo callidus, who possesses
knowledge, but keeps it to himself without bringing it forth till an
occasion presents itself for setting it forth at the right place, at the
right time, and to the right man. The right motive also regulates such
silence as well as modesty. But this proverb places it under the point
of view of prudence.

We take [Pro 12:24-28](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#024) together as a
group. In these verses the subject is the means of rising (in the
world), and the two ways, the one of which leads to error, and the other
to life.

24 The land of the diligent attains to dominion,

But slothfulness will become tributary.

In [Pro 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#004) רמיּה was adj., but to
כּף standing beside it; here it is to be regarded as adj. to יד
(sluggish hand) supplied from 24a, but may be equally regarded as a
subst. (slothfulness) (vid., at [Pro
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#027)). Regarding חרוּץ, vid., p. 211.
מס signifies tribute and service, i.e., tributary service rendered to a
master. In [Pro 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#029) עבד stands for
it. It is still the experience of to-day, as it was of Solomon's time,
that slothfulness (indolence) brings down to a state of servitude, if
not even deeper, but that vigorous activity raises to dominion or to the
position of a master, i.e., to independence, wealth, respect, and power.

[Proverbs 12:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">pro 12:25</span></span>

25 Trouble in the heart of a man boweth it down,

And a friendly word maketh it glad.

The twofold anomaly that דּאגה is construed as masc. and לב as fem.
renders the text doubtful, but the lxx, Syr., Targum, which introduce
another subject, φοβερὸς λόγος (דּבר מדאיג?), do not improve it;
Theodotion's is preferable, who translates μέριμνα ἐν καρδίᾳ ἀνδρὸς
κατίσχει αὐτόν, and thus reads ישׁחנּוּ. But the rhyme is thereby lost.
As כּבוד, [Gen 49:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#006), so also may לב be
used as fem., for one thereby thinks on נפשׁ; the plur. לבּות (לבבות),
according to which in [Eze 16:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#030) we
find the sing. לבּה, may also conform to this. And ישׁחנה as pred. to
דאגה follows the scheme [Pro 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#010),
perhaps not without attractional co-operation after the scheme קשׁת
גברים חתים, [Sa1 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#004). השׁחה, from
שׁחה, occurs only here; but השׁח, from שׁחח, occurs only twice. דּבר טוב
designates in the book of Joshua and in Kings ([Kg1
8:56](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#056)) the divine promise; here it is
of the same meaning as [Kg1 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#007) : an
appeasing word. Who has not in himself had this experience, how such a
word of friendly encouragement from a sympathizing heart cheers the
sorrowful soul, and, if only for a time, changes its sorrow into the joy
of confidence and of hope!

[Proverbs 12:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">pro 12:26</span></span>

26 The righteous looketh after his pastures,

But the way of the godless leadeth them into error.

In 26a no acceptable meaning is to be gained from the traditional mode
of vocalization. Most of the ancients translate יתר as part. to יתר, as
it occurs in post-bibl. Hebr., e.g., חבּה יתרה, prevailing, altogether
peculiar love. Thus the Targum, טב מן הבריהּ; Venet. πεπερίττευται
(after Kimchi); on the other hand, Aquila, active: περισσεύων τὸν
πλησίον (making the neighbour rich), which the meaning of the Kal as
well as the form יתר oppose; Luther, "The righteous man is better than
his neighbour," according to which Fleischer also explains, "Probably
יתר from יתר, πλεονάζειν, has the meaning of πλέον ἔχων, πλεονεκτῶν, he
gains more honour, respect, riches, etc., than the other, viz., the
unrighteous." Yet more satisfactory Ahron b. Joseph: not the nobility
and the name, but this, that he is righteous, raises a man above others.
In this sense we would approve of the praestantior altero justus, if
only the two parts of the proverb were not by such a rendering wholly
isolated from one another. Thus יתר is to be treated as the fut. of
התיר. The Syr. understands it of right counsel; and in like manner
Schultens explains it, with Cocceius, of intelligent, skilful guidance,
and the moderns (e.g., Gesenius) for the most part of guidance
generally. Ewald rather seeks (because the proverb-style avoids the
placing of a fut. verb at the commencement of the proverb but cf. [Pro
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#010)) to interpret יתר as a noun in
the sense of director, but his justification of the fixed ā is
unfounded. And generally this sense of the word is exposed to many
objections. The verb תּוּר signifies, after its root, to go about, "to
make to go about," but is, however, not equivalent to, to lead
(wherefore Bttcher too ingeniously derives יתר = יאתר from אתר = אשׁר);
and wherefore this strange word, since the Book of Proverbs is so rich
in synonyms of leading and guiding! The Hiph. התיר signifies to send to
spy, [Jdg 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#023), and in this sense the
poet ought to have said יתר לרעהוּ: the righteous spies out (the way)
for his neighbour, he serves him, as the Targum-Talmud would say, as
תּיּר. Thus connected with the obj. accus. the explanation would
certainly be: the righteous searches out his neighbour (Lwenstein), he
has intercourse with men, according to the maxim, "Trau schau wem." But
why not רעהוּ, but מרעהוּ, which occurs only once, [Pro
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#007), in the Mishle, and then for an
evident reason? Therefore, with Dderlein, Dathe, J. D. Michaelis,
Ziegler, and Hitzig, we prefer to read מרעהוּ; it is at least not
necessary, with Hitzig, to change יתר into יתר, since the Hiphil may
have the force of the intens. of the Kal, but יתר without the jussive
signification is a poetic licence for יתיר. That תור can quite well be
used of the exploring of the pasture, the deriv. יתוּר, [Job
39:18](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#018), shows. Thus altered, 26a falls
into an appropriately contrasted relation to 26b. The way of the godless
leads them into error; the course of life to which they have given
themselves up has such a power over them that they cannot set themselves
free from it, and it leads the enslaved into destruction: the righteous,
on the contrary, is free with respect to the way which he takes and the
place where he stays; his view (regard) is directed to his true
advancement, and he looketh after his pasture, i.e., examines and
discovers, where for him right pasture, i.e., the advancement of his
outer and inner life, is to be found. With מרעהוּ there is a combination
of the thought of this verse with the following, whose catch-word is
צידו, his prey.

[Proverbs 12:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 12:27</span></span>

27 The slothful pursues not his prey;

But a precious possession of a man is diligence.

The lxx, Syr., Targ., and Jerome render יחרך in the sense of obtaining
or catching, but the verbal stem חרך nowhere has this meaning. When
Fleischer remarks, חרך, ἅπ. λεγ., probably like לכד, properly to
entangle in a noose, a net, he supports his opinion by reference to
חרכּים, which signifies lattice-windows, properly, woven or knitted like
a net. But חרך, whence this חרכים, appears to be equivalent to the Arab.
kharḳ, fissura, so that the plur. gives the idea of a manifoldly divided
(lattice-like, trellis-formed) window. The Jewish lexicographers
(Menahem, Abulwald, Parchon, also Juda b. Koreish) all aim at that which
is in accord with the meaning of the Aram. חרך, to singe, to roast (=
Arab. ḥark): the slothful roasteth not his prey, whether (as Frst
presents it) because he is too lazy to hunt for it (Berth.), or because
when he has it he prepares it not for enjoyment (Ewald). But to roast is
צלה, not דרך, which is used only of singeing, e.g., the hair, and
roasting, e.g., ears of corn, but not of the roasting of flesh, for
which reason Joseph Kimchi (vid., Kimchi's Lex.) understands צידו of
wild fowls, and יחרך of the singeing of the tips of the wings, so that
they cannot fly away, according to which the Venet. translates οὐ μενεῖ
... ἡ θήρα αὐτοῦ. Thus the Arab. must often help to a right
interpretation of the ἅπ. λεγ.. Schultens is right: Verbum ḥarak, חרך,
apud Arabes est movere, ciere, excitare, κινεῖν generatim, et speciatim
excitare praedam e cubili, κινεῖν τήν θήραν. The Lat. agitare, used of
the frightening up and driving forth of wild beasts, corresponds with
the idea here, as e.g., used by Ovid, Metam. x. 538, of Diana:

Aut pronos lepores aue celsum in cornua cervum

Aut agitat damas.

Thus יחרך together with צידו gains the meaning of hunting, and generally
of catching the prey. רמיּה is here incarnate slothfulness, and thus
without ellipse equivalent to אישׁ רמיה. That in the contrasted clause
חרוץ does not mean ἀποτόμως, decreed (Lwenstein), nor gold (Targ.,
Jerome, Venet.), nor that which is excellent (Syr.), is manifest from
this contrast as well as from [Pro
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#004); [Pro
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#024). The clause has from its
sequence of words something striking about it. The lxx placed the words
in a difference order: κτῆμα δὲ τίμιον ἀνὴρ καθαρὸς (חלוץ in the sense
of Arab. khâlaṣ). But besides this transposition, two others have been
tried: הון אדם חרוץ יקר, the possession of an industrious man is
precious, and הון יקר אדם חרוץ, a precious possession is that (supply
הון) of an industrious man. But the traditional arrangement of the words
gives a better meaning than these modifications. It is not, however, to
be explained, with Ewald and Bertheau: a precious treasure of a man is
one who is industrious, for why should the industrious man be thought of
as a worker for another and not for himself? Another explanation
advanced by Kimchi: a valuable possession to men is industry, has the
twofold advantage that it is according to the existing sequence of the
words, and presents a more intelligible thought. But can חרוּץ have the
meaning of חריצוּת (the being industrious)? Hitzig reads חרוץ, to make
haste (to be industrious). This is unnecessary, for we have here a case
similar to [Pro 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#017), where שׁמר for
שׁומר is to be expected: a precious possession of a man is it that, or
when, he is industrious, חרוּץ briefly for היותו חרוּץ rof yl. The
accentuation fluctuates between והון־אדם יקר (so e.g., Cod. 1294),
according to which the Targum translates, and והון־אדם יקר, which,
according to our explanation, is to be preferred.

[Proverbs 12:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">pro 12:28</span></span>

28 In the path of righteousness is life,

And the way of its path is immortality.

All the old versions to the Venet. give אל־ instead of אל־, and are
therefore under the necessity of extracting from ודּרך נתיבה a meaning
corresponding to this, εἰς θάνατον, in which they are followed by
Hitzig: "a devious way leadeth to death." But נתיב (נתיבה) signifies
step, and generally way and street (vid., at [Pro
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#015)), not "devious way," which is
expressed, [Jdg 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#006), by ארחות עקלקלות.
And that אל is anywhere punctuated thus in the sense of אל is previously
improbable, because the Babylonian system of punctuation distinguishes
the negative אל with a short Pathach, and the prepositional אל (Arab.
ilâ) with a short Chirek, from each other (vid., Pinsker, Einl. p.
xxii.f.); the punctuation [Sa2 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#016);
[Jer 51:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#003), gives no support to the
opinion that here אל is vocalized thus in the sense of אל, and it is not
to be thus corrected. Nothing is more natural than that the Chokma in
its constant contrast between life and death makes a beginning of
expressing the idea of the ἀθανασία, which Aquila erroneously read from
the אל־מות, Ps. 48:15. It has been objected that for the formation of
such negative substantives and noun-adjectives לא (e.g., לא־אל, לא־עם)
and not אל is used; but that אל also may be in close connection with a
noun, [Sa2 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#013) shows. There אל־טל is
equivalent to אל יהי טל, according to which it may also be explained in
the passage before us, with Luther and all the older interpreters, who
accepted אל in its negative signification: and on (the בּ governing) the
way ... is no death. The negative אל frequently stands as an
intensifying of the objective לא; but why should the Chokma, which has
already shown itself bold in the coining of new words, not apply itself
to the formation of the idea of immortality?: the idol name אליל is the
result of a much greater linguistic boldness. It is certain that אל is
here not equivalent to אל; the Masora is therefore right in affirming
that נתיבה is written with He raphatum pro mappicato (vid., Kimchi,
Michlol 31a, and in the Lex.), cf. [Sa1
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#020), vid., Bttcher, 418. Thus: the
way of their step is immortality, or much rather, since דּרך is not a
fixed idea, but also denotes the going to a distance (i.e., the
journey), the behaviour, the proceeding, the walk, etc.: the walking
(the stepping over and passing through) of their way is immortality.
Rich in synonyms of the way, the Hebrew style delights in connecting
them with picturesque expressions; but דּרך always means the way in
general, which divides into ארחות or נתיבות ([Job
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#018); [Jer
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#005)), and consists of such ([Isa
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#016)). The distich is synonymous: on
the path of righteousness (accentuate בארח צדקה) is life meeting him who
walks in it, and giving itself to him as a possession, and the walking
in its path is immortality (cf. [Pro
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#017); [Pro
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#028)); so that to go in it and to be
immortal, i.e., to be delivered from death, to be exalted above it, is
one and the same thing. If we compare with this, [Sa1
14:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#032), it is obvious that the Chokma
begins (vid., Psychol. p. 410) to break through the limits of this
present life, and to announce a life beyond the reach of death.
