### [2 Chronicles Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 2:1</span></span>

(1:18). The account of these is introduced by 1:18: "Solomon thought to
build." אמר with an infinitive following does not signify here to
command one to do anything, as e.g., in [Ch1
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#017), but to purpose to do something,
as e.g., in [Kg1 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#005). For יהוה לשׁם,
see on [Kg1 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#017). למלכוּתו בּית, house
for his kingdom, i.e., the royal palace. The building of this palace is
indeed shortly spoken of in [Ch2 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#011);
[Ch2 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#011), and [Ch2
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#001), but is not in the Chronicle
described in detail as in [Kg1 7:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#001).

(2:1). With [Ch2 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#001) begins the
account of the preparations which Solomon made for the erection of these
buildings, especially of the temple building, accompanied by a statement
that the king caused all the workmen of the necessary sort in his
kingdom to be numbered. There follows thereafter an account of the
negotiations with King Hiram of Tyre in regard to the sending of a
skilful architect, and of the necessary materials, such as cedar wood
and hewn stones, from Lebanon ([Ch2
2:2-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#002)); and, in conclusion, the
statements as to the levying of the statute labourers of Israel ([Ch2
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#001)) are repeated and rendered more
complete ([Ch2 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#016), [Ch2
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#017)). If we compare the parallel
account in [Kg1 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#005)., we find that
Solomon's negotiation with Hiram about the proposed buildings is
preceded ([Kg1 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#005)) by a notice, that
Hiram, after he had heard of Solomon's accession, had sent him an
embassy to congratulate him. This notice is omitted in the Chronicle,
because it was of no importance in the negotiations which succeeded. In
the account of Solomon's negotiation with Hiram, both narratives ([Ch2
2:2-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#002) and [Kg1
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#016).) agree in the main, but differ
in form so considerably, that it is manifest that they are free
adaptations of one common original document, quite independent of each
other, as has been already remarked on [Kg1
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#005). On [Ch2
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#002) see further on [Kg1
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#015).

[2 Chronicles 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 2:3</span></span>

(2:2-9). Solomon, through his ambassadors, addressed himself to Huram
king of Tyre, with the request that he would send him an architect and
building wood for the temple. On the Tyrian king Huram or Hiram, the
contemporary of David and Solomon, see the discussion on [Sa2
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#011). According to the account in 1
Kings 5, Solomon asked cedar wood from Lebanon from Hiram; according to
our account, which is more exact, he desired an architect, and cedar,
cypress, and other wood. In 1 Kings 5 the motive of Solomon's request is
given in the communication to Hiram, viz., that David could not carry
out the building of the proposed temple on account of his wars, but that
Jahve had given him (Solomon) rest and peace, so that he now, in
accordance with the divine promise to David, desired to carry on the
building ([Kg1 5:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#003)). In the [Ch2
2:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#002), on the contrary, Solomon
reminds the Tyrian king of the friendliness with which he had supplied
his father David with cedar wood for his palace, and then announces to
him his purpose to build a temple to the Lord, at the same time stating
that it was designed for the worship of God, whom the heavens and the
earth cannot contain. It is clear, therefore, that both authors have
expanded the fundamental thoughts of their authority in somewhat freer
fashion. The apodosis of the clause beginning with כּאשׁר is wanting,
and the sentence is an anacolouthon. The apodosis should be: "do so also
for me, and send me cedars." This latter clause follows in [Ch2
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#006), [Ch2
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#007), while the first can easily be
supplied, as is done e.g., in the Vulg., by sic fac mecum.

[Ch2 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#004)

"Behold, I will build." הנּה with a participle of that which is
imminent, what one intends to do. לו להקדּישׁ, to sanctify (the house)
to Him. The infinitive clause which follows (וגו להקטיר) defines more
clearly the design of the temple. The temple is to be consecrated by
worshipping Him there in the manner prescribed, by burning incense, etc.
סמּים קטרת, incense of odours, [Exo
25:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#006), which was burnt every morning
and evening on the altar of incense, [Exo
30:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#007). The clauses which follow are to
be connected by zeugma with להקטיר, i.e., the verbs corresponding to the
objects are to be supplied from הקטיר: "and to spread the continual
spreading of bread" ([Exo 25:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#030)), and
to offer burnt-offerings, as is prescribed in Num 28 and 29. וגו זאת
לעולם, for ever is this enjoined upon Israel, cf. [Ch1
23:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#031).

[Ch2 2:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#005)

In order properly to worship Jahve by these sacrifices, the temple must
be large, because Jahve is greater than all gods; cf. [Exo
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#011); [Deu
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#017).

No one is able (כּוח עצר as in [Ch1
29:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#014)) to build a house in which this
God could dwell, for the heaven of heavens cannot contain Him. These
words are a reminiscence of Solomon's prayer ([Kg1
8:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#027); [Ch2
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#018)). How should I (Solomon) be able
to build Him a house, scil. that He should dwell therein? In connection
with this, there then comes the thought: and that is not my purpose, but
only to offer incense before Him will I build a temple. הקטיר is used as
pars pro toto, to designate the whole worship of the Lord. After this
declaration of the purpose, there follows in [Deu
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#006) the request that he would send
him for this end a skilful chief workman, and the necessary material,
viz., costly woods. The chief workman was to be a man wise to work in
gold, silver, etc. According to [Ch2
4:11-16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#011) and [Kg1
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#013)., he prepared the brazen and
metal work, and the vessels of the temple; here, on the contrary, and in
[Ch2 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#013) also, he is described as a
man who was skilful also in purple weaving, and in stone and wood work,
to denote that he was an artificer who could take charge of all the
artistic work connected with the building of the temple. To indicate
this, all the costly materials which were to be employed for the temple
and its vessels are enumerated. ארגּון, the later form of ארגּמן,
deep-red purple, see on [Exo 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#004).
כּרמיל, occurring only here, [Ch2 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#006),
[Ch2 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#013), and in [Ch2
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#014), in the signification of the Heb.
שׁני תּולעת, crimson or scarlet purple, see on [Exo
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#004). It is not originally a Hebrew
word, but is probably derived from the Old-Persian, and has been
imported, along with the thing itself, from Persia by the Hebrews.
תּכלת, deep-blue purple, hyacinth purple, see on [Exo
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#004). פּתּוּהים פּתּח, to make
engraved work, and [Exo 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#009), [Exo
28:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#011), [Exo
28:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#036), and [Exo
39:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#006), of engraving precious stones,
but used here, as כּל־פּתּוּח, [Ch2
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#013), shows, in the general
signification of engraved work in metal or carved work in wood; cf. [Kg1
6:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#029). עם־החכמים depends upon לעשׂות:
to work in gold ..., together with the wise (skilful) men which are with
me in Judah. הכין אשׁר, quos comparavit, cf. [Ch1
28:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#021); [Ch1
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#015).

[Ch2 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#007)

The materials Hiram was to send were cedar, cypress, and algummim wood
from Lebanon. אלגוּמים, [Ch2 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#007) and
[Ch2 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#010), instead of אלמגּים, [Kg1
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#011), probably means sandal wood,
which was employed in the temple, according to [Kg1
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#012), for stairs and musical
instruments, and is therefore mentioned here, although it did not grow
in Lebanon, but, according to [Kg1
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#010) and [Kg1
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#011), was procured at Ophir. Here, in
our enumeration, it is inexactly grouped along with the cedars and
cypresses brought from Lebanon.

[Ch2 2:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#008)

The infinitive וּלהכין cannot be regarded as the continuation of לכרות,
nor is it a continuation of the imperat. לי שׁלח ([Ch2
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#007)), with the signification, "and let
there be prepared for me" (Berth.). It is subordinated to the preceding
clauses: send me cedars, which thy people who are skilful in the matter
hew, and in that my servants will assist, in order, viz., to prepare me
building timber in plenty (the ו is explic). On [Ch2
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#008) cf. [Ch2
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#004). The infin. abs. הפלא is used
adverbially: "wonderfully" (Ew. 280, c). In return, Solomon promises to
supply the Tyrian workmen with grain, wine, and oil for their
maintenance - a circumstance which is omitted in [Kg1
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#010); see on [Ch2
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#014). להטבים is more closely defined
by העצים לכרתי, and ל is the introductory ל: "and behold, as to the
hewers, the fellers of trees." חטב, to hew (wood), and to dress it ([Deu
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#010); [Jos
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#021), [Jos
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#023)), would seem to have been
supplanted by חצב, which in [Ch2 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#002),
[Ch2 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#018) is used for it, and it is
therefore explained by העצים כּרת. "I will give wheat מכּות to thy
servants" (the hewers of wood). The word מכּות gives no suitable sense;
for "wheat of the strokes," for threshed wheat, would be a very
extraordinary expression, even apart from the facts that wheat, which is
always reckoned by measure, is as a matter of course supposed to be
threshed, and that no such addition is made use of with the barley.
מכּות is probably only an orthographical error for מכּלת, food, as may
be seen from [Kg1 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#011).

[2 Chronicles 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 2:11</span></span>

The answer of King Hiram; cf. [Kg1
5:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#007). - Hiram answered בּכתב, in a
writing, a letter, which he sent to Solomon. In [Kg1
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#007) Hiram first expresses his joy at
Solomon's request, because it was of importance to him to be on a
friendly footing with the king of Israel. In the Chronicle his writing
begins with the congratulation: because Jahve loveth His people, hath He
made thee king over them. Cf. for the expression, [Ch2
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#008) and [Kg1
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#009). He then, according to both
narratives, praises God that He has given David so wise a son. ויּאמר,
[Ch2 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#012), means: then he said
further. The praise of God is heightened in the Chronicle by Hiram's
entering into Solomon's religious ideas, calling Jahve the Creator of
heaven and earth. Then, further, חכם בּן is strengthened by וּבינה שׂכל
יודע, having understanding and discernment; and this predicate is
specially referred to Solomon's resolve to build a temple to the Lord.
Then in [Ch2 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#013). he promises to send
Solomon the artificer Huram-Abi. On the title אבי, my father, i.e.,
minister, counsellor, and the descent of this man, cf. the commentary on
[Kg1 7:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#013). In [Ch2
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#014) of the Chronicle his artistic
skill is described in terms coinciding with Solomon's wish in [Ch2
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#006), only heightened by small
additions. To the metals as materials in which he could work, there are
added stone and wood work, and to the woven fabrics בּוּץ (byssus), the
later word for שׁשׁ; and finally, to exhaust the whole, he is said to be
able כּל־מח ולחשׁב, to devise all manner of devices which shall be put
to him, as in [Exo 31:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#004), he being thus
raised to the level of Bezaleel, the chief artificer of the tabernacle.
עם־חכמיך is dependent upon לעשׂות, as in [Ch2
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#006). The promise to send cedars and
cypresses is for the sake of brevity here omitted, and only indirectly
indicated in [Ch2 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#016). In [Ch2
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#015), however, it is mentioned that
Hiram accepted the promised supply of grain, wine, and oil for the
labourers; and [Ch2 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#016) closes with
the promise to fell the wood required in Lebanon, and to cause it to be
sent in floats to Joppa (Jaffa), whence Solomon could take it up to
Jerusalem. The word צרך, "need," is a ἅπαξ λεγ. in the Old Testament,
but is very common in Aramaic writings. רפסדות, "floats," too, occurs
only here instead of דּבבות, [Kg1 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#009),
and its etymology is unknown. If we compare [Kg1
5:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#013) with the parallel account in
[Kg1 5:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#008), we find that, besides
Hiram's somewhat verbose promise to fell the desired quantity of cedars
and cypresses on Lebanon, and to send them in floats by sea to the place
appointed by Solomon, the latter contains a request from Hiram that
Solomon would give him לחם, maintenance for his house, and a concluding
remark that Hiram sent Solomon cedar wood, while Solomon gave Hiram,
year by year, 20,000 kor of wheat as food for his house, i.e., the royal
household, and twenty kor beaten oil, that is, of the finest oil. In the
book of Kings, therefore, the promised wages of grain, wine, and oil,
which were sent to the Tyrian woodcutters, is passed over, and only the
quantity of wheat and finest oil which Solomon gave to the Tyrian king
for his household, year by year, in return for the timber sent, is
mentioned. In the Chronicle, on the contrary, only the wages or payment
to the woodcutters is mentioned, and the return made for the building
timber is not spoken of; but there is no reason for bringing these two
passages, which treat of different things, into harmony by alterations
of the text. For further discussion of this and of the measures, see on
[Kg1 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#011).

[2 Chronicles 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch2 2:17</span></span>

In [Ch2 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#017) and [Ch2
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#018) the short statement in [Ch2
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#002) as to Solomon's statute labourers
is again taken up and expanded. Solomon caused all the men to be
numbered who dwelt in the land of Israel as strangers, viz., the
descendants of the Canaanites who were not exterminated, "according to
the numbering (ספר occurs only here) as his father David had numbered
them." This remark refers to [Ch1
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#002), where, however, it is only said
that David commanded the strangers to be assembled. But as he caused
them to be assembled in order to secure labourers for the building of
the temple, he doubtless caused them to be numbered; and to this
reference is here made. The numbering gave a total of 153,000 men, of
whom 70,000 were made bearers of burdens, 80,000 חצב, i.e., probably
hewers of stone and wood בּהר, i.e., on Lebanon, and 3600 foremen or
overseers over the workmen, את־העם להעביד, to cause the people to work,
that is, to hold them to their task. With this cf. [Kg1
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#015)., where the number of the
overseers is stated at 3300. This difference is explained by the fact
that in the Chronicle the total number of overseers, of higher and lower
rank, is given, while in the book of Kings only the number of overseers
of the lower rank is given without the higher overseers. Solomon had in
all 550 higher overseers of the builders (Israelite and Canaanite), -
cf. [Kg1 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#023); and of these, 250 were
Israelites, who alone are mentioned in [Ch2
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#010), while the remaining 300 were
Canaanites. The total number of overseers is the same in both accounts,
- 3850; who are divided in the Chronicle into 3600 Canaanitish and 250
Israelitish, in the book of Kings into 3300 lower and 550 higher
overseers (see on [Kg1 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#016)). It is,
moreover, stated in [Kg1 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#012). that
Solomon had levied a force of 30,000 statute labourers from among the
people of Israel, with the design that a third part of them, that is,
10,000 men, should labour alternately for a month at a time in Lebanon,
looking after their own affairs at home during the two following months.
This levy of workmen from among the people of Israel is not mentioned in
the Chronicle.
