<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#001">Zac 6:1</A>. "And again I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold four chariots coming forth between the two mountains, and the mountains were mountains of brass. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#002">Zac 6:2</A>. In the first chariot were red horses, and in the second chariot black horses. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#003">Zac 6:3</A>. And in the third chariot white horses, and in the fourth chariot speckled powerful horses. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#004">Zac 6:4</A>. And I answered and said to the angel that talked with me, What are these, my lord? <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#005">Zac 6:5</A>. And the angel answered and said to me, These are the four winds of heaven going out, after having stationed themselves by the Lord of the whole earth. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#006">Zac 6:6</A>. Those in which the black horses are, go out into the land of the north, and the white have gone out behind them, and the speckled have gone out into the land of the south. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#007">Zac 6:7</A>. And the powerful ones have gone out, and sought to go, to pass through the earth; and he said, Go ye, and pass through the earth; and they passed through the earth. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#008">Zac 6:8</A>. And he called to me, and spake to me thus: Behold, those which go out into the land of the north let down my spirit in the land of the north." The four chariots are explained in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#005">Zac 6:5</A> by the interpreting angel to be the four winds of heaven, which go forth after they have taken their stand by the Lord of the whole earth, i.e., have appeared before Him in the attitude of servants, to lay their account before Him, and to receive commands from Him (&#1492;&#1514;&#1497;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489; &#1506;&#1500;, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#006">Job 1:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#001">Job 2:1</A>). This addition shows that the explanation is not a real interpretation; that is to say, the meaning is not that the chariots represent the four winds; but the less obvious figure of the chariots is explained through the more obvious figure of the winds, which answers better to the reality. Since, for example, according to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#008">Zac 6:8</A>, the chariots are designed to carry the Spirit (ru&#772;a&#774;ch) of God, there was nothing with which they could be more suitably compared than the winds (ru&#772;a&#774;ch) of heaven, for these are the most appropriate earthly substratum to symbolize the working of the Divine Spirit (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#036">Jer 49:36</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#002">Dan 7:2</A>). This Spirit, in its judicial operations, is to be borne by the chariots to the places more immediately designated in the vision. As they go out, after having appeared before God, the two mountains, between which they go out or come forth, can only be sought in the place where God's dwelling is. But the mountains are of brass, and therefore are not earthly mountains; but they are not therefore mere symbols of the might of God with which His church is defended (Hengst., Neumann), or allusions to the fact that the dwelling-place of God is immovable and unapproachable (Koehler), or symbols of the imperial power of the world and the kingdom of God (Kliefoth), according to which the power of the world would be just as immovable as the kingdom of God. The symbol has rather a definite geographical view as its basis. As the lands to which the chariots go are described geographically as the lands of the north and south, the starting-point of the chariots must also be thought of geographically, and must therefore be a place or country lying between the northern and southern lands: this is the land of Israel, or more especially Jerusalem, the centre of the Old Testament kingdom of God, where the Lord had His dwelling-place. It is therefore the view of Jerusalem and its situation that lies at the foundation of the vision; only we must not think of the mountains Zion and Moriah (as Osiander, Maurer, Hofmann, and Umbreit do), for these are never distinguished from one another in the Old Testament as forming two separate mountains; but we have rather to think of Zion and the Mount of Olives, which stood opposite to it towards the east. Both are named as places where or from which the Lord judges the world, viz., the Mount of Olives in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#004">Zac 14:4</A>, and Zion very frequently, e.g., in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#016">Joe 3:16</A>. The place between the two mountains is, then, the valley of Jehoshaphat, in which, according to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#002">Joe 3:2</A>., the Lord judges the nations. In the vision before us this valley simply forms the starting-point for the chariots, which carry the judgment from the dwelling-place of God into the lands of the north and south, which are mentioned as the seat of the imperial power; and the mountains are of brass, to denote the immovable firmness of the place where the Lord dwells, and where He has founded His kingdom.
<p>The colour of the horses, by which the four chariots are distinguished, is just as significant here as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#008">Zac 1:8</A>; and indeed, so far as the colour is the same, the meaning is also the same here as there. Three colours are alike, since berudd&#305;&#772;m, speckled, is not essentially different from seruqq&#305;&#772;m, starling-grey, viz., black and white mixed together (see at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#008">Zac 1:8</A>). The black horses are added here. Black is the colour of grief (cf. "black as sackcloth of hair," <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#012">Rev 6:12</A>). The rider upon the black horse in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#005">Rev 6:5-6</A>, holds in his hand the emblem of dearness, the milder form of famine. Consequently the colours of the horses indicate the destination of the chariots, to execute judgment upon the enemies of the kingdom of God. Red, as the colour of blood, points to war and bloodshed; the speckled colour to pestilence and other fatal plagues; and the black colour to dearness and famine: so that these three chariots symbolize the three great judgments, war, pestilence, and hunger (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#011">Sa2 24:11</A>.), along with which "the noisome beast" is also mentioned in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#021">Eze 14:21</A> as a fourth judgment. In the vision before us the fourth chariot is drawn by white horses, to point to the glorious victories of the ministers of the divine judgment. The explanation of the chariots in this vision is rendered more difficult by the fact, that on the one hand the horses of the fourth chariot are not only called berudd&#305;&#772;m, but &#1488;&#1502;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; also; and on the other hand, that in the account of the starting of the chariots the red horses are omitted, and the speckled are distinguished from the &#1488;&#1502;&#1513;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501; instead, inasmuch as it is affirmed of the former that they went forth into the south country, and of the latter, that "they sought to go that they might pass through the whole earth," and they passed through with the consent of God. The commentators have therefore attempted in different ways to identify &#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1513;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501; in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#007">Zac 6:7</A> with &#1488;&#1491;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;. Hitzig and Maurer assume that &#1488;&#1502;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501; is omitted from <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#006">Zac 6:6</A> by mistake, and that &#1488;&#1502;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501; in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#007">Zac 6:7</A> is a copyist's error for &#1488;&#1491;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, although there is not a single critical authority that can be adduced in support of this. Hengstenberg and Umbreit suppose that the predicate &#1488;&#1502;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, strong, in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#003">Zac 6:3</A> refers to all the horses in the four chariots, and that by the "strong" horses of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#007">Zac 6:7</A> we are to understand the "red" horses of the first chariot. But if the horses of all the chariots were strong, the red alone cannot be so called, since the article not only stands before &#1488;&#1502;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#007">Zac 6:7</A>, but also before the three other colours, and indicates nothing more than that the colours have been mentioned before. Moreover, it is grammatically impossible that &#1488;&#1502;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#003">Zac 6:3</A> should refer to all the four teams; as "we must in that case have had &#1488;&#1502;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501;" (Koehler). Others (e.g., Abulw., Kimchi, Calvin, and Koehler) have attempted to prove that &#1488;&#1502;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; taht evo may have the sense of &#1488;&#1491;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;; regarding &#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509; as a softened form of &#1495;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;, and explaining the latter, after <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#001">Isa 63:1</A>, as signifying bright red. But apart from the fact that it is impossible to see why so unusual a word should have been chosen in the place of the intelligible word 'a&#774;dumm&#305;&#772;m in the account of the destination of the red team in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#007">Zac 6:7</A>, unless &#1488;&#1502;&#1513;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501; were merely a copyist's error for 'a&#774;dumm&#305;&#772;m, there are no satisfactory grounds for identifying &#1488;&#1502;&#1509; with &#1495;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;, since it is impossible to adduce any well-established examples of the change of &#1495; into &#1488; in Hebrew. The assertion of Koehler, that the Chaldee verb &#1488;&#1500;&#1501;, robustus fuit, is &#1495;&#1500;&#1501; in Hebrew in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#004">Job 39:4</A>, is incorrect; for we find &#1495;&#1500;&#1501; in the sense of to be healthy and strong in the Syriac and Talmudic as well, and the Chaldaic &#1488;&#1500;&#1501; is a softened form of &#1506;&#1500;&#1501;, and not of &#1495;&#1500;&#1501;. The fact that in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#035">Ch1 8:35</A> we have the name &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1506; in the place of &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1512;&#1506; in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#041">Ch1 9:41</A>, being the only instance of the interchange of &#1488; and &#1495; in Hebrew, is not sufficient of itself to sustain the alteration, amidst the great mass of various readings in the genealogies of the Chronicles. Moreover, cha&#770;mu&#772;ts, from cha&#770;me&#772;ts, to be sharp, does not mean red (= 'a&#770;do&#772;m), but a glaring colour, like the Greek &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c2;; and even in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#001">Isa 63:1</A> it has simply this meaning, i.e., merely "denotes the unusual redness of the dress, which does not look like the purple of a king's talar, or the scarlet of a chlamys" (Delitzsch); or, speaking more correctly, it merely denotes the glaring colour which the dress has acquired through being sprinkled over with red spots, arising either from the dark juice of the grape or from blood. All that remains therefore is to acknowledge, in accordance with the words of the text, that in the interpretation of the vision the departure of the team with the red horses is omitted, and the team with speckled powerful horses divided into two teams - one with speckled horses, and the other with black.
<p>We cannot find any support in this for the interpretation of the four chariots as denoting the four imperial monarchies of Daniel, since neither the fact that there are four chariots nor the colour of the teams furnishes any tenable ground for this. And it is precluded by the angel's comparison of the four chariots to the four winds, which point to four quarters of the globe, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#036">Jer 49:36</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#002">Dan 7:2</A>, but not to four empires rising one after another, one of which always took the place of the other, so that they embraced the same lands, and were merely distinguished from one another by the fact that each in succession spread over a wider surface than its predecessor. The colour of the horses also does not favour, but rather opposes, any reference to the four great empires. Leaving out of sight the arguments already adduced at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#008">Zac 1:8</A> against this interpretation, Kliefoth himself admits that, so far as the horses and their colour are concerned, there is a thorough contrast between this vision and the first one (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#007">Zac 1:7-17</A>), - namely, that in the first vision the colour assigned to the horses corresponds to the kingdoms of the world to which they are sent, whereas in the vision before us they have the colour of the kingdoms from which they set out to convey the judgment to the others; and he endeavours to explain this distinction, by saying that in the first vision the riders procure information from the different kingdoms of the world as to their actual condition, whereas in the vision before us the chariots have to convey the judgment to the kingdoms of the world. But this distinction furnishes no tenable ground for interpreting the colour of the horses in the one case in accordance with the object of their mission, and in the other case in accordance with their origin or starting-point. If the intention was to set forth the stamp of the kingdoms in the colours, they would correspond in both visions to the kingdoms upon or in which the riders and the chariots had to perform their mission. If, on the other hand, the colour is regulated by the nature and object of the vision, so that these are indicated by it, it cannot exhibit the character of the great empires.
<p>If we look still further at the statement of the angel as to the destination of the chariots, the two attempts made by Hofmann and Kliefoth to combine the colours of the horses with the empires, show most distinctly the untenable character of this view. According to both these expositors, the angel says nothing about the chariot with the red horses, because the Babylonian empire had accomplished its mission to destroy the Assyrian empire. But the Perso-Median empire had also accomplished its mission to destroy the Babylonian, and therefore the team with the black horses should also have been left unnoticed in the explanation. On the other hand, Kliefoth asserts, and appeals to the participle &#1497;&#1510;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#006">Zac 6:6</A> in support of his assertion, that the chariot with the horses of the imperial monarchy of Medo-Persia goes to the north country, viz., Mesopotamia, the seat of Babel, to convey the judgment of God thither; that the judgment was at that very time in process of execution, and the chariot was going in the prophet's own day. But although the revolt of Babylon in the time of Darius, and its result, furnish an apparent proof that the power of the Babylonian empire was not yet completely destroyed in Zechariah's time, this intimation cannot lie in the participle as expressing what is actually in process, for the simple reason that in that case the perfects &#1497;&#1510;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; which follow would necessarily affirm what had already taken place; and consequently not only would the white horses, which went out behind the black, i.e., the horses of the imperial monarchy of Macedonia, have executed the judgment upon the Persian empire, but the speckled horses would have accomplished their mission also, since the same &#1497;&#1510;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; is affirmed of both. The interchange of the participle with the perfect does not point to any difference in the time at which the events occur, but simply expresses a distinction in the idea. In the clause with &#1497;&#1510;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; the mission of the chariot is expressed through the medium of the participle, according to its idea. The expression "the black horses are going out" is equivalent to, "they are appointed to go out;" whereas in the following clauses with &#1497;&#1510;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; the going out is expressed in the form of a fact, for which we should use the present.
<p>A still greater difficulty lies in the way of the interpretation of the colours of the horses as denoting the great empires, from the statement concerning the places to which the teams go forth. Kliefoth finds the reason why not only the black horses (of the Medo-Persian monarchy), but also the white horses (of the Graeco-Macedonian), go forth to the north country (Mesopotamia), but the latter after the former, in the fact that not only the Babylonian empire had its seat there, but the Medo-Persian empire also. But how does the going forth of the speckled horses into the south country (Egypt) agree with this? If the fourth chariot answered to the fourth empire in Daniel, i.e., to the Roman empire, since this empire executed the judgment upon the Graeco-Macedonian monarchy, this chariot must of necessity have gone forth to the seat of that monarchy. But that was not Egypt, the south country, but Central Asia or Babylon, where Alexander died in the midst of his endeavours to give a firm foundation to his monarchy. In order to explain the going out of the (fourth) chariot with the speckled horses into the south country, Hofmann inserts between the Graeco-Macedonian monarchy and the Roman the empire of Antiochus Epiphanes as a small intermediate empire, which is indicated by the speckled horses, and thereby brings Zechariah into contradiction not only with Daniel's description of the empires, but also with the historical circumstances, according to which, as Kliefoth has already observed, "Antiochus Epiphanes and his power had not the importance of an imperial monarchy, but were merely an offshoot of another imperial monarchy, namely the Graeco-Macedonian."
<p>(Note: Kliefoth (Sach. p. 90) adds, by way of still further argument in support of the above: "The way in which Antiochus Epiphanes is introduced in Daniel 8 is in perfect accordance with these historical circumstances. The third monarchy, the Graeco-Macedonian, represented as a he-goat, destroys the Medo-Persian empire; but its first great horn, Alexander, breaks off in the midst of its victorious career: four horns of kingdoms grow out of the Graeco-Macedonian, and one of these offshoots of the Macedonian empire is Antiochus Epiphanes, the 'little horn,' the bold and artful king." But Zechariah would no more agree with this description in Daniel than with the historical fulfilment, if he had intended the speckled horses to represent Antiochus Epiphanes. For whereas, like Daniel, he enumerates four imperial monarchies, he makes the spotted horses appear not with the third chariot, but with the fourth, and expressly combines the spotted horses with the powerful ones, which, even according to Hofmann, were intended to indicate the Romans, and therefore unquestionably connects the spotted horses with the Roman empire. If, then, he wished the spotted horses to be understood as referring to Antiochus Epiphanes, he would represent Antiochus Epiphanes not as an offshoot of the third or Graeco-Macedonian monarchy, but as the first member of the fourth or Roman, in direct contradiction to the book of Daniel and to the historical order of events.)
<p>Kliefoth's attempt to remove this difficulty is also a failure. Understanding by the spotted strong horses the Roman empire, he explains the separation of the spotted from the powerful horses in the angel's interpretation from the peculiar character of the imperial monarchy of Rome, - namely, that it will first of all appear as an actual and united empire, but will then break up into ten kingdoms, i.e., into a plurality of kingdoms embracing the whole earth, and finally pass over into the kingdom of Antichrist. Accordingly, the spotted horses go out first of all, and carry the spirit of wrath to the south country, Egypt, which comes into consideration as the kingdom of the Ptolemies, and as that most vigorous offshoot of the Graeco-Macedonian monarchy, which survived Antiochus Epiphanes himself. The powerful horses harnessed to the same chariot as the Roman horses go out after this, and wander over the whole earth. They are the divided kingdoms of Daniel springing out of the Roman empire, which are called the powerful ones, not only because they go over the whole earth, but also because Antichrist with his kingdom springs out of them, to convey the judgments of God over the whole earth. But however skilful this interpretation is, it founders on the fact, that it fails to explain the going forth of the speckled horses into the land of the south in a manner corresponding to the object of the vision and the historical circumstances. If the vision represented the judgment, which falls upon the empires in such a manner that the one kingdom destroys or breaks up the other, the speckled horses, which are intended to represent the actual and united Roman empire, would of necessity have gone out not merely into the south country, but into the north country also, because the Roman empire conquered and destroyed not only the one offshoot of the Graeco-Macedonian empire, but all the kingdoms that sprang out of that empire. Kliefoth has given no reason for the exclusive reference to the southern branch of this imperial monarchy, nor can any reason be found. The kingdom of the Ptolemies neither broke up the other kingdoms that sprang out of the monarchy of Alexander, nor received them into itself, so that it could be mentioned as pars pro toto, and it had no such importance in relation to the holy land and nation as that it could be referred to on that account. If the angel had simply wished to mention a vigorous offshoot of the Graeco-Macedonian empire instead of mentioning the whole, he would certainly have fixed his eye upon the kingdom of the Seleucidae, which developed itself in Antiochus Epiphanes into a type of Antichrist, and have let the speckled horses also go to the north, i.e., to Syria. This could have been explained by referring to Daniel; but not their going forth to the south country from the fact that the south country is mentioned in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#005">Dan 11:5</A>, as Kliefoth supposes, inasmuch as in this prophecy of Daniel not only the king of the south, but the king of the north is also mentioned, and that long-continued conflict between the two described, which inflicted such grievous injury upon the holy land.
<p>To obtain a simple explanation of the vision, we must consider, above all things, that in all these visions the interpretations of the angel do not furnish a complete explanation of all the separate details of the vision, but simply hints and expositions of certain leading features, from which the meaning of the whole may be gathered. This is the case here. All the commentators have noticed the fact, that the statement in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#008">Zac 6:8</A> concerning the horses going forth into the north country, viz., that they carry the Spirit of Jehovah thither, also applies to the rest of the teams - namely, that they also carry the Spirit of Jehovah to the place to which they go forth. It is also admitted that the angel confines himself to interpreting single features by individualizing. This is the case here with regard to the two lands to which the chariots go forth. The land of the north, i.e., the territory covered by the lands of the Euphrates and Tigris, and the land of the south, i.e., Egypt, are mentioned as the two principal seats of the power of the world in its hostility to Israel: Egypt on the one hand, and Asshur-Babel on the other, which were the principal foes of the people of God, not only before the captivity, but also afterwards, in the conflicts between Syria and Egypt for the possession of Palestine (Daniel 11). If we observe this combination, the hypothesis that our vision depicts the fate of the four imperial monarchies, is deprived of all support. Two chariots go into the north country, which is one representative of the heathen world-power: viz., first of all the black horses, to carry famine thither, as one of the great plagues of God with which the ungodly are punished: a plague which is felt all the more painfully, in proportion to the luxury and excess in which men have previously lived. Then follow the white horses, indicating that the judgment will lead to complete victory over the power of the world. Into the south country, i.e., to Egypt, the other representative of the heathen world-power, goes the chariot with the speckled horses, to carry the manifold judgment of death by sword, famine, and pestilence, which is indicated by this colour. After what has been said concerning the team that went forth into the north country, it follows as a matter of course that this judgment will also execute the will of the Lord, so that it is quite sufficient for a chariot to be mentioned. On the other hand, it was evidently important to guard against the opinion that the judgment would only affect the two countries or kingdoms that are specially mentioned, and to give distinct prominence to the fact that they are only representatives of the heathen world, and that what is here announced applies to the whole world that is at enmity against God. This is done through the explanation in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#007">Zac 6:7</A> concerning the going out of a fourth team, to pass through the whole earth. This mission is not received by the red horses, but by the powerful ones, as the speckled horses are also called in the vision, to indicate that the manifold judgments indicated by the speckled horses will pass over the earth in all their force. The going forth of the red horses is not mentioned, simply because, according to the analogy of what has been said concerning the other teams, there could be no doubt about it, as the blood-red colour pointed clearly enough to the shedding of blood. The object of the going forth of the chariots is to let down the Spirit of Jehovah upon the land in question. &#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1495; &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; &#1497;&#1497;, to cause the Spirit of Jehovah to rest, i.e., to let it down, is not identical with &#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1495; &#1495;&#1502;&#1514;&#1493;, to let out His wrath, in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#013">Eze 5:13</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#042">Eze 16:42</A>; for ru&#772;a&#774;ch is not equivalent to che&#772;ma&#770;h, wrath or fury; but the Spirit of Jehovah is ru&#772;a&#774;ch mishpa&#770;t (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#004">Isa 4:4</A>), a spirit of judgment, which not only destroys what is ungodly, but also quickens and invigorates what is related to God. The vision does not set forth the destruction of the world-power, which is at enmity against God, but simply the judgment by which God purifies the sinful world, exterminates all that is ungodly, and renews it by His Spirit. It is also to be observed, that <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#006">Zac 6:6</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#007">Zac 6:7</A> are a continuation of the address of the angel, and not an explanation given by the prophet of what has been said by the angel in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#005">Zac 6:5</A>. The construction in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#006">Zac 6:6</A> is anakolouthic, the horses being made the subject in &#1497;&#1510;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;, instead of the chariot with black horses, because the significance of the chariots lay in the horses. The object to &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#007">Zac 6:7</A> is "the Lord of the whole earth" in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#005">Zac 6:5</A>, who causes the chariots to go forth; whereas in &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1494;&#1506;&#1511; &#1488;&#1514;&#1497; in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#008">Zac 6:8</A> it is the interpreting angel again. By &#1497;&#1494;&#1506;&#1511;, lit., he cried to him, i.e., called out to him with a loud voice, the contents of the exclamation are held up as important to the interpretation of the whole.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">zac 6:9</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The series of visions closes with a symbolical transaction, which is closely connected with the substance of the night-visions, and sets before the eye the figure of the mediator of salvation, who, as crowned high priest, or as priestly king, is to build the kingdom of God, and raise it into a victorious power over all the kingdoms of this world, for the purpose of comforting and strengthening the congregation. The transaction is the following: <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#009">Zac 6:9</A>. "And the word of Jehovah came to me thus: <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#010">Zac 6:10</A>. Take of the people of the captivity, of Cheldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedahyah, and go thou the same day, go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, whither they have come from Babel; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#011">Zac 6:11</A>. And take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them upon the head of Joshua the son of Jozadak the high priest." By the introduction, "The word of the Lord came to me," the following transaction is introduced as a procedure of symbolical importance. It is evident from <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#010">Zac 6:10</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#011">Zac 6:11</A> that messengers had come to Jerusalem from the Israelites who had been left behind in Babel, to offer presents of silver and gold, probably for supporting the erection of the temple, and had gone to the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah. The prophet is to go to them, and to take silver and gold from them, to have a crown made for Joshua the high priest. The construction in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#010">Zac 6:10</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#011">Zac 6:11</A> is somewhat broad and dragging. The object is wanting to the inf. absol. &#1500;&#1511;&#1493;&#1495;, which is used instead of the imperative; and the sentence which has been begun is interrupted by &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488;&#1514; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, so that the verb which stands at the head is resumed in the &#1493;&#1500;&#1511;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468; of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#011">Zac 6:11</A>, and the sentence finished by the introduction of the object. This view is the simplest one. For it is still more impracticable to take &#1500;&#1511;&#1493;&#1495; in an absolute sense, and either supply the object from the context, or force it out by alterations of the text (Hitzig). If, for example, we were to supply as the object, "that which they are bringing," this meaning would result: "accept what they are bringing, do not refuse it," without there being any ground for the assumption that there had been any unwillingness to accept the presents. The alteration of &#1502;&#1495;&#1500;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497; into &#1502;&#1495;&#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;, "my jewels," is destitute of any critical support, and &#1502;&#1495;&#1500;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497; is defended against critical caprice by the &#1500;&#1495;&#1500;&#1501; in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#014">Zac 6:14</A>. Nor can &#1502;&#1488;&#1514; &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; be taken as the object to &#1500;&#1511;&#1493;&#1495;, "take (some) from the emigration," because this thought requires &#1502;&#1503;, and is irreconcilable with &#1502;&#1488;&#1514;, "from with." Haggo&#772;la&#770;h, lit., the wandering into exile, then those who belong to the wandering, or to the exiled, not merely those who are still in exile, but very frequently also those who have returned from exile. This is the meaning here, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#001">Ezr 4:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#019">Ezr 6:19</A>, etc. Mecheldai is an abbreviation for &#1502;&#1488;&#1514; &#1495;&#1500;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;. Cheldai, Tobiyah, and Yedahyah, were the persons who had come from Babylon to bring the present. This is implied in the words &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; &#1502;&#1489;, whither they have come from Babel. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is an accus. loci, pointing back to &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;. We are not warranted in interpreting the names of these men symbolically or typically, either by the circumstance that the names have an appellative meaning, like all proper names in Hebrew, or by the fact that Cheldai is written Che&#772;lem in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#014">Zac 6:14</A>, and that instead of Josiah we have there apparently che&#772;n. For che&#772;n is not a proper name (see at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#014">Zac 6:14</A>), and che&#772;lem, i.e., strength, is not materially different from Cheldai, i.e., the enduring one; so that it is only a variation of the name, such as we often meet with. The definition "on that day" can only point back to the day mentioned in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#007">Zac 1:7</A>, on which Zechariah saw the night-visions, so that it defines the chronological connection between this symbolical transaction and those night-visions. For, with the explanation given by C. B. Michaelis, "die isto quo scil. facere debes quae nunc mando," the definition of the time is unmeaning. If God had defined the day more precisely to the prophet in the vision, the prophet would have recorded it. Zechariah is to have given to him as much of the silver and gold which they have brought with them as is required to make &#8219;a&#774;ta&#770;ro&#772;th. The plural &#8219;a&#774;ta&#770;ro&#772;th does indeed apparently point to at least two crowns, say a silver and a golden one, as C. B. Michaelis and Hitzig suppose. But what follows cannot be made to harmonize with this. The prophet is to put the &#8219;a&#774;ta&#770;ro&#772;th upon Joshua's head. But you do not put two or more crowns upon the head of one man; and the indifference with which Ewald, Hitzig, and Bunsen interpolate the words &#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1489;&#1500; &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; after &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, without the smallest critical authority, is condemned by the fact that in what follows only one wearer of a crown is spoken of, and in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#013">Zac 6:13</A>, according to the correct interpretation, there is no "sharp distinction made between the priest and the Messiah." The plural &#8219;a&#774;ta&#770;ro&#772;th denotes here one single splendid crown, consisting of several gold and silver twists wound together, or rising one above another, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#036">Job 31:36</A>, and just as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#012">Rev 19:12</A> (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;) Christ is said to wear, not many separate diadems, but a crown consisting of several diadems twisted together, as the insignia of His regal dignity. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#012">Zechariah 6:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">zac 6:12</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The meaning of this is explained in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#012">Zac 6:12-15</A>. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#012">Zac 6:12</A>. "And speak to him, saying, Thus speaketh Jehovah of hosts, saying, Behold a man, His name is Tsemach (Sprout), and from His place will He sprout up, and build the temple of Jehovah. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#013">Zac 6:13</A>. And He will build the temple of Jehovah, and He will carry loftiness, and will sit and rule upon His throne, and will be a priest upon His throne, and the counsel of peace will be between them both. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#014">Zac 6:14</A>. And the crown will be to Chelem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedahjah, and the favour of the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of Jehovah. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#015">Zac 6:15</A>. And they that are far off will come and build at the temple of Jehovah; then will ye know that Jehovah of hosts hath sent me to you; and it will come to pass, if ye hearken to the voice of Jehovah your God." Two things are stated in these verses concerning the crown: (1) In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#012">Zac 6:12</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#013">Zac 6:13</A> the meaning is explained of the setting of the crown upon the head of Joshua the high priest; and (2) in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#014">Zac 6:14</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#015">Zac 6:15</A>, an explanation is given of the circumstance, that the crown had been made of silver and gold presented by men of the captivity. The crowning of Joshua the high priest with a royal crown, which did not properly belong to the high priest as such, as his headdress is neither called a crown (&#8219;a&#774;ta&#770;ra&#770;h) nor formed part of the insignia of royal dignity and glory, had a typical significance. It pointed to a man who would sit upon his throne as both ruler and priest, that is to say, would combine both royalty and priesthood in his own person and rank. The expression "Speak thou to him" shows that the words of Jehovah are addressed to Joshua, and to him alone (&#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; is singular), and therefore that Zerubbabel must not be interpolated into <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#011">Zac 6:11</A> along with Joshua. The man whom Joshua is to represent or typify, by having a crown placed upon his head, is designated as the Messiah, by the name Tsemach (see at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#008">Zac 3:8</A>); and this name is explained by the expression &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493; &#1497;&#1510;&#1502;&#1495;. These words must not be taken impersonally, in the sense of "under him will it sprout" (lxx, Luth., Calov., Hitzig, Maurer, and others); for this thought cannot be justified from the usage of the language, to say nothing of its being quite remote from the context, since we have &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;, and not &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493; (under him); and moreover, the change of subject in &#1497;&#1510;&#1502;&#1495; and &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1504;&#1492; would be intolerably harsh. In addition to this, according to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#015">Jer 33:15</A>, the Messiah is called Tsemach, because Jehovah causes a righteous growth to spring up to David, so that Tsemach is the sprouting one, and not he who makes others or something else to sprout. &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;, "from under himself," is equivalent to "from his place" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#023">Exo 10:23</A>), i.e., from his soil; and is correctly explained by Alting in Hengstenberg thus: "both as to his nation and as to his country, of the house of David, Judah, and Abraham, to whom the promises were made." It also contains an allusion to the fact that He will grow from below upwards, from lowliness to eminence.
<p>This Sprout will build the temple of the Lord. That these words do not refer to the building of the earthly temple of stone and wood, as Ros. and Hitzig with the Rabbins suppose, is so obvious, that even Koehler has given up this view here, and understands the words, as Hengstenberg, Tholuck, and others do, as relating to the spiritual temple, of which the tabernacle and the temples of both Solomon and Zerubbabel were only symbols, the temple which is the church of God itself (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#001">Hos 8:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005">Pe1 2:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#006">Heb 3:6</A>; and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#021">Eph 2:21-22</A>). Zechariah not only speaks of this temple here, but also in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#009">Zac 4:9</A>, as Haggai had done before him, in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#006">Hag 2:6-9</A>, which puts the correctness of our explanation of these passages beyond the reach of doubt. The repetition of this statement in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#013">Zac 6:13</A> is not useless, but serves, as the emphatic &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; before this and the following sentence shows, to bring the work of the Tsemach into connection with the place He will occupy, in other words, to show the glory of the temple to be built. The two clauses are to be linked together thus: "He who will build the temple, the same will carry eminence." There is no "antithesis to the building of the temple by Joshua and Zerubbabel" (Koehler) in &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;; but this is quite as foreign to the context as another view of the same commentator, viz., that <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#013">Zac 6:13</A> interrupts the explanation of what the shoot is to be. &#1492;&#1493;&#1491;, eminence, is the true word for regal majesty (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#018">Jer 22:18</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#025">Ch1 29:25</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#021">Dan 11:21</A>). In this majesty He will sit upon His throne and rule, also using His regal dignity and power for the good of His people, and will be a Priest upon His throne, i.e., will be at once both Priest and King upon the throne which He assumes. The rendering, "And there will be a priest upon His throne" (Ewald and Hitzig), is precluded by the simple structure of the sentences, and still more by the strangeness of the thought which it expresses; for the calling of a priest in relation to God and the people is not to sit upon a throne, but to stand before Jehovah (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#028">Jdg 20:28</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#012">Deu 17:12</A>). Even the closing words of this verse, "And a counsel of peace will be between them both," do not compel us to introduce a priest sitting upon the throne into the text by the side of the Tsemach ruling upon His throne. &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; cannot be taken as a neuter in the sense of "between the regal dignity of the Messiah and His priesthood" (Capp., Ros.), and does not even refer to the Tsemach and Jehovah, but to the Mo&#772;she&#772;l and Ko&#772;he&#772;n, who sit upon the throne, united in one person, in the Tsemach. Between these two there will be &#8219;a&#774;tsath sha&#770;lo&#772;m. This does not merely mean, "the most perfect harmony will exist" (Hofmann, Umbreit), for that is a matter of course, and does not exhaust the meaning of the words. &#8219;Atsath sha&#770;lo&#772;m, counsel of peace, is not merely peaceful, harmonious consultation, but consultation which has peace for its object; and the thought is the following: The Messiah, who unites in Himself royalty and priesthood, will counsel and promote the peace of His people.
<p>This is the typical meaning of the crowning of the high priest Joshua. But another feature is added to this. The crown, which has been placed upon the head of Joshua, to designate him as the type of the Messiah, is to be kept in the temple of the Lord after the performance of this act, as a memorial for those who bring the silver and gold from the exiles in Babel, and &#1500;&#1495;&#1503; &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1510;, i.e., for the favour or grace of the son of Zephaniah. Che&#772;n is not a proper name, or another name for Josiah, but an appellative in the sense of favour, or a favourable disposition, and refers to the favour which the son of Zephaniah has shown to the emigrants who have come from Babylon, by receiving them hospitably into his house. For a memorial of these men, the crown is to be kept in the temple of Jehovah. The object of this is not merely "to guard it against profanation, and perpetuate the remembrance of the givers" (Kliefoth); but this action has also a symbolical and prophetic meaning, which is given in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#015">Zac 6:15</A> in the words, "Strangers will come and build at the temple of the Lord." Those who have come from the far distant Babylon are types of the distant nations who will help to build the temple of the Lord with their possessions and treasures. This symbolical proceeding therefore furnishes a confirmation of the promise in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#007">Hag 2:7</A>, that the Lord will fill His temple with the treasures of all nations. By the realization of what is indicated in this symbolical proceeding, Israel will perceive that the speaker has been sent to them by the Lord of hosts; that is to say, not that Zechariah has spoken by the command of God, but that the Lord has sent the angel of Jehovah. For although in what precedes, only the prophet, and not the angel of Jehovah, has appeared as acting and speaking, we must not change the "sending" into "speaking" here, or take the formula &#1493;&#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; in any other sense here than in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#013">Zac 2:13</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#002">Zac 3:2</A>, and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#009">Zac 4:9</A>. We must therefore assume, that just as the words of the prophet pass imperceptibly into words of Jehovah, so here they pass into the words of the angel of Jehovah, who says concerning himself that Jehovah has sent him. The words conclude with the earnest admonition to the hearers, that they are only to become partakers of the predicted good when they hearken to the voice of their God. The sentence commencing with &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; does not contain any aposiopesis; there is no valid ground for such an assumption as this in the simple announcement, which shows no trace of excitement; but veha&#770;ha&#770;h may be connected with the preceding thought, "ye will know," etc., and affirms that they will only discern that the angel of Jehovah has been sent to them when they pay attention to the voice of their God. Now, although the recognition of the sending of the angel of the Lord involves participation in the Messianic salvation, the fact that this recognition is made to depend upon their giving heed to the word of God, by no means implies that the coming of the Messiah, or the participation of the Gentiles in His kingdom, will be bound up with the fidelity of the covenant nation, as Hengstenberg supposes; but the words simply declare that Israel will not come to the knowledge of the Messiah or to His salvation, unless it hearkens to the voice of the Lord. Whoever intentionally closes his eyes, will be unable to see the salvation of God.
<p>The question whether the prophet really carried out the symbolical action enjoined upon him in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#010">Zac 6:10</A>., externally or not, can neither be answered in the affirmative nor with a decided negative. The statement in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#011">Zac 6:11</A>, that the prophet who was hardly a goldsmith, was to make the crown, is no more a proof that it was not actually done, than the talmudic notice in Middoth iii., concerning the place where the crown was hung up in the temple, is a proof that it was. For &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1514; in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#011">Zac 6:11</A> may also express causing to be made; and the talmudic notice referred to does not affirm that this crown was kept in the temple, but simply states that in the porch of the temple there were beams stretching from one wall to the other, and that golden chains were fastened to them, upon which the priestly candidates climbed up and saw crowns; and the verse before us is then quoted, with the formula &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; as a confirmation of this.
