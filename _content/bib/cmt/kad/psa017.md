### [Psalms Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 17:0</span></span>

Flight of an innocent and Persecuted Man for Refuge in the Lord, Who
Knoweth Them That Are His

[Psa 17:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#001) is placed after [Psa
16:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#001), because just like the latter
(cf. [Psa 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#007)) it closes with the
hope of a blessed and satisfying vision of God. In other respects also
the two Psalms have many prominent features in common: as, for instance,
the petition שׁמרני, [Psa 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#001); [Psa
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#008); the retrospect on nightly
fellowship with God, [Psa 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#007); [Psa
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#003); the form of address in prayer
אל, [Psa 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#001); [Psa
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#006); the verb תּמך, [Psa
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#005); [Psa
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#005), etc. (vid., Symbolae p. 49),
notwithstanding a great dissimilarity in their tone. For [Psa
16:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#001) is the first of those which we
call Psalms written in the indignant style, in the series of the Davidic
Psalms. The language of the Psalms of David, which is in other instances
so flowing and clear, becomes more harsh and, in accordance with the
subject and mood, as it were, full of unresolved dissonances ([Psa
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#001); [Psa
140:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#001); [Psa
58:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#001); [Psa
36:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#002), cf. [Psa
10:2-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#002)) when describing the dissolute
conduct of his enemies, and of the ungodly in general. The language is
then more rough and unmanageable, and wanting in the clearness and
transparency we find elsewhere. The tone of the language also becomes
more dull and, as it were, a dull murmur. It rolls on like the rumble of
distant thunder, by piling up the suffixes mo, āmo, ēmo, as in [Psa
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#010); [Psa
35:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#016); [Psa
64:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#006), [Psa
64:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#009), where David speaks of his
enemies and describes them in a tone suggested by the indignation, which
is working with his breast; or in [Psa
59:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#012); [Psa
56:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#008); [Psa
21:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#010); [Psa
140:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#010); [Psa
58:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#007), where, as in prophetic language,
he announces to them of the judgment of God. The more vehement and less
orderly flow of the language which we find here, is the result of the
inward tumult of his feelings.

There are so many parallels in the thought and expression of thought of
this Psalm in other Davidic Psalms (among those we have already
commented on we may instance more especially [Psa
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#001) and [Psa
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#001), and also [Psa
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#001) and [Psa
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#001)), that even Hitzig admits the
לדוד. The author of the Psalm is persecuted, and others with him; foes,
among whom one, their leader, stands prominently forward, plot against
his life, and have encompassed him about in the most threatening manner,
eager for his death. All this corresponds, line for line, with the
situation of David in the wilderness of Maon (about three hours and
three quarters S.S.E. of Hebron), as narrated in [Sa1
23:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#025)., when Saul and his men were so
close upon the heels of David and his men, that he only escaped capture
by a most fortunate incident.

The only name inscribed on this Psalm is תּפּלּה (a prayer), the most
comprehensive name for the Psalms, and the oldest ([Psa
72:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#020)); for שׁיר and מזמור were only
given to them when they were sung in the liturgy and with musical
accompaniment. As the title of a Psalm it is found five times ([Psa
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#001), [Psa
86:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#001), [Psa
90:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#001), [Psa
92:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#001), [Psa
142:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#001)) in the Psalter, and besides
that once, in Hab. Habakkuk's תפלה is a hymn composed for music. But in
the Psalter we do not find any indication of the Psalms thus inscribed
being arranged for music. The strophe schema is 4. 7; 4. 4. 6. 7.

[Psalms 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 17:1</span></span>

צדק is the accusative of the object: the righteousness, intended by the
suppliant, is his own ([Psa 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#015)). He
knows that he is not merely righteous in his relation to man, but also
in his relation to God. In all such assertions of pious
self-consciousness, that which is intended is a righteousness of life
which has its ground in the righteousness of faith. True, Hupfeld is of
opinion, that under the Old Testament nothing was known either of
righteousness which is by faith or of a righteousness belonging to
another and imputed. But if this were true, then Paul was in gross error
and Christianity is built upon the sand. But the truth, that faith is
the ultimate ground of righteousness, is expressed in [Gen
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#006), and at other turning-points in
the course of the history of redemption; and the truth, that the
righteousness which avails before God is a gift of grace is, for
instance, a thought distinctly marked out in the expression of Jeremiah
צדקנוּ ה, "the Lord our righteousness." The Old Testament conception, it
is true, looks more to the phenomena than to the root of the matter (ist
mehr phnomenell als wurzelhaft), is (so to speak) more Jacobic than
Pauline; but the righteousness of life of the Old Testament and that of
the New have one and the same basis, viz., in the grace of God, the
Redeemer, towards sinful man, who in himself is altogether wanting in
righteousness before God ([Psa 143:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#002)).
Thus there is no self-righteousness, in David's praying that the
righteousness, which in him is persecuted and cries for help, may be
heard. For, on the one hand, in his personal relation to Saul, he knows
himself to be free from any ungrateful thoughts of usurpation, and on
the other, in his personal relation to God free from מרמה, i.e.,
self-delusion and hypocrisy. The shrill cry for help, רנּה, which he
raises, is such as may be heard and answered, because they are not lips
of deceit with which he prays. The actual fact is manifest לפני יהוה,
therefore may his right go forth מלּפניו, - just what does happen, by
its being publicly proclaimed and openly maintained - from Him, for His
eyes, the eyes of Him who knoweth the hearts ([Psa
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#004)), behold מישׁרים (as in [Psa
58:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#002); [Psa
75:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#003) = בּמישׁרים, [Psa
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#009), and many other passages), in
uprightness, i.e., in accordance with the facts of the case and without
partiality. מישׁרים might also be an accusative of the object (cf. [Ch1
29:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#017)), but the usage of the language
much more strongly favours the adverbial rendering, which is made still
more natural by the confirmatory relation in which [Psa
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#002) stands to [Psa
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#002).

[Psalms 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 17:3</span></span>

David refers to the divine testing and illumination of the inward parts,
which he has experienced in himself, in support of his sincerity. The
preterites in [Psa 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#003) express the
divine acts that preceded the result בּל־תּמצא, viz., the testing He has
instituted, which is referred to in צרפתּני and also בּחנתּ as a trying
of gold by fire, and in פּקד as an investigation ([Job
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#018)). The result of the close
scrutiny to which God has subjected him in the night, when the bottom of
a man's heart is at once made manifest, whether it be in his thoughts
when awake or in the dream and fancies of the sleeper, was and is this,
that He does not find, viz., anything whatever to punish in him,
anything that is separated as dross from the gold. To the mind of the
New Testament believer with his deep, and as it were microscopically
penetrating, insight into the depth of sin, such a confession concerning
himself would be more difficult than to the mind of an Old Testament
saint. For a separation and disunion of flesh and spirit, which was
unknown in the same degree to the Old Testament, has been accomplished
in the New Testament consciousness by the facts and operations of
redemption revealed in the New Testament; although at the same time it
must be remembered that in such confessions the Old Testament
consciousness does not claim to be clear from sins, but only from a
conscious love of sin, and from a self-love that is hostile to God.

With זמּותי David begins his confession of how Jahve found him to be,
instead of finding anything punishable in him. This word is either an
infinitive like חנּות ([Psa 77:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#010))
with the regular ultima accentuation, formed after the manner of the הל
verbs, - in accordance with which Hitzig renders it: my thinking does
not overstep my mouth, - or even 1 pers. praet., which is properly
Milel, but does also occur as Milra, e.g., [Deu
32:41](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#041); [Isa
44:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#016) (vid., on [Job
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#017)), - according to which Bttcher
translates: should I think anything evil, it dare not pass beyond my
mouth, - or (since זמם may denote the determination that precedes the
act, e.g., [Jer 4:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#028); [Lam
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#017)): I have determined my mouth
shall not transgress. This last rendering is opposed by the fact, that
עבר by itself in the ethical signification "to transgress" (cf.
post-biblical עברה παράβασις) is not the usage of the biblical Hebrew,
and that when יעבר־פּי stand close together, פי is presumptively the
object. We therefore give the preference to Bttcher's explanation, which
renders זמותי as a hypothetical perfect and is favoured by [Pro
30:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#032) (which is to be translated: and
if thou thinkest evil, (lay) thy hand on thy mouth!). Nevertheless בל
יעבר־פי is not the expression of a fact, but of a purpose, as the
combination of בל with the future requires it to be taken. The psalmist
is able to testify of himself that he so keeps evil thoughts in
subjection within him, even when they may arise, that they do not pass
beyond his mouth, much less that he should put them into action. But
perhaps the psalmist wrote פּיך originally, "my reflecting does not go
beyond Thy commandment" (according to [Num
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#018); [Sa1
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#024); [Pro
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#029)), - a meaning better suited, as a
result of the search, to the nightly investigation. The ל of לפעלּות fo
ל need not be the ל of reference (as to); it is that of the state or
condition, as in [Psa 32:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#006); [Psa
69:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#022). אדם, as perhaps also in [Job
31:33](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#033); [Hos
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#007) (if אדם is not there the name of
the first man), means, men as they are by nature and habit. בּדבר שׂפתיך
does not admit of being connected with לפעלּות: at the doings of the
world contrary to Thy revealed will (Hofmann and others); for פּעל בּ
cannot mean: to act contrary to any one, but only: to work upon any one,
[Job 35:6](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#006). These words must therefore
be regarded as a closer definition, placed first, of the שׁמרתּי which
follows: in connection with the doings of men, by virtue of the divine
commandment, he has taken care of the paths of the oppressor, viz., not
to go in them; [Sa1 25:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#021) is an
instance in support of this rendering, where שׁמרתי, as in [Job
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#006), means: I have kept (Nabal's
possession), not seizing upon it myself. Jerome correctly translates
vias latronis; for פּריץ signifies one who breaks in, i.e., one who does
damage intentionally and by violence. The confession concerning himself
is still continued in [Psa 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#005), for
the inf. absol. תּמך, if taken as imperative would express a prayer for
constancy, that is alien to the circumstances described. The perfect
after בּל is also against such a rendering. It must therefore be taken
as inf. historicus, and explained according to [Job
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#011), cf. [Psa
41:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#013). The noun following the inf.
absol., which is usually the object, is the subject in this instance,
as, e.g., in [Job 40:2](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#002); [Pro
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#012); [Ecc
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#002), and frequently. It is אשׁוּרי,
and not אשּׁוּרי, אשׁור (a step) never having the שׁ dageshed, except in
[Psa 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#011) and [Job
31:7](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#007).

[Psalms 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 17:6</span></span>

It is only now, after his inward parts and his walk have been laid open
to Jahve, that he resumes his petition, which is so well justified and
so soundly based, and enters into detail. The אני

(Note: The word is pointed אני, in correct texts, as אני always is when
it has Munach and Dech follows, e.g., also [Psa
116:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#016). This Gaja demands an emphatic
intonation of the secondary word in its relation to the principal word
(which here is קראתיך).)

found beside קראתיך (the perfect referring to that which has just now
been put into execution) is meant to imply: such an one as he has
described himself to be according to the testimony of his conscience,
may call upon God, for God hears such and will therefore also hear him.
הט אזנך exactly corresponds to the Latin au-di (aus-cul-ta). The Hiph.
הפלה (הפליא, [Psa 31:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#022), cf. [Psa
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#004)) signifies here to work in an
extraordinary and marvellous manner. The danger of him who thus prays is
great, but the mercies of God, who is ready and able to help, are still
greater. Oh that He may, then, exhibit all its fulness on his behalf.
The form of the address resembles the Greek, which is so fond of
participles. If it is translated as Luther translates it: "Show Thy
marvellous lovingkindness, Thou Saviour of those who trust in Thee,
Against those who so set themselves against Thy right hand," then חוסים
is used just as absolutely as in [Pro
14:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#032), and the right hand of God is
conceived of as that which arranges and makes firm. But "to rebel
against God's right (not statuta, but desteram)" is a strange
expression. There are still two other constructions from which to
choose, viz., "Thou Deliverer of those seeking protection from
adversaries, with Thy right hand" (Hitz.), or: "Thou Helper of those
seeking protection from adversaries, at Thy right hand" (Aben-Ezra,
Tremell.). This last rendering is to be preferred to the two others.
Since, on the one hand, one says מחסה מן, refuge from..., and on the
other, חסה בּ to hide one's self in any one, or in any place, this
determining of the verbal notion by the preposition (on this, see above
on [Psa 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#012)) must be possible in both
directions. ממּתקוממים is equivalent to ממתקוממיהם [Job
27:7](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#007); and חוסים בימינך, those seeking
protection at the strong hand of Jahve. The force of the ב is just the
same as in connection with הסתּתּר, [Sa1
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#019). In Damascus and throughout
Syria - Wetzstein observes on this passage - the weak make use of these
words when they surrender themselves to the strong: Arab. anâ b-qabḍt
ydk, "I am in the grasp of thy hand (in thy closed hand) i.e., I give
myself up entirely to thee."

(Note: Cognate in meaning to חסה ב are Arab. 'sttr b and tadarrâ b,
e.g., Arab. tḏrrâ b-'l-ḥâ'ṭ mn 'l-rı̂ḥ he shelters (hides) himself by the
wall from the wind, or Arab. bâl‛ḍât mn 'l-brd, by a fire against the
cold, and Arab. ‛âḏ, which is often applied in like manner to God's
protection. Thus, e.g., (according to Bochri's Sunna) a woman, whom
Muhammed wanted to seize, cried out: Arab. a‛ûḏu b-'llh mnk, I place
myself under God's protection against thee, and he replied: Arab. ‛uḏti
bi-ma‛âḏin, thou hast taken refuge in an (inaccessible) asylum (cf. Job,
i. 310 n. and ii. 22 n. 2).)

[Psalms 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 17:8</span></span>

The covenant relationship towards Himself in which Jahve has placed
David, and the relationship of love in which David stands to Jahve,
fully justified the oppressed one in his extreme request. The apple of
the eye, which is surrounded by the iris, is called אישׁון, the man
(Arabic insân), or in the diminutive and endearing sense of the
termination on: the little man of the eye, because a picture in
miniature of one's self is seen, as in a glass, when looking into
another person's eye. בּת־עין either because it is as if born out of the
eye and the eye has, as it were, concentrated itself in it, or rather
because the little image which is mirrored in it is, as it were, the
little daughter of the eye (here and [Lam
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#018)). To the Latin pupilla (pupula),
Greek κόρη, corresponds most closely בּבת עין, [Zac
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#012), which does not signify the gate,
aperture, sight, but, as בּת shows, the little boy, or more strictly,
the little girl of the eye. It is singular that אישׁון here has the
feminine בּת־עין as the expression in apposition to it. The construction
might be genitival: "as the little man of the apple of the eye,"
inasmuch as the saint knows himself to be so near to God, that, as it
were, his image in miniature is mirrored in the great eye of God. But
(1) the more ozdinary name for the pupil of the eye is not בּת עין, but
אישׁון; and (2) with that construction the proper point of the
comparison, that the apple of the eye is an object of the most careful
self-preservation, is missed. There is, consequently, a combination of
two names of the pupil or apple of the eye, the usual one and one more
select, without reference to the gender of the former, in order to give
greater definition and emphasis to the figure. The primary passage for
this bold figure, which is the utterance of loving entreaty, is [Deu
32:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#010), where the dazzling
anthropomorphism is effaced by the lxx and other ancient versions;

(Note: Vid., Geiger, Urschrift und Ueberstezungen der Bibel, S. 324.)

cf. also Sir. 17:22. Then follows another figure, taken from the eagle,
which hides its young under its wings, likewise from Deut 32, viz., [Psa
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#011), for the figure of the hen ([Mat
23:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#037)) is alien to the Old Testament.
In that passage, Moses, in his great song, speaks of the wings of God;
but the double figure of the shadow of God's wings (here and in [Psa
36:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#008); [Psa
57:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#002); [Psa
63:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#008)) is coined by David. "God's
wings" are the spreadings out, i.e., the manifestations of His love,
taking the creature under the protection of its intimate fellowship, and
the "shadow" of these wings is the refreshing rest and security which
the fellowship of this love affords to those, who hide themselves
beneath it, from the heat of outward or inward conflict.

From [Psa 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#009) we learn more
definitely the position in which the psalmist is placed. שׁדד signifies
to use violence, to destroy the life, continuance, or possession of any
one. According to the accentuation בּנפשׁ is to be connected with איבי,
not with יקּפוּ, and to be understood according to [Eze
25:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#006) : "enemies with the soul" are
those whose enmity is not merely superficial, but most deep-seated (cf.
ἐκ ψυχῆς, [Eph 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#006); [Col
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#023)). The soul (viz., the hating and
eagerly longing soul, [Psa 27:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#012); [Psa
41:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#003)) is just the same as if בנפשׁ is
combined with the verb, viz., the soul of the enemies; and איבי נפשׁי
would therefore not be more correct, as Hitzig thinks, than בנפשׁ איבי,
but would have a different meaning. They are eager to destroy him (perf.
conatus), and form a circle round about him, as ravenous ones, in order
to swallow him up.

[Psalms 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 17:10</span></span>

[Psa 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#010) tell what sort of people
these persecutors are. Their heart is called fat, adeps, not as though
חלב could in itself be equivalent to לב, more especially as both words
are radically distinct (חלב from the root לב, λιπ; לב from the root לב,
לף to envelope: that which is enveloped, the kernel, the inside), but
(without any need for von Ortenberg's conjecture חלב לבּמו סגרוּ "they
close their heart with fat") because it is, as it were, entirely fat
([Psa 119:70](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#070), cf. [Psa
73:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#007)), and because it is inaccessible
to any feeling of compassion, and in general incapable of the nobler
emotions. To shut up the fat = the heart (cf. κλείειν τὰ σπλάγχνα [Jo1
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#017)), is equivalent to: to fortify
one's self wilfully in indifference to sympathy, tender feeling, and all
noble feelings (cf. השׁמין לב = to harden, [Isa
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#010)). The construction of פּימו
(which agrees in sound with פּימה, [Job
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#027)) is just the same as that of
קולי, [Psa 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#005). On the other hand,
אשּׁוּרנוּ (after the form עמּוּד and written plene) is neither such an
accusative of the means or instrument, nor the second accusative, beside
the accusative of the object, of that by which the object is surrounded,
that is usually found with verbs of surrounding (e.g., Ps 5:13; [Psa
32:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#007)); for "they have surrounded me
(us) with our step" is unintelligible. But אשׁורנו can be the accusative
of the member, as in [Psa 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#008), cf.
[Psa 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#017), [Gen
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#015), for "it is true the step is not
a member" (Hitz.), but since "step" and "foot" are interchangeable
notions, [Psa 73:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#002), the σχῆμα καθ ̓
ὅλον καὶ μέρος is applicable to the former, and as, e.g., Homer says,
Iliad vii. 355: σὲ μάλιστα πόνος φρένας ἀμφιβέβηκεν, the Hebrew poet can
also say: they have encompassed us (and in fact) our steps, each of our
steps (so that we cannot go forwards or backwards with our feet). The
Ker סבבוּנוּ gets rid of the change in number which we have with the
Chethb סבבוני; the latter, however, is admissible according to parallels
like [Psa 62:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#005), and corresponds to
David's position, who is hunted by Saul and at the present time driven
into a strait at the head of a small company of faithful followers.
Their eyes - he goes on to say in [Psa
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#011) - have they set to fell, viz.,
us, who are encompassed, to the earth, i.e., so that we shall be cast to
the ground. נטה is transitive, as in [Psa
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#010); [Psa
62:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#004), in the transitively applied
sense of [Psa 73:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#002) (cf. [Psa
37:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#031)): to incline to fall (whereas in
[Psa 44:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#019), [Job
31:7](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#007), it means to turn away from); and
בּארץ (without any need fore the conjecture בּארח) expresses the final
issue, instead of לארץ, [Psa 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#006). By
the expression דּמינו one is prominently singled out from the host of
the enemy, viz., its chief, the words being: his likeness is as a lion,
according to the peculiarity of the poetical style, of changing verbal
into substantival clauses, instead of דּמה כּאריה. Since in Old
Testament Hebrew, as also in Syriac and Arabic, כ is only a preposition,
not a connective conjunction, it cannot be rendered: as a lion longs to
prey, but: as a lion that is greedy or hungry (cf. Arab. ksf, used of
sinking away, decline, obscuring or eclipsing, growing pale, and Arab.
chsf, more especially of enfeebling, hunger, distinct from חשׂף = Arab.
ks̆f, to peel off, make bare) to ravin. In the parallel member of the
verse the participle alternates with the attributive clause. כּפיר is
(according to Meier) the young lion as being covered with thicker hair.

[Psalms 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 17:13</span></span>

The phrase קדּם פּני, antevertere faciem alicujus, means both to appear
before any one with reverence, [Psa
95:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#002) (post-biblical: to pay one's
respects to any one) and to meet any one as an enemy, rush on him. The
foe springs like a lion upon David, may Jahve - so he prays - as his
defence cross the path of the lion and intercept him, and cast him down
so that he, being rendered harmless, shall lie there with bowed knees
(כּרע, of the lion, [Gen 49:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#009); [Num
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#009)). He is to rescue his soul from
the ungodly חרבּך. This חרבך, and also the ידך which follows, can be
regarded as a permutative of the subject (Bצttcher, Hupfeld, and
Hitzig), an explanation which is commended by [Psa
44:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#003) and other passages. But it is
much more probable that more exact definitions of this kind are treated
as accusatives, vid., on [Psa 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#005). At
any rate "sword" and "hand" are meant as the instruments by which the
פּלּט, rescuing, is effected. The force of פּלּטה extends into [Psa
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#014), and mimatiym (with a Chateph
under the letter that is freed from reduplication, like ממכון, [Psa
33:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#014)) corresponds to מרשׁע, as ידך to
חרבּך. The word ממתים (plural of מת, men, [Deu
2:34](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#034), whence מתם, each and every one),
which of itself gives no complete sense, is repeated and made complete
after the interruption cause by the insertion of ידך ה, - a remarkable
manner of obstructing and then resuming the thought, which Hofmann
(Schriftbeweis ii. 2. 495) seeks to get over by a change in the division
of the verse and in the interpunction. חלד, either from חלד Syriac to
creep, glide, slip away (whence חלדּה a weasel, a mole) or from חלד
Talmudic to cover, hide, signifies: this temporal life which glides by
unnoticed (distinct from the Arabic chald, chuld, an abiding stay,
endless duration); and consequently חדל, limited existence, from חדל to
have an end, alternates with חלד as a play upon the letters, comp. [Psa
49:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#002) with [Isa
38:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#011). The combination מחלד מתים
resembles [Psa 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#018); [Psa
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#004). What is meant, is: men who have
no other home but the world, which passeth away with the lust thereof,
men ἐκ τοῦ κόσμου τούτου, or υίοὶ τοῦ αἰῶνος τούτου. The meaning of the
further description חלקם בּחיּים (cf. [Ecc
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#009)) becomes clear from the converse
in [Psa 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#005). Jahve is the חלק of the
godly man; and the sphere within which the worldling claims his חלק is
החיּים, this temporal, visible, and material life. This is everything to
him; whereas the godly man says: טּוב חסדּך מחיּים, [Psa
63:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#004). The contrast is not so much
between this life and the life to come, as between the world (life) and
God. Here we see into the inmost nature of the Old Testament faith. To
the Old Testament believer, all the blessedness and glory of the future
life, which the New Testament unfolds, is shut up in Jahve. Jahve is his
highest good, and possessing Him he is raised above heaven and earth,
above life and death. To yield implicitly to Him, without any explicit
knowledge of a blessed future life, to be satisfied with Him, to rest in
Him, to hide in Him in the face of death, is the characteristic of the
Old Testament faith. חלקם בחיים expresses both the state of mind and the
lot of the men of the world. Material things which are their highest
good, fall also in abundance to their share. The words "whose belly Thou
fillest with Thy treasure" (Chethb: וּצפינך the usual participial form,
but as a participle an Aramaising form) do not sound as though the poet
meant to say that God leads them to repentance by the riches of His
goodness, but on the contrary that God, by satisfying their desires
which are confined to the outward and sensuous only, absolutely deprives
them of all claim to possessions that extend beyond the world and this
present temporal life. Thus, then, צפוּן in this passage is used exactly
as צפוּנים is used in [Job 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#026) (from
צפן to hold anything close to one, to hold back, to keep by one).
Moreover, there is not the slightest alloy of murmur or envy in the
words. The godly man who lacks these good things out of the treasury of
God, has higher delights; he can exclaim, [Psa
31:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#020) : "how great is Thy goodness
which Thou hast laid up (צפנתּ) for those who fear Thee!" Among the good
things with which God fills the belly and house of the ungodly ([Job
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#017).) are also children in
abundance; these are elsewhere a blessing upon piety ([Psa
127:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#003)., [Psa
128:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#003).), but to those who do not
acknowledge the Giver they are a snare to self-glorifying, [Job
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#011) (cf. Wisdom [Job
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#001)). בּנים is not the subject, but an
accusative, and has been so understood by all the old translators from
the original text, just as in the phrase שׁבע ימים to be satisfied with,
or weary of, life. On עוללים vid., on [Psa
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#003). יתר (from יתר to stretch out in
length, then to be overhanging, towering above, projecting, superfluous,
redundant) signifies here, as in [Job
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#020), riches and the abundance of
things possessed.

[Psalms 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 17:15</span></span>

With אני he contrasts his incomparably greater prosperity with that of
his enemies. He, the despised and persecuted of men, will behold God's
face בּצדק, in righteousness, which will then find its reward ([Mat
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#008), [Heb
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#014)), and will, when this hope is
realised by him, thoroughly refresh himself with the form of God. It is
not sufficient to explain the vision of the divine countenance here as
meaning the experience of the gracious influences which proceed from the
divine countenance again unveiled and turned towards him. The parallel
of the next clause requires an actual vision, as in [Num
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#008), according to which Jahve
appeared to Moses in the true form of His being, without the
intervention of any self-manifestation of an accommodative and visionary
kind; but at the same time, as in [Exo
33:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#020), where the vision of the divine
countenance is denied to Moses, according to which, consequently, the
self-manifestation of Jahve in His intercourse with Moses is not to be
thought of without some veiling of Himself which might render the vision
tolerable to him. Here, however, where David gives expression to a hope
which is the final goal and the very climax of all his hopes, one has no
right in any way to limit the vision of God, who in love permits him to
behold Him (vid., on [Psa 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#007)), and
to limit the being satisfied with His תּמוּנה (lxx τὴν δόξαν σου, vid.,
Psychol. S. 49; transl. p. 61). If this is correct, then בּהקיץ cannot
mean "when I wake up from this night's sleep" as Ewald, Hupfeld and
others explain it; for supposing the Psalm were composed just before
falling asleep what would be the meaning of the postponement of so
transcendent a hope to the end of his natural sleep? Nor can the meaning
be to "awake to a new life of blessedness and peace through the sunlight
of divine favour which again arises after the night of darkness and
distress in which the poet is now to be found" (Kurtz); for to awake
from a night of affliction is an unsuitable idea and for this very
reason cannot be supported. The only remaining explanation, therefore,
is the waking up from the sleep of death (cf. Bttcher, De inferis
365-367). The fact that all who are now in their graves shall one day
hear the voice of Him that wakes the dead, as it is taught in the age
after the Exile ([Dan 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#002)), was
surely not known to David, for it was not yet revealed to him. But why
may not this truth of revelation, towards which prophecy advances with
such giant strides ([Isa 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#019). [Eze
37:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#001)), be already heard even in the
Psalms of David as a bold demand of faith and as a hope that has
struggled forth to freedom out of the comfortless conception of Shel
possessed in that age, just as it is heard a few decades later in the
master-work of a contemporary of Solomon, the Book of Job? The morning
in [Psa 49:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#015) is also not any morning
whatever following upon the night, but that final morning which brings
deliverance to the upright and inaugurates their dominion. A sure
knowledge of the fact of the resurrection such as, according to Hofmann
(Schriftbeweis ii. 2, 490), has existed in the Old Testament from the
beginning, is not expressed in such passages. For laments like [Psa
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#006); [Psa
30:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#010); [Psa
88:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#011), show that no such certain
knowledge as then in existence; and when the Old Testament literature
which we now possess allows us elsewhere an insight into the history of
the perception of redemption, it does not warrant us in concluding
anything more than that the perception of the future resurrection of the
dead did not pass from the prophetic word into the believing mind of
Israel until about the time of the Exile, and that up to that period
faith made bold to hope for a redemption from death, but only by means
of an inference drawn from that which was conceived and existed within
itself, without having an express word of promise in its favour.

(Note: To this Hofmann, loc. cit. S. 496, replies as follows: "We do not
find that faith indulges in such boldness elsewhere, or that the
believing ones cherish hopes which are based on such insecure grounds."
But the word of God is surely no insecure ground, and to draw bold
conclusions from that which is intimated only from afar, was indeed,
even in many other respects (for instance, respecting the incarnation,
and respecting the abrogation of the ceremonial law), the province of
the Old Testament faith.)

Thus it is here also. David certainly gives full expression to the hope
of a vision of God, which, as righteous before God, will be vouchsafed
to him; and vouchsafed to him, even though he should fall asleep in
death in the present extremity ([Psa
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#004)), as one again awakened from the
sleep of death, and, therefore (although this idea does not directly
coincide with the former), as one raised from the dead. But this hope is
not a believing appropriation of a "certain knowledge," but a view that,
by reason of the already existing revelation of God, lights up out of
his consciousness of fellowship with Him.
