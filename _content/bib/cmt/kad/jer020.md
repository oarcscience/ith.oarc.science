### [Jeremiah Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#001)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 20:0</span></span>

[Jer 20:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#001)

When the chief overseer of the temple, Pashur, heard this prophecy, he
had the prophet beaten, and put him over-night in the stocks at the
upper gate of Benjamin in the temple. Pashur is by the appellation: son
of Immer, distinguished from other priests of this name, e.g., Pashur,
son of Malchijah, [Ch1 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#012). It cannot
be determined whether Immer is here the name of the 16th class of
priests ([Ch1 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#014)) or of one of the
greater priestly clans ([Ezr 2:37](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#037);
[Neh 7:40](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#040)). Pashur held the office of
פּקיד נגיד, chief overseer in the house of God. נגיד is an official name
attached to פּקיד to explain it. In the latter word lies the idea of
overseeing, while the former denotes the official standing or rank of
the overseer. The position of נגיד was a high one, as may be seen from
the fact that the priest Zephaniah, who, according to [Jer
29:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#026), held this post, is quoted in
[Jer 52:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#024) ([Kg2
25:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#018)) as next to the high priest. The
compound expression without article implies that there were several
נגידים of the temple. In [Ch2 35:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#008)
there are three mentioned under Josiah; which is not contradicted by
[Ch2 31:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#013); [Ch1
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#011); [Neh
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#011), where particular persons are
called 'נגיד. As chief overseer of the temple, Pashur conceived it to be
his duty to take summary magisterial steps against Jeremiah, for his
public appearance in the temple. To put this procedure of the priest and
temple-warden in its proper light, Jeremiah is designated by the name of
his office, הנּביא.

(Note: As this official designation of Jeremiah is not found in Jer
1-19, but occurs frequently in the succeeding chapters, recent critics
have taken it to be an idle addition of the editor of the later
prophecies, and have laid stress on the fact as a proof of the later
composition, or at least later editing, of these pieces; cf. Graf, S.
xxxix. Ng., etc. This assumption is totally erroneous. The designation
of Jeremiah as הנּביא occurs only where the mention of the man's
official character was of importance. It is used partly in
contradistinction to the false prophets, [Jer
28:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#005), [Jer
28:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#010), [Jer
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#015), to the elders, priests, and
false prophets, [Jer 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#001), [Jer
29:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#029); [Jer
37:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#003), [Jer
37:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#006),[Jer
37:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#013); [Jer
42:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#002), [Jer
42:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#004), to the king, [Jer
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#002); [Jer
34:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#006); [Jer
37:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#002), and partly to distinguish from
persons of other conditions in life, [Jer
43:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#006); [Jer
45:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer045.htm#001); [Jer
51:59](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#059). We never find the title in the
headings of the prophecies save in [Jer
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#002), with reference to the fact that
here, [Jer 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#004), he upbraids the
people for not regarding the sayings of all the prophets of the Lord;
and in the oracles against foreign peoples, [Jer
46:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#001), [Jer
46:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#013); [Jer
47:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#001); [Jer
49:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#034), and [Jer
50:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#001), where the name of his calling
gave him credentials for these prophecies. - There is no further use of
the name in the entire book.)

In virtue of the summary authority which belonged to him (cf. [Jer
29:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#026)), Pashur smote the prophet,
i.e., caused him to be beaten with stripes, perhaps according to the
precept [Deu 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#003), cf. [Co2
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#024), and then threw him into prison
till the following day, and put him in the stocks. מהפּכת, twisting, was
an instrument of torture by which the body was forced into a distorted,
unnatural posture; the culprit's hands and feet were presumably bound,
so as to keep the position so; see on [Ch2
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#010), cf. with [Act
16:24](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#024). The upper gate of Benjamin in
the house of Jahveh is the northern gate at the upper, i.e., inner court
of the temple, the same with the upper gate or the gate of the inner
court, looking northwards, [Eze 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#002)
and [Eze 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#003). By the designation
"which is in the house," etc., it is distinguished from the city gate of
like name, [Jer 37:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#013); [Jer
38:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#007). - When on the next day Pashur
released the prophet from imprisonment, the latter made known to him the
divine punishment for his misdeed: "Not Pashur will Jahveh call thy
name, but Magor-Missabib" (i.e., Fear round about). The name is
expressive of the thing. And so: Jahveh will call the name, is, in other
words, He will make the person to be that which the name expresses; in
this case, make Pashur to be an object of fear round about. Under the
presumption that the name Magor-Missabib conveyed a meaning the most
directly opposed to that of Pashur, comm. have in various ways attempted
to interpret פּשׁחוּר. It is supposed to be composed of פּוּשׁ, Chald.
augeri, and חוּר, nobilitas, with the force: abundantia claritatis
(Rashi); or after Arab. fs̀, gloriatus est de nobilitate (Simonis); or
from Arab. hsh, amplus fuit locus, and the Chald. סחור, circumcirca: de
securitate circumcirca; or finally, by Ew., from פּשׁ from פּוּשׁ,
spring, leap, rejoice ([Mal 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#018)), and
חור = חול, joy round about. All these interpretations are arbitrary.
פּוּשׁ sig. leap and gallop about, [Mal
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#018) and [Hab
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#008), and in Niph. [Nah
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#018), to be scattered (see on [Hab
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#008)); and x\#<span class="small">ap@f
sig. in [Lam 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#011) to tear. But the
syllable chowr חור can by no means have the sig. of מסּביב claimed for
it. Nor are there, indeed, sufficient grounds for assuming that Jeremiah
turned the original name upside down in an etymological or philological
reference. The new name given by Jeremiah to Pashur is meant to intimate
the man's destiny. On "Fear round about," see on [Jer
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#025). What the words of the new name
signify is explained in [Jer
20:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#004).</span>

[Jeremiah 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 20:4</span></span>

[Jer 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#004). "For thus hath Jahveh said:
Behold, I make thee a terror to thyself and to all thy friends, and they
shall fall by the sword of their enemies and thine eyes behold it; and
all Judah will I give into the hand of the king of Babylon, that he may
carry them captive to Babylon and smite them with the sword. [Jer
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#005). And I will give all the stores
of this city, and all its gains, and all its splendour, and all the
treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their
enemies, who shall plunder them and take and bring them to Babylon. [Jer
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#006). And thou, Pashur, and all that
dwell in thine house shall go into captivity, and to Babylon shalt thou
come, and there die, and there be buried, thou and all thy friends, to
whom thou hast prophesied lyingly." - Pashur will become a fear or
terror to himself and all his friends, because of his own and his
friend's fate; for he will see his friends fall by the sword of the
enemy, and then he himself, with those of his house and his friends not
as yet slain, will go forth into exile to Babylon and die there. So that
not to himself merely, but to all about him, he will be an object of
fear. Ng. wrongly translates נתנך למגור, I deliver thee up to fear, and
brings into the text the contrast that Pashur is not to become the
victim of death itself, but of perpetual fear of death. Along with
Pashur's friends, all Judah is to be given into the hand of the king of
Babylon, and be partly exiled to Babylon, partly put to death with the
sword. All the goods and gear of Jerusalem, together with the king's
treasures, are to be plundered and carried off by the enemy. We must not
press "all thy friends" in [Jer 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#004)
and [Jer 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#006); and so we escape the
apparent contradiction, that while in [Jer
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#004) it is said of all the friends
that they shall die by the sword, it is said of all in [Jer
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#006) that they shall go into exile.
The friends are those who take Pashur's side, his partisans. From the
last clause of [Jer 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#006) we see that
Pashur was also of the number of the false prophets, who prophesied the
verse of Jeremiah's prediction, namely, welfare and peace (cf. [Jer
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#017); [Jer
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#013)). - This saying of Jeremiah was
most probably fulfilled at the taking of Jerusalem under Jechoniah,
Pashur and the better part of the people being carried off to Babylon.

[Jeremiah 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 20:7</span></span>

The Prophet's Complaints as to the Sufferings Met with in his Calling. -
This portion contains, first, a complaint addressed to the Lord
regarding the persecutions which the preaching of God's word draws down
on Jeremiah, but the complaint passes into a jubilant cry of hope ([Jer
20:7-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#007)); secondly, a cursing of the
day of his birth ([Jer 20:13-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#013)). The
first complaint runs thus:

[Jer 20:7-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#007)

"Thou hast persuaded me, Jahveh, and I let myself be persuaded; Thou
hast laid hold on me and hast prevailed. I am become a laughter the
whole day long, every one mocketh at me. [Jer
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#008). For as often as I speak, I must
call out and cry violence and spoil, for the word of Jahveh is made a
reproach and a derision to me all the day. [Jer
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#009). And I said, I will not more
remember nor speak more in His name; then was it in my heart as burning
fire, shut up in my bones, and I become weary of holding out, and
cannot. [Jer 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#010). For I heard the
talk of many: Fear round about! Report, and let us report him! Every man
of my friendship lies in wait for my downfall: Peradventure he will let
himself be enticed, that we may prevail against him and take our revenge
on him. [Jer 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#011). But Jahveh stands
by me as a mighty warrior; therefore shall my persecutors stumble and
not prevail, shall be greatly put to shame, because they have not dealt
wisely, with everlasting disgrace which will not be forgotten. [Jer
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#012). And, Jahveh of hosts that
trieth the righteous, that seeth reins and heart, let me see Thy
vengeance on them, for to Thee have I committed my cause. [Jer
20:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#013). Sing to Jahveh, praise Jahveh,
for He saves the soul of the poor from the hand of the evil-doers."

This lament as to the hatred and persecution brought upon him by the
preaching of the word of the Lord, is chiefly called forth by the
proceedings, recounted in [Jer 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#001),
[Jer 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#002), of the temple-warden Pashur
against him. This is clear from the מגור ; for, as Nהg. truly remarks,
the use of this expression against the prophet may certainly be most
easily explained by the use he had so pregnantly made of it against one
so distinguished as Pashur. Besides, the bitterness of the complaint,
rising at last to the extent of cursing the day of his birth ([Jer
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#014).), is only intelligible as a
consequence of such ill-usage as Pashur had already inflicted on him.
For although his enemies had schemed against his life, they had never
yet ventured positively to lay hands on his person. Pashur first caused
him to be beaten, and then had him kept a whole night long in the
torture of the stocks. From torture like this his enemies might proceed
even to taking his life, if the Lord did not miraculously shield him
from their vengeance. - The complaint, [Jer
20:7-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#007), is an outpouring of the heart
to God, a prayer that begins with complaint, passes into confidence in
the Lord's protection, and ends in a triumph of hope. In [Jer
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#007) and [Jer
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#008) Jeremiah complains of the evil
consequences of his labours. God has persuaded him to undertake the
office of prophet, so that he has yielded to the call of God. The words
of [Jer 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#007) are not an upbraiding,
nor are they given in an upbraiding tone (Hitz.); for פּתּה does not
mean befool, but persuade, induce by words to do a thing. חזק used
transitively, but not as [Kg1 16:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#022),
overpower (Ros., Graf, etc.); for then it would not be in keeping with
the following ותּוּכל, which after "overpower" would seem very feeble.
It means: lay hold of; as usually in the Hiph., so here in Kal. It thus
corresponds to חזקת יד, [Isa 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#011),
denoting the state of being laid hold of by the power of the Spirit of
God in order to prophesy. תּוּכל, not: Thou hast been able, but: Thou
hast prevailed, conquered. A sharp contrast to this is presented by the
issue of his prophetic labours: I am become a laughing-stock all the
day, i.e., incessantly. כּלּה, its (the people's) entirety = all the
people. - In [Jer 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#008) "call" is
explained by "cry out violence and spoil:" complain of the violence and
spoliation that are practised. The word of Jahveh is become a reproach
and obloquy, i.e., the proclamation of it has brought him only contempt
and obloquy. The two cases of כּי are co-ordinate; the two clauses give
two reasons for everybody mocking at him. One is objective: so often as
he speaks he can do nothing but complain of violence, so that he is
ridiculed by the mass of the people; and one is subjective: his
preaching brings him only disgrace. Most comm. refer "violence and
spoiling" to the ill-usage the prophet experiences; but this does not
exhaust the reference of the words.

[Jer 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#009)

After such bitter experiences, the thought arose in his soul: I will
remember Him (Jahveh) no more, i.e., make no more mention of the Lord,
nor speak in His name, labour as a prophet; but it was within him as
burning fire. The subject is not expressed, but is, as Ros. and Hitz.
rightly say, the word of Jahveh which is held back. "Shut up in my
bones" is apposition to "burning fire," for אשׁ occurs elsewhere also as
masc., e.g., [Jer 48:45](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#045); [Job
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#026); [Psa
104:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#004). The word of God dwells in the
heart; but from there outwards it acts upon his whole organism, like a
fire shut up in the hollow of his bones, burning the marrow of them
([Job 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#024)), so that he can no longer
bear to keep silence. The perfects "and I said," "and (then) it was,"
"and I became weary," are to be taken as preterites, expressing events
that have several times been repeated, and so the final result is spoken
in the imperf. I cannot.

[Jer 20:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#010)

[Jer 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#010) gives the reason for the
resolution, adopted but not carried out, of speaking no more in the name
of the Lord. This was found in the reports that reached his ears of
schemes against his life. The first clause is a verbal quotation from
[Psa 31:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#014), a lament of David in the
time of Saul's persecutions. דּבּה, base, backbiting slander. The
phrase: Fear round about, indicates, in the form of a brief popular
saying, the dangerous case in which the prophet was,

(Note: Hupfeld on [Psa 31:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#014) holds
מגור מסּביב to be a proverbial expression for a harassed condition, full
of terrors, since the phrase is frequently used by Jeremiah (besides the
present [Jer 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#003), [Jer
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#004), and [Jer
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#015), it is at [Jer
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#025); [Jer
46:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#005); [Jer
49:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#029); [Lam
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#022)). The use made of it in v. 3
would in that case be easily understood. For we cannot infer, as Ng.
would do, that Jeremiah must have formed the phrase himself, from the
fact that, except in [Psa 31:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#014), it is
nowhere found but in Jeremiah.)

which his adversaries prepare for him by their repeating: Report him, we
will report him.

Report: here, report to the authorities as a dangerous man. Even those
who are on friendly terms with him lie in wait for his fall. This phrase
too is formed of phrases from the Psalms. On "am of my peace," cf. [Psa
41:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#010); on צלעי, [Psa
35:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#015); [Psa
38:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#018); and on שׁמר, watch, lie in wait
for, [Psa 56:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#007); [Psa
71:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#010). "Peradventure" - so they said -
"he may let himself be enticed," sc. to say something on which a capital
charge may be founded (Graf). With "that we may prevail against him,"
cf. [Jer 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#019); [Jer
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#020). - At [Jer
20:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#011) the lament rises into confidence
in the Lord, springing from the promise given to him by God at his call.
אותי (for אתּי) יהוה recalls [Jer
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#019); [Jer
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#020).The designation of God as גּבּור
is formed after [Jer 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#021). Because
the Lord has promised to deliver him out of the hand of the עריצים,
violent, he now calls him a hero using violence, and on this founds his
assurance that his persecutors will accomplish nothing, but will come to
a downfall, to shame, and be covered with never-dying,
never-to-be-forgotten disgrace. Because they have dealt not wisely,
i.e., foolishly, see on [Jer 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#021);
not: because they did not prosper, which would give a weak, superfluous
idea, since their not prospering lies already in בּושׁ, spe frustrari.
This disgrace will befall the persecutors, because the Lord of hosts
will, as Searcher of hearts, take the part of the righteous, and will
take vengeance on their foes. This is the force of [Jer
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#012), which, with a few changes, is
repeated from [Jer 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#020). - In this
trustfulness his soul rises to a firm hope of deliverance, so that in
[Jer 20:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#013) he can call on himself and
all the godly to praise God, the Saviour of the poor. Cf. [Psa
31:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#008); [Psa
35:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#009), [Psa
35:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#028), etc.

[Jer 20:14-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#014)

The day of his birth cursed. - [Jer
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#014). "Cursed be the day wherein I
was born! The day my mother bare me, let it not be blessed! [Jer
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#015). Cursed be the man that brought
the good tidings to my father, saying: A man-child is born to thee, who
made him very glad. [Jer 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#016). Let
that man be as the cities which Jahveh overthrew without repenting; let
him hear crying in the morning and a war-cry at noon-tide, [Jer
20:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#017). Because he slew me not from the
womb, and so my mother should have been my grave, and her womb should
have been always great. [Jer 20:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#018).
Wherefore am I come forth out of the womb to see hardship and sorrow,
and that my days should wear away in shame?"

Inasmuch as the foregoing lamentation had ended in assured hope of
deliverance, and in the praise rendered to God therefor, it seems
surprising that now there should follow curses on the day of his birth,
without any hint to show that at the end this temptation, too, had been
overcome. For this reason Ew. wishes to rearrange the two parts of the
complaint, setting [Jer 20:14-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#014)
before [Jer 20:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#007). This
transposition he holds to be so unquestionably certain, that he speaks
of the order ad numbering of the verses in the text as an example, clear
as it is remarkable, of displacement. But against this hypothesis we
have to consider the improbability that, if individual copyists had
omitted the second portion ([Jer
20:14-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#014)) or written it on the margin,
others should have introduced it into an unsuitable place. Copyists did
not go to work with the biblical text in such an arbitrary and clumsy
fashion. Nor is the position occupied by the piece in question so
incomprehensible as Ew. imagines. The cursing of the day of his birth,
or of his life, after the preceding exaltation to hopeful assurance is
not psychologically inconceivable. It may well be understood, if we but
think of the two parts of the lamentation as not following one another
in the prophet's soul in such immediate succession as they do in the
text; if we regard them as spiritual struggles, separated by an interval
of time, through which the prophet must successively pass. In
vanquishing the temptation that arose from the plots of his enemies
against his life, Jeremiah had a strong support in the promise which the
Lord gave him at his call, that those who strove against him should not
prevail against him; and the deliverance out of the hand of Pashur which
he had just experience, must have given him an actual proof that the
Lord was fulfilling His promise. The feeling of this might fill the
trembling heart with strength to conquer his temptation, and to elevate
himself again, in the joyful confidence of faith, to the praising of the
Lord, who delivers the soul of the poor from the hand of the ungodly.
But the power of the temptation was not finally vanquished by the
renewal of his confidence that the Lord will defend him against all his
foes. The unsuccess of his mission might stir up sore struggles in his
soul, and not only rob him of all heart to continue his labours, but
excite bitter discontent with a life full or hardship and sorrow - a
discontent which found vent in his cursing the day of his birth.

The curse uttered in [Jer 20:14-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#014)
against the day of his birth, while it reminds us of the verses, [Jer
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#003)., in which Job curses the day of
his conception and of his birth, is markedly distinguished in form and
substance from that dreadful utterance of Job's. Job's words are much
more violent and passionate, and are turned directly against God, who
has given life to him, to a man whose way is hid, whom God hath hedged
round. Jeremiah, on the other hand, curses first the day of his birth
([Jer 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#014)), then the man that
brought his father the joyful news of the birth of a son ([Jer
20:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#015)), because his life is passing
away in hardship, trials, sorrow, and shame, without expressly blaming
God as the author of that life.

[Jer 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#014)

The day on which I was born, let it be cursed and not blessed, sc.
because life has never been a blessing to me. Job wishes that the day of
his birth and the night of his conception may perish, be annihilated.

[Jer 20:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#015)

In the curse on the man that brought the father the news of the birth,
the stress lies on the clause, "who made him very glad," which goes to
strengthen בּשּׂר, εὐαγγελίζεσθαι, a clause which is subordinated to the
principal clause without any grammatical connection (cf. Ew. 341, b).
The joy that man gave the father by his news is become to the son a
source of bitter grief.

[Jer 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#016)

He wishes the fate of Sodom ([Gen
19:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#025)), namely ruin, to befall that
man. ולא נחם, and may He (Jahveh) not let it repent Him, is adverbially
used: without feeling compunction for the destruction, i.e., without
pity. In [Jer 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#016) destruction is
depicted under the figure of the terrors of a town beleaguered by
enemies and suddenly taken. זעקה, the wailing cry of the afflicted
townspeople; תּרוּעה, the war-cry of the enemies breaking in; cf. [Jer
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#008).

[Jer 20:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#017)

tells why the curse should fall on that man: because (אשׁר, causal) he
slew me not from the womb, i.e., according to what follows: while yet in
the womb, and so (ותּהי with ו consec.) my mother would have become my
grave. Logically considered, the subject to מותתני can only be the man
on whom the curse of [Jer 20:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#015) is
pronounced. But how could the man kill the child in the mother's womb?
This consideration has given occasion to various untenable renderings.
Some have taken "from the womb," according to [Job
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#011), in the sense: immediately after
birth, simul ac ex utero exiissem (Ros.). This is grammatically fair
enough, but it does not fall in with the context; for then the following
Vav consec. must be taken as having the negative force "or rather," the
negation being repeated in the next clause again (Ros., Graf). Both
these cases are grammatically inadmissible. Others would supply "Jahveh"
as subject to מותתני, or take the verb as with indefinite subject, or as
passive. But to supply "Jahveh" is quite arbitrary; and against the
passive construction it must be said that thus the causal nexus,
indicated by אשׁר, between the man on whom the curse is to fall and the
slaying of the child is done away with, and all connection for the אשׁר
with what precedes would be lost. The difficulty arising from simply
accepting the literal meaning is solved by the consideration, that the
curse is not levelled against any one particular person. The man that
was present at the birth, so as to be able to bring the father the news
of it, might have killed the child in the mother's womb. Jeremiah is as
little thinking how this could happen as, in the next words, he is of
the possibility of everlasting pregnancy. His words must be taken
rhetorically, not physiologically. That pregnancy is everlasting that
has no birth at the end of it. - In [Jer
20:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#018) a reason for the curse is given,
in that birth had brought him only a life of hardship and sorrow. To see
hardship, i.e., experience, endure it. His days pass away, vanish in
shame, i.e., shame at the discomfiture of hopes; for his life-calling
produces no fruit, his prophetic work is in vain, since he cannot save
his people from destruction.

The curse on the day of birth closes with a sigh at the wretchedness of
life, without any hint that he again rises to new joyful faith, and
without God's reprimanding him for his discontent as in [Jer
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#019). This difficulty the comm. have
not touched upon; they have considered only the questions: how at all
such a curse in the mouth of a prophet is to be defended; and whether it
is in its right place in this connection, immediately after the words so
full of hope as [Jer 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#011). (cf. Ng.).
The latter question we have already discussed art the beginning of the
exposition of these verses. As to the first, opinions differ. Some take
the curse to be a purely rhetorical form, having no object whatsoever.
For, it is said, the long past day of his birth is as little an object
on which the curse could really fall, as is the man who told his father
of the birth of a son - a man who in all probability never had a real
existence (Ng.). To this view, ventured so early as Origen, Cor. a Lap.
has justly answered: obstat, quod dies illa exstiterit fueritque
creatura Dei; non licet autem maledicere alicui creaturae Dei, sive illa
praesens sit sive praeterita. Others, as Calv., espied in this cursing
quasi sacrilegum furorem, and try to excuse it on the ground that the
principium hujus zeli was justifiable, because Jeremiah cursed the day
of his birth not because of personal sufferings, sicknesses, poverty,
and the like, but quoniam videret se perdere operam, quum tamen
fideliter studeret eam impendere in salutem populi, deinde quum videret
doctrinam Dei obnoxiam esse probris et vituperationibus, quum videret
impios ita procaciter insurgere, quum videret totam pietatem ita haberi
ludibrio. But the sentence passed, that the prophet gravissime
peccaverit ut esset contumeliosus in Deu, is too severe one, as is also
that of the Berleburg Bible, that "Jeremiah therein stands for an
example of warning to all faithful witnesses for the truth, showing that
they should not be impatient of the reproach, contempt, derision, and
mockery that befall them on that account, if God's long-suffering bears
with the mockers so long, and ever delays His judgments." For had
Jeremiah sinned so grievously, God would certainly have reproached him
with his wrong-doing, as in [Jer
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#019). Since that is not here the
case, we are not entitled to make out his words to be a beacon of
warning to all witnesses for the truth. Certainly this imprecation was
not written fore our imitation; for it is doubtless an infirmitas, as
Seb. Schm. called it - an outbreak of the striving of the flesh against
the spirit. But it should be to us a source of instruction and comfort.
From it we should, on the one hand, learn the full weight of the
temptation, so that we may arm ourselves with prayer in faith as a
weapon against the power of the tempter; on the other hand, we should
see the greatness of God's grace, which raises again those that are
stumbling to their fall, and does not let God's true servants succumb
under the temptation, as we gather from the fact, that the Lord does not
cast off His servant, but gives him the needed strength for carrying on
the heavy labours of his office. - The difficulty that there is no
answer from the Lord to this complaint, neither by way of reprimand nor
of consolation, as in [Jer 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#005)., [Jer
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#010), [Jer
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#019)., is solved when we consider
that at his former complainings the Lord had said to him all that was
needed to comfort him and raise him up again. A repetition of those
promises would have soothed his bitterness of spirit for a time,
perhaps, but not permanently. For the latter purpose the Lord was
silent, and left him time to conquer from within the temptation that was
crushing him down, by recalling calmly the help from God he had so often
hitherto experienced in his labours, especially as the time was now not
far distant in which, by the bursting of the threatened judgment on
Jerusalem and Judah, he should not only be justified before his
adversaries, but also perceive that his labour had not been in vain. And
that Jeremiah did indeed victoriously struggle against this temptation,
we may gather from remembering that hereafter, when, especially during
the siege of Jerusalem under Zedekiah, he had still sorer afflictions to
endure, he no longer trembles or bewails the sufferings connected with
his calling.
