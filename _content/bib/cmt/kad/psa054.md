### [Psalms Chapter 54](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 54:0</span></span>

Consolation in the Presence of Bloodthirsty Adversaries

(In the Hebrew, [Psa 54:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#001) comprise
the designation 'To the leader, with the accompaniment of stringed
instruments, a Maskil of David...'; from then on [Psa
54:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#001) in English translation
corresponds to vv. 3-9 in the Hebrew)

Here again we have one of the eight Psalms dates from the time of Saul's
persecution - a Maskı̂l, like the two preceding Psalms, and having points
of close contact both with [Psa 53:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#001)
(cf. [Psa 54:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#005) with [Psa
53:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#003)) and with [Psa
52:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#001) (cf. the resemblance in the
closing words of. v. 8 and Ps 52:11): To the Precentor, with the
accompaniment of stringed instruments (vid., on [Psa
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#001)), a meditation, by David, when the
Ziphites came and said to Saul: Is not David hidden among us? Abiathar,
the son of Ahimelech, had escaped to David, who with six hundred men was
then in the fortified town of Kela (Keilah), but received through
Abiathar the divine answer, that the inhabitants would give him up if
Saul should lay siege to the town. Thereupon we find him in the
wilderness of Zph; the Ziphites betray him and pledge themselves to
capture him, and thereby he is in the greatest straits, out of which he
was only rescued by an invasion of the Philistines, which compelled Saul
to retreat ([Sa1 23:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#019).). The same
history which the earlier narrator of the Books of Samuel relates here,
we meet with once more in 1 Sam. 26, related with fuller colouring. The
form of the inscription of the Psalm is word for word the same as both
in [Sa1 23:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#019) and in [Sa1
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#001); the annals are in all three
passages the ultimate source of the inscription.

[Psalms 54:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 54:1</span></span>

(Heb.: 54:3-5) This short song is divided into two parts by Sela The
first half prays for help and answer. The Name of God is the
manifestation of His nature, which has mercy as its central point (for
the Name of God is טּוב, v. 8, Ps 52:11), so that בּשׁמך (which is here
the parallel word to בּגבוּרתך) is consequently equivalent to בּחסדּך.
The obtaining of right for any one (דּין like שׁפט, [Psa
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#009), and frequently, עשׂה דּין, [Psa
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#005)) is attributed to the
all-conquering might of God, which is only one side of the divine Name,
i.e., of the divine nature which manifests itself in the diversity of
its attributes. האזין ([Psa 54:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#004)) is
construed with ל (cf. אל, [Psa 87:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#002))
like הטּה אזן, [Psa 78:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#001). The Targum,
misled by [Psa 86:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#014), reads זרים
instead of זרים in [Psa 54:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#005). The
inscription leads one to think of the Ziphites in particular in
connection with "strangers" and "violent men." The two words in most
instances denote foreign enemies, [Isa
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#002)., [Psa
29:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#005); [Eze
31:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#012); but זר is also a stranger in
the widest sense, regulated in each instance according to the opposite,
e.g., the non-priest, [Lev 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#010); and
one's fellow-countrymen can also turn out to be עריצים, [Jer
15:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#021). The Ziphites, although Judaeans
like David, might be called "strangers," because they had taken the side
against David; and "violent men," because they pledged themselves to
seize and deliver him up. Under other circumstances this might have been
their duty as subjects. In this instance, however, it was godlessness,
as [Psa 54:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#005) (cf. [Psa
86:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#014)) says. Any one at that time in
Israel who feared God more than man, could not lend himself to be made a
tool of Saul's blind fury. God had already manifestly enough
acknowledged David.

[Psalms 54:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 54:4</span></span>

(Heb.: 54:6-9) In this second half, the poet, in the certainty of being
heard, rejoices in help, and makes a vow of thanksgiving. The בּ of
בּסמכי is not meant to imply that God is one out of many who upheld his
threatened life; but rather that He comes within the category of such,
and fills it up in Himself alone, cf. [Psa
118:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#007); and for the origin of this Beth
essentiae, [Psa 99:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#006), [Jdg
11:35](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#035). In [Psa
54:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#007) the Kerמ merits the preference
over the Chethמb (evil shall "revert" to my spies), which would at least
require על instead of ל (cf. [Psa
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#017)). Concerning שׁררי, vid., on [Psa
27:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#011). In the rapid transition to
invocation in [Psa 54:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#007) the end of the
Psalm announces itself. The truth of God is not described as an
instrumental agent of the cutting off, but as an impelling cause. It is
the same Beth as in the expression בּנדבה ([Num
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#003)): by or out of free impulse.
These free-will sacrifices are not spiritual here in opposition to the
ritual sacrifices ([Psa 50:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#014)), but
ritual as an outward representation of the spiritual. The subject of
הצּילני is the Name of God; the post-biblical language, following [Lev
24:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#011), calls God straightway השּׁם,
and passages like [Isa 30:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#027) and the
one before us come very near to this usage. The praeterites mention the
ground of the thanksgiving. What David now still hopes for will then lie
behind him in the past. The closing line, v. 9b, recalls [Psa
35:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#021), cf. [Psa
59:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#011); [Psa
92:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#012); the invoking of the curse upon
his enemies in v. 8 recalls [Psa
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#013); [Psa
56:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#008); [Psa
59:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#012).; and the vow of thanksgiving in
v. 8 recalls [Psa 22:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#026); [Psa
35:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#018); [Psa
40:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#010).
