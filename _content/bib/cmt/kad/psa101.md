### [Psalms Chapter 101](../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#001)

[Psalms 101:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 101:1</span></span>

This is the "prince's Psalm,"

(Note: Eyring, in his Vita of Ernest the Pious Duke of Saxe-Gotha, v.
1601, d. 1675, relates that he sent an unfaithful minister a copy of the
101st Psalm, and that it became a proverb in the country, when an
official had done anything wrong: He will certainty soon receive the
prince's Psalm to read.)

or as it is inscribed in Luther's version, "David's mirror of a
monarch." Can there be any more appropriate motto for it than what is
said of Jahve's government in [Psa
99:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#004)? In respect of this passage of
[Psa 99:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#001), to which [Psa
100:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa100.htm#001) is the finale, [Psa
101:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#001) seems to be appended as an
echo out of the heart of David. The appropriateness of the words לדוד
מזמור (the position of the words is as in [Psa
24:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#001); 40; 109:1-110:7; 139) is
corroborated by the form and contents. Probably the great historical
work from which the chronicler has taken excerpts furnished the
post-exilic collector with a further gleaning of Davidic songs, or at
least songs that were ascribed to David. The Psalm before us belongs to
the time during which the Ark was in the house of Obed-Edom, where David
had left it behind through terror at the misfortune of Uzzah. David said
at that time: "How shall the Ark of Jahve come to me (the unholy one)?"
[Sa2 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#008). He did not venture to bring
the Ark of the Fearful and Holy One within the range of his own house.
In our Psalm, however, he gives utterance to his determination as king
to give earnest heed to the sanctity of his walk, of his rule, and of
his house; and this resolve he brings before Jahve as a vow, to whom, in
regard to the rich blessing which the Ark of God diffuses around it
([Sa2 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#011).), he longingly sighs:
"When wilt Thou come to me?!" This contemporaneous reference has been
recognised by Hammond and Venema. From the fact that Jahve comes to
David, Jerusalem becomes "the city of Jahve," [Psa
101:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#008); and to defend the holiness of
this the city of His habitation in all faithfulness, and with all his
might, is the thing to which David here pledges himself.

The contents of the first verse refer not merely to the Psalm that
follows as an announcement of its theme, but to David's whole life:
graciousness and right, the self-manifestations united ideally and, for
the king who governs His people, typically in Jahve, shall be the
subject of his song. Jahve, the primal source of graciousness and of
right, it shall be, to whom he consecrates his poetic talent, as also
his playing upon the harp. חסד is condescension which flows from the
principle of free love, and משׁפּט legality which binds itself
impartially and uncapriciously to the rule (norm) of that which is right
and good. They are two modes of conduct, mutually tempering each other,
which God requires of every man ([Mic
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#008), cf. [Mat
23:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#023) : τὴν κρίσιν καὶ τὸν ἔλεον), and
more especially of a king. Further, he has resolved to give heed,
thoughtfully and with an endeavour to pursue it (השׂכּיל בּ as in [Dan
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#013)), unto the way of that which is
perfect, i.e., blameless. What is further said might now be rendered as
a relative clause: when Thou comest to me. But not until then?! Hitzig
renders it differently: I will take up the lot of the just when it comes
to me, i.e., as often as it is brought to my knowledge. But if this had
been the meaning, בּדבר would have been said instead of בּדרך ([Exo
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#016), [Exo
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#019); [Sa2
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#012) \[11\]); for, according to both
its parts, the expression דוך תמים is an ethical notion, and is
therefore not used in a different sense from that in [Psa
101:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#006). Moreover, the relative use of
the interrogative מתי in Hebrew cannot be supported, with the exception,
perhaps, of [Pro 23:35](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#035). Athanasius
correctly interprets: ποθῶ σου τὴν παρουσίαν, ὦ δέσποτα, ἱμείρομαί σου
τῆς ἐπιφανείας, ἀλλὰ δὸς τὸ ποθούμενον. It is a question of strong
yearning: when wilt Thou come to me? is the time near at hand when Thou
wilt erect Thy throne near to me? If his longing should be fulfilled,
David is resolved to, and will then, behave himself as he further sets
forth in the vows he makes. He pledges himself to walk within his house,
i.e., his palace, in the innocence or simplicity of his heart ([Psa
78:72](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#072); [Pro
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#007)), without allowing himself to be
led away from this frame of mind which has become his through grace. He
will not set before his eyes, viz., as a proposition or purpose ([Deu
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#009); [Exo
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#010); [Sa1
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#010), lxx), any morally worthless or
vile matter whatsoever ([Psa 41:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#008), cf.
concerning בליּעל, [Psa 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#005)). The
commission of excesses he hates: עשׂה is infin. constr. instead of עשׂות
as in [Gen 31:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#028); [Gen
50:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#020); [Pro
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#003), cf. ראה [Gen
48:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#011), שׁתו [Pro
31:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#004). סטים (like שׂטים in [Hos
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#002)), as the object of עשׂה, has not a
personal (Kimchi, Ewald) signification (cf. on the other hand [Psa
40:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#005)), but material signification:
(facta) declinantia (like זדים, [Psa
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#013), insolentia; הבלים, [Zac
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#007), vincientia); all temptations and
incitements of this sort he shakes off from himself, so that nothing of
the kind cleaves to him. The confessions in [Psa
101:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#004) refer to his own inward nature:
לב עקּשׁ (not עקּשׁ־לב, [Pro 17:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#020)), a
false heart that is not faithful in its intentions either to God or to
men, shall remain far from him; wickedness (רע as in [Psa
36:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#005)) he does not wish to know, i.e.,
does not wish to foster and nurture within him. Whoso secretly slanders
his neighbour, him will he destroy; it will therefore be so little
possible for any to curry favour with him by uncharitable perfidious
tale-bearing, of the wiliness of which David himself had had abundant
experience in his relation to Saul, that it will rather call forth his
anger upon him ([Pro 30:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#010)). Instead
of the regularly pointed מלושׁני the Ker reads מלשׁני, melŏshnı̂, a Poel
(לשׁן linguâ petere, like עין oculo petere, elsewhere הלשׁין, [Pro
30:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#010)) with ŏ instead of ō (vid., on
[Psa 109:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#010); [Psa
62:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#004)) and with Chirek compaginis
(vid., on [Psa 113:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#001)). The "lofty of
eyes," i.e., supercilious, haughty, and the "broad of heart," i.e.,
boastful, puffed up, self-conceited ([Pro
28:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#025), cf. [Psa
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#004)), him he cannot endure (אוּכל,
properly fut. Hoph., I am incapable of, viz., לשׂאת, which is to be
supplied as in [Isa 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#013), after [Pro
30:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#021); [Jer
44:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#022)).

(Note: In both instances the Masora writes אותו (plene), but the Talmud,
B. Erachin 15b, had אתו before it when it says: "Of the slanderer God
says: I and he cannot dwell together in the world, I cannot bear it any
longer with him (אתּו).")

On the other hand, his eyes rest upon the faithful of the land, with the
view, viz., of drawing them into his vicinity. Whoso walks in the way of
uprightness, he shall serve him (שׁרת, θεραπεύειν, akin to עבד,
δουλεύειν). He who practises deceit shall not stay within his house; he
who speaks lies shall have no continuance (יכּון is more than equivalent
to נכון) before (under) his eyes. Every morning (לבּקרים as in [Psa
73:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#014); [Isa
33:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#002); [Lam
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#023), and לבקרים, [Job
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#018)), when Jahve shall have taken up
His abode in Jerusalem, will he destroy all evil-doers (רשׁעי as in [Psa
119:119](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#119)), i.e., incorrigibly wicked
ones, wherever he may meet them upon the earth, in order that all
workers of evil may be rooted out of the royal city, which is now become
the city of Jahve.
