Service and Revenues of the Priests and Levites - Numbers 18

The practical confirmation of the priesthood of Aaron and his family, on
the part of God, is very appropriately followed by the legal regulations
concerning the official duties of the priest and Levites ([Num
18:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#001)), and the revenues to be
assigned them for their services (vv. 8-32), as the laws hitherto given
upon this subject, although they contain many isolated stipulations,
have not laid down any complete and comprehensive arrangement. The
instructions relating to this subject were addressed by Jehovah directly
to Aaron (see [Num 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#001) and [Num
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#008)), up to the law, that out of the
tenths which the Levites were to collect from the people, they were to
pay a tenth again to the priests; and this was addressed to Moses ([Num
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#025)), as the head of all Israel.

[Numbers 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 18:1</span></span>

The Official Duties and Rights of the Priests and Levites. - [Num
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#001). To impress upon the minds of the
priests and Levites the holiness and responsibility of their office, the
service of Aaron, of his sons, and of his father's house, i.e., of the
family of the Kohathites, is described as "bearing the iniquity of the
sanctuary," and the service which was peculiar to the Aaronides, as
"bearing the iniquity of their priesthood." "To bear the iniquity of the
sanctuary" signifies not only "to have to make expiation for all that
offended against the laws of the priests and the holy things, i.e., the
desecration of these" (Knobel), but "iniquity or transgression at the
sanctuary," i.e., the defilement of it by the sin of those who drew near
to the sanctuary; not only of the priests and Levites, but of the whole
people who defiled the sanctuary in the midst of them with its holy
vessels, not only by their sins ([Lev
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#006)), but even by their holy gifts
([Exo 28:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#038)), and thus brought guilt
upon the whole congregation, which the priests were to bear, i.e., to
take upon themselves and expunge, by virtue of the holiness and
sanctifying power communicated to their office (see at [Exo
28:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#038)). The "iniquity of the
priesthood," however, not only embraced every offence against the
priesthood, every neglect of the most scrupulous and conscientious
fulfilment of duty in connection with their office, but extended to all
the sin which attached to the official acts of the priests, on account
of the sinfulness of their nature. It was to wipe out these sins and
defilements, that the annual expiation of the holy things on the day of
atonement had been appointed ([Lev
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#016).). The father's house of Aaron,
i.e., the Levitical family of Kohath, was also to join in bearing the
iniquity of the sanctuary, because the oversight of the holy vessels of
the sanctuary devolved upon it ([Num
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#004).).

[Num 18:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#002)

Aaron was also to bring his (other) brethren (sc., to the sanctuary),
viz., the tribe of Levi, that is to say, the Gershonites and Merarites,
that they might attach themselves to him and serve him, both him (ואתּה)
and his sons, before the tent of testimony, and discharge the duties
that were binding upon them, according to [Num
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#024)., [Num
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#031). (cf. [Num
3:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#006); [Num
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#026)). Only they were not to come near
to the holy vessels and the altar, for that would bring death both upon
them and the priests (see at [Num
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#015)). On [Num
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#004), cf. [Num
1:53](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#053) and [Num
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#007).

[Num 18:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#005)

The charge of the sanctuary (i.e., the dwelling) and the altar (of
burnt-offering) devolved upon Aaron and his sons, that the wrath of God
might not come again upon the children of Israel (see [Num
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#019)), - namely, through such illegal
acts as Nadab and Abihu ([Lev 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#002)),
and the company of Korah ([Num 16:35](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#035)),
had committed. To this end God had handed over the Levites to them as a
gift, to be their assistants (see at [Num
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#009) and [Num
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#016), [Num
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#019)). But Aaron and his sons were to
attend to the priesthood "with regard to everything of the altar and
within the vail" (i.e., of the most holy place, see [Lev
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#012)). The allusion is to all the
priestly duties from the altar of burnt-offering to the most holy place,
including the holy place which lay between. This office, which brought
them into the closest fellowship with the Lord, was a favour accorded to
them by the grace of God. This is expressed in the words, "as a service
of gift (a service with which I present you) I give you the priesthood."
The last words in [Num 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#007) are the
same as in [Num 1:51](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#051); and "stranger"
(zar), as in [Lev 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#010).

[Numbers 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">num 18:8</span></span>

The Revenues of the Priests. - These are summed up in [Num
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#008) in these words, "I give thee the
keeping of My heave-offerings in all holy gifts for a portion, as an
eternal statute." The notion of משׁמרת, keeping, as in [Exo
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#006); [Exo
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#023), [Exo
16:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#032), is defined in the second
parallel clause as משׁחה, a portion (see at [Lev
7:35](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#035)). The priests were to keep all
the heave-offerings, as the portion which belonged to them, out of the
sacrificial gifts that the children of Israel offered to the Lord.
תּרוּמת, heave-offerings (see at [Exo
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#002), and [Lev
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#009)), is used here in the broadest
sense, as including all the holy gifts (kodashim, see [Lev
21:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#022)) which the Israelites lifted off
from their possessions and presented to the Lord (as in [Num
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#009)). Among these, for example, were,
first of all, the most holy gifts in the meat-offerings, sin-offerings,
and trespass-offerings ([Num 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#009),
[Num 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#010); see at [Lev
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#003)). The burnt-offerings are not
mentioned, because the whole of the flesh of these was burned upon the
altar, and the skin alone fell to the portion of the priest ([Lev
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#008)). "From the fire," sc., of the
altar. אשׁ, fire, is equivalent to אשּׁה ot , firing (see [Lev
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#009)). These gifts they were to eat, as
most holy, in a most holy place, i.e., in the court of the tabernacle
(see [Lev 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#009), [Lev
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#019); [Lev
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#006)), which is called "most holy"
here, to lay a stronger emphasis upon the precept. In the second place,
these gifts included also "the holy gifts;" viz., (a) ([Num
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#011)) the heave-offering of their
gifts in all wave-offerings (tenuphoth), i.e., the wave-breast and
heave-leg of the peace-offerings, and whatever else was waved in
connection with the sacrifices (see at [Lev
7:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#033)): these might be eaten by both
the male and female members of the priestly families, provided they were
legally clean ([Lev 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#003).); (b) ([Num
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#012)) the gifts of first-fruits: "all
the fat (i.e., the best, as in [Gen
45:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#018)) of oil, new wine, and corn,"
viz., ראשׁיתם, "the first of them," the בּכּוּרים, "the first-grown
fruits" of the land, and that of all the fruit of the ground ([Deu
26:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#002), [Deu
26:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#010); [Pro
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#009); [Eze
44:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#030)), corn, wine, oil, honey, and
tree-fruit ([Deu 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#008), compared with
[Lev 19:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#023)), which were offered,
according to [Ch2 31:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#005); [Neh
10:36](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#036), [Neh
10:38](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#038), Tob. 1:6, as first-fruits every
year (see Mishnah, Bikkur, i. 3, 10, where the first-fruits are
specified according to the productions mentioned in [Deu
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#008); the law prescribed nothing in
relation to the quantity of the different first-fruits, but left this
entirely to the offerer himself); (c) ([Num
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#014)) everything placed under a ban
(see at [Lev 27:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#028)); and (d) ([Num
18:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#015)) the first-born of man and
beast. The first-born of men and of unclean beasts were redeemed
according to [Num 3:47](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#047); [Exo
13:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#012), and [Lev
27:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#006), [Lev
27:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#027); but such as were fit for
sacrifice were actually offered, the blood being swung against the
altar, and the fat portions burned upon it, whilst the whole of the
flesh fell to the portion of the priests. So far as the redemption of
human beings was concerned ([Num
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#016)), they were "to redeem from the
monthly child," i.e., the first-born child as soon as it was a month
old.

[Numbers 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">num 18:19</span></span>

"All the holy heave-offerings" are not the thank-offerings (Knobel),
but, as in [Num 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#008), all the holy
gifts enumerated in [Num 18:9-18](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#009).
Jehovah gives these to the priests as an eternal claim. "An eternal
covenant of salt is this before Jehovah," for Aaron and his descendants.
A "covenant of salt;" equivalent to an indissoluble covenant, or
inviolable contract (see at [Lev
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#013)).

[Numbers 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">num 18:20</span></span>

For this reason, Aaron was to received no inheritance in the land among
the children of Israel. Aaron, as the head of the priests, represents
the whole priesthood; and with regard to the possession, the whole tribe
of Levi is placed, in [Num 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#023), on
an equality with the priests. The Levites were to receive no portion of
the land as an inheritance in Canaan (cf. [Num
26:62](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#062); [Deu
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#012); [Deu
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#027); [Jos
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#003)). Jehovah was the portion and
inheritance, not only of Aaron and his sons, but of the whole tribe of
Levi (cf. [Deu 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#009); [Deu
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#002); [Jos
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#033)); or, as it is expressed in [Jos
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#007), "the priesthood of Jehovah was
their inheritance," though not in the sense that Knobel supposes viz.,
"the priesthood with its revenues," which would make the expression
"Jehovah, the God of Israel" ([Jos
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#033)), to be metonymical for
"sacrificial gifts, first-fruits, and tenths." The possession of the
priests and Levites did not consist in the revenues assigned to them by
God, but in the possession of Jehovah, the God of Israel. In the same
sense in which the tribe of Levi was the peculiar possession of Jehovah
out of the whole of the people of possession, was Jehovah also the
peculiar possession of Levi; and just as the other tribes were to live
upon what was afforded by the land assigned them as a possession, Levi
was to live upon what Jehovah bestowed upon it. And inasmuch as not only
the whole land of the twelve tribes, with which Jehovah had enfeoffed
them, but the whole earth, belonged to Jehovah ([Exo
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005)), He was necessarily to be
regarded as the greatest possession of all, beyond which nothing greater
is conceivable, and in comparison with which every other possession is
to be regarded as nothing. Hence it was evidently the greatest privilege
and highest honour to have Him for a portion and possession (Bhr,
Symbolik, ii. p. 44). "For truly," as Masius writes (Com. on Josh.), "he
who possesses God possesses all things; and the worship (cultus) of Him
is infinitely fuller of delight, and far more productive, than the
cultivation (cultus) of any soil."

[Numbers 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">num 18:21</span></span>

Revenues of the Levites. - For (חלף, instead of, for) their service at
the tabernacle God assigns them "every tenth in Israel as an
inheritance." On the tenth, see at [Lev
27:30-33](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#030). The institution and
description of their service in [Num
18:22](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#022) and [Num
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#023) is the same as that in [Num
1:53](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#053) and [Num
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#019). "Lest they bear sin:" see at
[Lev 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#017).

[Numbers 18:25](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">num 18:25</span></span>

Appropriation of the Tithe. - [Num
18:26](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#026). When the Levites took
(received) from the people the tithe assigned them by Jehovah, they were
to lift off from it a heave-offering for Jehovah, a tithe of the tithe
for Aaron the priest (i.e., for the priesthood; see at [Num
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#020)). "Your heave-offering shall be
reckoned to you as the corn of the threshing-floor, and the fulness (see
[Exo 22:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#028)) of the wine-press," i.e.,
according to [Num 18:30](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#030), as the
revenue of the threshing-floor and wine-press; that is to say, as corn
and wine which they had reaped themselves.

[Numbers 18:29](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">num 18:29</span></span>

The whole of this heave-offering of Jehovah, i.e., the tithe of the
tithe, they were to lift off from all their gifts, from all the tithes
of the people which they received; "of all the fat of it," i.e., of all
the best of the heave-offering they received, they were to lift off
את־מקדּשׁו, "its holy," i.e., the holy part, which was to be dedicated
to Jehovah.

[Numbers 18:30](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">num 18:30</span></span>

They might eat it (the tithe they had received, after taking off the
priests' tithe) in any place with their families, as it was the reward
for their service at the tabernacle.

[Numbers 18:32](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">num 18:32</span></span>

They would load no sin upon themselves by so doing (see [Lev
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#017)), if they only lifted off the
best as tithe (for the priest), and did not desecrate the holy gifts,
sc., by eating in all kinds of places, which was not allowed, according
to [Num 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#010), with regard to the most
holy gifts. These regulations concerning the revenues of the priests and
Levites were in perfect accordance with the true idea of the Israelitish
kingdom of God. Whereas in heathen states, where there was an hereditary
priestly caste, that caste was generally a rich one, and held a firm
possession in the soil (in Egypt, for example; see at [Gen
47:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#022)), the Levites received no
hereditary landed property in the land of Israel, but only towns to
dwell in among the other tribes, with pasturage for their cattle (ch.
35), because Jehovah, the God of Israel, would be their inheritance. In
this way their earthly existence as based upon the spiritual ground and
soil of faith, in accordance with the calling assigned them to be the
guardians and promoters of the commandments, statutes, and rights of
Jehovah; and their authority and influence among the people were bound
up with their unreserved surrender of themselves to the Lord, and their
firm reliance upon the possession of their God. Now, whilst this
position was to be a constant incitement to the Levites to surrender
themselves entirely to the Lord and His service, it was also to become
to the whole nation a constant admonition, inasmuch as it was a
prerogative conferred upon them by the Lord, to seek the highest of all
good in the possession of the Lord, as its portion and inheritance. -
The revenue itself, however, which the Lord assigned to the Levites and
priests, as His servants, consisting of the tenths and first-fruits, as
well as certain portions of the different sacrificial gifts that were
offered to Him, appears to have been a very considerable one, especially
if we adopt the computation of J. D. Michaelis (Mos. Recht. i. 52) with
reference to the tithes. "A tribe," he says, "which had only 22,000
males in it (23,000 afterwards), and therefore could hardly have
numbered more than 12,000 grown-up men, received the tithes of 600,000
Israelites; consequently one single Levite, without the slightest
necessity for sowing, and without any of the expenses of agriculture,
reaped or received from the produce of the flocks and herds as much as
five of the other Israelites." But this leaves out of sight the fact
that tithes are never paid so exactly as this, and that no doubt there
was as little conscientiousness in the matter then as there is at the
present day, when those who are entitled to receive a tenth often
receive even less than a twentieth. Moreover, the revenue of the tribe,
which the Lord had chosen as His own peculiar possession, was not
intended to be a miserable and beggarly one; but it was hardly equal, at
any time, to the revenues which the priestly castes of other nations
derived from their endowments. Again, the Levites had to give up the
tenth of all the tithes they received to the priests; and the priests
were to offer to Jehovah upon the altar a portion of the first-fruits,
heave-offerings, and wave-offerings that were assigned to them.
Consequently, as the whole nation was to make a practical
acknowledgment, in the presentation of the tithe and first-fruits, that
it had received its hereditary property as a fief from the Lord its God,
so the Levites, by their payment of the tenth to the priests, and the
priests, by presenting a portion of their revenues upon the altar, were
to make a practical confession that they had received all their revenues
from the Lord their God, and owed Him praise and adoration in return
(see Bhr, Symbolik, ii. pp. 43ff.).
