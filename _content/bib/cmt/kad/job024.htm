<p>  1  Wherefore are not bounds reserved by the Almighty,
<p>And they who honour Him see not His days?
<p>  2  They remove the landmarks,
<p>They steal flocks and shepherd them.
<p>  3  They carry away the ass of the orphan,
<p>And distrain the ox of the widow.
<p>  4  They thrust the needy out of the way,
<p>The poor of the land are obliged to slink away together.
<p>The supposition that the text originally stood &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506; &#1500;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497; is natural; but it is at once destroyed by the fact that <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#001">Job 24:1</A> becomes thereby disproportionately long, and yet cannot be divided into two lines of comparatively independent contents. In fact, &#1500;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; is by no means absolutely necessary. The usage of the language assumes it, according to which &#1488;&#1514; followed by the genitive signifies the point of time at which any one's fate is decided. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#022">Isa 13:22</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#007">Jer 27:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#003">Eze 22:3</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#003">Eze 30:3</A>; the period when reckoning is made, or even the terminus ad quem, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#012">Ecc 9:12</A>; and ywm followed by the gen. of a man, the day of his end, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#032">Job 15:32</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#020">Job 18:20</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#030">Eze 21:30</A>, and freq.; or with &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;, the day when God's judgment is revealed, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#015">Joe 1:15</A>, and freq. The boldness of poetic language goes beyond this usage, by using &#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; directly of the period of punishment, as is almost universally acknowledged since Schultens' day, and &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1493; dna ,y of God's days of judgment or of vengeance;
<p>(Note: On &#1506;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;, in the sense of times of retribution, Wetzstein compares the Arab. &#8219;ida&#770;t, which signifies predetermined reward or punishment; moreover, &#1506;&#1514; is derived from &#1506;&#1491;&#1514; (from &#1493;&#1506;&#1491;), and &#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; is equivalent to &#1506;&#1491;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, according to the same law of assimilation, by which now-a-days they say &#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; instead of &#1500;&#1491;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; (one who is born on the same day with me, from Arab. lidat, lida), and &#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; instead of &#1512;&#1491;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; (my drinking-time), since the assimilation of the &#1491; takes place everywhere where &#1514; is pronounced. The &#1514; of the feminine termination in &#1506;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;, as in &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1514;&#1493;&#1514; and the like, perhaps also in &#1489;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; (ba&#770;ttim), is amalgamated with the root.)
<p>and it is the less ambiguous, since &#1510;&#1508;&#1503;, in the sense of the divine predetermination of what is future, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#020">Job 15:20</A>, especially of God's storing up merited punishment, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#019">Job 21:19</A>, is an acknowledged word of our poet. On &#1502;&#1503; with the passive, vid., Ew. 295, c (where, however, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#004">Job 28:4</A> is erroneously cited in its favour); it is never more than equivalent to &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;, for to use &#1502;&#1503; directly as &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769; with the passive is admissible neither in Hebrew nor in Arabic. &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1493; (Keri &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1497;&#1493;, for which the Targ. unsuitably reads &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1497;) are, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#011">Psa 36:11</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#004">Psa 87:4</A>, comp. supra, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#021">Job 18:21</A>, those who know God, not merely superficially, but from experience of His ways, consequently those who are in fellowship with Him. &#1500;&#1488; &#1495;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468; is to be written with Zinnorith over the &#1500;&#1488;, and Mercha by the first syllable of &#1495;&#1494;&#1493;. The Zinnorith necessitates the retreat of the tone of &#1495;&#1494;&#1493; to its first syllable, as in &#1499;&#1497;&#1470;&#1495;&#1512;&#1492;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#008">Psa 18:8</A> (Br's Pslaterium, p. xiii.); for if &#1495;&#1494;&#1493; remained Milra, &#1500;&#1488; ought to be connected with it by Makkeph, and consequently remain toneless (Psalter, ii. 507).
<p>Next follows the description of the moral, abhorrence which, while the friends (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#019">Job 22:19</A>) maintain a divine retribution everywhere manifest, is painfully conscious of the absence of any determination of the periods and days of judicial punishment. Fearlessly and unpunished, the oppression of the helpless and defenceless, though deserving of a curse, rages in every form. They remove the landmarks; comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#017">Deu 27:17</A>, "Cursed is he who removeth his neighbour's landmark" (&#1502;&#1505;&#1468;&#1497;&#1490;, here once written with &#1513;&#1474;, while otherwise &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1497;&#1490; from &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1490; signifies assequi, on the other hand &#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1497;&#1490; from &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1490; signifies dimovere). They steal flocks, &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;, i.e., they are so barefaced, that after they have stolen them they pasture them openly. The ass of the orphans, the one that is their whole possession, and their only beast for labour, they carry away as prey (&#1504;&#1492;&#1490;, as e.g., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#004">Isa 20:4</A>); they distrain, i.e., take away with them as a pledge (on &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;, to bind by a pledge, obstringere, and also to take as a pledge, vid., on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#006">Job 22:6</A>, and Khler on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#007">Zac 11:7</A>), the yoke-ox of the widow (this is the exact meaning of &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1512;, as of the Arab. tho&#770;r). They turn the needy aside from the way which they are going, so that they are obliged to wander hither and thither without home or right: the poor of the land are obliged to hide themselves altogether. The Hiph. &#1492;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492;, with &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; as its obj., is used as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#012">Amo 5:12</A>; there it is used of turning away from a right that belongs to them, here of turning out of the way into trackless regions. &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; (vid., on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#016">Job 29:16</A>) here, as frequently, is the parallel word with &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;, the humble one, the patient sufferer; instead of which the Keri is &#1506;&#1504;&#1497;, the humbled, bowed down with suffering (vid., on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#013">Psa 9:13</A>). &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1497;&#1470;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; without any Keri in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#010">Psa 76:10</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#003">Zep 2:3</A>, and might less suitably appear here, where it is not so much the moral attribute as the outward condition that is intended to be described. The Pual &#1495;&#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; describes that which they are forced to do.
<p>The description of these unfortunate ones is now continued; and by a comparison with <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#001">Job 30:1-8</A>, it is probable that aborigines who are turned out of their original possessions and dwellings are intended (comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#019">Job 15:19</A>, according to which the poet takes his stand in an age in which the original relations of the races had been already disturbed by the calamities of war and the incursions of aliens). If the central point of the narrative lies in Haurn, or, more exactly, in the Nukra, it is natural, with Wetzstein, to think of the Arab. 'hl 'l-wukr or &#8219;rb 'l-h&#803;ujr, i.e., the (perhaps Ituraean) "races of the caves" in Trachonitis. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#005">Job 24:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">job 24:5</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>  5  Behold, as wild asses in the desert,
<p>They go forth in their work seeking for prey,
<p>The steppe is food to them for the children.
<p>  6  In the field they reap the fodder for his cattle,
<p>And they glean the vineyard of the evil-doer.
<p>  7  They pass the night in nakedness without a garment,
<p>And have no covering in the cold.
<p>  8  They are wet with the torrents of rain upon the mountains,
<p>And they hug the rocks for want of shelter.
<p>The poet could only draw such a picture as this, after having himself seen the home of his hero, and the calamitous fate of such as were driven forth from their original abodes to live a vagrant, poverty-stricken gipsy life. By <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#005">Job 24:5</A>, one is reminded of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#021">Psa 104:21-23</A>, especially since in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#011">Job 24:11</A> of this Psalm the &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;, onagri (Kulans), are mentioned, - those beautiful animals
<p>(Note: Layard, New Discoveries, p. 270, describes these wild asses' colts. The Arabic name is like the Hebrew, el-fera&#770;, or also hima&#770;r el-wahsh, i.e., wild ass, as we have translated, whose home is on the steppe. For fuller particulars, vid., Wetzstein's note on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#005">Job 39:5</A>.)
<p>which, while young, as difficult to be broken in, and when grown up are difficult to be caught; which in their love of freedom are an image of the Beduin, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#012">Gen 16:12</A>; their untractableness an image of that which cannot be bound, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#012">Job 11:12</A>; and from their roaming about in herds in waste regions, are here an image of a gregarious, vagrant, and freebooter kind of life. The old expositors, as also Rosenm., Umbr., Arnh., and Vaih., are mistaken in thinking that aliud hominum sceleratorum genus is described in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#005">Job 24:5</A>. Ewald and Hirz. were the first to perceive that <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#005">Job 24:5</A> is the further development of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#004">Job 24:4</A>, and that here, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#001">Job 30:1</A>, those who are driven back into the wastes and caves, and a remnant of the ejected and oppressed aborigines who drag out a miserable existence, are described.
<p>The accentuation rightly connects &#1508;&#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1502;&#1491;&#1489;&#1512;; by the omission of the Caph similit., as e.g., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#012">Isa 51:12</A>, the comparison (like a wild ass) becomes an equalization (as a wild ass). The perf. &#1497;&#1510;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; is a general uncoloured expression of that which is usual: they go forth &#1489;&#1508;&#1506;&#1500;&#1501;, in their work (not: to their work, as the Psalmist, in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#023">Psa 104:23</A>, expresses himself, exchanging &#1489; for &#1500;). &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497; &#1500;&#1496;&#1468;&#1512;&#1507;,  searching after prey, i.e., to satisfy their hunger (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#021">Psa 104:21</A>), from &#1496;&#1512;&#1507;, in the primary signification decerpere (vid., Hupfeld on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#003">Psa 7:3</A>), describes that which in general forms their daily occupation as they roam about; the constructivus is used here, without any proper genitive relation, as a form of connection, according to Ges. 116, 1. The idea of waylaying is not to be connected with the expression. Job describes those who are perishing in want and misery, not so much as those who themselves are guilty of evil practices, as those who have been brought down to poverty by the wrongdoing of others. As is implied in &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497; (comp. the morning <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#002">Psa 63:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#009">Isa 26:9</A>), Job describes their going forth in the early morning; the children (&#1504;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#019">Job 1:19</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#005">Job 29:5</A>) are those who first feel the pangs of hunger. &#1500;&#1493; refers individually to the father in the company: the steppe (with its scant supply of roots and herbs) is to him food for the children; he snatches it from it, it must furnish it for him. The idea is not: for himself and his family (Hirz., Hahn, and others); for v. 6, which has been much misunderstood, describes how they, particularly the adults, obtain their necessary subsistence. There is no MS authority for reading &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1470;&#1500;&#1493; instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;; the translation "what is not to him" (lxx, Targ., and partially also the Syriac version) is therefore to be rejected. Raschi correctly interprets &#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1500;&#1493; as a general explanation, and Ralbag &#1514;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1493;: it is, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#005">Job 6:5</A>, mixed fodder for cattle, farrago, consisting of oats or barley sown among vetches and beans, that is intended. The meaning is not, however, as most expositors explain it, that they seek to satisfy their hunger with food for cattle grown in the fields of the rich evil-doer; for &#1511;&#1510;&#1512; does not signify to sweep together, but to reap in an orderly manner; and if they meant to steal, why did they not seize the better portion of the produce? It is correct to take the suff. as referring to the &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; which is mentioned in the next clause, but it is not to be understood that they plunder his fields per nefas; on the contrary, that he hires them to cut the fodder for his cattle, but does not like to entrust the reaping of the better kinds of corn to them. It is impracticable to press the Hiph. &#1497;&#1511;&#1510;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493; of the Chethib to favour this rendering; on the contrary, &#1492;&#1511;&#1510;&#1497;&#1512; stands to &#1511;&#1510;&#1512; in like (not causative) signification as &#1492;&#1504;&#1495;&#1492; to &#1504;&#1495;&#1492; (vid., on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#018">Job 31:18</A>). In like manner, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#006">Job 24:6</A> is to be understood of hired labour. The rich man prudently hesitates to employ these poor people as vintagers; but he makes use of their labour (whilst his own men are fully employed at the wine-vats) to gather the straggling grapes which ripen late, and were therefore left at the vintage season. the older expositors are reminded of &#1500;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;, late hay, and explain &#1497;&#1500;&#1511;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468; as denom. by &#1497;&#1499;&#1512;&#1514;&#1493; &#1500;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; (Aben-Ezra, Immanuel, and others) or &#1497;&#1488;&#1499;&#1500;&#1493; &#1500;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; (Parchon); but how unnatural to think of the second mowing, or even of eating the after-growth of grass, where the vineyard is the subject referred to! On the contrary, &#1500;&#1511;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; signifies, as it were, serotinare, i.e., serotinos fructus colligere (Rosenm.):
<p>(Note: In the idiom of Hauran, &#1500;&#1511;&#1513;&#1474;, fut. i, signifies to be late, to come late; in Piel, to delay, e.g., the evening meal, return, etc.; in Hithpa. telaqqas, to arrive too late. Hence laq&#305;&#770;s &#1500;&#1511;&#1497;&#1513;&#1474; and loqs&#305;&#770; &#1500;&#1511;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;, delayed, of any matter, e.g., &#1500;&#1511;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; and &#1494;&#1512;&#1506; &#1500;&#1511;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;, late seed (= &#1500;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#001">Amo 7:1</A>, in connection with which the late rain in April, which often fails, is reckoned on), &#1493;&#1500;&#1491; &#1500;&#1511;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;, a child born late (i.e., in old age); bak&#305;&#770;r &#1489;&#1499;&#1497;&#1512; and bekr&#305;&#770; &#1489;&#1499;&#1512;&#1497; are the opposites in every signification. - Wetzst.)
<p>this is the work which the rich man assigns to them, because he gains by it, and even in the worst case can lose but little.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#007">Job 30:7</A> tell how miserably they are obliged to shift for themselves during this autumnal season of labour, and also at other times. Naked (&#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1501;, whether an adverbial form or not, is conceived of after the manner of an accusative: in a naked, stripped condition, Arabic &#8219;urja&#770;nan) they pass the night, without having anything on the body (on &#1500;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, vid., on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#019">Psa 22:19</A>), and they have no (&#1488;&#1497;&#1503; supply &#1500;&#1492;&#1501;) covering or veil (corresponding to the notion of &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1491;) in the cold.
<p>(Note: All the Beduins sleep naked at night. I once asked why they do this, since they are often disturbed by attacks at night, and I was told that it is a very ancient custom. Their clothing (kiswe, &#1499;&#1505;&#1493;&#1492;), both of the nomads of the steppe (bedu&#770;) and of the caves (wa&#8219;r), is the same, summer and winter; many perish on the pastures when overtaken by snow-storms, or by cold and want, when their tents and stores are taken from them in the winter time by an enemy. - Wetzst.)
<p>They become thoroughly drenched by the frequent and continuous storms that visit the mountains, and for want of other shelter are obliged to shelter themselves under the overhanging rocks, lying close up to them, and clinging to them, - an idea which is expressed here by &#1495;&#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#005">Lam 4:5</A>, where, of those who were luxuriously brought up on purple cushions, it is said that they "embrace dunghills;" for in Palestine and Syria, the forlorn one, who, being afflicted with some loathsome disease, is not allowed to enter the habitations of men, lies on the dunghill (meza&#770;bil), asking alms by day of the passers-by, and at night hiding himself among the ashes which the sun has warmed.
<p>(Note: Wetzstein observes on this passage: In the mind of the speaker, &#1502;&#1495;&#1505;&#1492; is the house made of stone, from which localities not unfrequently derive their names, as El-hasa, on the east of the Dead Sea; the well-known commercial town El-has, on the east of the Arabian peninsula, which is generally called Lahs; the two of El-hasja (&#1488;&#1500;&#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1492;), north-east of Damascus, etc.: so that &#1495;&#1489;&#1511;&#1493; &#1510;&#1493;&#1512; forms the antithesis to the comfortable dwellings of the Arab. h&#803;ad&#803;ar&#305;&#770;, hadar&#305;&#770;, i.e., one who is firmly settled. The roots &#1495;&#1489;&#1511;, &#1495;&#1489;&#1498;, seem, in the desert, to be only dialectically distinct, and like the root &#1506;&#1489;&#1511;, to signify to be pressed close upon one another. Thus &#1495;&#1489;&#1511;&#1492; (pronounced hibtsha), a crowd = zahme, and asa&#770;bi&#8219; mahbu&#770;ke (&#1502;&#1495;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1492;), the closed fingers, etc. The locality, hibikke (Beduin pronunciation for habka, &#1495;&#1489;&#1499;&#1492; with the Beduin Dag. euphonicum), described in my Reisebericht, has its name from this circumstance alone, that the houses have been attached to (fastened into) the rocks. Hence &#1495;&#1489;&#1468;&#1511; in this passage signifies to press into the fissure of a rock, to seek out a corner which may defend one (dherwe) against the cold winds and rain-torrents (which are far heavier among the mountains than on the plain). The dherwe (from Arab. d&#817;ara&#770;, to afford protection, shelter, a word frequently used in the desert) plays a prominent part among the nomads; and in the month of March, as it is proverbially said the dherwe is better than the ferwe (the skin), they seek to place their tents for protection under the rocks or high banks of the wadys, on account of the cold strong winds, for the sake of the young of the flocks, to which the cold storms are often very destructive. When the sudden storms come on, it is a general thing for the shepherds and flocks to hasten to take shelter under overhanging rocks, and the caverns (mughr, Arab. mugr) which belong to the troglodyte age, and are e.g., common in the mountains of Hauran; so that, therefore, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#008">Job 24:8</A> can as well refer to concealing themselves only for a time (from rain and storm) in the clefts as to troglodytes, who constantly dwell in caverns, or to those dwelling in tents who, during the storms, seek the dherwe of rock sides.)
<p>The usual accentuation, &#1502;&#1494;&#1512;&#1501; with Dech, &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; with Munach, after which it should be translated ab inundatione montes humectantur, is false; in correct Codd. &#1494;&#1512;&#1501; has also Munach; the other Munach is, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#005">Job 23:5</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#009">Job 23:9</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#006">Job 24:6</A>, and freq., a substitute for Dech. Having sketched this special class of the oppressed, and those who are abandoned to the bitterest want, Job proceeds with his description of the many forms of wrong which prevail unpunished on the earth: 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#009">Job 24:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">job 24:9</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>  9  They tear the fatherless from the breast,
<p>And defraud the poor.
<p>10  Naked, they slink away without clothes,
<p>And hungering they bear the sheaves.
<p>11  Between their walls they squeeze out the oil;
<p>They tread the wine-presses, and suffer thirst.
<p>12  In the city vassals groan, And the soul of the oppressed crieth out - 
<p>And Eloah heedeth not the anomaly.
<p>The accentuation of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#009">Job 24:9</A> (&#1497;&#1490;&#1494;&#1500;&#1493; with Dech, &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1491; with Munach) makes the relation of &#1513;&#1473;&#1491; &#1497;&#1514;&#1493;&#1501; genitival. Heidenheim (in a MS annotation to Kimchi's Lex.) accordingly badly interprets: they plunder from the spoil of the orphan; Ramban better: from the ruin, i.e., the shattered patrimony; both appeal to the Targum, which translates &#1502;&#1489;&#1497;&#1494;&#1514; &#1497;&#1514;&#1493;&#1501;, like the Syriac version, men bezto de-jatme (comp. Jerome: vim fecerunt depraedantes pupillos). The original reading, however, is perhaps (vid., Buxtorf, Lex. col. 295) &#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1494;&#1488;, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3b6;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, from the mother's breast, as it is also, the lxx (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;), to be translated contrary to the accentuation. Inhuman creditors take the fatherless and still tender orphan away from its mother, in order to bring it up as a slave, and so to obtain payment. If this is the meaning of the passage, it is natural to understand &#1497;&#1495;&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#009">Job 24:9</A>, of distraining; but (1) the poet would then repeat himself tautologically, vid., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#003">Job 24:3</A>, where the same thing is far more evidently said; (2) &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;, to distrain, would be construed with &#1506;&#1500;, contrary to the logic of the word. Certainly the phrase &#1495;&#1489;&#1500; &#1506;&#1500; may be in some degree explained by the interpretation, "to impose a fine" (Ew., Hahn), or "to distrain" (Hirz., Welte), or "to oppress with fines" (Schlottm.); but violence is thus done to the usage of the language, which is better satisfied by the explanation of Ralbag (among modern expositors, Ges., Arnh., Vaih., Stick., Hlgst.): and what the unfortunate one possesses they seize; but this &#1506;&#1500; = &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1506;&#1500; directly as object is impossible. The passage, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#025">Deu 7:25</A>, cited by Schultens in its favour, is of a totally different kind.
<p>But throughout the Semitic dialects the verb &#1495;&#1489;&#1500; also signifies "to destroy, to treat injuriously" (e.g., Arab. el-cha&#770;bil, a by-name of Satan); it occurs in this signification in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#031">Job 34:31</A>, and according to the analogy of &#1492;&#1512;&#1506; &#1506;&#1500;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#020">Kg1 17:20</A>, can be construed with &#1506;&#1500; as well as with &#1500;. The poet, therefore, by this construction will have intended to distinguish the one &#1495;&#1489;&#1500; from the other, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#006">Job 22:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#003">Job 24:3</A>; and it is with Umbreit to be translated: they bring destruction upon the poor; or better: they take undue advantage of those who otherwise are placed in trying circumstances.
<p>The subjects of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#010">Job 24:10</A> are these &#1506;&#1504;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501;, who are made serfs, and become objects of merciless oppression, and the poet here in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#010">Job 24:10</A> indeed repeats what he has already said almost word for word in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#007">Job 24:7</A> (comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#019">Job 31:19</A>); but there the nakedness was the general calamity of a race oppressed by subjugation, here it is the consequence of the sin of merces retenta laborum, which cries aloud to heaven, practised on those of their own race: they slink away (&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1498;, as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#028">Job 30:28</A>) naked (nude), without (&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; = &#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;, as perhaps sine = absque) clothing, and while suffering hunger they carry the sheaves (since their masters deny them what, according to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#004">Deu 25:4</A>, shall not be withheld even from the beasts). Between their walls (&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514; like &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#010">Jer 5:10</A>, Chaldee &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;), i.e., the walls of their masters who have made them slaves, therefore under strict oversight, they press out the oil (&#1497;&#1510;&#1492;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;, &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;. &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;.), they tread the wine-vats (&#1497;&#1511;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;, lacus), and suffer thirst withal (fut. consec. according to Ew. 342, a), without being allowed to quench their thirst from the must which runs out of the presses (&#1504;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, torcularia, from which the verb &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; is here transferred to the vats). Bttch. translates: between their rows of trees, without being able to reach out right or left; but that is least of all suitable with the olives. Carey correctly explains: "the factories or the garden enclosures of these cruel slaveholders." This reference of the word to the wall of the enclosure is more suitable than to walls of the press-house in particular. From tyrannical oppression in the country, 
<p>(Note: Brentius here remarks: Quantum igitur judicium in eos futurum est, qui in homines ejusdem carnis, ejusdem patriae, ejusdem fidei, ejusdem Christi committunt quod nec in bruta animalia committendum est, quod malum in Germania frequentissimum est. Vae igitur Germaniae!)
<p>Job now passes over to the abominations of discord and was in the cities.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#012">Job 24:12</A>
<p>It is natural, with Umbr., Ew., Hirz., and others, to read &#1502;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; like the Peschito; but as m&#305;&#770;te in Syriac, so also &#1502;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; in Hebrew as a noun everywhere signifies the dead (Arab. mauta), not the dying, mortals (Arab. matna); wherefore Ephrem interprets the praes. "they groan" by the perf. "they have groaned." The pointing &#1502;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;, therefore, is quite correct; but the accentuation which, by giving Mehupach Zinnorith to &#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;, and Asla legarmeh to &#1502;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;, places the two words in a genitival relation, is hardly correct: in the city of men, i.e., the inhabited, thickly-populated city, they groan; not: men (as Rosenm. explains, according to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#006">Gen 9:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#006">Pro 11:6</A>) groan; for just because &#1502;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; appeared to be too inexpressive as a subject, this accentuation seems to have been preferred. It is also possible that the signification fierce anger (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#009">Hos 11:9</A>), or anguish (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#008">Jer 15:8</A>), was combined with &#1506;&#1497;&#1512;, comp. Arab. gayrt, jealousy, fury (= &#1511;&#1504;&#1488;&#1492;), of which, however, no trace is anywhere visible.
<p>(Note: Wetzstein translates <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#009">Hos 11:9</A> : I will not come as a raging foe, with &#1489; of the attribute = Arab. b-s&#803;ifat 'l-&#8219;ayyu&#770;r (comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#008">Jer 15:8</A>, &#1506;&#1497;&#1512;, parall. &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1491;) after the form &#1511;&#1497;&#1501;, to which, if not this &#1506;&#1497;&#1512;, certainly the &#1506;&#1497;&#1512;, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, occurring in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#010">Dan 4:10</A>, and freq., corresponds. What we remarked above, p. 483, on the form &#1511;&#1497;&#1501;, is cleared up by the following observation of Wetzstein: "The form &#1511;&#1497;&#1501; belongs to the numerous class of segolate forms of the form &#1508;&#1506;&#1500;, which, as belonging to the earliest period of the formation of the Semitic languages, take neither plural nor feminine terminations; they have often a collective meaning, and are not originally abstracta, but concreta in the sense of the Arabic part. act. mufa&#770;&#8219;l. This inflexible primitive formation is frequently found in the present day in the idiom of the steppe, which shows that the Hebrew is essentially of primeval antiquity (uralt). Thus the Beduin says: hu&#770; qitl&#305;&#770; (&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; &#1511;&#1496;&#1500;&#1497;), he is my opponent in a hand-to-hand combat; nith&#305;&#770; (&#1504;&#1496;&#1495;&#1497;), my opponent in the tournament with lances; ch&#305;&#770;lf&#305;&#770; (&#1495;&#1500;&#1508;&#1497;) and didd&#305;&#770; (&#1510;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;), my adversary; thus a step-mother is called d&#305;&#770;r (&#1510;&#1497;&#1512;), as the oppressor of the step-children, and a concubine dirr (&#1510;&#1512;&#1512;), as the oppressor of her rival. The Kamus also furnishes several words which belong here, as tilb (&#1496;&#1500;&#1489;), a persecutor." Accordingly, &#1511;&#1497;&#1501; is derived from &#1511;&#1493;&#1501;, as also &#1506;&#1497;&#1512;, a city, from &#1506;&#1493;&#1512; (whence, according to a prevalent law of the change of letters, we have &#1506;&#1497;&#1512; first of all, plur. &#1506;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#004">Jdg 10:4</A>), and signifies the rebelling one, i.e., the enemy (who is now in the idiom of the steppe called qo&#770;ma&#770;ni, from qo&#770;m, a state of war, a feud), as &#1506;&#1497;&#1512;, a keeper and &#1510;&#1497;&#1512;, a messenger; &#1506;&#1497;&#1512; (&#1511;&#1497;&#1512;) is also originally concrete, a wall (enclosure).)
<p>With Jer., Symm., and Theod., we take &#1502;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; as the sighing ones themselves; the feebleness of the subject disappears if we explain the passage according to such passages as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#034">Deu 2:34</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#006">Deu 3:6</A>, comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#048">Jdg 20:48</A> : it is the male inhabitants that are intended, whom any conqueror would put to the sword; we have therefore translated men (men of war), although "people" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#003">Job 11:3</A>) also would not have been unsuitable according to the ancient use of the word. &#1504;&#1488;&#1511; is intended of the groans of the dying, as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#052">Jer 51:52</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#024">Eze 30:24</A>, as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#012">Job 24:12</A> also shows: the soul of those that are mortally wounded cries out. &#1495;&#1500;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; signifies not merely the slain and already dead, but, according to its etymon, those who are pierced through those who have received their death-blow; their soul cries out, since it does not leave the body without a struggle. Such things happen without God preventing them. &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1500;&#1492;, He observeth not the abomination, either = &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1500;&#1489;&#1493;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#022">Job 22:22</A> (He layeth it not to heart), or, since the phrase occurs nowhere elliptically, = &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1489;&#1493; &#1506;&#1500;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#008">Job 1:8</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#023">Job 34:23</A>) He does not direct His heart, His attention to it), here as elliptical, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#020">Job 4:20</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#020">Isa 41:20</A>. True, the latter phrase is never joined with the acc. of the object; but if we translate after &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#018">Job 4:18</A> : non imputat, He does not reckon such &#1514;&#1508;&#1500;&#1492;, i.e., does not punish it, &#1489;&#1468;&#1501; (&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1501;) ought to be supplied, which is still somewhat liable to misconstruction, since the preceding subject is not the oppressors, but those who suffer oppression. &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1500;&#1492; is properly insipidity (comp. Arab. tafila, to stink), absurdity, self-contradiction, here the immorality which sets at nought the moral order of the world, and remains nevertheless unpunished. The Syriac version reads &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, and translates, like Louis Bridel (1818): et Dieu ne fait aucune attention  leur prire.

<p>13  Others are those that rebel against the light,
<p>They will know nothing of its ways,
<p>And abide not in its paths.

<p>With &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; begins a new turn in the description of the moral confusion which has escaped God's observation; it is to be translated neither as retrospective, "since they" (Ewald), nor as distinctive, "they even" (Bttch.), i.e., the powerful in distinction from the oppressed, but "those" (for &#1492;&#1502;&#1492; corresponds to our use of "those," &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; to "these"), by which Job passes on to another class of evil-disposed and wicked men. Their general characteristic is, that they shun the light. Those who are described in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#014">Job 24:14</A> are described according to their general characteristic in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#013">Job 24:13</A>; accordingly it is not to be interpreted: those belong to the enemies of the light, but: those are, according to their very nature, enemies of the light. The Beth is the so-called Beth essent.; &#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468; (comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#026">Pro 3:26</A>) affirms what they are become by their own inclination, or as what they are fashioned, viz., as &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; (Symm.); &#1502;&#1512;&#1491; (on the root &#1502;&#1512;, vid., on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#002">Job 23:2</A>) signifies properly to push one's self against anything, to lean upon, to rebel; &#1502;&#1512;&#1491; therefore signifies one who strives against another, one who is obstinate (like the Arabic ma&#770;rid, mer&#305;&#770;d, comp. muma&#770;ri, not conformable to the will of another). The improvement &#1502;&#1512;&#1491;&#1497; &#1488;&#1493;&#1512; (not with Makkeph, but with Mahpach of mercha mahpach. placed between the two words, vid., Br's Psalterium, p. x.) assumes the possibility of the construction with the acc., which occurs at least once, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#019">Jos 22:19</A>. They are hostile to the light, they have no familiarity with its ways (&#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;, as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#017">Jos 22:17</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#005">Psa 142:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#019">Rut 2:19</A>, to take knowledge of anything, to interest one's self in its favour), and do not dwell (&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;, Jer. reversi sunt, according to the false reading &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;) in its paths, i.e., they neither make nor feel themselves at home there, they have no peace therein. The light is the light of day, which, however, stands in deeper, closer relation to the higher light, for the vicious man hateth &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#020">Joh 3:20</A>, in every sense; and the works which are concealed in the darkness of the night are also &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#012">Rom 13:12</A> (comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#015">Isa 29:15</A>), in the sense in which light and darkness are two opposite principles of the spiritual world. It need not seem strange that the more minute description of the conduct of these enemies of the light now begins with &#1500;&#1488;&#1493;&#1512;. It is impossible that this should mean: still in the darkness of the night (Stick.), prop. towards the light, when it is not yet light. Moreover, in biblical Hebrew, &#1488;&#1493;&#1512; does not signify evening, in which sense it occurs in Talmudic Hebrew (Pesachim 1a, Seder olam rabba, c. 5, &#1488;&#1493;&#1512; &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497;&#1506;&#1497;, vespera septima), like &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1488; (= &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1507;) in Talmudic Aramaic. The meaning, on the contrary, is that towards daybreak (comp. &#1492;&#1489;&#1511;&#1512; &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#003">Gen 44:3</A>), therefore with early morning, the murderer rises up, to go about his work, which veils itself in darkness (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#008">Psa 10:8-10</A>) by day, viz., to slay (comp. on &#1497;&#1511;&#1496;&#1500;...&#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;, Ges. 142, 3, c) the unfortunate and the poor, who pass by defenceless and alone. One has to supply the idea of the ambush in which the waylayer lies in wait; and it is certainly inconvenient that it is not expressed.
<p>The antithesis &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#014">Job 24:14</A>, shows that nothing but primo mane is meant by &#1500;&#1488;&#1493;&#1512;. He who in the day-time goes forth to murder and plunder, at night commits petty thefts, where no one whom he could attack passes by. Stickel translates: to slay the poor and wretched, and in the night to play the thief; but then the subjunctivus &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497; ought to precede (vid., e.g., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#005">Job 13:5</A>), and in general it cannot be proved without straining it, that the voluntative form of the future everywhere has a modal signification. Moreover, here &#1497;&#1492;&#1497; does not differ from <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#012">Job 18:12</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#023">Job 20:23</A>, but is only a poetic shorter form for &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;: in the night he is like a thief, i.e., plays the part of the thief. And the adulterer's eye observes the darkness of evening (vid., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#009">Pro 7:9</A>), i.e., watches closely for its coming on (&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;, in the usual signification observare, to be on the watch, to take care, observe anxiously), since he hopes to render himself invisible; and that he may not be recognised even if seen, he puts on a mask. &#1505;&#1514;&#1512; &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; is something by which his countenance is rendered unrecognisable (lxx &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;), like the Arab. sitr, sita&#770;reh, a curtain, veil, therefore a veil for the face, or, as we say in one word borrowed from the Arabic mascharat, a farce (masquerade): the mask, but not in the proper sense.
<p>(Note: The mask was perhaps never known in Palestine and Syria; &#1505;&#1514;&#1512; &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; is the mend&#305;&#770;l or women's veil, which in the present day (in Hauran exclusively) is called sitr, and is worn over the face by all married women in the towns, while in the country it is worn hanging down the back, and is only drawn over the face in the presence of a stranger. If this explanation is correct the poet means to say that the adulterer, in order to remain undiscovered, wears women's clothes comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#005">Deu 22:5</A>; and, in fact, in the Syrian towns (the figure is taken from town-life) women's clothing is always chosen for that kind of forbidden nocturnal undertaking, i.e., the man disguises himself in an &#305;&#770;za&#770;r, which covers him from head to foot, takes the mend&#305;&#770;l, and goes with a lantern (without which at night every person is seized by the street watchman as a suspicious person) unhindered into a strange house. - Wetzst.)

<p>16  In the dark they dig through houses,
<p>By day they shut themselves up,
<p>They will know nothing of the light.
<p>17  For the depth of night is to them even as the dawn of the morning,
<p>For they know the terrors of the depth of night.
<p>The handiwork of the thief, which is but slightly referred to in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#014">Job 24:14</A>, is here more particularly described. The indefinite subj. of &#1495;&#1514;&#1512;, as is manifest from what follows, is the band of thieves. The &#1489;&#1468;, which is elsewhere joined with chtr (to break into anything), is here followed by the acc. &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; (to be pronounced ba&#770;ttim, not bottim),
<p>(Note: Vid., Aben-Ezra on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#007">Exo 12:7</A>. The main proof that it is to be pronounced ba&#770;ttim is, that written exactly it is &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, and that the Metheg according to circumstances, is changed into an accent, as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#007">Exo 8:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#007">Exo 12:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#022">Jer 18:22</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#004">Eze 45:4</A>, which can only happen by Kametz, not by Kometz (K. chatph); comp. Khler on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#002">Zac 14:2</A>.)
<p>as in the Talmudic, &#1495;&#1514;&#1512; &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;, to pick one's teeth (and thereby to make them loose), b. Kidduschin, 24 b. According to the Talmud, Ralbag, and the ancient Jewish interpretation in general, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#016">Job 24:16</A> is closely connected to btym: houses which they have marked by day for breaking into, and the mode of its accomplishment; but &#1495;&#1514;&#1501; nowhere signifies designare, always obsignare, to seal up, to put under lock and key, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#017">Job 14:17</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#007">Job 9:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#007">Job 37:7</A>; according to which the Piel, which occurs only here, is to be explained: by day they seal up, i.e., shut themselves up for their safety (&#1500;&#1502;&#1493; is not to be accented with Athnach, but with Rebia mugrasch): they know not the light, i.e., as Schlottm. well explains: they have no fellowship with it; for the biblical &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;, &#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, mostly signifies a knowledge which enters into the subject, and intimately unites itself with it. In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#017">Job 24:17</A> one confirmation follows another. Umbr. and Hirz. explain: for the morning is to them at once the shadow of death; but &#1497;&#1495;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;, in the signification at the same time, as we have taken &#1497;&#1495;&#1491; in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#016">Job 17:16</A> (nevertheless of simultaneousness of time), is unsupportable: it signifies together, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#011">Job 2:11</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#032">Job 9:32</A>; and the arrangement of the words &#1500;&#1502;&#1493;...&#1497;&#1495;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493; (to them together) is like <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#020">Isa 9:20</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#003">Isa 31:3</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#012">Jer 46:12</A>. Also, apart from the erroneous translation of the &#1497;&#1495;&#1491;&#1493;, which is easily set aside, Hirzel's rendering of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#017">Job 24:17</A> is forced: the morning, i.e., the bright day, is to them all as the shadow of death, for each and every one of them knows the terrors of the daylight, which is to them as the shadow of death, viz., the danger of being discovered and condemned. The interpretation, which is also preferred by Olshausen, is far more natural: the depth of night is to them as the dawn of the morning (on the precedence of the predicate, comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#013">Amo 4:13</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#008">Amo 5:8</A> : walking in the darkness of the early morning), for they are acquainted with the terrors of the depth of night, i.e., they are not surprised by them, but know how to anticipate and to escape them. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#015">Job 38:15</A> also, where the night, which vanishes before the rising of the sun, is called the "light" of the evil-doer, favours this interpretation (not the other, as Olsh. thinks). The accentuation also favours it; for is &#1489;&#1511;&#1512; had been the subj., and were to be translated: the morning is to them the shadow of death, it ought to have been accented &#1489;&#1511;&#1512; &#1500;&#1502;&#1493; &#1510;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, Dech, Mercha, Athnach. It is, however, accented Munach, Munach, Athnach, and the second Munach stands as the deputy of Dech, whose value in the interpunction it represents; therefore &#1489;&#1511;&#1512; &#1500;&#1502;&#1493; is the predicate: the shadow of death is morning to them. From the plur. the description now, with &#1497;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;, passes into the sing., as individualizing it. &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;&#1493;&#1514; constr. of &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1514;, is without a Dagesh in the second consonant. Mercier admirably remarks here: sunt ei familiares et noti nocturni terrores, neque eos timet aut curat, quasi sibi cum illis necessitudo et familiaritas intercederet et cum illis ne noceant foedus aut pactum inierit. Thus by their skill and contrivance they escape danger, and divine justice allows them to remain undiscovered and unpunished, - a fact which is most incomprehensible.
<p>It is now time that this thought was once again definitely expressed, that one may not forget what these accumulated illustrations are designed to prove. But what now follows in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#018">Job 24:18</A> seems to express not Job's opinion, but that of his opponents. Ew., Hirz., and Hlgst. regard <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#018">Job 24:18</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#022">Job 24:22</A>, as thesis and antithesis. To the question, What is the lot that befalls all these evil-doers? Job is thought to give a twofold answer: first, to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#021">Job 24:21</A>, an ironical answer in the sense of the friends, that those men are overtaken by the merited punishment; then from <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#022">Job 24:22</A> is his own serious answer, which stands in direct contrast to the former. But (1) in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#018">Job 24:18</A> there is not the slightest trace observable that Job does not express his own view: a consideration which is also against Schlottman, who regards <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#018">Job 24:18</A> as expressive of the view of an opponent. (2) There is no such decided contrast between <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#018">Job 24:18</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#022">Job 24:22</A>, for <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#019">Job 24:19</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#024">Job 24:24</A> both affirm substantially the same thing concerning the end of the evil-doer. In like manner, it is also not to be supposed, with Stick., Lwenth., Bttch., Welte, and Hahn, that Job, outstripping the friends, as far as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#021">Job 24:21</A>, describes how the evil-doer certainly often comes to a terrible end, and in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#022">Job 24:22</A> how the very opposite of this, however, is often witnessed; so that this consequently furnishes no evidence in support of the exclusive assertion of the friends. Moreover, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#024">Job 24:24</A> compared with <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#019">Job 24:19</A>, where there is nothing to indicate a direct contrast, is opposed to it; and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#022">Job 24:22</A>, which has no appearance of referring to a direct contrast with what has been previously said, is opposed to such an antithetical rendering of the two final strophes. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#022">Job 24:22</A> might more readily be regarded as a transition to the antithesis, if <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#018">Job 24:18</A> could, with Eichh., Schnurr., Dathe, Umbr., and Vaih., after the lxx, Syriac, and Jerome, be understood as optative: "Let such an one be light on the surface of the water, let ... be cursed, let him not turn towards," etc., but <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#018">Job 24:18</A> is not of the optative form; and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#018">Job 24:18</A>, where in that case &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1508;&#1504;&#1492; would be expected, instead of &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1508;&#1504;&#1492;, shows that <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#018">Job 24:18</A>, where, according to the syntax, the optative rendering is natural, is nevertheless not to be so rendered. The right interpretation is that which regards both <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#018">Job 24:18</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#022">Job 24:22</A> as Job's own view, without allowing him absolutely to contradict himself. Thus it is interpreted, e.g., by Rosenmller, who, however, as also Renan, errs in connecting <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#018">Job 24:18</A> with the description of the thieves, and understands <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#018">Job 24:18</A> of their slipping away, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#018">Job 24:18</A> of their dwelling in horrible places, and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#018">Job 24:18</A> of their avoidance of the vicinity of towns. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#018">Job 24:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">job 24:18</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>18  For he is light upon the surface of the water;
<p>Their heritage is cursed upon the earth;
<p>He turneth no more in the way of the vineyard.
<p>19  Drought, also heat, snatch away snow water - 
<p>So doth Shel those who have sinned.
<p>20  The womb forgetteth him, worms shall feast on him,
<p>He is no more remembered;
<p>So the desire of the wicked is broken as a tree - 
<p>21  He who hath plundered the barren that bare not,
<p>And did no good to the widow.
<p>The point of comparison in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#018">Job 24:18</A> is the swiftness of the disappearing: he is carried swiftly past, as any light substance on the surface of the water is hurried along by the swiftness of the current, and can scarcely be seen; comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#026">Job 9:26</A> : "My days shoot by as ships of reeds, as an eagle which dasheth upon its prey," and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#007">Hos 10:7</A>, "Samaria's king is destroyed like a bundle of brushwood (lxx, Theod., &#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;) on the face of the water," which is quickly drawn into the whirlpool, or buried by the approaching wave.
<p>(Note: The translation: like foam (spuma or bulla), is also very suitable here. Thus Targ., Symm., Jerome, and others; but the signification to foam cannot be etymologically proved, whereas &#1511;&#1510;&#1507; in the signification confringere is established by &#1511;&#1510;&#1508;&#1492;, breaking, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#007">Joe 1:7</A>, and Arab. qs&#803;f; so that consequently &#1511;&#1510;&#1507;, as synon. of &#1488;&#1507;, signifies properly the breaking forth, and is then allied to &#1488;&#1489;&#1512;&#1492;.)
<p>But here the idea is not that of being swallowed up by the waters, as in the passage in Hosea, but, on the contrary, of vanishing from sight, by being carried rapidly past by the rush of the waters. If, then, the evil-doer dies a quick, easy death, his heritage (&#1495;&#1500;&#1511;&#1492;, from &#1495;&#1500;&#1511;, to divide) is cursed by men, since no one will dwell in it or use it, because it is appointed by God to desolation on account of the sin which is connected with it (vid., on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#028">Job 15:28</A>); even he, the evil-doer, no more turns the way of the vineyard (&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;, with &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498;, not an acc. of the obj., but as indicating the direction = &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498;; comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#018">Sa1 13:18</A> with <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#017">Sa1 13:17</A> of the same chapter), proudly to inspect his wide extended domain, and overlook the labourers. The curse therefore does not come upon him, nor can one any longer lie in wait for him to take vengeance on him; it is useless to think of venting upon him the rage which his conduct during life provoked; he is long since out of reach in Shel.
<p>That which Job says figuratively in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#018">Job 24:18</A>, and in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#013">Job 21:13</A> without a figure: "in a moment they go down to Shel," he expresses in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#019">Job 24:19</A> under a new figure, and, moreover, in the form of an emblematic proverb (vid., Herzog's Real-Encyklopdie, xiv. 696), according to the peculiarity of which, not &#1499;&#1468;&#1503;, but either only the copulative Waw (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#025">Pro 25:25</A>) or nothing whatever (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#022">Pro 11:22</A>), is to be supplied before &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500; &#1495;&#1496;&#1488;&#1493;. &#1495;&#1496;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; is virtually an object: eos qui peccarunt. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#019">Job 24:19</A> is a model-example of extreme brevity of expression, Ges. 155, 4, b. Sandy ground (&#1510;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, arid land, without natural moisture), added to it (&#1490;&#1468;&#1501;, not: likewise) the heat of the sun - these two, working simultaneously from beneath and above, snatch away (&#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, cogn. &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;, root &#1490;&#1494;, to cut, cut away, tear away; Arab. jzr, fut. i, used of sinking, decreasing water) &#1502;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1490;, water of (melted) snow (which is fed from no fountain, and therefore is quickly absorbed), and Shel snatches away those who have sinned (= &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1500;&#1492; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1495;&#1496;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;). The two incidents are alike: the death of those whose life has been a life of sin, follows as a consequence easily and unobserved, without any painful and protracted struggle. The sinner disappears suddenly; the womb, i.e., the mother that bare him, forgets him (&#1512;&#1495;&#1501;, matrix = mater; according to Ralbag: friendship, from &#1512;&#1495;&#1501;, to love tenderly; others: relationship, in which sense Arab. rah&#803;imun = &#1512;&#1495;&#1501; is used), worms suck at him (&#1502;&#1514;&#1511;&#1493; for &#1502;&#1514;&#1511;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, according to Ges. 147, a, sugit eum, from which primary notion of sucking comes the signification to be sweet, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#033">Job 21:33</A> : Syriac, metkat ennun remto; Ar. imtasahum, from the synonymous Arab. mas&#803;s&#803;a = &#1502;&#1510;&#1509;, &#1502;&#1510;&#1492;, &#1502;&#1494;&#1492;), he is no more thought of, and thus then is mischief (abstr. pro concr. as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#016">Job 5:16</A>) broken like a tree (not: a staff, which &#1506;&#1509; never, not even in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#012">Hos 4:12</A>, directly, like the Arabic &#8219;asa, &#8219;asa&#770;t, signifies). Since &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; is used personally, &#1512;&#1506;&#1492; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#021">Job 24:21</A>, can be connected with it as an appositional permutative. His want of compassion (as is still too often seen in the present day in connection with the tyrannical conduct of the executive in Syria and Palestine, especially on the part of those who collected the taxes) goes the length of eating up, i.e., entirely plundering, the barren, childless (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#030">Gen 11:30</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#001">Isa 54:1</A>), and therefore helpless woman, who has no sons to protect and defend her, and never showing favour to the widow, but, on the contrary, thrusting her away from him. There is as little need for regarding the verb &#1512;&#1506;&#1492; here, with Rosenm. after the Targ., in the signification confringere, as cognate with &#1512;&#1506;&#1506;, &#1512;&#1510;&#1509;, as conversely to change &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;&#1501;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#009">Psa 2:9</A>, into &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;&#1501;; it signifies depascere, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#026">Job 20:26</A>, here in the sense of depopulari. On the form &#1497;&#1497;&#1496;&#1497;&#1489; for &#1497;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1489;, vid., Ges. 70, 2, rem.; and on the transition from the part. to the v. fin., vid., Ges. 134, rem. 2. Certainly the memory of such an one is not affectionately cherished; this is equally true with what Job maintains in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#032">Job 21:32</A>, that the memory of the evil-doer is immortalized by monuments. Here the allusion is to the remembrance of a mother's love and sympathetic feeling. The fundamental thought of the strophe is this, that neither in life nor in death had he suffered the punishment of his evil-doing. The figure of the broken tree (broken in its full vigour) also corresponds to this thought; comp. on the other hand what Bildad says, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#016">Job 18:16</A> : "his roots dry up beneath, and above his branch is lopped off" (or: withered). The severity of his oppression is not manifest till after his death.
<p>In the next strophe Job goes somewhat further. But after having, in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#022">Job 24:22</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#023">Job 24:23</A>, said that the life of the ungodly passes away as if they were the favoured of God, he returns to their death, which the friends, contrary to experience, have so fearfully described, whilst it is only now and then distinguished from the death of other men by coming on late and painlessly. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#022">Job 24:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">job 24:22</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>22  And He preserveth the mighty by His strength;
<p>Such an one riseth again, though he despaired of life.
<p>23  He giveth him rest, and he is sustained,
<p>And His eyes are over their ways.
<p>24  They are exalted - a little while, - then they are no more,
<p>And they are sunken away, snatched away like all others,
<p>And as the top of the stalk they are cut off. - 
<p>25  And if it is not so, who will charge me with lying,
<p>And make my assertion worthless?
<p>Though it becomes manifest after their death how little the ungodly, who were only feared by men, were beloved, the form of their death itself is by no means such as to reveal the retributive justice of God. And does it become at all manifest during their life? The Waw, with which the strophe begins, is, according to our rendering, not adversative, but progressive. God is the subject. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498;, to extend in length, used elsewhere of love, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#011">Psa 36:11</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#012">Psa 109:12</A>, and anger, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#006">Psa 85:6</A>, is here transferred to persons: to prolong, preserve long in life. &#1488;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; are the strong, who bid defiance not only to every danger (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#006">Psa 76:6</A>), but also to all divine influences and noble impulses (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#012">Isa 46:12</A>). These, whose trust in their own strength God might smite down by His almighty power, He preserves alive even in critical positions by that very power: he (the &#1488;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;) stands up (again), whilst he does not trust to life, i.e., whilst he believes that he must succumb to death (&#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1503; as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#013">Psa 27:13</A>, comp. Genesis, S. 368; &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;, Aramaic form, like &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#002">Job 4:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#011">Job 12:11</A>; the whole is a contracted circumstantial clause for &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1488; &#1500;&#1488; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;). He (God) grants him &#1500;&#1489;&#1496;&#1495;, in security, viz., to live, or even directly: a secure peaceful existence, since &#1500;&#1489;&#1496;&#1495; is virtually an object, and the &#1500; is that of condition (comp. &#1500;&#1512;&#1489;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#003">Job 26:3</A>). Thus Hahn, who, however, here is only to be followed in this one particular, takes it correctly: and that he can support himself, which would only be possible if an inf. with &#1500; had preceded. Therefore: and he is supported or he can support himself, i.e., be comforted, though this absolute use of &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1503; cannot be supported; in this instance we miss &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;, or some such expression (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#015">Job 8:15</A>). God sustains him and raises him up again: His eyes (&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468; = &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;) are (rest) on the ways of these men, they stand as it were beneath His special protection, or, as it is expressed in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#003">Job 10:3</A> : He causes light to shine from above upon the doings of the wicked. "They are risen up, and are conscious of the height (of prosperity) - a little while, and they are no more." Thus <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#024">Job 24:24</A> is to be explained. The accentuation &#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1493; with Mahpach, &#1502;&#1506;&#1496; with Asla legarmeh (according to which it would have to be translated: they stand on high a short time), is erroneous. The verb &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; signifies not merely to be high, but also to rise up, raise one's self, e.g., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#011">Pro 11:11</A>, and to show one's self exalted, here extulerunt se in altum or exaltati sunt; according to the form of writing &#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; is treated as an Ayin Waw verb med. O, and the Dagesh is a so-called Dag. affecuosum (Olsh. 83, b), while &#1512;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; (like &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#023">Gen 49:23</A>) appears to assume the form of a double Ayin verb med. O, consequently &#1512;&#1502;&#1501; (Ges. 67, rem. 1).
<p>&#1502;&#1506;&#1496;, followed by Waw of the conclusion, forms a clause of itself, as more frequently &#1506;&#1493;&#1491; &#1502;&#1506;&#1496; &#1493; (yet a little while, then ... ), as, e.g., in an exactly similar connection in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#010">Psa 37:10</A>; here, however, not expressive of the sudden judgment of the ungodly, but of their easy death without a struggle (&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;): a little, then he is not (again a transition from the plur. to the distributive or individualizing sing.). They are, viz., as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#024">Job 24:24</A> further describes, bowed down all at once (an idea which is expressed by the perf.), are snatched off like all other men. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468; is an Aramaizing Hophal-form, approaching the Hoph. of strong verbs, for &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; (Ges. 67, rem. 8), from &#1502;&#1499;&#1498;, to bow one's self (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#043">Psa 106:43</A>), to be brought low (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#018">Ecc 10:18</A>); comp. Arab. mkk, to cause to vanish, to annul. &#1497;&#1511;&#1468;&#1508;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503; (for which it is unnecessary with Olsh. to read &#1497;&#1511;&#1468;&#1489;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;, after <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#005">Eze 29:5</A>) signifies, according to the primary signification of &#1511;&#1508;&#1509;, comprehendere, constringere, contrahere (cogn. &#1511;&#1489;&#1509;, &#1511;&#1502;&#1509;, &#1511;&#1502;&#1496;, comp. supra, p. 481): they are hurried together, or snatched off, i.e., deprived of life, like the Arabic qbd&#803;h alla&#770;h (&#1511;&#1508;&#1510;&#1493; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;) and passive qubid&#803;a, equivalent to, he has died. There is no reference in the phrase to the componere artus, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#033">Gen 49:33</A>; it is rather the figure of housing (gathering into the barn) that underlies it; the word, however, only implies seizing and drawing in. Thus the figure which follows is also naturally (comp. &#1511;&#1502;&#1509;, Arab. qabd&#803;at, manipulus) connected with what precedes, and, like the head of an ear of corn, i.e., the corn-bearing head of the wheat-stalk, they are cut off (by which one must bear in mind that the ears are reaped higher up than with us, and the standing stalk is usually burnt to make dressing for the field; vid., Ges. Thes. s.v. &#1511;&#1513;&#1473;).
<p>(Note: Another figure is also presented here. It is a common thing for the Arabs (Beduins) in harvest-time to come down upon the fields of standing corn - especially barley, because during summer and autumn this grain is indispensable to them as food for their horses - of a district, chiefly at night, and not unfrequently hundreds of camels are laden at one time. As they have no sickles, they cut off the upper part of the stalk with the &#8219;aqfe (a knife very similar to the Roman sica) and with sabres, whence this theft is called qard &#1511;&#1512;&#1509;, sabring off; and that which is cut off, as well as the uneven stubble that is left standing, is called qarid. - Wetzst.)).
<p>On &#1497;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; (fut. Niph. = &#1497;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;), vid., on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#002">Job 14:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#016">Job 18:16</A>; the signification praedicuntur, as observed above, is more suitable here than marcescunt (in connection with which signification <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#026">Job 5:26</A> ought to be compared, and the form regarded as fut. Kal). Assured of the truth, in conformity with experience, of that which has been said, he appeals finally to the friends: if it be not so (on &#1488;&#1508;&#1493; = &#1488;&#1508;&#1493;&#1488; in conditional clauses, vid., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#024">Job 9:24</A>), who (by proving the opposite) is able to charge me with lying and bring to nought (&#1500;&#1488;&#1500; = &#1500;&#1488;&#1497;&#1503;, Ew. 321, b, perhaps by &#1488;&#1500; being conceived of as originally infin. from &#1488;&#1500;&#1500; (comp. &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;), in the sense of non-existence, Arab. 'l-&#8219;adam) my assertion?
<p>The bold accusations in the speech of Eliphaz, in which the uncharitableness of the friends attains its height, must penetrate most deeply into Job's spirit. But Job does not answer like by like. Even in this speech in opposition to the friends, he maintains the passionless repose which has once been gained. Although the misjudgment of his character has attained its height in the speech of Eliphaz, his answer does not contain a single bitter personal word. In general, he does not address them, not as though he did not wish to show respect to them, but because he has nothing to say concerning their unjust and wrong conduct that he would not already have said, and because he has lost all hope of his reproof taking effect, all hope of sympathy with his entreaty that they would spare him, all hope of understanding and information on their part.
<p>In the first part of the speech (Job 23) he occupies himself with the mystery of his own suffering lot, and in the second part (Job 24) with the reverse of this mystery, the evil-doers' prosperity and immunity from punishment. How is he to vindicate himself against Eliphaz, since his lament over his sufferings as unmerited as accounted by the friends more and more as defiant obstinacy (&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;), and consequently tends to bring him still deeper into that suspicion which he is trying to remove? His testimony concerning himself is of no avail; for it appears to the friends more self-delusive, hypocritical, and sinful, the more decidedly he maintains it; consequently the judgment of God can alone decide between him and his accusers. But while the friends accuse him by word of mouth, God himself is pronouncing sentence against him by His acts, - his affliction is a de facto accusation of God against him. Therefore, before the judgment of God can become a vindication of his affliction against the friends, he must first of all himself have defended and proved his innocence in opposition to the Author of his affliction. Hence the accusation of the friends, which in the speech of Eliphaz is become more direct and cutting than heretofore, must urge on anew with all its power the desire in Job of being able to bring his cause before God.
<p>At the outset he is confident of victory, for his consciousness does not deceive him; and God, although He is both one party in the cause and judge, is influenced by the irresistible force of the truth. Herein the want of harmony in Job's conception of God, the elevation of which into a higher unity is the goal of the development of the drama, again shows itself. He is not able to think of the God who pursues him, the innocent one, at the present time with suffering, as the just God; on the other hand, the justice of the God who will permit him to approach His judgment throne, is to him indisputably sure: He will attend to him, and for ever acquit him. Now Job yields to the arbitrary power of God, but then he will rise by virtue of the justice and truth of God. His longing is, therefore, that the God who now afflicts him may condescend to hear him: this seems to him the only way of convincing God, and indirectly the friends, of his innocence, and himself of God's justice. The basis of this longing is the desire of being free from the painful conception of God which he is obliged to give way to. For it is not the darkness of affliction that enshrouds him which causes Job the intensest suffering, but the darkness in which it has enshrouded God to him, - the angry countenance of God which is turned to him. But if this is sin, that he is engaged in a conflict concerning the justice of the Author of his affliction, it is still greater that he indulges evil thoughts respecting the Judge towards whose throne of judgment he presses forward. He thinks that God designedly avoids him, because He is well aware of his innocence; now, however, he will admit no other thought but that of suffering him to endure to the end the affliction decreed. Job's suspicion against God is as dreadful as it is childish. This is a profoundly tragic stroke. It is not to be understood as the sarcasm of defiance; on the contrary, as one of the childish thoughts into which melancholy bordering on madness falls. From the bright height of faith to which Job soars in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#025">Job 19:25</A>. he is here again drawn down into the most terrible depth of conflict, in which, like a blind man, he gropes after God, and because he cannot find Him thinks that He flees before him lest He should be overcome by him. The God of the present, Job accounts his enemy; and the God of the future, to whom his faith clings, who will and must vindicate him so soon as He only allows himself to be found and seen - this God is not to be found! He cannot get free either from his suffering or from his ignominy. The future for him is again veiled in a twofold darkness.
<p>Thus Job does not so much answer Eliphaz as himself, concerning the cutting rebukes he has brought against him. He is not able to put them aside, for his consciousness does not help him; and God, whose judgment he desires to have, leaves him still in difficulty. But the mystery of his lot of affliction, which thereby becomes constantly more torturing, becomes still more mysterious from a consideration of the reverse side, which he is urged by Eliphaz more closely to consider, terrible as it may be to him. He, the innocent one, is being tortured to death by an angry God, while for the ungodly there come no times of punishment, no days of vengeance: greedy conquerors, merciless rulers, oppress the poor to the last drop of blood, who are obliged to yield to them, and must serve them without wrong being helped by the right; murderers, who shun the light, thieves, and adulterers, carry on their evil courses unpunished; and swiftly and easily, without punishment overtaking them, or being able to overtake them, Shel snatches them away, as heat does the melted snow; even God himself preserves the oppressors long in the midst of extreme danger, and after a long life, free from care and laden with honour, permits them to die a natural death, as a ripe ear of corn is cut off. Bold in the certainty of the truth of his assertion, Job meets the friends: if it is not so, who will convict me as a liar?! What answer will they give? They cannot long disown the mystery, for experience outstrips them. Will they therefore solve it? They might, had they but the key of the future state to do it with! But neither they nor Job were in possession of that, and we shall therefore see how the mystery, without a knowledge of the future state, struggled through towards solution; or even if this were impossible, how the doubts which it excites are changed to faith, and so are conquered.
