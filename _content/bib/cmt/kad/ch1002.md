The Twelve Sons of Israel and the Families of Judah - 1 Chronicles
2-4:23

The list of the twelve sons of Israel ([Ch1
2:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#001)) serves as foundation and
starting-point for the genealogies of the tribes of Israel which follow,
[Ch1 2:3-8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#003). The enumeration of the
families of the tribe of Judah commences in [Ch1
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#003) with the naming of Judah's sons,
and extends to [Ch1 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#023). The tribe of
Judah has issued from the posterity of only three of the five sons of
Judah, viz., from Shelah, Pharez, and Zerah; but it was subdivided into
five great families, as Hezron and Hamul, the two sons of Pharez, also
founded families. The lists of our three chapters give us: (1) from the
family of Zerah only the names of some famous men ([Ch1
2:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#006)); (2) the descendants of Hezron
in the three branches corresponding to the three sons of Hezron, into
which they divided themselves ([Ch1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#009)), viz., the descendants of Ram to
David ([Ch1 2:10-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#010)), of Caleb ([Ch1
2:18-24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#018)), and of Jerahmeel (2:25-41).
Then there follow in [Ch1 2:42-55](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#042) four
other lists of descendants of Caleb, who peopled a great number of the
cities of Judah; and then in 1 Chron 3 we have a list of the sons of
David and the line of kings of the house of David, down to the grandsons
of Zerubbabel; and finally, in 1 Chron 4:1-23, other genealogical
fragments as to the posterity of Pharez and Shelah. Of Hamul,
consequently, no descendants are noticed, unless perhaps some of the
groups ranged together in [Ch1 4:8-22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#008),
whose connection with the heads of the families of Judah is not given,
are of his lineage. The lists collected in 1 Chron 4:1-20 are clearly
only supplements to the genealogies of the great families contained in 1
Chron 2 and 3, which the author of the Chronicle found in the same
fragmentary state in which they are communicated to us.

[1 Chronicles 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 2:1</span></span>

The twelve sons of Israel, arranged as follows: first, the six sons of
Leah; then Dan, the son of Rachel's handmaid; next, the sons of Rachel;
and finally, the remaining sons of the handmaids. That a different place
is assigned to Dan, viz., before the sons of Rachel, from that which he
holds in the list in [Gen 35:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#023)., is
perhaps to be accounted for by Rachel's wishing the son of her maid
Bilhah to be accounted her own (vide [Gen
30:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#003)).

[1 Chronicles 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch1 2:3</span></span>

The sons of Judah and of Pharez, [Ch1
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#003).f. - The five sons of Judah are
given according to Gen 38, as the remark on Er which is quoted from [Gen
38:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#007) of that chapter shows, while the
names of the five sons are to be found also in [Gen
46:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#012). The two sons of Pharez are
according to [Gen 46:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#012), cf. [Num
26:21](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#021).

[1 Chronicles 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 2:6</span></span>

Sons and descendants of Zerah. - In [Ch1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#006), five names are grouped together
as בּנים of Zerah, which are found nowhere else so united. The first,
Zimri, may be strictly a son; but זמרי may perhaps be a mistake for
זבדּי, for Achan, who is in [Ch1 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#007)
the son of Carmi, is in [Jos 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#001)
called the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah. But זבדּי
(Josh.) may also be an error for זמרי, or he may have been a son of
Zimri, since in genealogical lists an intermediate member of the family
is often passed over. Nothing certain can, however, be ascertained; both
names are found elsewhere, but of persons belonging to other tribes:
Zimri as prince of the Simeonites, [Num
25:14](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#014); as Benjamite, [Ch1
8:36](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#036); [Ch1
9:42](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#042); and as king of Israel, [Kg1
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#009); Zabdi, [Ch1
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#019) (as Benjamite), and [Ch1
27:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#027), [Neh
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#017). The four succeeding names,
Ethan, Heman, Calcol, and Dara, are met with again in [Kg1
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#011), where it is said of Solomon he
was wiser than the Ezrahite Ethan, and Heman, and Calcol, and Darda, the
sons of Machol, with the unimportant variation of דרדע for דרע. On this
account, Movers and Bertheau, following Clericus on [Kg1
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#031) ([Kg1
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#011)), hold the identity of the wise
men mentioned in [Kg1 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#011) with the
sons (descendants) of Zerah to be beyond doubt. But the main reason
which Clericus produces in support of this supposition, the consensus
quatuor nominum et quidem unius patris filiorum, and the difficulty of
believing that in alia familia Hebraea there should have been quatuor
fratres cognomines quatuor filiis Zerachi Judae filii, loses all its
force from the fact that the supposition that the four wise men in [Kg1
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#011) are brothers by blood, is a
groundless and erroneous assumption. Since Ethan is called the Ezrahite,
while the last two are said to be the sons of Machol, it is clear that
the four were not brothers. The mention of them as men famous for their
wisdom, does not at all require that we should think the men
contemporary with each other. Even the enumeration of these four along
with Zimri as זרח בּני in our verse does not necessarily involve that
the five names denote brothers by blood; for it is plain from [Ch1
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#007), [Ch1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#008) that in this genealogy only single
famous names of the family of Zerah the son of Judah and Tamar are
grouped together. But, on the other hand, the reasons which go to
disprove the identity of the persons in our verse with those named in
[Kg1 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#011) are not of very great
weight. The difference in the names דרע and דרדע is obviously the result
of an error of transcription, and the form העזרחי ([Kg1
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#011)) is most probably a patronymic
from זרח, notwithstanding that in [Num
26:20](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#020) it appears as זרחי, for even the
appellative עזרח, indigena, is formed from זרח. We therefore hold that
the persons who bear the same names in our verse and in [Kg1
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#011) are most probably identical, in
spite of the addition מחול בּני to Calcol and Darda ([Kg1
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#011)). For that this addition belongs
merely to these two names, and not to Ezrah, appears from [Psa
88:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#001) and [Psa
89:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#001), which, according to the
superscription, were composed by the Ezrahites Heman and Ethan. The
authors of these psalms are unquestionably the Heman and Ethan who were
famed for their wisdom ([Kg1 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#011)),
and therefore most probably the same as those spoken of in our verse as
sons of Zerah. It is true that the authors of these psalms have been
held by many commentators to be Levites, nay, to be the musicians
mentioned in [Ch1 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#017) and [Ch1
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#019); but sufficient support for this
view, which I myself, on [Kg1 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#011),
after the example of Hengstenberg, Beitrr. ii. S. 61, and on Ps 88
defended, cannot be found. The statement of the superscription of [Psa
88:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#001) - "a psalm of the sons of Korah"
- from which it is inferred that the Ezrahite Heman was of Levitic
origin, does not justify such a conclusion.

(Note: The above quoted statement of the superscription of [Psa
88:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#001) can contain no information as to
the author of the psalm, for this reason, that the author is expressly
mentioned in the next sentence of the superscription. The psalm can only
in so far be called a song of the children of Korah, as it bears the
impress peculiar to the Korahite psalms in contents and form.)

For though the musician Heman the son of Joel was Korahite of the race
of Kohath ([Ch1 6:18-23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#018)), yet the
musician Ethan the son of Kishi, or Kushaiah, was neither Korahite nor
Kohathite, but a Merarite ([Ch1
6:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#029).). Moreover, the Levites Heman
and Ethan could not be enumerated among the Ezrahites, that is, the
descendants of Zerah, a man of Judah.

The passages which are quoted in support of the view that the Levites
were numbered with the tribes in the midst of whom they dwelt, and that,
consequently, there were Judaean and Ephraimite Levites - as, for
example, [Sa1 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001), where the father of
the Levite Samuel is called an Ephrathite because he dwelt in Mount
Ephraim; and [Jdg 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#007), where a Levite
is numbered with the family of Judah because he dwelt as sojourner (גּר)
in Bethlehem, a city of Judah - certainly prove that the Levites were
reckoned, as regards citizenship, according to the tribes or cities in
which they dwelt, but certainly do not show that they were incorporated
genealogically with those tribes because of their place of residence.

(Note: Not even by intermarrying with heiresses could Levites become
members of another tribe; for, according to the law, [Num
36:5](../../../bib/kjv/num036.htm#005)., heiresses could marry only men
of their own tribe; and the possibility of a man of Judah marrying an
heiress of the tribe of Levi was out of the question, for the Levites
possessed no inheritance in land.)

The Levites Heman and Ethan, therefore, cannot be brought forward in our
verse "as adopted sons of Zerah, who brought more honour to their father
than his proper sons" (Hengstb.). This view is completely excluded by
the fact that in our verse not only Ethan and Heman, but also Zimri,
Calcol, and Dara are called sons of Zerah, yet these latter were not
adopted sons, but true descendants of Zerah. Besides, in [Ch1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#008), there is an actual son or
descendant of Ethan mentioned, and consequently בּני and בּן cannot
possibly be understood in some cases as implying only an adoptive
relationship, and in the others actual descent. But the similarity of
the names is not of itself sufficient to justify us in identifying the
persons. As the name Zerah again appears in [Ch1
6:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#026) in the genealogy of the Levite
Asaph, so also the name Ethan occurs in the same genealogy, plainly
showing that more than one Israelite bore this name. The author of the
Chronicle, too, has sufficiently guarded against the opinion that
Zerah's sons Ethan and Heman are identical with the Levitical musicians
who bear the same names, by tracing back in 1 Chron 6 the family of
those musicians to Levi, without calling them Ezrahites.

(Note: The supposition of Ewald and Bertheau, that these two great
singers of the tribe of Judah had been admitted into their guild by the
Levitic musical schools, and on that account had been received also into
their family, and so had been numbered with the tribe of Levi, is thus
completely refuted, even were it at all possible that members of other
tribes should have been received into the tribe of Levi.)

But to hold, with Movers, S. 237, that the recurrences of the same names
in various races are contradictions, which are to be explained only on
the supposition of genealogical combinations by various authors, will
enter into the head of no sensible critic. We therefore believe the five
persons mentioned in our verse to be actual descendants of the Judaean
Zerah; but whether they were sons or grandsons, or still more distant
descendants, cannot be determined. It is certainly very probable that
Zimri was a son, if he be identical with the Zabdi of [Jos
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#001); Ethan and Heman may have been
later descendants of Zerah, if they were the wise men mentioned in [Kg1
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#011); but as to Calcol and Dara no
further information is to be obtained. From [Ch1
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#007) and [Ch1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#008), where of the sons (בּני) of Zimri
and Ethan only one man in each case is named, it is perfectly clear that
in our genealogy only individuals, men who have become famous, are
grouped together out of the whole posterity of Zerah. The plural בּני in
[Ch1 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#007) and [Ch1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#008), etc., even where only one son is
mentioned, is used probably only in those cases where, out of a number
of sons or descendants, one has gained for himself by some means a
memorable name. This is true at least of Achan, [Ch1
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#007), who, by laying hands on the
accursed spoils of Jericho, had become notorious (Josh 7). Because Achan
had thus troubled Israel (עכר), he is called here at once Achar. As to
Carmi, vide on [Ch1 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#001).

[1 Chronicles 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch1 2:9</span></span>

The only name given here as that of a descendant of Ethan is Azariah, of
whom nothing further is known, while the name recurs frequently. Nothing
more is said of the remaining sons of Zerah; they are merely set down as
famous men of antiquity (Berth.). There follows in

1 Chronicles 2:9-41

The family of Hezron, the first-born son of Pharez, which branches off
in three lines, originating with his three sons respectively. The three
sons of Hezron are Jerahmeel, and Ram, and Chelubai; but the families
springing from them are enumerated in a different order. First ([Ch1
2:10-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#010)) we have the family of Ram,
because King David is descended from him; then ([Ch1
2:18-24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#018)) the family of Chelubai or
Caleb, from whose lineage came the illustrious Bezaleel; and finally
(vv. 25-41), the posterity of the first-born, Jerahmeel.

[Ch1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#009)

לו נולד אשׁר, what was born to him. The passive stands impersonally
instead of the more definite active, "to whom one bore," so that the
following names are subordinated to it with את. The third person
singular Niph. occurs thus also in [Ch1
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#004) and [Ch1
26:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#006); the construction of Niph. with
את frequently ([Gen 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#018); [Gen
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#005), and elsewhere). Ram is called,
in the genealogy in [Mat 1:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#003), Aram;
comp. רם, [Job 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#002), with ארם, [Gen
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#021). כּלוּבי is called afterwards
כּלב; cf. on [Ch1 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#018).

[Ch1 2:10-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#010)

The family of Ram ([Ch1 2:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#010)),
traced down through six members of Jesse. - This genealogy is also to be
found in Ruth. [Ch1 4:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#019); but only
here is Nahshon made more prominent than the others, by the addition,
"prince of the sons of Judah." Nahshon was a prince of Judah at the
exodus of the Israelites from Egypt ([Num
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#007); [Num
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#003); [Num
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#012)). Now between him, a contemporary
of Moses, and Pharez, who at the immigration of Jacob into Egypt was
about fifteen years old, lies a period of 430 years, during which the
Israelites remained in Egypt. For that time only three names - Hezron,
Ram, and Amminidab - are mentioned, from which it is clear that several
links must have been passed over. So also, from Nahshon to David, for a
period of over 400 years, four generations - Salma, Boaz, Obed, and
Jesse - are too few; and consequently here also the less famous
ancestors of David are omitted. שׂלמא is called in [Rut
4:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#020), שׁלמה and שׂלמון. In [Ch1
2:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#013), seven sons and two daughters
of Jesse, with those of their sons who became famous ([Ch1
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#016), [Ch1
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#017)), are enumerated. According to
[Sa1 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#012), Jesse had eight sons. This
account, which agrees with that in [Sa1
16:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#008), may be reconciled with the
enumeration in our verse, on the supposition that one of the sons died
without posterity. In [Sa1 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#006). and
[Ch1 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#013), the names of the eldest
three - Eliab, Abinadab, and Shammah - occur. Besides ישׁי, we meet with
the form אשׁי ([Ch1 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#013)); and the
name שׁמּה is only another form of שׁמעה, which is found in [Sa2
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#003) and in [Ch1
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1020.htm#007), and is repeated in [Sa2
13:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#032) and [Sa2
21:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#021) in the Kethibh (שׁמעי). The
names of the other three sons here mentioned ([Ch1
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#014) and [Ch1
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#015)) are met with nowhere else.

[Ch1 2:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#016)

The sisters of David have become known through their heroic sons.
Zeruiah is the mother of the heroes of the Davidic history, Abishai,
Joab, and Asahel (cf. [Sa1 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#006); [Sa2
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#018); [Sa2
3:39](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#039); [Sa2
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#016), and elsewhere). Their father is
nowhere mentioned, "because their more famous mother challenged the
greater attention" (Berth.). Abigail was, according to [Sa2
17:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#025), the daughter of Nahash, a
sister of Zeruiah, and so was only a half-sister of David, and was the
mother of Amasa the captain of the host, so well known on account of his
share in the conspiracy of Absalom; cf. [Sa2
17:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#025); [Sa2
19:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#014), and [Sa2
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#010). His father was Jether, or
Jithra, the Ishmaelite, who in the Masoretic text of [Sa2
17:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#025) is called, through a copyist's,
error, היּשׂראלי instead of היּשׁמעאלי; see comm. on passage.

[Ch1 2:18-24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#018)

The family of Caleb. - That כּלב is merely a shortened form of כּלוּבי,
or a form of that word resulting from the friction of constant use, is
so clear from the context, that all exegetes recognise it. We have first
([Ch1 2:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#018)) a list of the
descendants of Caleb by two wives, then descendants which the daughter
of the Gileadite Machir bore to his father Hezron ([Ch1
2:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#021)), and finally the sons whom
Hezron's wife bore him after his death ([Ch1
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#024)). The grouping of these
descendants of Hezron with the family of Caleb can only be accounted for
by supposing that they had, through circumstances unknown to us, come
into a more intimate connection with the family of Caleb than with the
families of his brothers Ram and Jerahmeel. In [Ch1
2:42-55](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#042) follow some other lists of
descendants of Caleb, which will be more fully considered when we come
to these verses. The first half of the 18th verse is obscure, and the
text is probably corrupt. As the words stand at present, we must
translate, "Caleb the son of Hezron begat with Azubah, a woman, and with
Jerioth, and these are her (the one wife's) sons, Jesher," etc. בּניה,
filii ejus, suggests that only one wife of Caleb had been before
mentioned; and, as appears from the "and Azubah died" of [Ch1
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#019), Azubah is certainly meant. The
construction את הוליד, "he begat with," is, it is true, unusual, but is
analogous to חוליד מן, [Ch1 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#009), and
is explained by the fact that הוליד may mean to cause to bear, to bring
to bearing; cf. [Isa 66:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#009) : therefore
properly it is, "he brought Azubah to bearing." The difficulty of the
verse lies in the ואת־יריעות אשּׁה, for, according to the usual
phraseology, we would have expected אשׁתּו instead of אשּׁה. But אשּׁה
may be, under the circumstances, to some extent justified by the
supposition that Azubah is called indefinitely "woman," because Caleb
had several wives. ואת־וריעות gives no suitable meaning. The explanation
of Kimchi, "with Azubah a woman, and with Jerioth," cannot be accepted,
for only the sons of Azubah are hereafter mentioned; and the idea that
the children of the other wives are not enumerated here because the list
used by the chronicler was defective, is untenable: for after two wives
had been named in the enumeration of the children of one of them, the
mother must necessarily have been mentioned; and so, instead of בּניה,
we should have had עזוּבה בּני. Hiller and J. H. Michaelis take ואת as
explicative, "with Azubah a woman, viz., with Jerioth;" but this is
manifestly only the product of exegetical embarrassment. The text is
plainly at fault, and the easiest conjecture is to read, with the
Peschito and the Vulgate, את אשׁתּו instead of ואת אשּׁה, "he begat with
Azubah his wife, Jerioth (a daughter); and these are her sons." In that
case אשּׁה would be added to עזוּבה, to guard against עזוּבה being taken
for acc. obj. The names of the sons of Azubah, or of her daughter
Jerioth, do not occur elsewhere.

[Ch1 2:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#019)

When Azubah died, Caleb took Ephrath to wife, who bore him Hur. For אפרת
we find in [Ch1 2:50](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#050) the lengthened
feminine form אפרתה; cf. also [Ch1
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#004). From Hur descended, by Uri, the
famous Bezaleel, the skilful architect of the tabernacle ([Exo
31:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#002); [Exo
35:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#030)).

[Ch1 2:21-24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#021)

The descendants of Hezron numbered with the stock of Caleb: (a) those
begotten by Hezron with the daughter of Machir, [Ch1
2:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#021); (b) those born to Hezron
after his death, [Ch1 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#024).

[Ch1 2:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#021)

Afterwards (אחר), i.e., after the birth of the sons mentioned in [Ch1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#009), whose mother is not mentioned,
when he was sixty years old, Hezron took to wife the daughter of Machir
the father of Gilead, who bore him Segub. Machir was the first-born of
Manasseh ([Gen 50:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#023); [Num
26:29](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#029)). But Machir is not called in
[Ch1 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#021) and [Ch1
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#023) the father of Gilead because he
was the originator of the Israelite population of Gilead, but אב has
here its proper signification. Machir begot a son of the name of Gilead
([Num 26:29](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#029)); and it is clear from the
genealogy of the daughters of Zelophehad, communicated in [Num
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#001), that this expression is to be
understood in its literal sense. Machir is distinguished from other men
of the same name (cf. [Sa2 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#004); [Sa2
17:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#027)) by the addition, father of
Gilead. Segub the son of Hezron and the daughter of Machir begat Jair.
This Jair, belonging on his mother's side to the tribe of Manasseh, is
set down in [Num 32:40](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#040)., [Deu
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#014), as a descendant of Manasseh.
After Moses' victory over Og king of Bashan, Jair's family conquered the
district of Argob in Bashan, i.e., in the plain of Jaulan and Hauran;
and to the conquered cities, when they were bestowed upon him for a
possession by Moses, the name Havvoth-jair, i.e., Jair's-life, was
given. Cf. [Num 32:41](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#041) and [Deu
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#014), where this name is explained.
These are the twenty-three cities in the land of Gilead, i.e., Pera.

[Ch1 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#023)

These cities named Jair's-life were taken away from the Jairites by
Geshur and Aram, i.e., by the Arameans of Geshur and of other places.
Geshur denotes the inhabitants of a district of Aram, or Syria, on the
north-western frontier of Bashan, in the neighbourhood of Hermon, on the
east side of the upper Jordan, which had still its own kings in the time
of David ([Sa2 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#003); [Sa2
13:37](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#037); [Sa2
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#023); [Sa2
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#008)), but which had been assigned to
the Manassites by Moses; cf. [Jos
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#013). The following וגו את־קנת must
not be taken as an explanatory apposition to יאיר את־חוּת: "Jair's-life,
Kenath and her daughters, sixty cities" (Berth.). For since מאתּם refers
to the collective name Jair, Geshur and Aram could not take away from
Jair sixty cities, for Jair only possessed twenty-three cities. But
besides this, according to [Num 32:42](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#042),
Kenath with her daughters had been conquered by Nobah, who gave his own
name to the conquered cities; and according to [Deu
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#004), the kingdom of Og in Bashan had
sixty fenced cities. But this kingdom was, according to [Num
32:41](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#041), and [Num
32:42](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#042), conquered by two families of
Manasseh, by Jair and Nobah, and was divided between them; and as
appears from our passage, twenty-three cities were bestowed upon Jair,
and all the rest of the land, viz., Kenath with her daughters, fell to
Nobah. These two domains together included sixty fenced cities, which in
[Deu 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#014) are called Jair's-life;
while here, in our verse, only twenty-three cities are so called, and
the remaining thirty-seven are comprehended under the name of Kenath had
her daughters. WE must therefore either supply a w copul. before את־קנת,
or we must take את־ק in the signification "with Kenath," and refer עיר
שׁשּׁים to both Jair's-life and Kenath. Cf. herewith the discussion on
[Deu 3:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#012); and for Kenath, the
ruins of which still exist under the name Kanuat on the western slope of
the Jebel Hauran, see the remarks on [Num
32:42](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#042). The time when these cities were
taken away by the Arameans is not known. From [Jdg
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#004) we only learn that the Jair who
was judge at a later time again had possession of thirty of these
cities, and renewed the name Jair's-life. כּל־אלּה is not all these
sixty cities, but the before-mentioned descendants of Hezron, who are
called sons, that is offspring, of Machir, because they were begotten
with the daughter of Machir. Only two names, it is true, Segub and Jair,
are enumerated; but from these two issue the numerous families which
took Jair's-life. To these, therefore, must we refer the כּל־אלּה.

[Ch1 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#024)

After the death of Hezron there was born to him by his wife Abiah (the
third wife, cf. [Ch1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#009) and [Ch1
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#021)) another son, Ashur, the father
of Tekoa, whose descendants are enumerated in [Ch1
4:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#005). Hezron's death took place אפרתה
בּכלב, "in Caleb Ephrathah." This expression is obscure. According to
[Sa1 30:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#014), a part of the Negeb (south
country) of Judah was called Negeb Caleb, as it belonged to the family
of Caleb. According to this analogy, the town or village in which Caleb
dwelt with his wife Ephrath may have been called Caleb of Ephrathah, if
Ephrath had brought this place as a dower to Caleb, as in the case
mentioned in [Jos 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#018). Ephrathah, or
Ephrath, was the ancient name of Bethlehem ([Gen
33:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#019); [Gen
48:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#001)), and with it the name of Caleb's
wife Ephrath ([Ch1 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#019)) is
unquestionably connected; probably she was so called after her
birthplace. If this supposition be well founded, then Caleb of Ephrathah
would be the little town of Bethlehem. Ashur is called father (אבי) of
Tekoa, i.e., lord and prince, as the chief of the inhabitants of Tekoa,
now Tekua, two hours south of Bethlehem (vide on [Jos
15:59](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#059)).

1 Chronicles 2:25-41

The family of Jerahmeel, the first-born of Hezron, which inhabited a
part of the Negeb of Judah called after him the south of the
Jerahmeelites ([Sa1 27:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#010); [Sa1
30:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#029)).

[Ch1 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#025)

Four sons were born to Jerahmeel by his first wife. Five names indeed
follow; but as the last, אחיּה, although met with elsewhere as a man's
name, is not ranged with the others by ו copul., as those that precede
are with each other, it appears to be the name of a woman, and probably
a מ has fallen out after the immediately preceding ם. So Cler., J. H.
Mich., Berth. This conjecture gains in probability from the mention in
[Ch1 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#026) of another wife, whence we
might expect that in [Ch1 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#025) the
first wife would be named.

[Ch1 2:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#026)

Only one son of the second wife is given, Onam, whose posterity follows
in [Ch1 2:28-33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#028); for in [Ch1
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#027) the three sons of Ram, the
first-born of Jerahmeel, are enumerated.

[Ch1 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#028)

Onam had two sons, Shammai and Jada; the second of these, again, two
sons, Nadab and Abishur.

[Ch1 2:29-31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#029)

To Abishur his wife Abihail bore likewise two sons, with whom his race
terminates. - In [Ch1 2:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#030), [Ch1
2:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#031), Nadab's posterity follow, in
four members, ending with Ahlai, in the fourth generation. But Ahlai
cannot well have been a son, but must have been a daughter, the heiress
of Sheshan; for, according to [Ch1
2:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#034), Sheshen had no sons, but only
daughters, and gave his daughter to an Egyptian slave whom he possessed,
to wife, by whom she became the mother of a numerous posterity. The
שׁשׁן בּני is not irreconcilable with this, for בּני denotes in
genealogies only descendants in general, and has been here correctly so
explained by Hiller in Onomast. p. 736: quicquid habuit liberorum, sive
nepotum, sustulit ex unica filia Achlai.

[Ch1 2:32-41](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#032)

The descendants of Jada, the brother of Shammai, in two generations,
after which this genealogy closes with the subscription, "these were the
sons of Jerahmeel."

(Note: Bertheau reckons up to "the concluding subscription in [Ch1
2:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#033)" the following descendants of
Judah: "Judah's sons = 5; Hezron and Hamul = 2; Zerah's sons = 5; Karmi,
Akar, and Azariah = 3; Ram and his descendants (including the two
daughters of Jesse, and Jeter the father of Amasa) = 21; Kaleb and his
descendants = 10; Jerahmeel and his descendants = 24: together = 70."
But this number also is obtained only by taking into account the father
and mother of Amasa as two persons, contrary to the rule according to
which only the father, without the mother, is to be counted, or, in case
the mother be more famous than the father, or be an heiress, only the
mother.)

\- In [Ch1 2:34-41](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#034) there follows the
family of Sheshan, which was originated by the marriage of his daughter
with his Egyptian slave, and which is continued through thirteen
generations. The name of this daughter is in [Ch1
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#025). not mentioned, but she is
without doubt the Ahlai mentioned in [Ch1
2:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#031). But since this Ahlai is the
tenth in descent from Judah through Pharez, she was probably born in
Egypt; and the Egyptian slave Jarha was most likely a slave whom Sheshan
had in Egypt, and whom he adopted as his son for the propagation of his
race, by giving him his daughter and heir to wife. If this be the case,
the race begotten by Jarha with the daughter of Sheshan is traced down
till towards the end of the period of the judges. The Egyptian slave
Jarha is not elsewhere met with; and though the names which his
posterity bore are found again in various parts of the Old Testament, of
none of them can it be proved that they belonged to men of this family,
so as to show that one of these person shad become famous in history.

[1 Chronicles 2:42](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">ch1 2:42</span></span>

Other renowned descendants of Caleb. - First of all there are
enumerated, in [Ch1 2:42-49](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#042), three
lines of descendants of Caleb, of which the two latter, [Ch1
2:46-49](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#046), are the issue of concubines.
- The first series, [Ch1 2:42-45](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#042),
contains some things which are very obscure. In [Ch1
2:42](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#042) there are menitioned, as sons of
Caleb the brother of Jerahmeel, Mesha his first-born, with the addition,
"this is the father of Ziph; and the sons of Mareshah, the father of
Hebron," as it reads according to the traditional Masoretic text. Now it
is here not only very surprising that the sons of Mareshah stand
parallel with Mesha, but it is still more strange to find such a
collocation as "sons of Mareshah the father of Hebron." The
last-mentioned difficulty would certainly be greatly lessened if we
might take Hebron to be the city of that name, and translate the phrase
"father of Hebron," lord of the city of Hebron, according to the analogy
of "father of Ziph," "father of Tekoa" ([Ch1
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#024)), and other names of that sort.
But the continuation of the genealogy, "and the sons of Hebron were
Korah, and Tappuah, Rekem, and Shema" ([Ch1
2:43](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#043)), is irreconcilable with such an
interpretation. For of these names, Tappuah, i.e., apple, is indeed met
with several times as the name of a city ([Jos
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#017); [Jos
15:34](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#034); [Jos
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#008)); and Rekem is the name of a city
of Benjamin ([Jos 18:27](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#027)), but occurs
also twice as the name of a person - once of a Midianite prince ([Num
31:8](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#008)), and once of a Manassite ([Ch1
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#016)); but the other two, Korah and
Shema, only occur as the names of persons. In [Ch1
2:44](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#044)., moreover, the descendants of
Shema and Rekem are spoken of, and that, too, in connection with the
word הוליד, "he begat," which demonstrably can only denote the
propagation of a race. We must therefore take Hebron as the name of a
person, as in [Ch1 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#002) and [Exo
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#018). But if Hebron be the name of a
man, then Mareshah also must be interpreted in the same manner. This is
also required by the mention of the sons of Mareshah parallel with Mesha
the first-born; but still more so by the circumstance that the
interpretation of Mareshah and Hebron, as names of cities, is
irreconcilable with the position of these two cities, and with their
historical relations. Bertheau, indeed, imagines that as Mareshah is
called the father of Hebron, the famous capital of the tribe of Judah,
we must therefore make the attempt, however inadmissible it may seem at
first sight, to take Mareshah, in the connection of our verse, as the
name of a city, which appears as father of Hebron, and that we must also
conclude that the ancient city Hebron ([Num
13:23](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#023)) stood in some sort of dependent
relationship to Mareshah, perhaps only in later time, although we cannot
at all determine to what time the representation of our verse applies.
But at the foundation of this argument there lies an error as to the
position of the city Mareshah. Mareshah lay in the Shephelah ([Jos
15:44](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#044)), and exists at present as the
ruin Marasch, twenty-four minutes south of Beit-Jibrin: vide on [Jos
15:44](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#044); and Tobler, Dritte Wanderung,
129 and 142f. Ziph, therefore, which is mentioned in [Ch2
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#008) along with Mareshah, and which is
consequently the Ziph mentioned in our verse, cannot be, as Bertheau
believes, the Ziph situated in the hill country of Judah, in the
wilderness of that name, whose ruins are still to be seen on the hill
Zif, about four miles south-east from Hebron ([Jos
15:55](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#055)). It can only be the Ziph in the
Shephelah ([Jos 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#024)), the position
of which has not indeed been discovered, but which is to be sought in
the Shephelah at no great distance from Marasch, and thus far distant
from Hebron. Since, then, Mareshah and Ziph were in the Shephelah, no
relation of dependence between the capital, Hebron, situated in the
mountains of Judah, and Mareshah can be thought of, neither in more
ancient nor in later time. The supposition of such a dependence is not
made probable by the remark that we cannot determine to what time the
representation of our verse applies; it only serves to cover the
difficulty which renders it impossible. That the verse does not treat of
post-exilic times is clear, although even after the exile, and in the
time of the Maccabees and the Romans, Hebron was not in a position of
dependence on Marissa. Bertheau himself holds Caleb, of whose son our
verses treat, for a contemporary of Moses and Joshua, because in [Ch1
2:49](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#049) Achsa is mentioned as daughter of
Caleb ([Jos 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#016); [Jdg
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#012)). The contents of our verse would
therefore have reference to the first part of the period of the judges.
But since Hebron was never dependent on Mareshah in the manner supposed,
the attempt, which even at first sight appeared so inadmissible, to
interpret Mareshah as the name of a city, loses all its support. For
this reason, therefore, the city of Hebron, and the other cities named
in [Ch1 2:43](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#043)., which perhaps belonged
to the district of Mareshah, cannot be the sons of Mareshah here spoken
of; and the fact that, of the names mentioned in [Ch1
2:43](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#043) and [Ch1
2:44](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#044), at most two may denote cities,
while the others are undoubtedly the names of persons, points still more
clearly to the same conclusion. We must, then, hold Hebron and Mareshah
also to be the names of persons.

Now, if the Masoretic text be correct, the use of the phrase, "and the
sons of Mareshah the father of Hebron," instead of "and Mareshah, the
sons of the father of Hebron," can only have arisen from a desire to
point out, that besides Hebron there were also other sons of Mareshah
who were of Caleb's lineage. But the mention of the sons of Mareshah,
instead of Mareshah, and the calling him the father of Hebron in this
connection, make the correctness of the traditional text very
questionable. Kimchi has, on account of the harshness of placing the
sons of Mareshah on a parallel with Mesha the first-born of Caleb,
supposed an ellipse in the expression, and construes מר ובני, et ex
filiis Ziphi Mareshah. But this addition cannot be justified. If we may
venture a conjecture in so obscure a matter, it would more readily
suggest itself that מרשׁה is an error for מישׁע, and that חברון אבי is
to be taken as a nomen compos., when the meaning would be, "and the sons
of Mesha were Abi-Hebron." The probability of the existence of such a
name as Abihebron along with the simple Hebron has many analogies in its
favour: cf. Dan and Abidan, [Num 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#011);
Ezer, [Ch1 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#009), [Neh
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#019), with Abi-ezer; Nadab, [Exo
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#023), and Abinadab. In the same family
even we have Abiner, or Abner, the son of Ner ([Sa1
14:50](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#050).; [Sa2
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#008); cf. Ew. 273, S. 666, 7th
edition). Abihebron would then be repeated in [Ch1
2:43](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#043), in the shortened form Hebron,
just as we have in [Jos 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#008) Tappuah,
instead of En-tappuah, [Jos 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#007). The
four names introduced as sons of Hebron denote persons, not localities:
cf. for Korah, [Ch1 1:35](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#035), and
concerning Tappuah and Rekem the above remark. In [Ch1
2:44](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#044) are mentioned the sons of Rekem
and of Shema, the latter a frequently recurring man's name (cf. [Ch1
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#008); [Ch1
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#013); [Ch1
11:44](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#044); [Neh
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#004)). Shema begat Raham, the father of
Jorkam. The name יקעם is quite unknown elsewhere. The lxx have rendered
it Ἰεκλὰν, and Bertheau therefore holds Jorkam to be the name of a
place, and conjectures that originally יקדעם ([Jos
15:56](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#056)) stood here also. But the lxx
give also Ἰεκλὰν for the following name רקם, from which it is clear that
we cannot rely much on their authority. The lxx have overlooked the fact
that רקם, [Ch1 2:44](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#044), is the son of the
Hebron mentioned in [Ch1 2:43](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#043), whose
descendants are further enumerated. Shammai occurs as a man's name also
in [Ch1 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#028), and is again met with in
[Ch1 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#017). His son is called in [Ch1
2:45](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#045) Maon, and Maon is the father of
Bethzur. בּית־צוּר is certainly the city in the mountains of Judah which
Rehoboam fortified ([Ch2 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#007)), and
which still exists in the ruin Bet-sur, lying south of Jerusalem in the
direction of Hebron. Maon also was a city in the mountains of Judah, now
Main ([Jos 15:55](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#055)); but we cannot allow
that this city is meant by the name מעון, because Maon is called on the
one hand the son of Shammai, and on the other is father of Bethzur, and
there are no well-ascertained examples of a city being represented as
son (בּן) of a man, its founder or lord, nor of one city being called
the father of another. Dependent cities and villages are called
daughters (not sons) of the mother city. The word מעון, "dwelling," does
not per se point to a village or town, and in [Jdg
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#012) denotes a tribe of
non-Israelites.

[1 Chronicles 2:46](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#046)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">ch1 2:46</span></span>

Descendants of Caleb by two concubines. - The name עיפה occurs in [Ch1
2:47](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#047) and [Ch1
1:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#033) as a man's name. Caleb's
concubine of this name bore three sons: Haran, of whom nothing further
is known; Moza, which, though in [Jos
18:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#026) it is the name of a Benjamite
town, is not necessarily on that account the name of a town here; and
Gazez, unknown, perhaps a grandson of Caleb, especially if the clause
"Haran begat Gazez" be merely an explanatory addition. But Haran may
also have given to his son the name of his younger brother, so that a
son and grandson of Caleb may have borne the same name.

[Ch1 2:47](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#047)

The genealogical connection of the names in this verse is entirely
wanting; for Jahdai, of whom six sons are enumerated, appears quite
abruptly. Hiller, in Onomast., supposes, but without sufficient ground,
that יהדּי is another name of Moza. Of his sons' names, Jotham occurs
frequently of different persons; Ephah, as has been already remarked, is
in [Ch1 1:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#033) the name of a chief of a
Midianite tribe; and lastly, Shaaph is used in [Ch1
2:49](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#049) of another person.

[Ch1 2:48-49](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#048)

Another concubine of Caleb was called Maachah, a not uncommon woman's
name; cf. [Ch1 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#002); [Ch1
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#016); [Ch1
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#029); [Ch1
11:43](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#043), etc. She bore Sheber and
Tirhanah, names quite unknown. The masc. ילד instead of the fem. ילדה,
[Ch1 2:46](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#046), is to be explained by the
supposition that the father who begat was present to the mind of the
writer. [Ch1 2:49](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#049). Then she bore also
Shaaph (different from the Shaaph in [Ch1
2:47](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#047)), the father of Madmannah, a city
in the south of Judah, perhaps identical with Miniay or Minieh,
southwards from Gaza (see on [Jos
15:31](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#031)). Sheva (David's Sopher scribe
is so called in the Keri of [Sa2
20:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#025)), the father of Machbenah, a
village of Judah not further mentioned, and of Gibea, perhaps the Gibeah
mentioned in [Jos 15:57](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#057), in the
mountains of Judah, or the village Jeba mentioned by Robinson, Palest.
ii. p. 327, and Tobler, Dritte Wanderung, S. 157f., on a hill in the
Wady Musurr (vide on [Jos 15:57](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#057)). This
list closes with the abrupt remark, "and Caleb's daughter was Achsah."
This notice can only refer to the Achsah so well known in the history of
the conquest of the tribal domain of Judah, whom Caleb had promised, and
gave as a reward to the conqueror of Debir ([Jos
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#016).; [Jdg
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#012)); otherwise in its abrupt form it
would have no meaning. Women occur in the genealogies only when they
have played an important part in history. Since, however, the father of
this Achsah was Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who was about forty years
old when the Israelites left Egypt, while our Caleb, on the contrary, is
called in [Ch1 2:42](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#042) the brother of
Jerahmeel, and is at the same time designated son of Hezron, the son of
Pharez ([Ch1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#009)), these two Calebs
cannot be one person: the son of Hezron must have been a much older
Caleb than the son of Jephunneh. The older commentators have
consequently with one voice distinguished the Achsah mentioned in our
verse from the Achsah in [Jos 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#016);
while Movers, on the contrary (Chron. S. 83), would eliminate from the
text, as a later interpolation, the notice of the daughter of Caleb.
Bertheau, however, attempts to prove the identity of Caleb the son of
Hezron with Caleb the son of Jephunneh. The assertion of Movers is so
manifestly a critical tour de force, that it requires no refutation; but
neither can we subscribe to Bertheau's view. He is, indeed, right in
rejecting Ewald's expedient of holding that [Ch1
2:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#018) and [Ch1
2:45-50](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#045) are to be referred to
Chelubai, and [Ch1 2:42-49](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#042) to a Caleb
to be carefully distinguished from him; for it contradicts the plain
sense of the words, according to which both Chelubai, [Ch1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#009), and Caleb, [Ch1
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#018) and [Ch1
2:42](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#042), is the son of Hezron and the
brother of Jerahmeel. But what he brings forward against distinguishing
Caleb the father of Achsah, [Ch1 2:49](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#049),
from Caleb the brother of Jerahmeel, [Ch1
2:42](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#042), is entirely wanting in force.
The reasons adduced reduce themselves to these: that Caleb the son of
Jephunneh, the conqueror and possessor of Hebron, might well be called
in the genealogical language, which sometimes expresses geographical
relations, the son of Hezron, along with Ram and Jerahmeel, as the names
Ram and Jerahmeel certainly denote families in Judah, who, originally at
least, dwelt in other domains than that of Caleb; and again, that the
individual families as well as the towns and villages in these various
domains may be conceived of as sons and descendants of those who
represent the great families of the tribe, and the divisions of the
tribal territory. But we must deny the geographical signification of the
genealogies when pressed so far as this: for valid proofs are entirely
wanting that towns are represented as sons and brothers of other towns;
and the section [Ch1 2:42-49](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#042) does not
treat merely, or principally, of the geographical relations of the
families of Judah, but in the first place, and in the main, deals with
the genealogical ramifications of the descendants and families of the
sons of Judah. It by no means follows, because some of these descendants
are brought forward as fathers of cities, that in [Ch1
2:42-49](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#042) towns and their mutual
connection are spoken of; and the names Caleb, Ram, and Jerahmeel do not
here denote families, but are the names of the fathers and chiefs of the
families which descended from them, and dwelt in the towns just named.
We accordingly distinguish Caleb, whose daughter was called Achsah, and
whose father was Jephunneh ([Jos
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#016).), from Caleb the brother of
Jerahmeel and the son of Hezron. but we explain the mention of Achsah as
daughter of Caleb, at the end of the genealogical lists of the persons
and families descended by concubines from Caleb, by the supposition that
the Caleb who lived in the time of Moses, the son of Jephunneh, was a
descendant of an older Caleb, the brother of Jerahmeel. But it is
probable that the Caleb in [Ch1 2:49](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#049)
is the same who is called in [Ch1 2:42](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#042)
the brother of Jerahmeel, and whose descendants are specified [Ch1
2:42-49](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#042); and we take the word בּת,
"daughter," in its wider sense, as signifying a later female descendant,
because the father of the Achsah so well known from [Jos
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#016). is also called son of Jephunneh
in the genealogy, [Ch1 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#015).

[1 Chronicles 2:50](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#050)

The families descended from Caleb through his son Hur. - [Ch1
2:50](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#050). The superscription, "These are
the sons (descendants) of Caleb," is more accurately defined by the
addition, "the son of Hur, the first-born of Ephratah;" and by this
definition the following lists of Caleb's descendants are limited to the
families descended from his son Hur. That the words וגו בּן־חוּר are to
be so understood, and not as apposition to כּלב, "Caleb the son of Hur,"
is shown by [Ch1 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#019), according to
which Hur is a son of Caleb and Ephrath. On that account, too, the
relationship of Hur to Caleb is not given here; it is presupposed as
known from [Ch1 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#019). A famous
descendant of Hur has already been mentioned in [Ch1
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#020), viz., Bezaleel the son of Uri.
Here, in [Ch1 2:50](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#050) and [Ch1
2:51](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#051), three sons of Hur are named,
Shobal, Salma, and Hareph, with the families descended from the first
two. All information is wanting as to whether these sons of Hur were
brothers of Uri, or his cousins in nearer or remoter degree, as indeed
is every means of a more accurate determination of the degrees of
relationship. Both בּן and הוליד in genealogies mark only descent in a
straight line, while intermediate members of a family are often omitted
in the lists. Instead of בּן־חוּר, בּני־חוּר might have been expected,
as two sons are mentioned. The singular בּן shows that the words are not
to be fused with the following into one sentence, but, as the Masoretic
punctuation also shows, are meant for a superscription, after which the
names to be enumerated are ranged without any more intimate logical
connection. For the three names are not connected by the w copul. They
stand thus: "sons of Hur, the first-born of Ephratah;
Shobal...Salma...Hareph." Shobal is called father of Kirjath-jearim, now
Kureyet el Enab (see on [Jos 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#017)).
Salma, father of Bethlehem, the birth-place of David and Christ. This
Salma is, however, not the same person as Salma mentioned in [Ch1
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#011) and [Rut
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#020) among the ancestors of David; for
the latter belonged to the family of Ram, the former to the family of
Caleb. Hareph is called the father of Beth-Geder, which is certainly not
the same place as Gedera, [Jos 15:36](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#036),
which lay in the Shephelah, but is probably identical with Gedor in the
hill country, [Jos 15:58](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#058), west of the
road which leads from Hebron to Jerusalem (vide on [Ch1
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#004)). Nothing further is told of
Hareph, but in the following verses further descendants of both the
other sons of Hur are enumerated.

[1 Chronicles 2:52](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#052)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">ch1 2:52</span></span>

Shobal had sons, המּנחות חצי הראה. These words, which are translated in
the Vulgate, qui videbat dimidium requietionum, give, so interpreted, no
fitting sense, but must contain proper names. The lxx have made from
them three names, Ἀραὰ καὶ Αἰσὶ καὶ Ἀμμανίθ, on mere conjecture. Most
commentators take הראה for the name of the man who, in [Ch1
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#002), is called under the name Reaiah,
ראיה, the son of Shobal. This is doubtless correct; but we must not take
הראה for another name of Reaiah, but, with Bertheau, must hold it to be
a corruption of ראיה, or a conjecture arising from a false
interpretation of המּנחות חצי by a transcriber or reader, who did not
take Hazi-Hammenuhoth for a proper name, but understood it
appellatively, and attempted to bring some sense out of the words by
changing ראיה into the participle ראה. The המּנחתּי חצי ה in [Ch1
2:54](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#054) corresponds to our המּנחות חצי,
as one half of a race or district corresponds to the other, for the
connection between the substantive המּנחות and the adjective המּנחתּי
cannot but be acknowledged. Now, although מנוּחה signifies resting-place
([Num 10:33](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#033); [Jdg
20:43](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#043)), and the words "the half of the
resting-place," or "of the resting-places," point in the first instance
to a district, yet not only does the context require that
Hazi-Hammenuhoth should signify a family sprung from Shobal, but it is
demanded also by a comparison of our phrase with hmnchty chtsy in [Ch1
2:54](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#054), which unquestionably denotes a
family. It does not, however, seem necessary to alter the המּנחות into
המּנחתּי; for as in [Ch1 2:54](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#054)
Bethlehem stands for the family in Bethlehem descended from Salma, so
the district Hazi-Hammenuhoth may be used in [Ch1
2:52](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#052) to denote the family residing
there. As to the geographical position of this district, see on [Ch1
2:54](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#054).

[Ch1 2:53](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#053)

Besides the families mentioned in [Ch1
2:52](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#052), the families of Kirjath-jearim,
which in [Ch1 2:53](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#053) are enumerated by
name, came of Shobal also. וּמשׁפּחות ק is simply a continuation of the
families already mentioned, and the remark of Berth., that "the families
of Kirjath-jearim are moreover distinguished from the sons of Shobal,"
is as incorrect as the supplying of ו cop. before הם הצי in [Ch1
2:52](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#052) is unnecessary. The meaning is
simply this: Shobal had sons Reaiah, Hazi-Hammenuhoth, and the families
of Kirjath-jearim, viz., the family of Jether, etc. David's heroes, Ira
and Gareb, [Ch1 11:40](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#040); [Sa2
23:38](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#038), belonged to the family of
Jether (היּתרי). The other three families are not met with elsewhere.
מאלּה, of these, the four families of Kirjath-jearim just mentioned,
came the Zoreathites and the Eshtaulites, the inhabitants of the town of
Zoreah, the home of Samson, now the ruin Sura, and of Eshtaol, which
perhaps may be identified with Um Eshteyeh (see in [Jos
15:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#033)).

[1 Chronicles 2:54](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#054)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">ch1 2:54</span></span>

The descendants of Salma: Bethlehem, i.e., the family of Bethlehem (see
on [Ch1 2:52](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#052)), the Netophathites,
i.e., the inhabitants of the town of Netophah, which, according to our
verse and [Ezr 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#022), and especially
[Neh 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#026), is to be looked for in the
neighbourhood of Bethlehem (cf. [Ch1
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#016)); a family which produced at
various times renowned men (cf. [Sa2
23:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#028).; [Kg2
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#023); [Ezr
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#022)). The following words, י עטחרות
ב, i.e., "crowns of the house of Joab," can only be the name of a place
which is mentioned instead of its inhabitants; for עטרות occurs
elsewhere, sometimes alone, and sometimes in conjunction with a proper
name, as the name of places: cf. [Num
32:34](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#034).; [Jos
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#002), [Jos
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#005),[Jos
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#007); [Jos
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#013). Hazi-Hammanahath is certainly
to be sought in the neighbourhood of Manahath, [Ch1
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#006), whose position has, however, not
yet been ascertained. הצּרעי is only another form of הצּרעתי, and is
derived from the masculine of the word. The Zorites here spoken of
formed a second division of the inhabitants of Zoreah and the
neighbourhood, along with the Zoreathites descended from Shobal, [Ch1
2:53](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#053).

[Ch1 2:55](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#055)

"And the families of the writers (scribes) who inhabited Jabez." The
position of the town Jabez, which is mentioned only here, and which
derived its name from a descendant of Judah, has not yet been
discovered, but is to be sought somewhere in the neighbourhood of
Zoreah. This may be inferred from the fact that of the six שׂלמא בּני,
two are always more closely connected with each other by ו cop.: (1)
Bethlehem and Netophathite, (2) Ataroth-beth-Joab and Hazi-Hammanahath,
(3) the Zoreites and the families of the Sopherim inhabiting Jabez.
These last were divided into three branches, תּרעתים, שׁמעתים, שׂוּכתים,
i.e., those descended from Tira, Shimea, and Suchah. The Vulgate has
taken these words in an appellative sense of the occupations of these
three classes, and translates canentes et resonantes et in tabernaculis
commemorantes. But this interpretation is not made even probable by all
that Bertheau has brought forward in support of it. Even if שׂוּכתים
might perhaps be connected with סכּה, and interpreted "dwellers in
tabernacles," yet no tenable reason can be found for translating תּרעתים
and שׁמעתים by canentes et resonantes. שׁמעתי, from שׁמעה, "that which
is heard," cannot signify those who repeat in words and song that which
has been heard; and תּרעתי no more means canentes than it is connected
(as Bertheau tries to show) with שׁערים htiw , "doorkeepers" (the
Chaldee תּרע being equivalent to the Hebrew שׁער); and the addition,
"These are the Kenites who came of Hemath, the father of the house of
Rechab" (מן בּוא, to issue from any one, to be descended from any one),
gives no proof of this, for the phrase itself is to us so very obscure.
קינים are not inhabitants of the city Kain ([Jos
15:57](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#057)) in the tribal domain of Judah
(Kimchi), but, judging from the succeeding relative sentence, were
descendants of Keni the father-in-law of Moses ([Jdg
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#016)), who had come with Israel to
Canaan, and dwelt there among the Israelites ([Jdg
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#011), [Jdg
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#017); [Jdg
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#024); [Sa1
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#006); [Sa1
27:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#010); [Sa1
30:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#029)); and Hemath, the father of the
house of Rechab, i.e., of the Rechabites ([Jer
35:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#006)), is probably the grandfather of
Jonadab the son of Rechab, with whom Jehu entered into alliance ([Kg2
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#015), [Kg2
10:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#023)). But how can the families of
Sopherim inhabiting Jabez, which are here enumerated, be called
descendants of Salma, who is descended from Hur the son of Caleb, a man
of Judah, if they were Kenites, who issued from or were descendant of
the grandfather of the family of the Rechabites? From lack of
information, this question cannot be answered with certainty. In
general, however, we may explain the incorporation of the Kenites in the
Judaean family of the Calebite Salma, on the supposition that one of
these Kenites of the family of Hobab, the brother-in-law of Moses,
married an heiress of the race of Caleb. On this account the children
and descendants sprung of this marriage would be incorporated in the
family of Caleb, although they were on their father's side Kenites, and
where they followed the manner of life of their fathers, might continue
to be regarded as such, and to bear the name.
