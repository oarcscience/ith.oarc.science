<p>  1  The Job began, and said:
<p>  2  Truly then ye are the people,
<p>And wisdom shall die with you!
<p>  3  I also have a heart as well as you;
<p>I do not stand behind you;
<p>And to whom should not such things be known?
<p>The admission, which is strengthened by &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1502;&#1504;&#1501;, truly then (distinct from &#1488;&#1502;&#1504;&#1501; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, for truly, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#004">Job 36:4</A>, similar to &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;, behold indeed, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#004">Psa 128:4</A>), is intended as irony: ye are not merely single individuals, but the people = race of men (&#1506;&#1501;, as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#007">Isa 40:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#005">Isa 42:5</A>), so that all human understanding is confined to you, and there is none other to be found; and when once you die, it will seem to have died out. The lxx correctly renders: &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; (according to the reading of the Cod. Alex.); he also has a heart like them, he is therefore not empty, &#1504;&#1489;&#1493;&#1489;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#012">Job 11:12</A>. Heart is, like <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#010">Job 34:10</A>, comp. &#1504;&#1500;&#1489;&#1489;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#012">Job 11:12</A>, equivalent to &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;; Ewald's translation, "I also have a head even as you" ("brains" would better accord with the connection), is a western form of expression, and modern and unbiblical (vid., Division "Herz und Haupt," Psychol. iv. 12). He is not second to them; &#1502;&#1503; &#1504;&#1508;&#1500;, like <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#002">Job 13:2</A>, properly to slip from, to be below any one; &#1502;&#1503; is not the comparative (Ewald). Oetinger's translation is not bad: I cannot slink away at your presence. Who has not a knowledge of such things as those which they, by setting themselves up as defenders of God, have presented to him! &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; is equivalent to &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#012">Isa 59:12</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#004">Job 12:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">job 12:4</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>  4  I must be a mockery to my own friend,
<p>I who called on Eloah and He heard me;
<p>A mockery - the just, the godly man.
<p>  5  Contempt belongs to misfortune, according to the ideas of the prosperous;
<p>It awaits those who are ready to slip.
<p>  6  Tents of the destroyer remain in peace,
<p>And those that defy God are prosperous,
<p>Who taketh Eloah into his hand.
<p>The synallage of &#1500;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; for &#1500;&#1512;&#1506;&#1497; is not nearly so difficult as many others: a laughing-stock to his own friend; comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#008">Isa 2:8</A>, they worship the work of their (his) own hands (&#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1493;). "One who called on Eloah (&#1500;&#1488;&#1500;&#1493;&#1492;&#1468;, for which &#1500;&#1488;&#1500;&#1493;&#1492;&#1468; is found in lxx at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#002">Job 36:2</A>) and He heard him" is in apposition to the subject; likewise &#1514;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1510;&#1491;&#1497;&#1511;, which is to be explained according to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#005">Pro 11:5</A>, &#1510;&#1491;&#1497;&#1511; (from &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;, Arab. s&#803;dq, to be hard, firm, stiff, straight), is one who in his conduct rules himself strictly according to the will of God; &#1514;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, one whose thoughts are in all respects and without disguise what they should be-in one word: pure. Most old translators (Targ., Vulg., Luther) give &#1500;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491; the signification, a torch. Thus e.g., Levi v. Gerson explains: "According to the view of the prosperous and carnally secure, he who is ready for falterings of the feet, i.e., likely to fall, is like a lighted torch which burns away and destroys whatever comes in contact with it, and therefore one keeps aloof from him; but it is also more than this: he is an object of contempt in their eyes." Job might not inappropriately say, that in the eyes of the prosperous he is like a despised, cast-away torch (comp. the similar figure, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#019">Isa 14:19</A>, like a branch that is rejected with contempt); and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#005">Job 12:5</A> would be suitably connected with this if &#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497; could be derived from a substantive &#1502;&#1506;&#1491;, vacillatio, but neither the usage of the language nor the scriptio plena (after which Jerome translates tempus statutum, and consequently has in mind the &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, times of festal pilgrimages, which are also called &#1512;&#1512;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; in later times), nor the vowel pointing (instead of which &#1502;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497; would be expected), is favourable to this. &#1512;&#1490;&#1500; &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497; signifies vacillantes pede, those whose prosperity is shaken, and who are in danger of destruction that is near at hand. We therefore, like Abenezra and modern expositors, who are here happily agreed, take &#1500;&#1508;&#1497;&#1491; as composed of &#1500; and &#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;, a word common to the books of Job (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#024">Job 30:24</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#029">Job 31:29</A>) and Proverbs (ch. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#022">Pro 24:22</A>), which is compared by the Jewish lexicographers, according both to form and meaning, to &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#020">Job 21:20</A>) and &#1488;&#1497;&#1491;, and perhaps signifies originally dissolution (comp. &#1508;&#1491;&#1492;), decease (Syr. f'jodo, escape; Arab. faid, dying), fall, then generally calamity, misfortune: contempt (befits) misfortune, according to the thoughts (or thinking), idea of the prosperous. The pointing wavers between &#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; and the more authorized &#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, with which Parchon compares the nouns &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; and &#1502;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;; the &#1514;, like &#1491; in the latter word, has Dag. lene, since the punctuation is in this respect not quite consistent, or follows laws at present unknown (comp. Ges. 21, rem. 2). <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#005">Job 12:5</A> is now suitably connected: ready (with reference to &#1489;&#1493;&#1494;) for those who stumble, i.e., contempt certainly awaits such, it is ready and waiting for them, &#1504;&#1499;&#1493;&#1503;, &#x3b5;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, like <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#002">Exo 34:2</A>.
<p>While the unfortunate, in spite of his innocence, has thus only to expect contempt, the tents, i.e., dwellings and possessions, of the oppressor and the marauder remain in prosperity; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468; for &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, an intensive form used not only in pause (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#008">Psa 36:8</A>; comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#037">Deu 32:37</A>) and with greater distinctives (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#006">Num 34:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#006">Psa 122:6</A>), but also in passages where it receives no such accent (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#009">Psa 36:9</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#002">Psa 57:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#002">Psa 73:2</A>). On &#1488;&#1492;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, instead of &#1488;&#1492;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, vid., Ges. 93, 6, 3. The verbal clause (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#006">Job 12:6</A>) is followed by a substantival clause (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#006">Job 12:6</A>). &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; is an abstract plural from &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, perfectly secure; therefore: the most care-less security is the portion of those who provoke God (lxx &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;); 
<p>(Note: Luther takes &#1489;&#1496;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; as the adverb to &#1502;&#1512;&#1490;&#1497;&#1494;&#1497;: und toben wider Gott thrstiglich (vid., Vilmar, Pastoraltheolog. Bltter, 1861, S. 110-112); according to the Vulg., et audacter provocant Deum.)
<p>and this is continued in an individualizing form: him who causes Eloah to go into his hand. Seb. Schmid explains this passage in the main correctly: qui Deum in manu fert h.e. qui manum aut potentiam suam pro Deo habet et licitum sibi putat quodlibet; comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#011">Hab 1:11</A> : "this his strength becomes God to him," i.e., he deifies his own power, and puts it in the place of God. But &#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488; signifies, in this connection with &#1500;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493; (not &#1489;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;), neither to carry, nor to lead (Gesenius, who compares <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#005">Psa 74:5</A>, where, however, it signifies to cause to go into = to strike into); it must be translated: he who causes Eloah to enter into his hand; from which translation it is clear that not the deification of the hand, but of that which is taken into the hand, is meant. This which is taken into the hand is not, however, an idol (Abenezra), but the sword; therefore: him who thinks after the manner of Lamech, 
<p>(Note: [Comp Pentateuch, at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#025">Gen 4:25</A>, Clark's Foreign Theological Library. - Tr.])
<p>as he takes the iron weapon of attack and defence into his hand, that he needs no other God. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#007">Job 12:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">job 12:7</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>  7  But ask now even the beasts - they shall teach it thee;
<p>And the birds of heaven - they shall declare it to thee:
<p>  8  Or look thoughtfully to the ground - it shall teach it thee;
<p>And the fish of the sea shall tell it thee.
<p>  9  Who would not recognise in all this
<p>That the hand of Jehovah hath wrought this,
<p>10  In whose hand is the soul of every living thing,
<p>And the breath of all mankind?!
<p>The meaning of the whole strophe is perverted if &#1494;&#1488;&#1514; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#009">Job 12:9</A>), is, with Ewald, referred to "the destiny of severe suffering and pain," and if that which precedes is accordingly referred to the testimony of creation to God as its author. Since, as a glance at what follows shows, Job further on praises God as the governor of the universe, it may be expected that the reference is here to God as the creator and preserver of the world, which seems to be the meaning of the words. Job himself expresses the purpose of this hymn of confession, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#002">Job 12:2</A>., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#001">Job 13:1</A>.: he will show the friends that the majesty of God, before which he ought, according to their demands, to humble himself in penitence, is not less known to him than to them; and with &#1493;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;, verum enim vero, he passes over to this subject when he begins his third answer with the following thought: The perception in which you pride yourselves I also possess; true, I am an object of scornful contempt to you, who are as little able to understand the suffering of the godly as the prosperity of the godless, nevertheless what you know I also know: ask now, etc. Bildad had appealed to the sayings of the ancients, which have the long experience of the past in their favour, to support the justice of the divine government; Job here appeals to the absoluteness of the divine rule over creation. In form, this strophe is the counterpart of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#008">Job 8:8-10</A> in the speech of Bildad, and somewhat also of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#007">Job 11:7-9</A> in that of Zophar. The working of God, which infinitely transcends human power and knowledge, is the sermon which is continuously preached by all created things; they all proclaim the omnipotence and wisdom of the Creator.
<p>The plural &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; is followed by the verb that refers to it, in the singular, in favour of which <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#022">Gen 49:22</A> is the favourite example among old expositors (Ges. 146, 3). On the other hand, the verb might follow the collective &#1506;&#1493;&#1507; in the plural, according to Ges. 146, 1. The plural, however, is used only in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#008">Job 12:8</A>, because there the verb precedes instead of following its subject. According to the rule Ges. 128, 2, the jussive form of the fut. follows the imperative. In the midst of this enumeration of created things, &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1495;, as a substantive, seems to signify the plants - and especially as Arab. s&#780;&#305;&#770;h even now, in the neighbourhood of Job's ancient habitation, is the name of a well-known mountain-plant - under whose shade a meagre vegetation is preserved even in the hot season (vid., on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#004">Job 30:4</A>.). But (1) &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1495; as subst. is gen. masc. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#005">Gen 2:5</A>); (2) instead of &#1500;&#1506;&#1512;&#1509;, in order to describe a plant that is found on the ground, or one rooted in the ground, it must be &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; or &#1489;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;;   (3) the mention of plants between the birds and fishes would be strange. It may therefore be taken as the imperative: speak to the earth (lxx, Targ., Vulg., and most others); or, which I prefer, since the Aramaic construction &#1500;&#1493; &#1505;&#1495;, narravit ei, does not occur elsewhere in Hebrew (although perhaps implicite, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#022">Pro 6:22</A>, &#1514;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1495;&#1498; = &#1500;&#1498; &#1514;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1495;, favulabitur, or confabulabitur tibi), as a pregnant expression: think, i.e., look meditatively to the earth (Ewald), since &#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; (&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1495;), like &#1492;&#1490;&#1492;, combines the significations of quiet or articulate meditation on a subject. The exhortation directs attention not to the earth in itself, but to the small living things which move about on the ground, comprehended in the collective name &#1512;&#1502;&#1513;&#1474;, syn. &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1509; (creeping things), in the record of creation. All these creatures, though without reason and speech, still utter a language which is heard by every intelligent man. Renan, after Ewald, translates erroneously: qui ne sait parmi tous ces tres. They do not even possess knowledge, but they offer instruction, and are a means of knowledge; &#1489;&#1468; with &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;, like <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#008">Gen 15:8</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#033">Gen 42:33</A>, and freq. All the creatures named declare that the hand of Jehovah has made "this," whatever we see around us, &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#003">Heb 11:3</A>. In the same manner in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#002">Isa 66:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#022">Jer 14:22</A>, &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; is used of the world around us. In the hand of God, i.e., in His power, because His workmanship, are the souls of all living things, and the spirit (that which came direct from God) of all men; every order of life, high and low, owes its origin and continuance to Him. &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; is the individual, and in this connection, in which &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; and &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; (= &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1492;) are certainly not unintentionally thus separated, the individual man. Creation is the school of knowledge, and man is the learner. And this knowledge forces itself upon one's attention: quis non cognoverit? The perf. has this subjunctive force also elsewhere in interrogative clauses, e.g., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#003">Psa 11:3</A> (vid., on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#007">Gen 21:7</A>). That the name of God, JEHOVAH, for once escapes the poet here, is to be explained from the phrase "the hand of Jehovah hath made this," being a somewhat proverbial expression (comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#020">Isa 41:20</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#002">Isa 66:2</A>).
<p>Job now refers to the sayings of the fathers, the authority of which, as being handed down from past generations, Bildad had maintained in his opposition to Job. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#011">Job 12:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">job 12:11</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>11  Shall not the ear try sayings,
<p>As the palate tasteth food?
<p>12  Among the ancients is wisdom,
<p>And long life is understanding.
<p>13  With Him is wisdom and strength;
<p>Counsel and understanding are His.
<p>The meaning of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#011">Job 12:11</A> is, that the sayings (&#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#010">Job 8:10</A>, comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#027">Job 5:27</A>) of the ancients are not to be accepted without being proved; the waw in &#1493;&#1495;&#1498; is waw adaequationis, as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#007">Job 5:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#012">Job 11:12</A>, therefore equivalent to quemadmodum; it places together for comparison things that are analogous: The ear, which is used here like &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#014">Heb 5:14</A>), has the task of searching out and testing weighty sayings, as the palate by tasting has to find out delicious and suitable food; this is indicated by &#1500;&#1493;, the dat. commodi. So far Job recognises the authority of these traditional sayings. At any rate, he adds (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#012">Job 12:12</A>): wisdom is to be expected from the hoary-headed, and length of life is understanding, i.e., it accompanies length of life. "Length of days" may thus be taken as the subject (Ewald, Olsh.); but &#1489;&#1468; may also, with the old translations and expositors, be carried forward from the preceding clause: &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#837; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b7; (lxx). We prefer, as the most natural: long life is a school of understanding. But - such is the antithesis in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#013">Job 12:13</A> which belongs to this strophe - the highest possessor of wisdom, as of might, is God. Ewald inserts two self-made couplets before <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#012">Job 12:12</A>, which in his opinion are required both by the connection and "the structure of the strophe;" we see as little need for this interpolation here as before, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#014">Job 6:14</A>. &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493; and &#1500;&#1493;, which are placed first for the sake of emphasis, manifestly introduce an antithesis; and it is evident from the antithesis, that the One who is placed in contrast to the many men of experience is God. Wisdom is found among the ancients, although their sayings are not to be always implicitly accepted; but wisdom belongs to God as an attribute of His nature, and indeed absolutely, i.e., on every side, and without measure, as the piling up of synonymous expressions implies: &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1492;, which perceives the reason of the nature, and the reality of the existence, of things; &#1506;&#1510;&#1492;, which is never perplexed as to the best way of attaining its purpose; &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;, which can penetrate to the bottom of what is true and false, sound and corrupt (comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#009">Kg1 3:9</A>); and also &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;, which is able to carry out the plans, purposes, and decisions of this wisdom against all hindrance and opposition.
<p>In the strophe which follows, from his own observation and from traditional knowledge (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#001">Job 13:1</A>), Job describes the working of God, as the unsearchably wise and the irresistibly mighty One, both among men and in nature.

<p>14  Behold, He breaketh down and it cannot be built again,
<p>He shutteth up, and it cannot be opened.
<p>15  Behold, He restraineth the waters and they dry up,
<p>And He letteth them out and they overturn the earth.
<p>16  With Him is might and existence,
<p>The erring and the deceiver are His.
<p>God is almighty, and everything in opposition to Him powerless. If He break down (any structure whatever), it can never be rebuilt; should He close upon any one (i.e., the dungeon, as perhaps a cistern covered with a stone, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#053">Lam 3:53</A>, comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#006">Jer 38:6</A>; &#1506;&#1500; with reference to the depth of the dungeon, instead of the usual &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491;), it (that which is closed from above) cannot be opened again. In like manner, when He desires to punish a land, He disposes the elements according to His will and pleasure, by bringing upon it drought or flood. &#1497;&#1506;&#1510;&#1512;, coercet, according to the correct Masoretic mode of writing &#1497;&#1506;&#1510;&#1512; with dagesh in the Ssade, in order clearly to distinguish in the pronunciation between the forms j'a-ssor and jaa'ssor (&#1497;&#1506;&#1510;&#1512;); 
<p>(Note: Vid., my notice of Br's Psalter-Ausgabe, Luth. Zeitschr. 1863, 3; and comp. Keil on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#013">Lev 4:13</A> (Comm on Pent., Clark's transl.).)
<p>&#1493;&#1497;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468; (for which Abulwalid writes &#1493;&#1497;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;) is a defective form of writing according to Ges. 69, 3, 3; the form &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1508;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468; with the similarly pointed fut. consec., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#012">Sa1 25:12</A>, form a pair (zuwg) noted by the Masora. By &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, which is ascribed to God, is here to be understood that which really exists, the real, the objective, knowledge resting on an objective actual basis, in contrast with what only appears to be; so that consequently the idea of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#016">Job 12:16</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#013">Job 12:13</A> is somewhat veiled; for the primary notion of &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1492; is thickness, solidity, purity, like &#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;.
<p>(Note: The primary notion of &#1495;&#1499;&#1501;, Arab. hkm, is, to be thick, firm, solid, as the prim. notion of Arab. sachfa (to be foolish, silly) is to be thin, loose, not holding together (as a bad texture). The same fundamental notions are represented in the expression of moral qualities (in distinction from intellectual) by &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;, Arab. sdq, and &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;, (Arab. rs', rsg).)
<p>This strophe closes like the preceding, which favours our division. The line with &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493; is followed by one with &#1500;&#1493;, which affirms that, in the supremacy of His rule and the wisdom of His counsels, God makes evil in every form subservient to His designs.

<p>In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#017">Job 12:17</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#019">Job 12:19</A>, &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500; is added to &#1502;&#1493;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498; as a conditional accusative; the old expositors vary in the rendering of this word; at any rate it does not mean: chained (Targ. on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#017">Job 12:17</A>), from &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1500; (&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1512;), which is reduplicated in the word &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1514;, a chain, a word used in later Hebrew than the language of the Old Testament (&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1492; is the Old Testament word); nor is it: taken as booty, made captive (lxx &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;; Targ. on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#019">Job 12:19</A>, &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1494;&#1514;&#1488;, in the quality of spoil) = &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;; but it is a neuter adjective closely allied to the idea of the verb, exutus, not however mente (deprived of sense), but vestibus; not merely barefooted (Hirz., Oehler, with lxx, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#008">Mic 1:8</A>, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;), which is the meaning of &#1497;&#1495;&#1507;, but: stripped of their clothes with violence (vid., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#004">Isa 20:4</A>), stripped in particular of the insignia of their power. He leads them half-naked into captivity, and takes away the judges as fools (&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;, vid., Psychol. S. 292), by destroying not only their power, but the prestige of their position also. We find echoes of this utterance respecting God's paradoxical rule in the world in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#023">Isa 40:23</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#025">Isa 44:25</A>; and Isaiah's oracle on Egypt, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#011">Job 19:11-15</A>, furnishes an illustration in the reality.
<p>It is but too natural to translate <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#018">Job 12:18</A> : the bands of kings He looses (after <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#016">Psa 116:16</A>, &#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1505;&#1512;&#1497; &#1508;&#1514;&#1495;&#1514;, Thou hast loosed my bands); but the relation of the two parts of the verse can then not be this: He unchains and chains kings (Hirz., Ew., Heiligst. Schlottm.), for the fut. consec. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1505;&#1512; requires a contrast that is intimately connected with the context, and not of mere outward form: fetters in which kings have bound others (&#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501;, gen. subjectivus) He looses, and binds them in fetters (Raschi), - an explanation which much commends itself, if &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1512; could only be justified as the construct of &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1512; by the remark that "the o sinks into u" (Ewald, 213, c). &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1512; does not once occur in the signification vinculum; but only the plur. &#1502;&#1493;&#1505;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1502;&#1493;&#1505;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, vincula, accord with the usage of the language, so that even the pointing &#1502;&#1493;&#1505;&#1512; proposed by Hirzel is a venture. &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1512;, however, as constr. of &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1512;, correction, discipline, rule (i.e., as the domination of punishment, from &#1497;&#1505;&#1512;, castigare), is an equally suitable sense, and is probably connected by the poet with &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495; (a word very familiar to him, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#011">Job 30:11</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#005">Job 39:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#006">Job 41:6</A>) on account of its relation both in sound and sense to &#1502;&#1493;&#1505;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; (comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#022">Psa 105:22</A>). The English translation is correct: He looseth the authority of kings. The antithesis is certainly lost, but the thoughts here moreover flow on in synonymous parallelism.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#019">Job 12:19</A>
<p>It is unnecessary to understand &#1499;&#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, after <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#018">Sa2 8:18</A>, of high officers of state, perhaps privy councillors; such priest-princes as Melchizedek of Salem and Jethro of Midian are meant. &#1488;&#1497;&#1496;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, which denotes inexhaustible, perennis, when used of waters, is descriptive of nations as invincible in might, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#015">Jer 5:15</A>, and of persons as firmly-rooted and stedfast. &#1504;&#1488;&#1502;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, such as are tested, who are able to speak and counsel what is right at the fitting season, consequently the ready in speech and counsel. The derivation, proposed by Kimchi, from &#1504;&#1488;&#1501;, in the sense of diserti, would require the pointing &#1504;&#1488;&#1502;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;. &#1496;&#1506;&#1501; is taste, judgment, tact, which knows what is right and appropriate under the different circumstances of life, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#033">Sa1 25:33</A>. &#1497;&#1511;&#1468;&#1495; is used exactly as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#011">Hos 4:11</A>. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#021">Job 12:21</A> is repeated verbatim, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#040">Psa 107:40</A>; the trilogy, Ps 105-107, particularly Ps 107, is full of passages similar to the second part of Isaiah and the book of Job (vid., Psalter, ii. 117). &#1488;&#1508;&#1497;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501; (only here and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#007">Job 41:7</A>) are the strong, from &#1488;&#1508;&#1511;, to hold together, especially to concentrate strength on anything. &#1502;&#1494;&#1497;&#1495; (only here, instead of &#1502;&#1494;&#1495;, not from &#1502;&#1494;&#1495;, which is an imaginary root, but from &#1494;&#1495;&#1495;, according to Frst equivalent to &#1494;&#1511;&#1511;, to lace, bind) is the girdle with which the garments were fastened and girded up for any great exertion, especially for desperate conflict (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#027">Isa 5:27</A>). To make him weak or relaxed, is the same as to deprive of the ability of vigorous, powerful action. Every word is here appropriately used. This tottering relaxed condition is the very opposite of the intensity and energy which belongs to "the strong." All temporal and spiritual power is subject to God: He gives or takes it away according to His supreme will and pleasure. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#022">Job 12:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">job 12:22</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>22  He discovereth deep things out of darkness,
<p>And bringeth out to light the shadow of death;
<p>23  He giveth prosperity to nations and then destroyeth them,
<p>Increase of territory to nations and then carrieth them away;
<p>24  He taketh away the understanding of the chief people of the land,
<p>And maketh them to wander in a trackless wilderness;
<p>25  They grope in darkness without light,
<p>He maketh them to stagger like a drunken man.
<p>The meaning of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#022">Job 12:22</A> in this connection can only be, that there is nothing so finely spun out that God cannot make it visible. All secret plans of the wicked, all secret sins, and the deeds of the evil-doer though veiled in deep darkness, He bringeth before the tribunal of the world. The form of writing given by the Masora is &#1506;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1514; with koph raphatum, consequently plur. from &#1506;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;, like &#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, &#1506;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; from &#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;, &#1506;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;, not from &#1506;&#1502;&#1511;.
<p>(Note: Kimchi in his Wrterbuch adopts the form &#1506;&#1502;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, but gives Abulwalid as an authority for the lengthened form, which, according to the Masora on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#003">Lev 13:3</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#025">Lev 13:25</A>, is the traditional. The two exceptions where the form occurs with a long vowel are <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#027">Pro 23:27</A> and this passage.)
<p>The lxx translates &#1502;&#1513;&#1490;&#1497;&#1488; &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;, as it is also explained in several Midrash-passages, but only by a few Jewish expositors (Jachja, Alschech) by &#1502;&#1496;&#1506;&#1492;. The word, however, is not &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1488;, but &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1488; with &#1513; sinistrum, after which in Midrash Esther it is explained by &#1502;&#1490;&#1491;&#1497;&#1500;; and Hirzel correctly interprets it of upward growth (Jerome after the Targ. unsuitably, multiplicat), and &#1513;&#1473;&#1496;&#1495;, on the other hand, of growth in extent. The latter word is falsely explained by the Targ. in the sense of expandere rete, and Abenezra also falsely explains: He scatters nations, and brings them to their original peace. The verb &#1513;&#1473;&#1496;&#1495; is here connected with &#1500;, as &#1492;&#1508;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#027">Gen 9:27</A>); both signify to make a wider and longer space for any one, used here of the ground where they dwell and rule. The opposite, in an unpropitious sense, is &#1492;&#1504;&#1495;&#1492;, which is used here, as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#011">Kg2 18:11</A>, in a similar sense with &#1492;&#1490;&#1500;&#1492; (abducere, i.e., in servitutem). We have intentionally translated &#1490;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501; nations, &#1506;&#1501; people; for &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;, as we shall show elsewhere, is the mass held together by the ties of a common origin, language, and country; (&#1506;&#1501;) &#1506;&#1501;, the people bound together by unity of government, whose membra praecipua are consequently called &#1492;&#1506;&#1501; &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;. &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; is, in this connection, the country, although elsewhere, as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#004">Isa 24:4</A>, comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#005">Job 42:5</A>, &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1506;&#1501; signifies also the people of the earth or mankind; for the Hebrew language expresses a country as a portion of the earth, and the earth as a whole, by the same name. Job dwells longer on this tragic picture, how God makes the star of the prosperity of these chiefs to set in mad and blind self-destruction, according to the proverb, quem Deus perdere vult prius dementat. This description seems to be echoed in many points in Isaiah, especially in the oracle on Egypt, Job 19 (e.g., &#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#014">Job 19:14</A>). The connection &#1489;&#1512;&#1498; &#1500;&#1488; &#1489;&#1514;&#1492;&#1493; is not genitival; but &#1491;&#1512;&#1498; &#1500;&#1488; is either an adverbial clause appended to the verb, as &#1495;&#1511;&#1512; &#1500;&#1488;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#024">Job 34:24</A>, &#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1488;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#030">Ch1 2:30</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#032">Ch1 2:32</A>, or, which we prefer as being more natural, and on account of the position of the words, a virtual adjective: in a trackless waste, as &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1500;&#1488;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#026">Job 38:26</A>; &#1506;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; &#1500;&#1488;,   <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#004">Sa2 23:4</A> (Olsh.).
<p>Job here takes up the tone of Eliphaz (comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#013">Job 5:13</A>.). Intentionally he is made to excel the friends in a recognition of the absolute majesty of God. He is not less cognizant of it than they.
