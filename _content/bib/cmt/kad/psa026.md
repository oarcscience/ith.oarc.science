### [Psalms Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 26:0</span></span>

The Longing of the One Who Is Persecuted innocently, to Give Thanks to
God in His House

Ps. 25 and [Psa 26:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#001) are bound
together by similarity of thought and expression. In the former as in
this Psalm, we find the writer's testimony to his trust in God (בּטחתּי,
[Psa 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#002); [Psa
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#001)); there as here, the cry coming
forth from a distressed condition for deliverance (פּדה, [Psa
25:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#022); [Psa
26:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#011)), and for some manifestation of
mercy (חנּני [Psa 26:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#011); [Psa
25:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#016)); and in the midst of theses,
other prominent points of contact ([Psa
26:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#011); [Psa
25:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#021); [Psa
26:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#003); [Psa
25:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#005)). These are grounds sufficient
for placing these two Psalms close together. But in [Psa
26:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#001) there is wanting the
self-accusation that goes hand in hand with the self-attestation of
piety, that confession of sin which so closely corresponds to the New
Testament consciousness (vid., supra p. 43), which is thrice repeated in
Ps 25. The harshness of the contrast in which the psalmist stands to his
enemies, whose character is here more minutely described, does not admit
of the introduction of such a lament concerning himself. The description
applies well to the Absolomites. They are hypocrites, who, now that they
have agreed together in their faithless and bloody counsel, have thrown
off their disguise and are won over by bribery to their new master; for
Absolom had stolen the hearts of the men of Israel, [Sa2
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#006). David at that time would not
take the Ark with him in his flight, but said: If I shall find favour in
the eyes of Jahve, He will bring me back, and grant me to see both it
and His habitation, [Sa2 15:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#025). The
love for the house of God, which is expressed herein, is also the very
heart of this Psalm.

[Psalms 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 26:1</span></span>

[Psa 26:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#001)

The poet, as one who is persecuted, prays for the vindication of his
rights and for rescue; and bases this petition upon the relation in
which he stands to God. שׁפטני, as in [Psa
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#009); [Psa
35:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#024), cf. [Psa
43:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#001). תּם (synon. תמים, which,
however, does not take any suffix) is, according to [Gen
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#005)., [Kg1
22:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#034), perfect freedom from all sinful
intent, purity of character, pureness, guilelessness (ἀκακία, ἀπλότης).
Upon the fact, that he has walked in a harmless mind, without cherishing
or provoking enmity, and trusted unwaveringly (לא אמעד, an adverbial
circumstantial clause, cf. [Psa 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#008))
in Jahve, he bases the petition for the proving of his injured right. He
does not self-righteously hold himself to be morally perfect, he appeals
only to the fundamental tendency of his inmost nature, which is turned
towards God and to Him only. [Psa 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#002)
also is not so much a challenge for God to satisfy Himself of his
innocence, as rather a request to prove the state of his mind, and, if
it be not as it appears to his consciousness, to make this clear to him
([Psa 139:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#023).). בּחן is not used in
this passage of proving by trouble, but by a penetrating glance into the
inmost nature ([Psa 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#005); [Psa
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#003)). נסּה, not in the sense of
πειράζειν, but of δοκομάζειν. צרף, to melt down, i.e., by the agency of
fire, the precious metal, and separate the dross ([Psa
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#007); [Psa
66:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#010)). The Chethמb is not to be read
צרוּפה (which would be in contradiction to the request), but צרופה, as
it is out of pause also in [Isa 32:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#011),
cf. [Jdg 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#008), [Jdg
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#012); [Sa1
28:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#008). The reins are the seat of the
emotions, the heart is the very centre of the life of the mind and soul.

[Psa 26:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#003)

[Psa 26:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#003) tells how confidently and
cheerfully he would set himself in the light of God. God's grace or
loving-kindness is the mark on which his eye is fixed, the desire of his
eye, and he walks in God's truth. חסד is the divine love, condescending
to His creatures, and more especially to sinners ([Psa
25:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#007)), in unmerited kindness; אמת is
the truth with which God adheres to and carries out the determination of
His love and the word of His promise. This lovingkindness of God has
been always hitherto the model of his life, this truth of God the
determining line and the boundary of his walk.

[Psalms 26:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 26:4</span></span>

He still further bases his petition upon his comportment towards the men
of this world; how he has always observed a certain line of conduct and
continues still to keep to it. With [Psa
26:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#004) compare [Jer
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#017). מתי שׁוא ([Job
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#011), cf. [Psa
31:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#005), where the parallel word is מרמה)
are "not-real," unreal men, but in a deeper stronger sense than we are
accustomed to use this word. שׁוא (= שׁוא, from שׁוא) is aridity,
hollowness, worthlessness, and therefore badness (Arab. su') of
disposition; the chaotic void of alienation from God; untruth
white-washed over with the lie of dissimulation ([Psa
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#003)), and therefore nothingness: it
is the very opposite of being filled with the fulness of God and with
that which is good, which is the morally real (its synonym is און, e.g.,
[Job 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#015)). נעלמים, the veiled, are
those who know how to keep their worthlessness and their mischievous
designs secret and to mask them by hypocrisy; post-biblical צבוּעים,
dyed (cf. ἀνυπόκριτος, Luther "ungefδrbt," undyed). (את) בּוא עם, to go
in with any one, is a short expression for: to go in and out with, i.e.,
to have intercourse with him, as in [Pro
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#024), cf. [Gen
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#010). מרע (from רעע) is the name for
one who plots that which is evil and puts it into execution. On רשׁע see
[Psa 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001).

[Psalms 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 26:6</span></span>

The poet supports his petition by declaring his motive to be his love
for the sanctuary of God, from which he is now far removed, without any
fault of his own. The coloured future ואסבבה, distinct from ואסבבה
(vid., on [Psa 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#006) and [Psa
73:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#016)), can only mean, in this
passage, et ambiam, and not et ambibam as it does in a different
connection ([Isa 43:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#026), cf. [Jdg
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#009)); it is the emotional continuation
(cf. [Psa 27:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#006); [Sol
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#012); [Isa
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#024); [Isa
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#019), and frequently) of the plain and
uncoloured expression ארחץ. He wishes to wash his hands in innocence (בּ
of the state that is meant to be attested by the action), and compass
([Psa 59:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#007)) the altar of Jahve. That
which is elsewhere a symbolic act ([Deu
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#006), cf. [Mat
27:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#024)), is in this instance only a
rhetorical figure made use of to confess his consciousness of innocence;
and it naturally assumes this form (cf. [Psa
73:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#013)) from the idea of the priest
washing his hands preparatory to the service of the altar ([Exo
32:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#020).) being associated with the idea
of the altar. And, in general, the expression of [Psa
26:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#006). takes a priestly form, without
exceeding that which the ritual admits of, by virtue of the
consciousness of being themselves priests which appertained even to the
Israelitish laity ([Exo 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#016)). For
סבב can be used even of half encompassing as it were like a semi-circle
([Gen 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#011); [Num
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#004)), no matter whether it be in the
immediate vicinity of, or at a prescribed distance from, the central
point. לשׁמע is a syncopated and defectively written Hiph., for להשׁמיע,
like לשׁמד, [Isa 23:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#011). Instead of
לשׁמע קול תּודה, "to cause the voice of thanksgiving to be heard," since
השׁמיע is used absolutely ([Ch1 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#019);
[Ch2 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#013)) and the object is conceived
of as the instrument of the act (Ges. 138, 1, rem. 3), it is "in order
to strike in with the voice of thanksgiving." In the expression "all Thy
wondrous works" is included the latest of these, to which the voice of
thanksgiving especially refers, viz., the bringing of him home from the
exile he had suffered from Absolom. Longing to be back again he longs
most of all for the gorgeous services in the house of his God, which are
performed around the altar of the outer court; for he loves the
habitation of the house of God, the place, where His doxa, - revealed on
earth, and in fact revealed in grace, - has taken up its abode. ma\`own
does not mean refuge, shelter (Hupfeld), - for although it may obtain
this meaning from the context, it has nothing whatever to do with Arab.
‛ân, med. Waw, in the signification to help (whence ma‛ûn, ma‛ûne,
ma‛âne, help, assistance, succour or support), - but place, dwelling,
habitation, like the Arabic ma‛ân, which the Kamus explains by menzil, a
place to settle down in, and explains etymologically by Arab. mḥll
'l-‛ı̂n, i.e., "a spot on which the eye rests as an object of sight;" for
in the Arabic ma‛ân is traced back to Arab. ‛ân, med. Je, as is seen
from the phrase hum minka bi-ma‛ânin, i.e., they are from thee on a
point of sight (= on a spot where thou canst see them from the spot on
which thou standest). The signification place, sojourn, abode (Targ.
מדור) is undoubted; the primary meaning of the root is, however,
questionable.

[Psalms 26:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 26:9</span></span>

It is now, for the first time, that the petition compressed into the one
word שׁפטני ([Psa 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#001)) is divided
out. He prays (as in [Psa 28:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#003)), that
God may not connect him in one common lot with those whose fellowship of
sentiment and conduct he has always shunned. אנשׁי דּמים, as in [Psa
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#007), cf. ἄνθρωποι αἱμάτων, Sir. 31:25.
Elsewhere זמּה signifies purpose, and more particularly in a bad sense;
but in this passage it means infamy, and not unnatural unchastity, to
which בּידיהם is inappropriate, but scum of whatever is vicious in
general: they are full of cunning and roguery, and their right hand,
which ought to uphold the right - David has the lords of his people in
his eye - is filled (מלאה, not מלאה) with accursed ([Deu
27:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#025)) bribery to the condemnation of
the innocent. He, on the contrary, now, as he always has done, walks in
his uprightness, so that now he can with all the more joyful conscience
intreat God to interpose judicially in his behalf.

[Psalms 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 26:12</span></span>

The epilogue. The prayer is changed into rejoicing which is certain of
the answer that shall be given. Hitherto shut in, as it were, in deep
trackless gorges, he even now feels himself to be standing בּמישׁור,

(Note: The first labial of the combination בם, בף, when the preceding
word ends with a vowel and the two words are closely connected, receives
the Dagesh contrary to the general rule; on this orthophonic Dag. lene,
vid., Luth. Zeitschr., 1863, S. 414.)

upon a pleasant plain commanding a wide range of vision (cf. בּמּרחב,
[Psa 31:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#009)), and now blends his
grateful praise of God with the song of the worshipping congregation,
קהל (lxx ἐν ἐκκλησίαις), and its full-voiced choirs.
