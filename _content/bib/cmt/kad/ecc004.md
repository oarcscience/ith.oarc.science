### [Ecclesiastes Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#001)

[Ecclesiastes 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ecc 4:1</span></span>

"And again I saw all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and
behold there the tears of the oppressed, and they have no comforter; and
from the hand of their oppressors goeth forth violence; and they have no
comforter." Incorrectly Hahn: And anew I saw, - the observation is
different from that of [Ecc 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#016),
though cognate. Thus: And again I saw, - the expression follows the
syntactic scheme of [Gen 26:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#018);
regarding the fut. consec. brought into view here and at [Ecc
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#007). The second העשׁ is part. pass.;
the first, as at [Job 35:9](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#009), and also
at [Amo 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#009), is abstract (i.e.,
bringing the many separate instances under one general idea)
pluraletantum (cf. פּדוּיי, redemti, [Isa
35:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#010); and redemtio, pretium
redemtionis, [Num 3:46](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#046)); the plur. נע
אשׁר need not appear strange, since even חיּים is connected with the
plur. of the pred., e.g., [Psa 31:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#011);
[Psa 88:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#004). דּמעת has, as at [Isa
25:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#008) (cf. [Rev
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#004), πᾶν δάκρυον), a collective
sense. The expression כּח ... וּמיּד is singular. According to the most
natural impression, it seems to signify: "and from the hand of their
oppressors no power of deliverance" (carrying forward אין); but the
parallelism of the palindromically constructed verse (as at [Ecc
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#006); [Ecc
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#010); [Ecc
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#016)) excludes this meaning. Thus כּח
is here once-nowhere else-used, like the Greek βία, in the sense of
violence; Luzzatto prefers the reading וּביד, by which the expression
would be in conformity with the linguistic usage; but also מיד is
explained: the force which they have in their hands is, in going forth
from their hands, thought of as abused, and, as taking the form of שׁד
or חזקה. In view of this sorrow which men bring upon their fellow-men,
life for Koheleth lost all its worth and attraction.

[Ecclesiastes 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ecc 4:2</span></span>

"And I praised the dead who were long ago dead, more than the living who
are yet in life; and as happier than both, him who has not yet come into
existence, who hath not seen the evil work which is done under the sun."
ושׁבּח is hardly thought of as part., like יוּקשׁים = מיקּשׁים, [Ecc
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#012); the m of the part. Pih. is not
usually thrown away, only מהר, [Zep
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#014), is perhaps = ממהר, but for the
same reason as בּית־אל, [Kg2 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#003), is =
בּבית - אל. Thus ושׁבּח, like ונתון, [Ecc
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#009), is inf. absol., which is used to
continue, in an adverbially subord. manner, the preceding finite with
the same subject,

(Note: Also [Ch1 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#020), the subject
remains virtually the same: et ita quidem ut exaudirentur.)

[Gen 41:43](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#043); [Lev
25:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#014); [Jdg
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#019), etc.; cf. especially [Exo
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#011) : "Pharaoh saw ... and hardened
(והכבּד) his heart;" just in the same manner as ושׁבּח here connects
itself with ושׁ אני וא. Only the annexed designation of the subject is
peculiar; the syntactic possibility of this connection is established by
[Psa 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#005), [Job
40:2](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#002), and, in the second rank, by [Gen
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#010); [Eze
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#014). Yet אני might well enough have
been omitted had וש אני וא not stood too remote. Regarding עדנה

(Note: Thus punctuated with Segol under Daleth, and ,נ raphatum, in F.
H. J. P. Thus also Kimchi in W.B. under עד.)

and עדן. The circumstantial form of the expression: prae vivis qui vivi
sunt adhuc, is intentional: they who are as yet living must be witnesses
of the manifold and comfortless human miseries.

It is a question whether [Ecc 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#003)
begins a new clause (lxx, Syr., and Venet.) or not. That את, like the
Arab. aiya, sometimes serves to give prominence to the subject, cannot
be denied (vid., Bttcher, 516, and Mhlau's remarks thereto). The Mishnic
expressions היּום אותו, that day, הארץ אותהּ, that land, and the like
(Geiger, 14. 2), presuppose a certain preparation in the older language;
and we might, with Weiss (Stud. ueber d. Spr. der Mishna, p. 112),
interpret אשׁר את in the sense of אותי אשר, is qui. But the accus.
rendering is more natural. Certainly the expression טוב שׁבּח, "to
praise," "to pronounce happy," is not used; but to טוב it is natural to
suppose וקראתי added. Jerome accordingly translates: et feliciorem
utroque judicavi qui necdum natus est. הרע has the double Kametz, as is
generally the case, except at [Psa
54:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#007) and [Mic
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#003).

(Note: Vid., Heidenheim, Meor Enajim, under [Deu
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#007).)

Better than he who is born is the unborn, who does not become conscious
of the wicked actions that are done under the sun. A similar thought,
with many variations in its expression, is found in Greek writers; see
regarding these shrill discordances, which run through all the joy of
the beauty and splendour of Hellenic life, my Apologetick, p. 116.
Buddhism accordingly gives to nirvna the place of the highest good. That
we find Koheleth on the same path (cf. [Ecc
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#003); [Ecc
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#001)), has its reason in this, that so
long as the central point of man's existence lies in the present life,
and this is not viewed as the fore-court of eternity, there is no
enduring consolation to lift us above the miseries of this present
world.

[Ecclesiastes 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ecc 4:4</span></span>

"And I saw all the labour and all the skill of business, that it is an
envious surpassing of the one by the other: also this is vain and windy
effort." The היא refers to this exertion of vigorous effort and skill.
The Graec. Venet., by rendering here and at [Ecc
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#024) כּשׁרון, by καθαρότης, betrays
himself as a Jew. With כּי, quod, that which forms the pred. follows the
object. the min in mere'ehu is as in amatz min, [Psa
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#018), and the like - the same as the
compar.: aemulatio qua unus prae altero eminere studet. All this
expenditure of strength and art has covetousness and envy, with which
one seeks to surpass another, as its poisoned sting.

[Ecclesiastes 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ecc 4:5</span></span>

There ought certainly to be activity according to our calling; indolence
is self-destruction: "The fool foldeth his hands, and eateth his own
flesh." He layeth his hands together (Prov 6:10-24:33), - placeth them
in his bosom, instead of using them in working, - and thereby he eateth
himself up, i.e., bringeth ruin upon himself ([Psa
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#002); [Mic
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#003); [Isa
49:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#026)); for instead of nourishing
himself by the labour of his hands, he feeds on his own flesh, and thus
wasteth away. The emphasis does not lie on the subject (the fool, and
only the fool), but on the pred.

[Ecclesiastes 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ecc 4:6</span></span>

The fifth verse stands in a relation of contrast to this which follows:
"Better is one hand full of quietness, than both fists full of labour
and windy effort." Mendelssohn and others interpret [Ecc
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#005) as the objection of the
industrious, and [Ecc 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#006) as the reply
of the slothful. Zckler agrees with Hitz., and lapses into the
hypothesis of a dialogue otherwise rejected by him. As everywhere, so
also here it preserves the unity of the combination of thoughts. נחת
signifies here, as little as it does anywhere else, the rest of sloth;
but rest, in contrast to such activity in labour as robs a man of
himself, to the hunting after gain and honour which never has enough, to
the rivalry which places its goal always higher and higher, and seeks to
be before others - it is rest connected with well-being ([Ecc
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#005)), gentle quietness ([Ecc
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#017)), resting from self-activity
([Isa 30:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#015)); cf. the post-bibl. רוּח
נחת, satisfaction, contentment, comfort. In a word, nahath has not here
the sense of being idle or lazy. The sequence of the thoughts is this:
The fool in idleness consumes his own life-strength; but, on the other
hand, a little of true rest is better than the labour of windy effort,
urged on by rivalry yielding no rest. כּף is the open hollow hand, and
חפן (Assyr. ḥupunnu) the hand closed like a ball, the first. "Rest" and
"labour and windy effort" are the accusatives of that to which the
designation of measure refers (Gesen. 118. 3); the accus. connection lay
here so much the nearer, as מלא is connected with the accus. of that
with which anything is full. In "and windy effort" lies the reason for
the judgment pronounced. The striving of a man who laboriously seeks
only himself and loses himself in restlessness, is truly a striving
which has wind for its object, and has the property of wind.

[Ecclesiastes 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ecc 4:7</span></span>

"There is one without a second, also son and brother he has not; and
there is no end of his labour; his eyes nevertheless are not satisfied
with riches: For whom do I labour, then, and deny all good to my soul?
Also this is vain, and it is a sore trouble." That ואין, as in [Psa
104:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#025); [Psa
105:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#034), has the meaning of בּאין,
absque, Nolde has already observed in his Partik.-Concordanz: a
solitarius, without one standing by his side, a second standing near
him, i.e., without wife and without friend; also, as the words following
show, without son and brother. Regarding ואח, for which, with the
connect. accus., ואח might be expected (cf. also [Ecc
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#007), וצאן with Mahpach; and, on the
other hand, [Ecc 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#023), וכעס with
Pashta), vid., under [Psa 55:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#010). Gam
may be interpreted in the sense of "also" as well as of "nevertheless"
(Ewald, 354a); the latter is to be preferred, since the endless labour
includes in itself a restless striving after an increase of possession.
The Kerî&lt;, in an awkward way, changes עיניו into עינו; the taking
together the two eyes as one would here be unnatural, since the
avaricious man devours gold, silver, and precious things really with
both his eyes, and yet, however great be his wealth, still more does he
wish to see in his possession; the sing. of the pred. is as at [Sa1
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#015); [Mic
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#011).

With ulmi ani, Koheleth puts himself in the place of such a friendless,
childless man; yet this change of the description into a self-confession
may be occasioned by this, that the author in his old age was really
thus isolated, and stood alone. Regarding חסּר with the accus. of the
person, to whom, and min of the matter, in respect of which there is
want, vid., under [Psa 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#006). That the
author stands in sympathy with the sorrowful condition here exposed, may
also be remarked from the fact that he now proceeds to show the value of
companionship and the miseries of isolation:

[Ecclesiastes 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ecc 4:9</span></span>

"Better are two together than one, seeing they have a good reward in
their labour." By hashshenaim, the author refers to such a pair; haehhad
is one such as is just described. The good reward consists in this, that
each one of the two has the pleasant consciousness of doing good to the
other by his labour, and especially of being helpful to him. In this
latter general sense is grounded the idea of the reward of faithful
fellowship:

[Ecclesiastes 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ecc 4:10</span></span>

"For if they fall, the one can raise up his fellow: but woe to the one
who falleth, and there is not a second there to lift him up." Only the
Targ., which Grtz follows, confounds אילו

(Note: With Munach and Rebia in one word, which, according to the
masora, occurs in only four other places. Vid., Mas. magna under this
passage, and Mishpete hateamin 26a.)

with אילוּ; it is equivalent to אוי לו, [Isa
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#009), or הוי לו, [Eze
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#018). Haehhad is appos. connecting
itself to the pronominal suff., as, e.g., in a far more inappropriate
manner, [Psa 86:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#002); the prep. is not in
appos. usually repeated, [Gen 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#019);
[Gen 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#004) (exceptions: Ps. 18:51; [Psa
74:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#014)). Whether we translate שׁיּפּל
by qui ceciderit ([Ecc 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#003)), or by
quum ceciderit (Jerome), is all one. יקים is potential: it is possible
and probable that it will be done, provided he is a טוב חבר, i.e., a
true friend (Pirke aboth, ii. 13).

[Ecclesiastes 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ecc 4:11</span></span>

"Moreover, if two lie together, then there is heat to them: but how can
it be warm with one who is alone?" The marriage relation is not
excluded, but it remains in the background; the author has two friends
in his eye, who, lying in a cold night under one covering ([Exo
22:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#026); [Isa
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#020)), cherish one another, and
impart mutual warmth. Also in Aboth de-Rabbi Nathan, c. 8, the sleeping
of two together is spoken of as an evidence of friendship. The vav in
vehham is that of the consequent; it is wanting 10a, according to rule,
in haehhad, because it commonly comes into use with the verb, seldom
(e.g., [Gen 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#001)) with the preceding
subj.

[Ecclesiastes 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ecc 4:12</span></span>

"And if one shall violently assail him who is alone, two shall withstand
him; and (finally) a threefold cord is not quickly broken asunder." The
form yithqepho for yithqephehu, [Job
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#024), is like hirdepho, [Hos
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#003) = hirdephehu, [Jdg
9:40](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#040). If we take תקף in the sense of
to overpower, then the meaning is: If one can overpower him who is
alone, then, on the contrary, two can maintain their ground against him
(Herzf.); but the two אם, [Ecc 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#010),
[Ecc 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#011), which are equivalent to
ἐάν, exclude such a pure logical εἰ. And why should תקף, if it can mean
overpowering, not also mean doing violence to by means of a sudden
attack? In the Mishnic and Arab. it signifies to seize, to lay hold of;
in the Aram. אתקף = החזיק, and also at [Job
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#020); [Job
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#024) (vid., Comm.), it may be
understood of a violent assault, as well as of a completed subjugation;
as נשׂא means to lift up and carry; עמד, to tread and to stand. But
whether it be understood inchoat. or not, in any case האחד is not the
assailant, who is much rather the unnamed subj. in יתקפי, but the one
(the solitarius) who, if he is alone, must succumb; the construction of
hithqepho haehhad follows the scheme of [Exo
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#006), "she saw it, the child." To the
assault expressed by תקף, there stands opposed the expression נגד עמד,
which means to withstand any one with success; as עמד לפני, [Kg2
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#004); [Psa
147:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#017); [Dan
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#007), means to maintain one's ground.
Of three who hold together, 12a says nothing; the advance from two to
three is thus made in the manner of a numerical proverb (vid., Proverbs,
vol. I p. 13). If two hold together, that is seen to be good; but if
there be three, this threefold bond is likened to a cord formed of three
threads, which cannot easily be broken. Instead of the definite specific
art. הח הם, we make use of the indefinite. Funiculus triplex difficile
rumpitur is one of the winged expressions used by Koheleth.

[Ecclesiastes 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ecc 4:13</span></span>

"Better is a youth poor and wise, than a king old and foolish, who no
longer understands how to be warned," - i.e., who increases his folly by
this, that he is "wise in his own eyes," [Pro
26:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#012); earlier, as עוד denotes, he
was, in some measure, accessible to the instruction of others in respect
of what was wanting to him; but now in his advanced age he is hardened
in his folly, bids defiance to all warning counsel, and undermines his
throne. The connection of the verb ידע with ל and the inf. (for which
elsewhere only the inf. is used) is a favourite form with the author; it
means to know anything well, [Ecc 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#001);
[Ecc 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#008); [Ecc
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#015); here is meant an understanding
resting on the knowledge of oneself and on the knowledge of men. נזהר is
here and at [Ecc 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#012), [Psa
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#012), a Niph. tolerativum, such as
the synon. נוסר, [Psa 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#010) : to let
oneself be cleared up, made wiser, enlightened, warned. After this
contrast, the idea connected with חכם also defines itself. A young man
(ילד, as at [Dan 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#004), but also [Gen
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#023)) is meant who (vid., above, p.
639, under misken) yet excels the old imbecile and childish king, in
that he perceives the necessity of a fundamental change in the present
state of public matters, and knows how to master the situation to such a
degree that he raises himself to the place of ruler over the neglected
community.

[Ecclesiastes 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ecc 4:14</span></span>

"For out of the prison-house he goeth forth to reign as king, although
he was born as a poor man in his kingdom." With כּי the properties of
poverty and wisdom attributed to the young man are verified, - wisdom in
this, that he knew how to find the way from a prison to a throne. As
harammim, [Ch2 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#005) = haarammim, [Kg2
8:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#028), so hasurim = haasurim (cf.
masoreth = maasoreth, [Eze 20:37](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#037));
beth haasirim (Kerı̂; haasurim), [Jdg
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#021), [Jdg
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#025), and beth haesur, [Jer
38:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#015), designate the prison; cf. Mod
katan, [Ecc 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#001). The modern form of
the language prefers this elision of the א, e.g., אפלּוּ = אף אלּוּ,
אלתּר = אל־אתר, בּתר post = בּאתר contra, etc. The perf. יחא is also
thought of as having reached the throne, and having pre-eminence
assigned to him as such. He has come forth from the prison to become
king, רשׁ ... כּי. Zckler translates: "Whereas also he that was born in
his kingdom was poor," and adds the remark: "גם כי, after the כי of the
preceding clause, does not so much introduce a verification of it, as
much rather an intensification; by which is expressed, that the prisoner
has not merely transitorily fallen into such misery, but that he was
born in poor and lowly circumstances, and that in his own kingdom בּם,
i.e., in the same land which he should afterwards rule as king." But גם
כי is nowhere used by Koheleth in the sense of "ja auch" (= whereas
also); and also where it is thus to be translated, as at [Jer
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#018); [Jer
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#011), it is used in the sense of
"denn auch" (= for also), assigning proof. The fact is, that this group
of particles, according as כי is thought of as demonst. or relat., means
either "denn auch," [Ecc 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#016); [Ecc
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#022); [Ecc
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#016), or "wenn auch" = ἐὰν καί, as
here and at [Ecc 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#012). In the latter
case, it is related to כּי גּם (sometimes also merely גּם, [Psa
95:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#009); [Mal
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#015)), as ἐὰν (εἰ) καί, although,
notwithstanding, is to καὶ ἐάν (εἰ), even although.

(Note: That the accentuation separates the two words גם־ כי is to be
judged from this, that it almost everywhere prefers אם־ כי (vid., under
Comm. to [Psa 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#002)).)

Thus 14b, connecting itself with למלך, is to be translated: "although he
was born (נולד,not נולד) in his kingdom as a poor man."

(Note: נולד רש cannot mean "to become poor." Grtz appeals to the Mishnic
language; but no intelligent linguist will use נולד רשׁ of a man in any
other sense than that he is originally poor.)

We cannot also concur with Zckler in the view that the suff. of :\_b
refers to the young upstart: in the kingdom which should afterwards
become his; for this reason, that the suff. of תח, [Ecc
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#016), refers to the old king, and thus
also that this designation may be mediated, בם must refer to him. מלכות
signifies kingdom, reign, realm; here, the realm, as at [Neh
9:35](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#035), [Dan
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#011); 6:29. Grtz thinks [Ecc
4:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#013) ought to drive expositors to
despair. But hitherto we have found no room for despair in obtaining a
meaning from them. What follows also does not perplex us. The author
describes how all the world hails the entrance of the new youthful king
on his government, and gathers together under his sceptre.

[Ecclesiastes 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ecc 4:15</span></span>

"I saw all the living which walk under the sun on the side of the youth,
the second who shall enter upon the place of the former: no end of all
the people, all those at whose head he stands." The author, by the
expression "I saw," places himself back in the time of the change of
government. If we suppose that he represents this to himself in a lively
manner, then the words are to be translated: of the second who shall be
his successor; but if we suppose that he seeks to express from the
standpoint of the past that which, lying farther back in the past, was
now for the first time future, then the future represents the time to
come in the past, as at [Kg2 3:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#027);
[Psa 78:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#006); [Job
15:28](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#028) (Hitz.): of the second who
should enter on his place (עמד, to step to, to step forth, of the new
king, [Dan 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#023); [Dan
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#002).; cf. קוּם, [Kg1
8:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#020)). The designation of the crowd
which, as the pregnant עם expresses, gathered by the side of the young
successor to the old king, by "all the living, those walking under the
sun (המה, perhaps intentionally the pathetic word for הלכים, Isa 42;
5)," would remain a hyperbole, even although the throne of the Asiatic
world-ruler had been intended; still the expression, so absolute in its
universality, would in that case be more natural (vid., the conjectural
reference to Cyrus and Astygates). השּׁני, Ewald refers to the successor
to the king, the second after the king, and translates: "to the second
man who should reign in his stead;" but the second man in this sense has
certainly never been the child of fortune; one must then think of
Joseph, who, however, remains the second man. Hitzig rightly: "The youth
is the second שׁני, not אחר, in contrast to the king, who, as his
predecessor, is the first." "Yet," he continues, "הילד should be the
appos. and השׁני the principal word," i.e., instead of: with the second
youth, was to be expected: with the second, the youth. It is true, we
may either translate: with the second youth, or: with the second, the
youth - the\_ form of expression has in its something incorrect, for it
has the appearance as if it treated of two youths. But similar are the
expressions, [Mat 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#021), ἓτερος κ.τ.λ.,
"another, and that, too, one of His disciples;" and [Luk
23:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#032), ἤγοντο κ.τ.λ All the world
ranks itself by the side (thus we may also express it) of the second
youthful king, so that he comes to stand at the head of an endless
multitude. The lxx, Jerome, and the Venet. render incorrectly the all
(the multitude) as the subject of the relative clause, which Luther,
after the Syr., corrects by reading לפניו for לפניהם: of the people that
went for him there was no end. Rightly the Targ.: at whose head (=
בּרישׁיהון) he had the direction, לפני, as with יצא ובא, [Sa1
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#016); [Ch2
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#010); [Psa
68:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#008), etc. All the world congregates
about him, follows his leadership; but his history thus splendidly
begun, viewed backwards, is a history of hopes falsified.

"And yet they who come after do not rejoice in him: for that also is
vain, and a grasping after the wind." For all that, and in spite of that
(gam has here this meaning, as at [Ecc
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#007); [Jer
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#015); [Psa
129:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#002); Ewald, 354a), posterity (הא, as
at [Ecc 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#011); cf. [Isa
41:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#004)) has no joy in this king, - the
hopes which his contemporaries placed in the young king, who had seized
the throne and conquered their hearts, afterwards proved to be
delusions; and also this history, at first so beautiful, and afterwards
so hateful, contributed finally to the confirmation of the truth, that
all under the sun is vain. As to the historical reminiscence from the
time of the Ptolemies, in conformity with which Hitzig (in his Comm.)
thinks this figure is constructed; Grtz here, as always, rocks himself
in Herodian dreams. In his Comm., Hitz. guesses first of Jeroboam, along
with Rehoboam the שׁני ילד, who rebelled against King Solomon, who in
his old age had become foolish. In an essay, "Zur Exeg. u. Kritik des B.
Koheleth," in Hilgenfeld's Zeitschr. XIV 566ff., Saul, on the contrary,
appears to him to be the old and foolish king, and David the poor wise
youth who rose to the throne, and took possession of the whole kingdom,
but in his latter days experienced desertion and adversities; for those
who came after (the younger men) had no delight in him, but rebelled
against him. But in relation to Saul, who came from the plough to be
king, David, who was called from being a shepherd, is not נולד רשׁ; and
to Jewish history this Saul, whose nobler self is darkened by
melancholy, but again brightens forth, and who to his death maintained
the dignity of a king of Israel, never at any time appears as וכסיל ...
מלך. Moreover, by both combinations of that which is related with the
הסורים בּית (for which הסּ is written) of the history of the old
Israelitish kings, a meaning contrary to the usage of the language must
be extracted. It is true that סוּר, as the so-called particip. perfecti,
may mean "gone aside (to a distance)," [Isa
49:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#021); [Jer
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#013); and we may, at any rate, by
סורים, think on that poor rabble which at first gathered around David,
[Sa1 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#002), regarded as outcasts from
honourable society. But בית will not accord therewith. That David came
forth from the house (home) of the estranged or separated, is and
remains historically an awkward expression, linguistically obscure, and
not in accordance with the style of Koheleth. In order to avoid this
incongruity, Bttcher regards Antiochus the Great as the original of the
ילד. He was the second son of his father, who died 225. When a hopeful
youth of fifteen years of age, he was recalled to the throne from a
voluntary banishment into Farther Asia, very soon gained against his old
cousin and rival Achaeus, who was supported by Egypt, a large party, and
remained for several years esteemed as a prince and captain; he
disappointed, however, at a later time, the confidence which was reposed
in him. But granting that the voluntary exile of Antiochus might be
designated as האס בית, he was yet not a poor man, born poor, but was the
son of King Seleucus Callincus; and his older relative and rival Achaeus
wished indeed to become king, but never attained unto it. Hence השׁני is
not the youth as second son of his father, but as second on the throne,
in relation to the dethroned king reckoned as the first. Thus, far from
making it probable that the Book of Koheleth originated in the time of
the Diadochs, this combination of Bttcher's also stands on a feeble
foundation, and falls in ruins when assailed.

The section Eccl 1:12-4:16, to which we have prefixed the
superscription, "Koheleth's Experiences and their Results," has now
reached its termination, and here for the first time we meet with a
characteristic peculiarity in the composition of the book: the narrative
sections, in which Koheleth, on the ground of his own experiences and
observations, registers the vanities of earthly life, terminate in
series of proverbs in which the I of the preacher retires behind the
objectivity of the exhortations, rules, and principles obtained from
experience, here recorded. The first of these series of proverbs which
here follows is the briefest, but also the most complete in internal
connection.
