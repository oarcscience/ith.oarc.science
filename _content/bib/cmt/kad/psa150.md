The Final Hallelujah

The call to praise Jahve "with dance and with timbrel" in [Psa
149:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#003) is put forth here anew in [Psa
150:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa150.htm#004), but with the introduction of
all the instruments; and is addressed not merely to Israel, but to every
individual soul.

[Psalms 150:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa150.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 150:1</span></span>

The Synagogue reckons up thirteen divine attributes according to ex.
[Psa 34:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#006). (שׁלשׁ עשׂרה מדּות), to
which, according to an observation of Kimchi, correspond the thirteen
הלּל of this Psalm. It is, however, more probable that in the mind of
the poet the tenfold halaluw encompassed by Hallelujah's is
significative; for ten is the number of rounding off, completeness,
exclusiveness, and of the extreme of exhaustibleness. The local
definitions in [Psa 150:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa150.htm#001) are related
attributively to God, and designate that which is heavenly, belonging to
the other world, as an object of praise. קדשוּ (the possible local
meaning of which is proved by the קדשׁ and קדשׁ קדשׁים of the Tabernacle
and of the Temple) is in this passage the heavenly היכל; and רקיע עזּו
is the firmament spread out by God's omnipotence and testifying of God's
omnipotence ([Psa 68:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#035)), not
according to its front side, which is turned towards the earth, but
according to the reverse or inner side, which is turned towards the
celestial world, and which marks it off from the earthly world. The
third and fourth hălalu give as the object of the praise that which is
at the same time the ground of the praise: the tokens of His גּבוּרה,
i.e., of His all-subduing strength, and the plenitude of His greatness
(גּדלו = גּדלו), i.e., His absolute, infinite greatness. The fifth and
sixth hălalu bring into the concert in praise of God the ram's horn,
שׁופר, the name of which came to be improperly used as the name also of
the metallic חצצרה (vid., on [Psa
81:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#004)), and the two kinds of stringed
instruments (vid., [Psa 33:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#002)), viz.,
the nabla (i.e., the harp and lyre) and the kinnor (the cithern), the
ψαλτήριον and the κιθάρα (κινύρα). The seventh hălalu invites to the
festive dance, of which the chief instrumental accompaniment is the תּף
(Arabic duff, Spanish adufe, derived from the Moorish) or tambourine.
The eighth hălalu brings on the stringed instruments in their widest
compass, מנּים (cf. [Psa 45:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#009)) from
מן, Syriac menı̂n, and the shepherd's pipe, עגב (with the Gimel raphe =
עוּגב); and the ninth and tenth, the two kinds of castanets (צלצלי,
construct form of צלצלים, singular צלצל), viz., the smaller
clear-sounding, and the larger deeper-toned, more noisy kinds (cf.
κύμβαλον ἀλαλάζον, [Co1 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#001)), as
צלצלי שׁמע (pausal form of שׁמע = שׁמע, like סתר in [Deu
27:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#015), and frequently, from סתר = סתר)
and צלצלי תרוּעה are, with Schlultens, Pfeifer, Burk, Kster, and others,
to be distinguished.

[Psalms 150:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa150.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 150:6</span></span>

The call to praise has thus far been addressed to persons not mentioned
by name, but, as the names of instruments thus heaped up show, to Israel
especially. It is now generalized to "the totality of breath," i.e., all
the beings who are endowed by God with the breath of lie (Heb.: נשׁמת
חיּים), i.e., to all mankind.

With this full-toned Finale the Psalter closes. Having risen as it were
by five steps, in this closing Psalm it hovers over the blissful summit
of the end, where, as Gregory of Nyssa says, all creatures, after the
disunion and disorder caused by sin have been removed, are harmoniously
united for one choral dance (εἰς μίαν χοροστασίαν), and the chorus of
mankind concerting with the angel chorus are become one cymbal of divine
praise, and the final song of victory shall salute God, the triumphant
Conqueror (τῷ τροπαιούχῳ), with shouts of joy. There is now no need for
any special closing beracha. This whole closing Psalm is such. Nor is
there any need even of an Amen ([Psa
106:48](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#048), cf. [Ch1
16:36](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#036)). The Hallelujah includes it
within itself and exceeds it.
