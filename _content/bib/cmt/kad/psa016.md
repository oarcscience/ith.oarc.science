[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

Refuge in God, the Highest Good, in the Presence of Distress and of
Death

The preceding Psalm closed with the words לא ימּוט; this word of promise
is repeated in [Psa 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#008) as an
utterance of faith in the mouth of David. We are here confronted by a
pattern of the unchangeable believing confidence of a friend of God; for
the writer of [Psa 16:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#001) is in
danger of death, as is to be inferred from the prayer expressed in [Psa
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#001) and the expectation in [Psa
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#010). But there is no trace of
anything like bitter complaint, gloomy conflict, or hard struggle: the
cry for help is immediately swallowed up by an overpowering and blessed
consciousness and a bright hope. There reigns in the whole Psalm, a
settled calm, an inward joy, and a joyous confidence, which is certain
that everything that it can desire for the present and for the future it
possesses in its God.

The Psalm is inscribed לדוד; and Hitzig also confesses that "David may
be inferred from its language." Whatever can mark a Psalm as Davidic we
find combined in this Psalm: thoughts crowding together in compressed
language, which becomes in [Psa 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#004)
bold even to harshness, but then becomes clear and moves more rapidly;
an antiquated, peculiar, and highly poetic impress (אדני, my Lord, מנת,
נחלת, שׁפר, תּומיך); and a well-devised grouping of the strophes. In
addition to all these, there are manifold points of contact with
indisputably genuine Davidic Psalms (comp. e.g., [Psa
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#005) with [Psa
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#006); [Psa
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#010) with [Psa
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#004); [Psa
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#011) with [Psa
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#015)), and with indisputably ancient
portions of the Pentateuch ([Exo
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#013); [Exo
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#006); [Gen
49:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#006)). Scarcely any other Psalm shows
so clearly as this, what deep roots psalm-poetry has struck into the
Tra, both as it regards the matter and the language. Concerning the
circumstances of its composition, vid., on [Psa
30:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#001).

The superscription מכתּם לדוד, [Psa
16:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#001) has in common with [Psa
56:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#001). After the analogy of the other
superscriptions, it must have a technical meaning. This at once
militates against Hitzig's explanation, that it is a poem hitherto
unknown, an ἀνέκδοτον, according to the Arabic mâktum, hidden, secret,
just as also against the meaning keimee'lion, which says nothing further
to help us. The lxx translates it στηλογραφία (εἰς στηλογραφίαν),
instead of which the Old Latin version has tituli inscriptio (Hesychius
τίτλος· πτυχίον ἐπίγραμμα ἔχον). That this translation accords with the
tradition is shown by that of the Targum גּליפא תריצא sculptura recta
(not erecta as Hupfeld renders it). Both versions give the verb the
meaning כּתם insculpere, which is supported both by a comparison with
כּתב, cogn. חצב, עצב, and by חתם imprimere (sigillum). Moreover, the sin
of Israel is called נכתּם in [Jer 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#022)
(cf. [Psa 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#001)) as being a deeply
impressed spot, not to be wiped out. If we now look more closely into
the Michtam Psalms as a whole, we find they have two prevailing features
in common. Sometimes significant and remarkable words are introduced by
אמרתּי, וימר, דּבּר, [Psa 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#002); 58:12;
[Psa 60:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#008), cf. [Isa
38:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#010) (in Hezekiah's psalm, which
is inscribed מכתּב = מכתּם as it is perhaps to be read); sometimes words
of this character are repeated after the manner of a refrain, as in [Psa
56:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#001) : I will not fear, what can
man do to me! in [Psa 57:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001) : Be
Thou exalted, Elohim, above the heavens, Thy glory above all the earth!
and in Ps 59: For Elohim is my high tower, my merciful God. Hezekiah's
psalm unites this characteristic with the other. Accordingly מכתם, like
ἐπίγραμμα,

(Note: In modern Jewish poetry מכתם is actually the name for the
epigram.)

appears to mean first of all an inscription and then to be equivalent to
an inscription-poem or epigram, a poem containing pithy sayings; since
in the Psalms of this order some expressive sentence, after the style of
an inscription or a motto on a monument, is brought prominently forward,
by being either specially introduced or repeated as a refrain.

The strophe-schema is 5. 5. 6. 7. The last strophe, which has grown to
seven lines, is an expression of joyous hopes in the face of death,
which extend onward even into eternity.

[Psalms 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 16:1</span></span>

The Psalm begins with a prayer that is based upon faith, the special
meaning of which becomes clear from [Psa
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#010) : May God preserve him (which He
is able to do as being אל, the Almighty, able to do all things), who has
no other refuge in which he has hidden and will hide but Him. This short
introit is excepted from the parallelism; so far therefore it is
monostichic, - a sigh expressing everything in few words. And the
emphatic pronunciation שׁמרני shāmereni harmonises with it; for it is to
be read thus, just as in [Psa 86:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#002);
[Psa 119:167](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#167) shāmerah (cf. on [Isa
38:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#014) עשׁקה), according to the express
testimony of the Masora.

(Note: The Masora observes גרשין בספרא ב, i.e., twice in the Psalter
שׁמרה is in the imperative, the o being displaced by Gaja (Metheg) and
changed into aa, vid., Baer, Torath Emeth p. 22f. In spite of this the
grammarians are not agreed as to the pronunciation of the imperative and
infinitive forms when so pointed. Luzzatto, like Lonzano, reads it
shŏmereni.)

The text of the next two verses (so it appears) needs to be improved in
two respects. The reading אמרתּ as addressed to the soul (Targ.), cf.
[Lam 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#024)., is opposed by the absence
of any mention of the thing addressed. It rests upon a misconception of
the defective form of writing, אמרתּ (Ges. 44, rem. 4). Hitzig and Ewald
(190, d) suppose that in such cases a rejection of the final vowel,
which really occurs in the language of the people, after the manner of
the Aramaic (אמרת or אמרת), lies at the bottom of the form. And it does
really seem as though the frequent occurrence of this defective form
(ידעת = ידעתי [Psa 140:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#013); [Job
42:2](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#002), בנית = בניתי [Kg1
8:48](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#048), עשׂית = עשׂיתי [Eze
16:59](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#059), cf. [Kg2
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#020), אמרת now pointed אמרת, with
[Isa 36:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#005)) has its occasion at least
in some such cutting away of the i, peculiar to the language of the
common people; although, if David wrote it so, אמרת is not intended to
be read otherwise than it is in [Psa
31:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#015); [Psa
140:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#007).

(Note: Pinsker's view (Einleit. S. 100-102), who considers פּעלתּ to
have sprung from פּללת as the primary form of the 1 pers. sing., from
which then came פּלתּי and later still פּלתּי, is untenable according to
the history of the language.)

First of all David gives expression to his confession of Jahve, to whom
he submits himself unconditionally, and whom he sets above everything
else without exception. Since the suffix of אדני (properly domini mei =
domine mi, [Gen 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#003), cf. [Psa
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#002)), which has become mostly lost
sight of in the usage of the language, now and then retains its original
meaning, as it does indisputably in [Psa
35:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#023), it is certainly to be rendered
also here: "Thou art my Lord" and not "Thou art the Lord." The emphasis
lies expressly on the "my." It is the unreserved and joyous feeling of
dependence (more that of the little child, than of the servant), which
is expressed in this first confession. For, as the second clause of the
confession says: Jahve, who is his Lord, is also his benefactor, yea
even his highest good. The preposition על frequently introduces that
which extends beyond something else, [Gen
48:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#022) (cf. [Psa
89:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#008); [Psa
95:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#003)), and to this passage may be
added [Gen 31:50](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#050); [Gen
32:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#012); [Exo
35:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#022); [Num
31:8](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#008); [Deu
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#009); [Deu
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#006), the one thing being above, or
co-ordinate with, the other. So also here: "my good, i.e., whatever
makes me truly happy, is not above Thee," i.e., in addition to Thee,
beside Thee; according to the sense it is equivalent to out of Thee or
without Thee (as the Targ., Symm., and Jerome render it), Thou alone,
without exception, art my good. In connection with this rendering of the
על, the בּל (poetic, and contracted from בּלי), which is unknown to the
literature before David's time, presents no difficulty. As in [Pro
23:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#007) it is short for בּל־תּהיה.
Hengstenberg remarks, "Just as Thou art the Lord! is the response of the
soul to the words I am the Lord thy God ([Exo
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#002)), so Thou only art my salvation!
is the response to Thou shalt have no other gods beside Me (על־פּני)."
The psalmist knows no fountain of true happiness but Jahve, in Him he
possesses all, his treasure is in Heaven.

Such is his confession to Jahve. But he also has those on earth to whom
he makes confession. Transposing the w we read:

ולקדושׁים אשׁר בּארץ

המּה אדּירי כל־חפצי־בם׃

While Diestel's alteration: "to the saints, who are in his land, he
makes himself glorious, and all his delight is in them," is altogether
strange to this verse: the above transfer of the Waw

(Note: Approved by Kamphausen and by the critic in the Liter. Blatt of
the Allgem. Kirchen-Zeitung 1864 S. 107.)

suffices to remove its difficulties, and that in a way quite in
accordance with the connection. Now it is clear, that לקדושׁים, as has
been supposed by some, is the dative governed by אמרתּי, the influence
of which is thus carried forward; it is clear what is meant by the
addition אשׁר בארץ, which distinguishes the object of his affection here
below from the One above, who is incomparably the highest; it is clear,
as to what המּה defines, whereas otherwise this purely descriptive
relative clause אשׁר בּארץ המּה (which von Ortenberg transposes into
אשׁר ארצה בהמּה) appears to be useless and surprises one both on account
of its redundancy (since המה is superfluous, cf. e.g., [Sa2
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#009); [Sa2
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#018)) and on account of its
arrangement of the words (an arrangement, which is usual in connection
with a negative construction, [Deu
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#015); [Ch2
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#007), cf. [Gen
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#003); [Eze
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#010)); it is clear, in what sense
אדירי alternates with קדושׁים, since it is not those who are accounted
by the world as אדיריס on account of their worldly power and possessions
([Psa 136:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#018), [Ch2
23:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#020)), but the holy, prized by him as
being also glorious, partakers of higher glory and worthy of higher
honour; and moreover, this corrected arrangement of the verse harmonises
with the Michtam character of the Psalm. The thought thus obtained, is
the thought one expected (love to God and love to His saints), and the
one which one is also obliged to wring from the text as we have it,
either by translating with De Welte, Maurer, Dietrich and others: "the
saints who are in the land, they are the excellent in whom I have all my
delight," - a Waw apodoseos, with which one could only be satisfied if
it were והמּה (cf. [Sa2 15:34](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#034)) - or:
"the saints who are in the land and the glorious-all my delight is in
them." By both these interpretations, ל would be the exponent of the
nom. absol. which is elsewhere detached and placed at the beginning of a
sentence, and this l of reference (Ew. 310, a) is really common to every
style ([Num 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#008); [Isa
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#001); [Ecc
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#004)); whereas the ל understood of the
fellowship in which he stands when thus making confession to Jahve:
associating myself with the saints (Hengst.), with (von Lengerke), among
the saints (Hupf., Thenius), would be a preposition most liable to be
misapprehended, and makes [Psa 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#003) a
cumbersome appendage of [Psa 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#002). But
if l be taken as the Lamed of reference then the elliptical construct
ואדּירי, to which הארץ ought to be supplied, remains a stumbling-block
not to be easily set aside. For such an isolation of the connecting form
from its genitive cannot be shown to be syntactically possible in Hebrew
(vid., on [Kg2 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#017), Thenius, and
Keil); nor are we compelled to suppose in this instance what cannot be
proved elsewhere, since כל־חפצי־בם is, without any harshness,
subordinate to ואדירי as a genitival notion (Ges. 116, 3). And still in
connection with the reading ואדירי, both the formation of the sentence
which, beginning with ל, leads one to expect an apodosis, and the
relation of [Psa 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#003) to [Psa
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#002), according to which the central
point of the declaration must lie just within כל־חפצי־בם, are opposed to
this rendering of the words ואדירי כל־חפצי־כם.

Thus, therefore, we come back to the above easy improvement of the text.
קושׁים are those in whom the will of Jahve concerning Israel, that it
should be a holy nation ([Exo 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#006);
[Deu 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#006)), has been fulfilled, viz.,
the living members of the ecclesia sanctorum in this world (for there is
also one in the other world, [Psa
89:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#006)). Glory, δόξα, is the outward
manifestation of holiness. It is ordained of God for the sanctified (cf.
[Rom 8:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#030)), whose moral nobility is
now for the present veiled under the menial form of the עני; and in the
eyes of David they already possess it. His spiritual vision pierces
through the outward form of the servant. His verdict is like the verdict
of God, who is his all in all. The saints, and they only, are the
excellent to him. His whole delight is centred in them, all his respect
and affection is given to them. The congregation of the saints is his
Chephzibah, [Isa 62:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#004) (cf. [Kg2
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#001)).

[Psalms 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 16:4</span></span>

As he loves the saints so, on the other hand, he abhors the apostates
and their idols. אהר מהרוּ is to be construed as an appositional
relative clause to the preceding: multi sunt cruciatus (cf. [Psa
32:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#010)) eorum, eorum scil. qui alium
permutant. The expression would flow on more smoothly if it were ירבּוּ:
they multiply, or increase their pains, who..., so that אחר מהרו would
be the subject, for instance like אהבו ה (he whom Jahve loves), [Isa
48:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#014). This [Psa
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#004) forms a perfect antithesis to
[Psa 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#003). In David's eyes the saints
are already the glorified, in whom his delight centres; while, as he
knows, a future full of anguish is in store for the idolatrous, and
their worship, yea, their very names are an abomination to him. The
suffixes of נסכּיהם and שׁמותם might be referred to the idols according
to [Exo 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#013); [Hos
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#019), if אהר be taken collectively as
equivalent to אחר ם, as in [Job 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#019).
But it is more natural to assign the same reference to them as to the
suffix of עצּבותם, which does not signify "their idols" (for idols are
עצבּים), but their torments, pains (from עצּבת derived from עצּב), [Psa
147:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#003); [Job
9:28](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#028). The thought is similar to [Ti1
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#010), ἑαυτοὺς περιέπειραν ὀδύναις
ποικίλαις. אהר is a general designation of the broadest kind for
everything that is not God, but which man makes his idol beside God and
in opposition to God (cf. [Isa 42:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#008);
[Isa 48:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#011)). מהרוּ cannot mean
festinant, for in this signification it is only found in Piel מהר, and
that once with a local, but not a personal, accusative of the direction,
[Nah 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#006). It is therefore to be
rendered (and the perf. is also better adapted to this meaning): they
have taken in exchange that which is not God (מהר like המיר, [Psa
106:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#020); [Jer
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#011)). Perhaps (cf. the phrase זנה
אהרי) the secondary meaning of wooing and fondling is connected with it;
for מהר is the proper word for acquiring a wife by paying down the price
asked by her father, [Exo 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#015). With
such persons, who may seem to be אדּירים in the eyes of the world, but
for whom a future full of anguish is in store, David has nothing
whatever to do: he will not pour out drink-offerings as they pour them
out. נסכּיהם has the Dag. lene, as it always has. They are not called
מדּם as actually consisting of blood, or of wine actually mingled with
blood; but consisting as it were of blood, because they are offered with
blood-stained hands and blood-guilty consciences. מן is the min of
derivation; in this instance (as in [Amo
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#005), cf. [Hos
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#008)) of the material, and is used in
other instances also for similar virtually adjectival expressions. [Psa
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#018); [Psa
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#014); [Psa
80:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#014).

In [Psa 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#004) the expression of his
abhorrence attains its climax: even their names, i.e., the names of
their false gods, which they call out, he shuns taking upon his lips,
just as is actually forbidden in the Tra, [Exo
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#013) (cf. Const. Apost. V. 10 εἴδωλον
μνημονεύειν ὀνόματα δαιμονικά).; He takes the side of Jahve. Whatever he
may wish for, he possesses in Him; and whatever he has in Him, is always
secured to him by Him. חלקי does not here mean food (Bttch.), for in
this sense חלק ([Lev 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#010)) and מגה
([Sa1 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#004)) are identical; and parallel
passages like [Psa 142:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#006) show what
חלקי means when applied to Jahve. According to [Psa
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#006), כוסי is also a genitive just
like חלקי; מנת חלק is the share of landed property assigned to any one;
מנת כּוס the share of the cup according to paternal apportionment. The
tribe of Levi received no territory in the distribution of the country,
from which they might have maintained themselves; Jahve was to be their
חלק, [Num 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#020), and the gifts
consecrated to Jahve were to be their food, [Deu
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#009); [Deu
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#001). But nevertheless all Israel is
βασίλειον ἱεράτευμα, [Exo 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#006),
towards which even קדושׁים and אדרים in [Psa
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#003) pointed; so that, therefore, the
very thing represented by the tribe of Levi in outward relation to the
nation, holds good, in all its deep spiritual significance, of every
believer. It is not anything earthly, visible, created, and material,
that is allotted to him as his possession and his sustenance, but Jahve
and Him only; but in Him is perfect contentment. In [Psa
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#005), תּומיך, as it stands, looks at
first sight as though it were the Hiph. of a verb ימך (ומך). But such a
verb is not to be found anywhere else, we must therefore seek some other
explanation of the word. It cannot be a substantive in the signification
of possession (Maurer, Ewald), for such a substantival form does not
exist. It might more readily be explained as a participle = תּומך,
somewhat like יוסיף, [Isa 29:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#004); [Isa
38:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#005); [Ecc
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#018), = יוסף, - a comparison which has
been made by Aben-Ezra (Sefath Jether No. 421) and Kimchi (Michlol 11a),
- a form of the participle to which, in writing at least, סוכיב, [Kg2
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#021), forms a transition; but there is
good reason to doubt the existence of such a form. Had the poet intended
to use the part. of תמך, it is more probable he would have written אתה
תּומכי גורלי, just as the lxx translators might have had it before them,
taking the Chirek compaginis as a suffix: σὺ εἶ ὁ ἀποκαθιστῶν τὴν
κληρονομίαν μου ἐμοί (Bttcher). For the conjecture of Olshausen and
Thenius, תּוסיף in the sense: "thou art continually my portion" halts
both in thought and expression. Hitzig's conjecture תּוּמּיך "thou, thy
Tummm are my lot," is more successful and tempting. But the fact that
the תּמּים are never found (not even in [Deu
33:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#008)) without the אוּרים, is against
it. Nevertheless, we should prefer this conjecture to the other
explanations, if the word would not admit of being explained as Hiph.
from ימך (ומך), which is the most natural explanation. Schultens has
compared the Arabic wamika, to be broad, from which there is a Hiphil
form Arab. awmaka, to make broad, in Syro-Arabic, that is in use even in
the present day among the common people.

(Note: The Arabic Lexicographers are only acquainted with a noun wamka,
breadth (amplitudo), but not with the verb. And even the noun does not
belong to the universal and classical language. But at the present day
Arab. 'l-wamk (pronounced wumk), breadth, and wamik are in common use in
Damascus; and it is only the verb that is shunned in the better
conversational style. - Wetzstein.)

And since we must at any rate come down to the supposition of something
unusual about this תומיך, it is surely not too bold to regard it as a
ἅπαξ γεγραμμ.: Thou makest broad my lot, i.e., ensurest for me a
spacious habitation, a broad place, as the possession that falleth to
me,

(Note: It is scarcely possible for two words to be more nearly identical
than גּורל and κλῆρος. The latter, usually derived from κλάω (a piece
broken off), is derived from κέλεσθαι (a determining of the divine will)
in Dderlein's Homer. Glossar, iii. 124. But perhaps it is one word with
גורל. Moreover κλῆρος signifies 1) the sign by which anything whatever
falls to one among a number of persons in conformity with the decision
of chance or of the divine will, a pebble, potsherd, or the like. So in
Homer, Il. iii. 316, vii. 175, xxiii. 351, Od. x. 206, where casting
lots is described with the expression κλῆρος. 2) The object that falls
to any one by lot, patrimonium, e.g., Od. xiv. 64, Il. xv. 498, οἶκος
καὶ κλῆρος, especially of lands. 3) an inheritance without the notion of
the lot, and even without any thought of inheriting, absolutely: a
settled, landed property. It is the regular expression for the
allotments of land assigned to colonists (κληροῦχοι).)

\- a thought, that is expanded in [Psa
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#006).

[Psalms 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 16:6</span></span>

The measuring lines (הבלים) are cast ([Mic
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#005)) and fall to any one just where
and as far as his property is assigned to him; so that נפל חבל ([Jos
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#005)) is also said of the falling to
any one of his allotted portion of land. נעמים (according to the Masora
defective as also in [Psa 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#011) נעמות)
is a pluralet., the plural that is used to denote a unity in the
circumstances, and a similarity in the relations of time and space, Ges.
֗108, 2, a; and it signifies both pleasant circumstances, [Job
36:11](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#011), and, as here, a pleasant
locality, Lat. amaena (to which נעמות in [Psa
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#011), more strictly corresponds). The
lines have fallen to him in a charming district, viz., in the
pleasurable fellowship of God, this most blessed domain of love has
become his paradisaic possession. With אף he rises from the fact to the
perfect contentment which it secures to him: such a heritage seems to
him to be fair, he finds a source of inward pleasure and satisfaction in
it. נחלת - according to Ew. 173, d, lengthened from the construct form
נהלת (like נגינת [Psa 61:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#001)); according
to Hupfeld, springing from נחלתי (by the same apocope that is so common
in Syriac, perhaps like אמרתּ [Psa
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#001) from אמרתּי) just like זמרת [Exo
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#002) - is rather, since in the former
view there is no law for the change of vowel and such an application of
the form as we find in Ps 60:13 ([Psa
108:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#013)) is opposed to the latter, a
stunted form of נחלתה: the heritage = such a heritage pleases me, lit.,
seems fair to me (שׁפר, cognate root ספר, צפר, cognate in meaning בשׂר,
Arab. bs̆r, to rub, polish, make shining, intr. שׁפר to be shining,
beautiful). עלי of beauty known and felt by him (cf. [Est
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#009) with [Sa1
25:36](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#036) טוב עליו, and the later way of
expressing it Dan. 3:32). But since the giver and the gift are one and
the same, the joy he has in the inheritance becomes of itself a constant
thanksgiving to and blessing of the Giver, that He (אשׁר quippe qui) has
counselled him ([Psa 73:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#024)) to choose
the one thing needful, the good part. Even in the night-seasons his
heart keeps watch, even then his reins admonish him (יסּר, here of moral
incitement, as in [Isa 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#011), to warn).
The reins are conceived of as the seat of the blessed feeling that Jahve
is his possession (vid., Psychol. S. 268; tr. p. 316). He is impelled
from within to offer hearth-felt thanks to his merciful and faithful
God. He has Jahve always before him, Jahve is the point towards which he
constantly directs his undiverted gaze; and it is easy for him to have
Him thus ever present, for He is מימיני (supply הוּא, as in [Psa
22:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#029); [Psa
55:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#020); [Psa
112:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#004)), at my right hand (i.e., where
my right hand begins, close beside me), so that he has no need to draw
upon his power of imagination. The words בּל־אמּוט, without any
conjunction, express the natural effect of this, both in consciousness
and in reality: he will not and cannot totter, he will not yield and be
overthrown.

[Psalms 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 16:9</span></span>

Thus then, as this concluding strophe, as it were like seven rays of
light, affirms, he has the most blessed prospect before him, without any
need to fear death. Because Jahve is thus near at hand to help him, his
heart becomes joyful (שׂמח) and his glory, i.e., his soul (vid., on [Psa
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#006)) rejoices, the joy breaking forth
in rejoicing, as the fut. consec. affirms. There is no passage of
Scripture that so closely resembles this as [Th1
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#023). לב is πνεῦμα (νοῦς), כבוד, ψυχή
(vid., Psychol. S. 98; tr. p. 119), בּשׂר (according to its primary
meaning, attrectabile, that which is frail), σῶμα. The ἀμέμπτως
τηρηθῆναι which the apostle in the above passage desires for his readers
in respect of all three parts of their being, David here expresses as a
confident expectation; for אף implies that he also hopes for his body
that which he hopes for his spirit-life centred in the heart, and for
his soul raised to dignity both by the work of creation and of grace. He
looks death calmly and triumphantly in the face, even his flesh shall
dwell or lie securely, viz., without being seized with trembling at its
approaching corruption. David's hope rests on this conclusion: it is
impossible for the man, who, in appropriating faith and actual
experience, calls God his own, to fall into the hands of death. For [Psa
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#010) shows, that what is here thought
of in connection with שׁכן לבטח, dwelling in safety under the divine
protection ([Deu 33:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#012), [Deu
33:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#028), cf. [Pro
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#024)), is preservation from death.
שׁחת is rendered by the lxx διαφθορά, as though it came from שׁחת
διαφθείρειν, as perhaps it may do in [Job
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#014). But in [Psa
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#016) the lxx has βόθρος, which is the
more correct: prop. a sinking in, from שׁוּח to sink, to be sunk, like
נחת from נוּח, רחת from רוּח. To leave to the unseen world (עזב prop. to
loosen, let go) is equivalent to abandoning one to it, so that he
becomes its prey. [Psa 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#010) - where
to see the grave ([Psa 49:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#010)),
equivalent to, to succumb to the state of the grave, i.e., death ([Psa
89:49](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#049); [Luk
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#026); [Joh
8:51](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#051)) is the opposite of "seeing
life," i.e., experiencing and enjoying it ([Ecc
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#009), [Joh
3:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#036)), the sense of sight being used
as the noblest of the senses to denote the sensus communis, i.e., the
common sense lying at the basis of all feeling and perception, and
figuratively of all active and passive experience (Psychol. S. 234; tr.
p. 276) - shows, that what is said here is not intended of an
abandonment by which, having once come under the power of death, there
is no coming forth again (Bttcher). It is therefore the hope of not
dying, that is expressed by David in [Psa
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#010). for by חסידך David means
himself. According to Norzi, the Spanish MSS have חסידיך with the
Masoretic note יתיר יוד, and the lxx, Targ., and Syriac translate, and
the Talmud and Midrash interpret it, in accordance with this Ker. There
is no ground for the reading חסידיך, and it is also opposed by the
personal form of expression surrounding it.

(Note: Most MSS and the best, which have no distinction of Ker and
Chethb here, read חסידך, as also the Biblia Ven. 1521, the Spanish
Polyglott and other older printed copies. Those MSS which give חסידיך
(without any Ker), on the other hand, scarcely come under
consideration.)

The positive expression of hope in [Psa
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#011) comes as a companion to the
negative just expressed: Thou wilt grant me to experience (הודיע, is
used, as usual, of the presentation of a knowledge, which concerns the
whole man and not his understanding merely) ארח חיּים, the path of life,
i.e., the path to life (cf. [Pro 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#006);
[Pro 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#019) with ib. [Psa
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#017); [Mat
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#014)); but not so that it is conceived
of as at the final goal, but as leading slowly and gradually onwards to
life; חיּים in the most manifold sense, as, e.g., in [Psa
36:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#010); [Deu
30:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#015) : life from God, with God, and
in God, the living God; the opposite of death, as the manifestation of
God's wrath and banishment from Him. That his body shall not die is only
the external and visible phase of that which David hopes for himself; on
its inward, unseen side it is a living, inwrought of God in the whole
man, which in its continuance is a walking in the divine life. The
second part of [Psa 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#011), which
consists of two members, describes this life with which he solaces
himself. According to the accentuation, - which marks חיים with
Olewejored not with Rebia magnum or Pazer, - שׂבע שׂמחות is not a second
object dependent upon תּודיעני, but the subject of a substantival
clause: a satisfying fulness of joy is את־פּניך, with Thy countenance,
i.e., connected with and naturally produced by beholding Thy face (את
preposition of fellowship, as in [Psa
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#007); 140:14); for joy is light, and
God's countenance, or doxa, is the light of lights. And every kind of
pleasurable things, נעמות, He holds in His right hand, extending them to
His saints - a gift which lasts for ever; נצח equivalent to לנצח. נצח,
from the primary notion of conspicuous brightness, is duration extending
beyond all else - an expression for לעולם, which David has probably
coined, for it appears for the first time in the Davidic Psalms.
Pleasures are in Thy right hand continually - God's right hand is never
empty, His fulness is inexhaustible.

The apostolic application of this Psalm ([Act
2:29-32](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#029); [Act
13:35-37](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#035)) is based on the
considerations that David's hope of not coming under the power of death
was not realised in David himself, as is at once clear, to the unlimited
extent in which it is expressed in the Psalm; but that it is fulfilled
in Jesus, who has not been left to Hades and whose flesh did not see
corruption; and that consequently the words of the Psalm are a prophecy
of David concerning Jesus, the Christ, who was promised as the heir to
his throne, and whom, by reason of the promise, he had prophetically
before his mind. If we look into the Psalm, we see that David, in his
mode of expression, bases that hope simply upon his relation to Jahve,
the ever-living One. That it has been granted to him in particular, to
express this hope which is based upon the mystic relation of the חסיד to
Jahve in such language, - a hope which the issue of Jesus' life has
sealed by an historical fulfilment, - is to be explained from the
relation, according to the promise, in which David stands to his seed,
the Christ and Holy One of God, who appeared in the person of Jesus.
David, the anointed of God, looking upon himself as in Jahve, the God
who has given the promise, becomes the prophet of Christ; but this is
only indirectly, for he speaks of himself, and what he says has also
been fulfilled in his own person. But this fulfilment is not limited to
the condition, that he did not succumb to any peril that threatened his
life so long as the kingship would have perished with him, and that,
when he died, the kingship nevertheless remained (Hofmann); nor, that he
was secured against all danger of death until he had accomplished his
life's mission, until he had fulfilled the vocation assigned to him in
the history of the plan of redemption (Kurtz) - the hope which he
cherishes for himself personally has found a fulfilment which far
exceeds this. After his hope has found in Christ its full realisation in
accordance with the history of the plan of redemption, it receives
through Christ its personal realisation for himself also. For what he
says, extends on the one hand far beyond himself, and therefore refers
prophetically to Christ: in decachordo Psalterio - as Jerome boldly
expresses it - ab inferis suscitat resurgentem. But on the other hand
that which is predicted comes back upon himself, to raise him also from
death and Hades to the beholding of God. Verus justitiae sol - says
Sontag in his Tituli Psalmorum, 1687 - e sepulcro resurrexit, στήλη seu
lapis sepulcralis a monumento devolutus, arcus triumphalis erectus,
victoria ab hominibus reportata. En vobis Michtam! En Evangelium! -
