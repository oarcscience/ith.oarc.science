### [Psalms Chapter 95](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#001)

[Psalms 95:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 95:1</span></span>

Jahve is called the Rock of our salvation (as in [Psa
89:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#027), cf. [Psa
94:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#022)) as being its firm and sure
ground. Visiting the house of God, one comes before God's face; קדּם
פּני, praeoccupare faciem, is equivalent to visere (visitare). תּודה is
not confessio peccati, but laudis. The Beth before תודה is the Beth of
accompaniment, as in [Mic 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#006); that
before זמרות (according to [Sa2 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#001) a
name for psalms, whilst מזמר can only be used as a technical expression)
is the Beth of the medium.

[Psalms 95:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 95:3</span></span>

The adorableness of God receives a threefold confirmation: He is exalted
above all gods as King, above all things as Creator, and above His
people as Shepherd and Leader. אלהים (gods) here, as in [Psa
96:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#004)., [Psa
97:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#007), [Psa
97:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#009), and frequently, are the powers
of the natural world and of the world of men, which the Gentiles deify
and call kings (as Moloch Molech, the deified fire), which, however, all
stand under the lordship of Jahve, who is infinitely exalted above
everything that is otherwise called god ([Psa
96:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#004); [Psa
97:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#009)). The supposition that תּועפות
הרים denotes the pit-works (μέταλλα) of the mountains (Bφttcher), is at
once improbable, because to all appearance it is intended to be the
antithesis to מחקרי־ארץ, the shafts of the earth. The derivation from
ועף (יעף), κάμνειν, κοπιᾶν, also does not suit תועפות in [Num
23:22](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#022); [Num
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#008), for "fatigues" and
"indefatigableness" are notions that lie very wide apart. The כּסף
תּועפות of [Job 22:25](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#025) might more
readily be explained according to this "silver of fatigues," i.e.,
silver that the fatiguing labour of mining brings to light, and תועפות
הרים in the passage before us, with Gussetius, Geier, and Hengstenberg:
cacumina montium quia defatigantur qui eo ascendunt, prop. ascendings =
summits of the mountains, after which כסף תועפות, [Job
22:25](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#025), might also signify "silver of
the mountain-heights." But the lxx, which renders δόξα in the passages
in Numbers and τὰ ὕψη τῶν ὀρέων in the passage before us, leads one to a
more correct track. The verb יעף (ועף), transposed from יפע (ופע), goes
back to the root יף, וף, to stand forth, tower above, to be high,
according to which תועפות = תופעות signifies eminentiae, i.e., towerings
= summits, or prominences = high (the highest) perfection (vid., on [Job
22:25](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#025)). In the passage before us it is
a synonym of the Arabic mı̂fan, mı̂fâtun, pars terrae eminens (from Arab.
wfâ = יפע, prop. instrumentally: a means of rising above, viz., by
climbing), and of the names of eminences derived from Arab. yf' (after
which Hitzig renders: the teeth of the mountains). By reason of the fact
that Jahve is the Owner (cf. [Sa1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#008)), because the Creator of all
things, the call to worship, which concerns no one so nearly as it does
Israel, the people, which before other peoples is Jahve's creation,
viz., the creation of His miraculously mighty grace, is repeated. In the
call or invitation, השׁתּחוה signifies to stretch one's self out full
length upon the ground, the proper attitude of adoration; כּרע, to
curtsey, to totter; and בּרך, Arabic baraka, starting from the radical
signification flectere, to kneel down, in genua (πρόχνυ, pronum =
procnum) procumbere, [Ch2 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#013) (cf.
Hlemann, Bibelstudien, i. 135f.). Beside עם מרעיתו, people of His
pasture, צאן ידו is not the flock formed by His creating hand
(Augustine: ipse gratiâ suâ nos oves fecit), but, after [Gen
30:35](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#035), the flock under His protection,
the flock led and defended by His skilful, powerful hand. Bttcher
renders: flock of His charge; but יד in this sense ([Jer
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#003)) signifies only a place, and
"flock of His place" would be poetry and prose in one figure.

[Psalms 95:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 95:7</span></span>

The second decastich begins in the midst of the Masoretic [Psa
95:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#007). Up to this point the church
stirs itself up to a worshipping appearing before its God; now the voice
of God ([Heb 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#007)), earnestly
admonishing, meets it, resounding from out of the sanctuary. Since שׁמע
בּ signifies not merely to hear, but to hear obediently, [Psa
95:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#007) cannot be a conditioning protasis
to what follows. Hengstenberg wishes to supply the apodosis: "then will
He bless you, His people;" but אם in other instances too ([Psa
81:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#009); [Psa
139:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#019); [Pro
24:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#011)), like לוּ, has an optative
signification, which it certainly has gained by a suppression of a
promissory apodosis, but yet without the genius of the language having
any such in mind in every instance. The word היּום placed first gives
prominence to the present, in which this call to obedience goes forth,
as a decisive turning-point. The divine voice warningly calls to mind
the self-hardening of Israel, which came to light at Merמbah, on the day
of Massah. What is referred to, as also in [Psa
81:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#008), is the tempting of God in the
second year of the Exodus on account of the failing of water in the
neighbourhood of Horeb, at the place which is for this reason called
Massah u-Merı̂bah ([Exo 17:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#001)); from
which is to be distinguished the tempting of God in the fortieth year of
the Exodus at Merı̂bah, viz., at the waters of contention near Kadesh
(written fully Mê-Merı̂bah Kadesh, or more briefly Mê-Merı̂bah), [Num
20:2-13](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#002) (cf. on [Psa
78:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#020)). Strictly כמריבה signifies
nothing but instar Meribae, as in [Psa
83:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#010) instar Midianitarum; but
according to the sense, כּ is equivalent to כּעל. [Psa
106:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#032), just as כּיום is equivalent to
כּביום. On אשׁר, quum, cf. [Deu 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#006).
The meaning of גּם־ראוּ פעלי is not they also (גם as in [Psa
52:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#007)) saw His work; for the reference
to the giving of water out of the rock would give a thought that is
devoid of purpose here, and the assertion is too indefinite for it to be
understood of the judgment upon those who tempted God (Hupfeld and
Hitzig). It is therefore rather to be rendered: notwithstanding
(ho'moos, Ew. 354, a) they had (= although they had, cf. גם in [Isa
49:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#015)) seen His work (His wondrous
guiding and governing), and might therefore be sure that He would not
suffer them to be destroyed. The verb קוּט coincides with κοτέω, κότος.
בּדּור .ען, for which the lxx has τῇ γενεᾷ ἐκείνη, is anarthrous in
order that the notion may be conceived of more qualitatively than
relatively: with a (whole) generation. With ואמר Jahve calls to mind the
repeated declarations of His vexation concerning their heart, which was
always inclined towards error which leads to destruction - declarations,
however, which bore no fruit. Just this ineffectiveness of His
indignation had as its result that (אשׁר, not ὅτι but ὥστε, as in [Gen
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#016); [Deu
28:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#027), [Deu
28:51](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#051); [Kg2
9:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#037), and frequently) He sware, etc.
(אם = verily not, Gesen. 155, 2, f, with the emphatic future form in n
which follows). It is the oath in [Num
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#027). that is meant. The older
generation died in the desert, and therefore lost the entering into the
rest of God, by reason of their disobedience. If now, many centuries
after Moses, they are invited in the Davidic Psalter to submissive
adoration of Jahve, with the significant call: "To-day if ye will
hearken to His voice!" and with a reference to the warning example of
the fathers, the obedience of faith, now as formerly, has therefore to
look forward to the gracious reward of entering into God's rest, which
the disobedient at that time lost; and the taking possession of Canaan
was, therefore, not as yet the final מנוּחה ([Deu
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#009)). This is the connection of the
wider train of thought which to the writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews
[Heb 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#001), [Heb
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#001), follows from this text of the
Psalm.
