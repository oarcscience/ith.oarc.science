<p>Adoration of the Omniscient and Omnipresent One
<p>In this Aramaizing Psalm what the preceding Psalm says in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#006">Psa 139:6</A> comes to be carried into effect, viz.: for Jahve is exalted and He seeth the lowly, and the proud He knoweth from afar. This Psalm has manifold points of contact with its predecessor. From a theological point of view it is one of the most instructive of the Psalms, and both as regards its contents and poetic character in every way worthy of David. But it is only inscribed &#1500;&#1491;&#1493;&#1491; because it is composed after the Davidic model, and is a counterpart to such Psalms as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#001">Psa 19:1-14</A> and to other Davidic didactic Psalms. For the addition &#1500;&#1502;&#1504;&#1510;&#1495; neither proves its ancient Davidic origin, nor in a general way its origin in the period prior to the Exile, as Ps 74 for example shows, which was at any rate not composed prior to the time of the Chaldaean catastrophe.
<p>The Psalm falls into three parts: <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#001">Psa 139:1</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#013">Psa 139:13</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#019">Psa 139:19</A>; the strophic arrangement is not clear. The first part celebrates the Omniscient and Omnipresent One. The poet knows that he is surrounded on all sides by God's knowledge and His presence; His Spirit is everywhere and cannot be avoided; and His countenance is turned in every direction and inevitably, in wrath or in love. In the second part the poet continues this celebration with reference to the origin of man; and in the third part he turns in profound vexation of spirit towards the enemies of such a God, and supplicates for himself His proving and guidance. In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#001">Psa 139:1</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#004">Psa 139:4</A> God is called Jahve, in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#017">Psa 139:17</A> El, in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#019">Psa 139:19</A> Eloha, in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#021">Psa 139:21</A> again Jahve, and in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#023">Psa 139:23</A> again El. Strongly as this Psalm is marked by the depth and pristine freshness of its ideas and feeling, the form of its language is still such as is without precedent in the Davidic age. To all appearance it is the Aramaeo-Hebrew idiom of the post-exilic period pressed into the service of poetry. The Psalm apparently belongs to those Psalms which, in connection with a thoroughly classical character of form, bear marks of the influence which the Aramaic language of the Babylonian kingdom exerted over the exiles. This influence affected the popular dialect in the first instance, but the written language also did not escape it, as the Books of Daniel and Ezra show; and even the poetry of the Psalms is not without traces of this retrograde movement of the language of Israel towards the language of the patriarchal ancestral house. In the Cod. Alex. &#x396;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; is added to the &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x394;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4; &#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, and by a second hand &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#834;&#837;, which Origen also met with "in some copies."

<p>The Aramaic forms in this strophe are the &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc; &#1512;&#1506; (ground-form &#1512;&#1506;&#1497;) in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#002">Psa 139:2</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#017">Psa 139:17</A>, endeavour, desire, thinking, like &#1512;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; and &#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; in the post-exilic books, from &#1512;&#1506;&#1492; (&#1512;&#1506;&#1488;), cupere, cogitare; and the &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. &#1512;&#1489;&#1506; in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#003">Psa 139:3</A>, equivalent to &#1512;&#1489;&#1509;, a lying down, if &#1512;&#1489;&#1506;&#1497; be not rather an infinitive like &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1506;&#1497; in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#019">Job 7:19</A>, since &#1488;&#1512;&#1495;&#1497; is undoubtedly not inflected from &#1488;&#1512;&#1495;, but, as being infinitive, like &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497; in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#021">Deu 4:21</A>, from &#1488;&#1512;&#1495;; and the verb &#1488;&#1512;&#1495; also, with the exception of this passage, only occurs in the speeches of Elihu (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#008">Job 34:8</A>), which are almost more strongly Aramaizing than the Book of Job itself. Further, as an Aramaizing feature we have the objective relation marked by Lamed in the expression &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; &#1500;&#1512;&#1506;&#1497;, Thou understandest my thinking, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#016">Psa 116:16</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#003">Psa 129:3</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#011">Psa 135:11</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#019">Psa 136:19</A>. The monostichic opening is after the Davidic style, e.g., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#001">Psa 23:1</A>. Among the prophets, Isaiah in particular is fond of such thematic introductions as we have here in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#001">Psa 139:1</A>. On &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1491;&#1506; instead of &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1491;&#1506;&#1504;&#1497; vid., on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#020">Psa 107:20</A>; the pronominal object stands once beside the first verb, or even beside the second (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#025">Kg2 9:25</A>), instead of twice (Hitzig). The "me" is then expanded: sitting down, rising up, walking and lying, are the sum of human conditions or states. &#1512;&#1506;&#1497; is the totality or sum of the life of the spirit and soul of man, and &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497; the sum of human action. The divine knowledge, as &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1491;&#1506; says, is the result of the scrutiny of man. The poet, however, in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#002">Psa 139:2</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#003">Psa 139:3</A> uses the perfect throughout as a mood of that which is practically existing, because that scrutiny is a scrutiny that is never unexecuted, and the knowledge is consequently an ever-present knowledge. &#1502;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1511; is meant to say that He sees into not merely the thought that is fully fashioned and matured, but even that which is being evolved. &#1494;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; from &#1494;&#1512;&#1492; is combined by Luther (with Azulai and others) with &#1494;&#1512;, a wreath (from &#1494;&#1512;&#1512;, constringere, cingere), inasmuch as he renders: whether I walk or lie down, Thou art round about me (Ich gehe oder lige, so bistu umb mich). &#1494;&#1512;&#1492; ought to have the same meaning here, if with Wetzstein one were to compare the Arabic, and more particularly Beduin, drra&#770;, dherra&#770;, to protect; the notion of affording protection does not accord with this train of thought, which has reference to God's omniscience: what ought therefore to be meant is a hedging round which secures its object to the knowledge, or even a protecting that places it in security against any exchanging, which will not suffer the object to escape it.
<p>(Note: This Verb. tert. Arab. w et y is old, and the derivative dhera&#770;, protection, is an elegant word; with reference to another derivative, dherwe, a wall of rock protecting one from the winds, vid., Job, at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#007">Job 24:7</A>, note. The II form (Piel) signifies to protect in the widest possible sense, e.g., (in Neshwn, ii. 343b), "[Arab.] dra&#770; 'l-s&#780;a&#770;h, he protected the sheep (against being exchanged) by leaving a lock of wool upon their backs when they were shorn, by which they might be recognised among other sheep.")
<p>The Arabic d&#817;ra&#770;, to know, which is far removed in sound, is by no means to be compared; it is related to Arab. dr', to push, urge forward, and denotes knowledge that is gained by testing and experimenting. But we also have no need of that Arab. d&#817;ra&#770;, to protect, since we can remain within the range of the guaranteed Hebrew usage, inasmuch as &#1494;&#1512;&#1492;, to winnow, i.e., to spread out that which has been threshed and expose it to the current of the wind, in Arabic likewise d&#817;rra&#770;, (whence &#1502;&#1494;&#1512;&#1492;, midhra&#770;, a winnowing-fork, like &#1512;&#1495;&#1514;, racht, a winnowing-shovel), gives an appropriate metaphor. Here it is equivalent to: to investigate and search out to the very bottom; lxx, Symmachus, and Theodotion, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, after which the Italic renders investigasti, and Jerome eventilasti. &#1492;&#1505;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503; with the accusative, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#021">Job 22:21</A> with &#1506;&#1501;: to enter into neighbourly, close, familiar relationship, or to stand in such relationship, with any one; cogn. &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1503;, Arab. skn. God is acquainted with all our ways not only superficially, but closely and thoroughly, as that to which He is accustomed.
<p>In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#004">Psa 139:4</A> this omniscience of God is illustratively corroborated with &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#004">Psa 139:4</A> has the value of a relative clause, which, however, takes the form of an independent clause. &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; (pronounced by Jerome in his letter to Sunnia and Fretela, 82, MALA) is an Aramaic word that has been already incorporated in the poetry of the Davidico-Salomonic age. &#1499;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; signifies both all of it and every one. In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#005">Psa 139:5</A> Luther has been misled by the lxx and Vulgate, which take &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; in the signification formare (whence &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;, forma); it signifies, as the definition "behind and before" shows, to surround, encompass. God is acquainted with man, for He holds him surrounded on all sides, and man can do nothing, if God, whose confining hand he has lying upon him (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#023">Job 9:23</A>), does not allow him the requisite freedom of motion. Instead of &#1491;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1498; (XX &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;) the poet purposely says in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#006">Psa 139:6</A> merely &#1491;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514;: a knowledge, so all-penetrating, all-comprehensive as God's knowledge. The Ker reads &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1488;&#1492;, but the Chethb &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; is supported by the Chethb &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;&#1497; in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#018">Jdg 13:18</A>, the Ker of which there is not &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1488;, but &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; (the pausal form of an adjective &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;, the feminine of which would be &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;). With &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497; the transcendence, with &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492; the unattainableness, and with &#1500;&#1492;&#1468; &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500; the incomprehensibleness of the fact of the omniscience of God is expressed, and with this, to the mind of the poet, coincides God's omnipresence; for true, not merely phenomenal, knowledge is not possible without the immanence of the knowing one in the thing known. God, however, is omnipresent, sustaining the life of all things by His Spirit, and revealing Himself either in love or in wrath - what the poet styles His countenance. To flee from this omnipresence (&#1502;&#1503;, away from), as the sinner and he who is conscious of his guilt would gladly do, is impossible. Concerning the first &#1488;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;, which is here accented on the ultima, vid., on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#004">Psa 116:4</A>.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">psa 139:8</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The future form &#1488;&#1505;&#1468;&#1511;, customary in the Aramaic, may be derived just as well from &#1505;&#1500;&#1511; (&#1505;&#1500;&#1511;), by means of the same mode of assimilation as in &#1497;&#1505;&#1468;&#1489; = &#1497;&#1505;&#1489;&#1468;&#1489;, as from &#1504;&#1505;&#1511; (&#1504;&#1505;&#1511;), which latter is certainly only insecurely established by <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#024">Dan 6:24</A>, &#1500;&#1492;&#1504;&#1505;&#1511;&#1492; (cf. &#1500;&#1492;&#1504;&#1494;&#1511;&#1514;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#022">Ezr 4:22</A>; &#1492;&#1504;&#1508;&#1468;&#1511;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#002">Dan 5:2</A>), since the Nun, as in &#1500;&#1492;&#1504;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#003">Dan 4:3</A>, can also be a compensation for the resolved doubling (vid., Bernstein in the Lexicon Chrestom. Kirschianae, and Levy s.v. &#1504;&#1505;&#1511;). &#1488;&#1501; with the simple future is followed by cohortatives (vid., on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#016">Psa 73:16</A>) with the equivalent &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488; among them: et si stratum facerem (mihi) infernum (accusative of the object as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#005">Isa 58:5</A>), etc. In other passages the wings of the sun (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#002">Mal 4:2</A>) and of the wind (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#011">Psa 18:11</A>) are mentioned, here we have the wings of the morning's dawn. Pennae aurorae, Eugubinus observes (1548), est velocissimus aurorae per omnem mundum decursus. It is therefore to be rendered: If I should lift wings (&#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; &#1499;&#1504;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501; as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#016">Eze 10:16</A>, and frequently) such as the dawn of the morning has, i.e., could I fly with the swiftness with which the dawn of the morning spreads itself over the eastern sky, towards the extreme west and alight there. Heaven and Hades, as being that which is superterrestrial and subterrestrial, and the east and west are set over against one another. &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1497;&#1501; is the extreme end of the sea (of the Mediterranean with the "isles of the Gentiles"). In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#010">Psa 139:10</A> follows the apodosis: nowhere is the hand of God, which governs everything, to be escaped, for dextera Dei ubique est. &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; (not &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#015">Eze 13:15</A>), "therefore I spake," also has the value of a hypothetical protasis: quodsi dixerim. &#1488;&#1498; and &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498; belongs together: merae tenebrae (vid: <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#006">Psa 39:6</A>.); but &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; is obscure. The signification secured to it of conterere, contundere, in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#015">Gen 3:15</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#017">Job 9:17</A>, which is followed by the lxx (Vulgate) &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;, is inappropriate to darkness. The signification inhiare, which may be deduced as possible from &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1507;, suits relatively better, yet not thoroughly well (why should it not have been &#1497;&#1489;&#1500;&#1506;&#1504;&#1497;?). The signification obvelare, however, which one expects to find, and after which the Targum, Symmachus, Jerome, Saadia, and others render it, seems only to be guessed at from the connection, since &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507; has not this signification in any other instance, and in favour of it we cannot appeal either to &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1507; - whence &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1507;, which belongs together with &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, and &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; - or to &#1506;&#1496;&#1507;, the root of which is &#1506;&#1514; (&#1506;&#1514;&#1492;), or to &#1510;&#1506;&#1507;, whence &#1510;&#1506;&#1497;&#1507;, which does not signify to cover, veil, but according to Arab. d&#803;&#8219;f, to fold, fold together, to double. We must therefore either assign to &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; the signification operiat me without being able to prove it, or we must put a verb of this signification in its place, viz., &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1504;&#1497; (Ewald) or &#1497;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; (Bttcher), which latter is the more commendable here, where darkness (&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498;, synon. &#1506;&#1497;&#1508;&#1492;, &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;) is the subject: and if I should say, let nothing but darkness cover me, and as night (the predicate placed first, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#013">Amo 4:13</A>) let the light become about me, i.e., let the light become night that shall surround and cover me (&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;, poetic for &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497;, like &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; in 2 Sam. 22) -  the darkness would spread abroad no obscurity (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#028">Psa 105:28</A>) that should extend beyond (&#1502;&#1503;) Thy piercing eye and remove me from Thee. In the word &#1497;&#1488;&#1497;&#1512;, too, the Hiphil signification is not lost: the night would give out light from itself, as if it were the day; for the distinction of day and night has no conditioning influence upon God, who is above and superior to all created things (der Uebercreatrliche), who is light in Himself. The two &#1499; are correlative, as e.g., in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#004">Kg1 22:4</A>. &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1499;&#1492; (with a superfluous Jod) is an old word, but &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492; (cf. Aramaic &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1488;) is a later one.

<p>The fact that man is manifest to God even to the very bottom of his nature, and in every place, is now confirmed from the origin of man. The development of the child in the womb was looked upon by the Israelitish Chokma as one of the greatest mysteries, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#005">Ecc 11:5</A>; and here the poet praises this coming into being as a marvellous work of the omniscient and omnipresent omnipotence of God. &#1511;&#1504;&#1492; here signifies condere; and &#1505;&#1499;&#1498; not: to cover, protect, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#008">Psa 140:8</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#022">Job 40:22</A>, prop. to cover with network, to hedge in, but: to plait, interweave, viz., with bones, sinews, and veins, like &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1498; in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#011">Job 10:11</A>. The reins are made specially prominent in order to mark the, the seat of the tenderest, most secret emotions, as the work of Him who trieth the heart and the reins. The &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769; becomes in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#014">Psa 139:14</A> the &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;: I give thanks unto Thee that I have wonderfully come into being under fearful circumstances, i.e., circumstances exciting a shudder, viz., of astonishment (&#1504;&#1493;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#006">Psa 65:6</A>). &#1504;&#1508;&#1500;&#1492; (= &#1504;&#1508;&#1500;&#1488;) is the passive to &#1492;&#1508;&#1500;&#1492;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#004">Psa 4:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#007">Psa 17:7</A>. Hitzig regards &#1504;&#1508;&#1500;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492; (Thou hast shown Thyself wonderful), after the lxx, Syriac, Vulgate, and Jerome, as the only correct reading; but the thought which is thereby gained comes indeed to be expressed in the following line, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#014">Psa 139:14</A>, which sinks down into tautology in connection with this reading. `otsem (collectively equivalent to &#1506;&#1510;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#005">Ecc 11:5</A>) is the bones, the skeleton, and, starting from that idea, more generally the state of being as a sum-total of elements of being. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, without being necessarily a conjunction (Ew. 333, a), attaches itself to the suffix of &#1506;&#1510;&#1502;&#1497;. &#1512;&#1511;&#1468;&#1501;, "to be worked in different colours, or also embroidered," of the system of veins ramifying the body, and of the variegated colouring of its individual members, more particularly of the inward parts; perhaps, however, more generally with a retrospective conception of the colours of the outline following the undeveloped beginning, and of the forming of the members and of the organism in general.
<p>(Note: In the Talmud the egg of a bird or of a reptile is called &#1502;&#1512;&#1511;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514;, when the outlines of the developed embryo are visible in it; and likewise the mole (mola), when traces of human; organization can be discerned in it.)
<p>The mother's womb is here called not merely &#1505;&#1514;&#1512; (cf. Aeschylus' Eumenides, 665: &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9; &#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;, and the designation of the place where the foetus is formed as "a threefold darkness' in the Koran, Sur. xxxix. 8), the e&#772; of which is retained here in pause (vid., Bttcher, Lehrbuch, 298), but by a bolder appellation &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; &#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, the lowest parts of the earth, i.e., the interior of the earth (vid., on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#010">Psa 63:10</A>) as being the secret laboratory of the earthly origin, with the same retrospective reference to the first formation of the human body out of the dust of the earth, as when Job says,  <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#021">Job 1:21</A> : "naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither" -  &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, viz., &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;, Sir. 40:1. The interior of Hades is also called &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1503; &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500; in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jon002.htm#002">Jon 2:2</A>, Sir. 51:5. According to the view of Scripture the mode of Adam's creation is repeated in the formation of every man, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#006">Job 33:6</A>, cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#004">Job 33:4</A>. The earth was the mother's womb of Adam, and the mother's womb out of which the child of Adam comes forth is the earth out of which it is taken.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#016">Psa 139:16</A>
<p>The embryo folded up in the shape of an egg is here called &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501;, from &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501;, to roll or wrap together (cf. glomus, a ball), in the Talmud said of any kind of unshapen mass (lxx &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, Symmachus &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;) and raw material, e.g., of the wood or metal that is to be formed into a vessel (Chullin 25a, to which Saadia has already referred).
<p>(Note: Epiphanius, Haer, xxx. 31, says the Hebrew &#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3b7; signifies the peeled grains of spelt or wheat before they are mixed up and backed, the still raw (only bruised) flour-grains - a signification that can now no longer be supported by examples.)
<p>As to the rest, compare similar retrospective glances into the embryonic state in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#008">Job 10:8-12</A>, 2 Macc. 7:22f. (Psychology, S. 209ff., tr. pp. 247f.). On the words in libro tuo Bellarmine makes the following correct observation: quia habes apud te exemplaria sive ideas omnium, quomodo pictor vel sculptor scit ex informi materia quid futurum sit, quia videt exemplar. The signification of the future &#1497;&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; is regulated by &#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;, and becomes, as relating to the synchronous past, scribebantur. The days &#1497;&#1510;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;, which were already formed, are the subject. It is usually rendered: "the days which had first to be formed." If &#1497;&#1510;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; could be equivalent to &#1497;&#1497;&#1510;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;, it would be to be preferred; but this rejection of the praeform. fut. is only allowed in the fut. Piel of the verbs Pe Jod, and that after a Waw convertens, e.g., &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; = &#1493;&#1497;&#1497;&#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#004">Nah 1:4</A> (cf. Caspari on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#011">Oba 1:11</A>).
<p>(Note: But outside the Old Testament it also occurs in the Pual, though as a wrong use of the word; vide my Anekdota (1841), S. 372f.)
<p>Accordingly, assuming the original character of the &#1500;&#1488; in a negative signification, it is to be rendered: The days which were (already) formed, and there was not one among them, i.e., when none among them had as yet become a reality. The suffix of &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501; points to the succeeding &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, to which &#1497;&#1510;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; is appended as an attributive clause; &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1488;&#1495;&#1491; &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1501; is subordinated to this &#1497;&#1510;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;: cum non or nondum (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#016">Job 22:16</A>) unus inter eos = unus eorum (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#028">Exo 14:28</A>) esset. But the expression (instead of &#1493;&#1506;&#1493;&#1491; &#1500;&#1488; &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; or &#1496;&#1512;&#1501; &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;) remains doubtful, and it becomes a question whether the Ker &#1493;&#1500;&#1493; (vid., on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa100.htm#003">Psa 100:3</A>), which stands side by side with the Chethb &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; (which the lxx, Aquila, Symmachus, Theodotion, the Targum, Syriac, Jerome, and Saadia follow), is not to be preferred. This &#1493;&#1500;&#1493;, referred to &#1490;&#1500;&#1502;&#1497;, gives the acceptable meaning: and for it (viz., its birth) one among them (these days), without our needing to make any change in the proposed exposition down to &#1497;&#1510;&#1512;&#1493;. We decide in favour of this, because this &#1493;&#1500;&#1493; &#1488;&#1495;&#1491; &#1489;&#1492;&#1501; does not, as &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1488;&#1495;&#1491; &#1489;&#1492;&#1501;, make one feel to miss any &#1492;&#1497;&#1492;, and because the &#1493;&#1500;&#1497; which begins <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#017">Psa 139:17</A> connects itself to it by way of continuation. The accentuation has failed to discern the reference of &#1499;&#1500;&#1501; to the following &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, inasmuch as it places Olewejored against &#1497;&#1499;&#1514;&#1489;&#1493;. Hupfeld follows this accentuation, referring &#1499;&#1500;&#1501; back to &#1490;&#1500;&#1502;&#1497; as a coil of days of one's life; and Hitzig does the same, referring it to the embryos. But the precedence of the relative pronoun occurs in other instances also, 
<p>(Note: The Hebrew poet, says Gesenius (Lehrgebude, S. 739f.), sometimes uses the pronoun before the thing to which it referred has even been spoken of. This phenomenon belongs to the Hebrew style generally, vid., my Anekdota (1841), S. 382.)
<p>and is devoid of all harshness, especially in connection with &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501;, which directly signifies altogether (e.g., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#014">Isa 43:14</A>).
<p>It is the confession of the omniscience that is united with the omnipotence of God, which the poet here gives utterance to with reference to himself, just as Jahve says with reference to Jeremiah, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#005">Jer 1:5</A>. Among the days which were preformed in the idea of God (cf. on &#1497;&#1510;&#1512;&#1493;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#011">Isa 22:11</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#026">Isa 37:26</A>) there was also one, says the poet, for the embryonic beginning of my life. The divine knowledge embraces the beginning, development, and completion of all things (Psychology, S. 37ff., tr. pp. 46ff.). The knowledge of the thoughts of God which are written in the book of creation and revelation is the poet's cherished possession, and to ponder over them is his favourite pursuit: they are precious to him, &#1497;&#1511;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; (after <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#008">Psa 36:8</A>), not: difficult of comprehension (schwerbegreiflich, Maurer, Olshausen), after <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#011">Dan 2:11</A>, which would surely have been expressed by &#1506;&#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#006">Psa 92:6</A>), more readily: very weighty (schwergewichtig, Hitzig), but better according to the prevailing Hebrew usage: highly valued (schwergewerthet), cara.
<p>(Note: It should be noted that the radical idea of the verb, viz., being heavy (German schwer), is retained in all these renderings. - Tr.)
<p>"Their sums" are powerful, prodigious (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006">Psa 40:6</A>), and cannot be brought to a summa summarum. If he desires to count them (fut. hypothet. as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#007">Psa 91:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#024">Job 20:24</A>), they prove themselves to be more than the sand with its grains, that is to say, innumerable. He falls asleep over the pondering upon them, wearied out; and when he wakes up, he is still with God, i.e., still ever absorbed in the contemplation of the Unsearchable One, which even the sleep of fatigue could not entirely interrupt. Ewald explains it somewhat differently: if I am lost in the stream of thoughts and images, and recover myself from this state of reverie, yet I am still ever with Thee, without coming to an end. But it could only perhaps be interpreted thus if it were &#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497; or &#1492;&#1514;&#1506;&#1493;&#1512;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;. Hofmann's interpretation is altogether different: I will count them, the more numerous than the sand, when I awake and am continually with Thee, viz., in the other world, after the awaking from the sleep of death. This is at once impossible, because &#1492;&#1511;&#1497;&#1510;&#1514;&#1497; cannot here, according to its position, be a perf. hypotheticum. Also in connection with this interpretation &#1506;&#1493;&#1491; would be an inappropriate expression for "continually," since the word only has the sense of the continual duration of an action or a state already existing; here of one that has not even been closed and broken off by sleep. He has not done; waking and dreaming and waking up, he is carried away by that endless, and yet also endlessly attractive, pursuit, the most fitting occupation of one who is awake, and the sweetest (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#026">Jer 31:26</A>) of one who is asleep and dreaming. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#019">Psalms 139:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">psa 139:19</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>And this God is by many not only not believed in and loved, but even hated and blasphemed! The poet now turns towards these enemies of God in profound vexation of spirit. The &#1488;&#1501;, which is conditional in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#008">Psa 139:8</A>, here is an optative o si, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#009">Psa 81:9</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#007">Psa 95:7</A>. The expression &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1496;&#1500; &#1488;&#1500;&#1493;&#1492;&#1468; reminds one of the Book of Job, for, with the exception of our Psalm, this is the only book that uses the verb &#1511;&#1496;&#1500;, which is more Aramaic than Hebrew, and the divine name Eloah occurs more frequently in it than anywhere else. The transition from the optative to the imperative &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; is difficult; it would have been less so if the Waw copul. had been left out: cf. the easier expression in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#009">Psa 6:9</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#115">Psa 119:115</A>. But we may not on this account seek to read &#1497;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;, as Olshausen does. Everything here is remarkable; the whole Psalm has a characteristic form in respect to the language. &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497; is the ground-form of the overloaded &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;, and is also like the Book of Job, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#016">Job 21:16</A>, cf. &#1502;&#1504;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#012">Job 4:12</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#024">Psa 68:24</A>. The mode of writing &#1497;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498; (instead of which, however, the Babylonian texts had &#1497;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498;) is the same as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#015">Sa2 19:15</A>, cf. in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#009">Sa2 20:9</A> the same melting away of the Aleph into the preceding vowel in connection with &#1488;&#1495;&#1494;, in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#040">Sa2 22:40</A> in connection with &#1488;&#1494;&#1468;&#1512;, and in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#020">Isa 13:20</A> with &#1488;&#1492;&#1500;. Construed with the accusative of the person, &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; here signifies to declare any one, profiteri, a meaning which, we confess, does not occur elsewhere. But &#1500;&#1502;&#1494;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; (cf. &#1500;&#1502;&#1512;&#1502;&#1492;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#004">Psa 24:4</A>; the Targum: who swear by Thy name for wantonness) and the parallel member of the verse, which as it runs is moulded after <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#007">Exo 20:7</A>, show that it has not to be read &#1497;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498; (Quinta: &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3b5;). The form &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, with Aleph otians, is also remarkable; it ought at least to have been written &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; (cf. &#1504;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#008">Eze 47:8</A>) instead of the customary &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;; yet the same mode of writing is found in the Niphal in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#005">Jer 10:5</A>, &#1497;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, it assumes a ground-form &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001">Psa 32:1</A>) = &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;, and is to be judged of according to &#1488;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#012">Isa 28:12</A> [Ges. 23, 3, rem. 3]. Also one feels the absence of the object to &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; &#1500;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488;. It is meant to be supplied according to the decalogue, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#007">Exo 20:7</A>, which certainly makes the alteration &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1498; (Bttcher, Olsh.) or &#1494;&#1499;&#1512;&#1498; (Hitzig on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#013">Isa 26:13</A>), instead of &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1498;, natural. But the text as we now have it is also intelligible: the object to &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1488; is derived from &#1497;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1498;, and the following &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1498; is an explanation of the subject intended in &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1488; that is introduced subsequently. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#052">Psa 89:52</A> proves the possibility of this structure of a clause. It is correctly rendered by Aquila &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, and Symmachus &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;. &#1506;&#1512;, an enemy, prop. one who is zealous, a zealot (from &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, or rather &#1506;&#1497;&#1512;, = Arab. ga&#770;r, med. Je, &#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;, whence &#1506;&#1497;&#1512;, Arab. gayrat = &#1511;&#1504;&#1488;&#1492;), is a word that is guaranteed by <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#016">Sa1 28:16</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#016">Dan 4:16</A>, and as being an Aramaism is appropriate to this Psalm. The form &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501; for &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501; has cast away the preformative Mem (cf. &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;, &#1502;&#1511;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492; in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#011">Deu 23:11</A> for &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;); the suffix is to be understood according to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#007">Psa 17:7</A>. Pasek stands between &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; and &#1488;&#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1492; in order that the two words may not be read together (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#013">Job 27:13</A>, and above <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#003">Psa 10:3</A>). &#1492;&#1514;&#1511;&#1493;&#1496;&#1496; as in the recent <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#158">Psa 119:158</A>. The emphasis in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#022">Psa 139:22</A> lies on &#1500;&#1497;; the poet regards the adversaries of God as enemies of his own. &#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1497;&#1514; takes the place of the adjective: extremo (odio) odi eos. Such is the relation of the poet to the enemies of God, but without indulging any self-glorying.

<p>He sees in them the danger which threatens himself, and prays God not to give him over to the judgment of self-delusion, but to lay bare the true state of his soul. The fact "Thou hast searched me," which the beginning of the Psalm confesses, is here turned into a petitioning "search me." Instead of &#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#017">Psa 139:17</A>, the poet here says &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1506;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, which signifies branches (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#005">Eze 31:5</A>) and branchings of the act of thinking (thoughts and cares, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#019">Psa 94:19</A>). The Resh is epenthetic, for the first form is &#1513;&#1474;&#1506;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#013">Job 4:13</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#002">Job 20:2</A>. The poet thus sets the very ground and life of his heart, with all its outward manifestations, in the light of the divine omniscience. And in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#024">Psa 139:24</A> he prays that God would see whether any &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498;&#1470;&#1506;&#1510;&#1489; cleaves to him (&#1489;&#1468;&#1497; as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#024">Sa1 25:24</A>), by which is not meant "a way of idols" (Rosenm&#1516;ller, Gesenius, and Maurer), after <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#005">Isa 48:5</A>, since an inclination towards, or even apostasy to, heathenism cannot be an unknown sin; nor to a man like the writer of this Psalm is heathenism any power of temptation. &#1491;&#1493;&#1498; &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1506; (Gr&#1492;tz) might more readily be admissible, but &#1491;&#1493;&#1498; &#1506;&#1510;&#1489; is a more comprehensive notion, and one more in accordance with this closing petition. The poet gives this name to the way that leads to the pain, torture, viz., of the inward and outward punishments of sin; and, on the other hand, the way along which he wishes to be guided he calls &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;, the way of endless continuance (lxx, Vulgate, Luther), not the way of the former times, after <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#016">Jer 6:16</A> (Maurer, Olshausen), which thus by itself is ambiguous (as becomes evident from <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#015">Job 22:15</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#015">Jer 18:15</A>), and also does not furnish any direct antithesis. The "everlasting way" is the way of God (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#011">Psa 27:11</A>), the way of the righteous, which stands fast for ever and shall not "perish" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#006">Psa 1:6</A>).
