Thanksgiving Song of One Who Has Escaped from Death

We have here another anonymous Psalm closing with Hallelujah. It is not
a supplicatory song with a hopeful prospect before it like Ps 115, but a
thanksgiving song with a fresh recollection of some deadly peril that
has just been got the better of; and is not, like Ps 115, from the mouth
of the church, but from the lips of an individual who distinguishes
himself from the church. It is an individual that has been delivered who
here praises the loving-kindness he has experienced in the language of
the tenderest affection. The lxx has divided this deeply fervent song
into two parts, [Psa 116:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#001), [Psa
116:10-19](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#010), and made two
Hallelujah-Psalms out of it; whereas it unites [Psa
114:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#001) and Ps 115 into one. The four
sections or strophes, the beginnings of which correspond to one another
([Psa 116:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#001) and [Psa
116:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#010), [Psa
116:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#005) and [Psa
116:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#015)), are distinctly separate. The
words אקרא וּבשׁם ה are repeated three times. In the first instance they
are retrospective, but then swell into an always more full-toned vow of
thanksgiving. The late period of its composition makes itself known not
only in the strong Aramaic colouring of the form of the language, which
adopts all kinds of embellishments, but also in many passages borrowed
from the pre-exilic Psalms. The very opening, and still more so the
progress, of the first strophe reminds one of Ps 18, and becomes an
important hint for the exposition of the Psalm.

[Psalms 116:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 116:1</span></span>

Not only is כּי אהבתּי "I love (like, am well pleased) that," like ἀγαπῶ
ὅτι, Thucydides vi. 36, contrary to the usage of the language, but the
thought, "I love that Jahve answereth me," is also tame and flat, and
inappropriate to the continuation in [Psa
116:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#002). Since [Psa
116:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#003) have come from [Psa
18:5-17](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#005), אהבתּי is to be understood
according to ארחמך in [Psa 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#002), so
that it has the following יהוה as its object, not it is true
grammatically, but logically. The poet is fond of this pregnant use of
the verb without an expressed object, cf. אקרא in [Psa
116:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#002), and האמנתּי in [Psa
116:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#010). The Pasek after ישׁמע is
intended to guard against the blending of the final a‛ with the initial
'a of אדני (cf. [Psa 56:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#001) :18; [Psa
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#002), in Baer). In [Psa
116:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#001) the accentuation prevents the
rendering vocem orationis meae (Vulgate, lxx) by means of Mugrash. The ı̂
of קולי will therefore no more be the archaic connecting vowel (Ew. 211,
b) than in [Lev 26:42](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#042); the poet has
varied the genitival construction of [Psa
28:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#006) to the permutative. The second
כי, following close upon the first, makes the continuation of the
confirmation retrospective. "In my days" is, as in [Isa
39:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#008), Bar. 4:20, cf. בחיּי in [Psa
63:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#005), and frequently, equivalent to
"so long as I live." We even here hear the tone of Ps 18 ([Psa
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#002)), which is continued in [Psa
18:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#003) as a freely borrowed passage.
Instead of the "bands" (of Hades) there, the expression here is מצרי,
angustiae, plural of meetsar, after the form מסב in [Psa
118:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#005); [Lam
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#003) (Bttcher, De inferis, 423); the
straitnesses of Hades are deadly perils which can scarcely be escaped.
The futures אמצא and אקרא, by virtue of the connection, refer to the
contemporaneous past. אנּה (viz., בלישׁן בקשׁה, i.e., in a suppliant
sense) is written with He instead of Aleph here and in five other
instances, as the Masora observes. It has its fixed Metheg in the first
syllable, in accordance with which it is to be pronounced ānna (like
בּתּים, bāttim), and has an accented ultima not merely on account of the
following יהוה = אדני (vid., on [Psa
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#008)), but in every instance; for even
where (the Metheg having been changed into a conjunctive) it is supplied
with two different accents, as in [Gen
50:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#017); [Exo
32:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#031), the second indicates the
tone-syllable.

(Note: Kimchi, mistaking the vocation of the Metheg, regards אנּה (אנּא)
as Milel. But the Palestinian and the Babylonian systems of pointing
coincide in this, that the beseeching אנא (אנה) is Milra, and the
interrogatory אנה Milel (with only two exceptions in our text, which is
fixed according to the Palestinian Masora, viz., [Psa
139:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#007); [Deu
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#028), where the following word begins
with Aleph), and these modes of accenting accord with the origin of the
two particles. Pinsker (Einleitung, S. xiii.) insinuates against the
Palestinian system, that in the cases where אנא has two accents the
pointing was not certain of the correct accentuation, only from a
deficient knowledge of the bearings of the case.)

Instead now of repeating "and Jahve answered me," the poet indulges in a
laudatory confession of general truths which have been brought vividly
to his mind by the answering of his prayer that he has experienced.

[Psalms 116:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 116:5</span></span>

With "gracious" and "compassionate" is here associated, as in [Psa
112:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#004), the term "righteous," which
comprehends within itself everything that Jahve asserts concerning
Himself in [Exo 34:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#006). from the words
"and abundant in goodness and truth" onwards. His love is turned
especially toward the simple (lxx τὰ νήπια, cf. [Mat
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#025)), who stand in need of His
protection and give themselves over to it. פּתאים, as in [Pro
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#006), is a mode of writing blended out
of פּתאים and פּתיים. The poet also has experienced this love in a time
of impotent need. דּלּותי is accented on the ultima here, and not as in
[Psa 142:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#007) on the penult. The
accentuation is regulated by some phonetic or rhythmical law that has
not yet been made clear (vid., on [Job
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#017)).

(Note: The national grammarians, so far as we are acquainted with them,
furnish no explanation. De Balmis believes that these Milra forms
דּלּותי, בּלּותי, and the like, must be regarded as infinitives, but at
the same time confirms the difference of views existing on this point.)

יהושׁיע is a resolved Hiphil form, the use of which became common in the
later period of the language, but is not alien to the earlier period,
especially in poetry (Ps 45:18, cf. [Psa
81:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#006); [Sa1
17:47](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#047); [Isa
52:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#005)). In [Psa
116:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#007) we hear the form of soliloquy
which has become familiar to us from [Psa
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001); Ps 103. שׁוּבי is Milra here, as
also in two other instances. The plural מנוּחים signifies full, complete
rest, as it is found only in God; and the suffix in the address to the
soul is ajchi for ajich, as in [Psa
103:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#003). The perfect גּמל states that
which is a matter of actual experience, and is corroborated in [Psa
116:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#008) in retrospective perfects. In
[Psa 116:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#008) we hear Ps 56:14 again
amplified; and if we add [Psa 27:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#013),
then we see as it were to the bottom of the origin of the poet's
thoughts. מן־דּמעה belongs still more decidedly than יהושׁיע to the
resolved forms which multiply in the later period of the language. In
[Psa 116:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#009) the poet declares the
result of the divine deliverance. The Hithpa. אתהלּך denotes a free and
contented going to and fro; and instead of "the land of the living,"
[Psa 27:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#013), the expression here is
"the lands (ארצות), i.e., the broad land, of the living." There he walks
forth, with nothing to hinder his feet or limit his view, in the
presence of Jahve, i.e., having his Deliverer from death ever before his
eyes.

[Psalms 116:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 116:10</span></span>

Since כּי אדבּר does not introduce anything that could become an object
of belief, האמין is absolute here: to have faith, just as in [Job
24:22](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#022); [Job
29:24](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#024), with לא it signifies "to be
without faith, i.e., to despair." But how does it now proceed? The lxx
renders ἐπίστευσα, διὸ ἐλάλησα, which the apostle makes use of in [Co2
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#013), without our being therefore
obliged with Luther to render: I believe, therefore I speak; כי does not
signify διὸ. Nevertheless כי might according to the sense be used for
לכן, if it had to be rendered with Hengstenberg: "I believed, therefore
I spake,hy but I was very much plagued." But this assertion does not
suit this connection, and has, moreover, no support in the syntax. It
might more readily be rendered: "I have believed that I should yet
speak, i.e., that I should once more have a deliverance of God to
celebrate;" but the connection of the parallel members, which is then
only lax, is opposed to this. Hitzig's attempted interpretation, "I
trust, when (כּי as in [Jer 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#001)) I
should speak: I am greatly afflicted," i.e., "I have henceforth
confidence, so that I shall not suffer myself to be drawn away into the
expression of despondency," does not commend itself, since [Psa
116:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#010) is a complaining, but not
therefore as yet a desponding assertion of the reality. Assuming that
האמנתּי and אמרתּי in [Psa 116:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#011)
stand on the same line in point of time, it seems that it must be
interpreted I had faith, for I spake (was obliged to speak); but אדבר,
separated from האמנתי by כי, is opposed to the colouring relating to the
contemporaneous past. Thus [Psa 116:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#010)
will consequently contain the issue of that which has been hitherto
experienced: I have gathered up faith and believe henceforth, when I
speak (have to speak, must speak): I am deeply afflicted (ענה as in [Psa
119:67](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#067), cf. Arab. ‛nâ, to be bowed
down, more particularly in captivity, whence Arab. 'l-‛nât, those who
are bowed down). On the other hand, [Psa
116:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#011) is manifestly a retrospect. He
believes now, for he is thoroughly weaned from putting trust in men: I
said in my despair (taken from [Psa
31:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#023)), the result of my deeply bowed
down condition: All men are liars (πᾶς ἄνθρωπος ψεύστης, [Rom
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#004)). Forsaken by all the men from
whom he expected succour and help, he experienced the truth and
faithfulness of God. Striding away over this thought, he asks in [Psa
116:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#012) how he is to give thanks to God
for all His benefits. מה is an adverbial accusative for בּמּה, as in
[Gen 44:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#016), and the substantive
תּגּמוּל, in itself a later formation, has besides the Chaldaic plural
suffix ôhi, which is without example elsewhere in Hebrew. The poet says
in [Psa 116:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#013) how alone he can and
will give thanks to his Deliverer, by using a figure taken from the
Passover ([Mat 26:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#027)), the memorial
repast in celebration of the redemption out of Egypt. The cup of
salvation is that which is raised aloft and drunk amidst thanksgiving
for the manifold and abundant salvation (ישׁוּעות) experienced. קרא בשׁם
ה is the usual expression for a solemn and public calling upon and
proclamation of the Name of God. In [Psa
116:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#014) this thanksgiving is more
minutely designated as שׁלמי נדר, which the poet now discharges. A
common and joyous eating and drinking in the presence of God was
associated with the shelamim. נא (vid., [Psa
115:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#002)) in the freest application gives
a more animated tone to the word with which it stands. Because he is
impelled frankly and freely to give thanks before the whole
congregation, נא stands beside נגד, and נגד, moreover, has the
intentional ah.

[Psalms 116:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 116:15</span></span>

From what he has experienced the poet infers that the saints of Jahve
are under His most especial providence. Instead of המּות the poet, who
is fond of such embellishments, chooses the pathetic form המּותה, and
consequently, instead of the genitival construct state (מות), the
construction with the Lamed of "belonging to." It ought properly to be
"soul" or "blood," as in the primary passage [Psa
72:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#014). But the observation of Grotius:
quae pretiosa sunt, non facile largimur, applies also to the expression
"death." The death of His saints is no trifling matter with God; He does
not lightly suffer it to come about; He does not suffer His own to be
torn away from Him by death.

(Note: The Apostolic Constitutions (vi. 30) commend the singing of these
and other words of the Psalms at the funerals of those who have departed
in the faith (cf. Augusti, Denkwrdigkeiten, ix. 563). In the reign of
the Emperor Decius, Babylas Bishop of Antioch, full of blessed hope, met
death singing these words.)

After this the poet goes on beseechingly: ānnáh Adonaj. The prayer
itself is not contained in פּתּחתּ למוסרי - for he is already rescued,
and the perfect as a precative is limited to such utterances spoken in
the tone of an exclamation as we find in [Job
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#016) - but remains unexpressed; it
lies wrapped up as it were in this heartfelt ānnáh: Oh remain still so
gracious to me as Thou hast already proved Thyself to me. The poet
rejoices in and is proud of the fact that he may call himself the
servant of God. With אמתך he is mindful of his pious mother (cf. [Psa
86:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#016)). The Hebrew does not form a
feminine, עבדּה; Arab. amata signifies a maid, who is not, as such, also
Arab. ‛abdat, a slave. The dative of the object, למוסרי (from מוסרים for
the more usual מוסרות), is used with פתחת instead of the accusative
after the Aramaic manner, but it does also occur in the older Hebrew
(e.g., [Job 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#003); [Isa
53:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#011)). The purpose of publicly giving
thanks to the Gracious One is now more full-toned here at the close.
Since such emphasis is laid on the Temple and the congregation, what is
meant is literal thank-offerings in payment of vows. In בּתוככי (as in
[Psa 135:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#009)) we have in the suffix the
ancient and Aramaic i (cf. [Psa 116:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#007))
for the third time. With אנּה the poet clings to Jahve, with נגדּה־נּא
to the congregation, and with בּתוככי to the holy city. The one thought
that fills his whole soul, and in which the song which breathes forth
his soul dies away, is Hallelujah.
