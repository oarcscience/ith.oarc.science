II\. The Return of Ezra the Scribe from Babylon to Jerusalem, and His
Entry upon His Official Duties There - [Ezr
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#001)

In the seventh year of the reign of King Artaxerxes Longimanus, Ezra the
priest and scribe returned with certain priests, Levites, and other
Israelites from Babylon to Jerusalem, furnished with a royal commission
to provide for the worship of God, and the observance of the law,
according to the ordinance of God, by the community, Ezra 7 and 8. This
mission he began to execute by sending way such heathen women as were
married to Israelites.

[Ezra 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ezr 7:1</span></span>

[Ezr 7:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#001) form the introduction to
the narrative which follows of Ezra's return to Jerusalem and his
ministry there, and speak in general terms of himself and his arrival at
Jerusalem with a band of exiles. They are followed, vv. 11-26, by a copy
of the royal commission, and a thanksgiving, [Ezr
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#027), [Ezr
7:28](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#028), on the part of Ezra, for the
mercy of God bestowed upon him.

[Ezr 7:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#001)

What follows is slightly combined with the former occurrences by the
formula "after these things," without any more exact chronological
definition; comp. [Gen 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#001); [Gen
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#001), and elsewhere. Between the
dedication of the temple in the sixth year of Darius and the arrival of
Ezra in Jerusalem, a period of fifty-seven years had elapsed. "In the
reign of Artachshasta king of Persia, went up Ezra," etc. The verb of
the subject עזרא does not follow till [Ezr
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#006), where, after the interposition of
the long genealogy, [Ezr 7:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#001), the
distant subject is again taken up in עזרא הוּא. It is all but
universally agreed that Artaxerxes Longimanus is intended by
ארתּחשׁסתּא; the explanation of this appellation as Xerxes in Joseph.
Antiq. xi. 5. 1, for which Fritzsche (on 1 Esdr. 8:1) has recently
decided, being a mere conjecture on the part of that not very critical
historian. The fact that the Artachshasta of the book of Nehemiah ([Neh
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#001); [Neh
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#014); [Neh
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#006)) can be no other than Artaxerxes,
is decisive of this point: for in [Neh
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#006) the thirty-second year of
Artachshasta is mentioned; while according to [Neh
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#009); [Neh
12:26](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#026), [Neh
12:36](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#036), Ezra and Nehemiah jointly
exercised their respective offices at Jerusalem.

(Note: Very superficial are the arguments, and indeed the whole
pamphlet, Etude Chronologique des livres d'Esdras et de Nhmie, Paris
1868, p. 40, etc., by which F. de Saulcy tries to show that the
Artachshasta of Ezra 7 and of Nehemiah is Artaxerxes II (Mnemon).)

Ezra is called Ben Seraiah, whose pedigree is traced to Eleazar the son
of Aaron; Seraiah the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah, was the father
of Josedec the high priest carried into captivity ([Ch1
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#014), etc.), and was himself the high
priest whom Nebuchadnezzar slew at Riblah ([Kg2
25:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#018)). Between the execution of
Seraiah in the year 588 and the return of Ezra from Babylon in 458 b.c.,
there is a period of 130 years. Hence Ezra could have been neither the
son nor grandson of Seraiah, but only his great or great-great-grandson.
When we consider that Joshua, or Jeshua ([Ezr
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#002)), the high priest who returned
from Babylon with Zerubbabel, was the grandson of Seraiah, we cannot but
regard Ezra, who returned thence 78 years later, as a
great-great-grandson of Seraiah. Moreover, we are justified in inferring
from the fact that Ezra is not, like Joshua, designated as Ben Josedech,
that he did not descend from that line of Seraiah in which the
high-priestly dignity was hereditary, but from a younger son, and hence
that his immediate ancestors were not (though his forefathers from
Seraiah upwards were) of high-priestly descent. Hence the names of
Ezra's ancestors from Seraiah up to Aaron ([Ezr
7:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#001)) agree also with the genealogy
of the high-priestly race ([Ch1
6:4-14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#004)), with the one deviation that
in [Ezr 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#003), between Azariah and
Meraioth, six members are passed over, as is frequently the case in the
longer genealogies, for the sake of shortening the list of names. - In
v. 6 Ezra, for the sake of at once alluding to the nature of his office,
is designated בת מהיר סוף ר, a scribe skilful in the law of Moses. The
word סופר means in older works writer or secretary; but even so early as
[Jer 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#008) the lying pen of the ספרים is
spoken of, and here therefore סופר has already attained the meaning of
one learned in the Scripture, one who has made the written law a subject
of investigation. Ezra is, however, the first of whom the predicate
הסּופר, ὁ γραμματεύς, is used as a title. He is so called also in the
letter of Artaxerxes ([Ezr 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#011)),
because he is said ([Ezr 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#009)) to have
applied his heart to seek out and to do the law of the Lord, and to
teach in Israel statutes and judgment, i.e., because he had made the
investigation of the law, for the sake of introducing the practice of
the same among the congregation, his life-task; and the king granted him
all his desire, according to the hand of the Lord his God upon him. The
peculiar expression עליו אלהיו יהוה כּיד which is found only here and in
[Ezr 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#009), [Ezr
7:28](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#028), [Ezr
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#018); [Neh
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#008), [Neh
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#018), and in a slightly altered guise
in [Ezr 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#022), [Ezr
8:31](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#031), "according to the good hand of
his God, which was over him," means: according to the divine favour or
divine care arranging for him; for the hand of God is הטּובה, the good
([Ezr 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#009), and [Ezr
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#018)), or לטובה, [Ezr
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#022). בּקּשׁה, the desire, request,
demand, occurs only here and in the book of Esther.

[Ezr 7:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#007)

With Ezra went up a number of Israelites, priests, and Levites. מן
partitive: a part of the whole. That they went up with Ezra appears from
the context, and is expressly stated both in the royal edict ([Ezr
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#013)) and in the further description
of the expedition ([Ezr 7:28](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#028), [Ezr
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#001)). They went up in the seventh year
of Artaxerxes, and reached Jerusalem in the fifth month of that year. -
In [Ezr 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#008) Ezra is again, as in [Ezr
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#006), the subject of the sentence; the
intervening seventh verse being really only in apposition with [Ezr
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#006). - In [Ezr
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#009) the time occupied by the journey
is more precisely defined; כּי is explanatory. Namely, on the first day
of the first month, he had appointed the journey from Babylon, etc. The
Keri יסד הוּא can only mean, ipsum erat fundamentum profectionis, as J.
H. Mich. after R. Sal. explains it, for יסד is pointed as the construct
state. The departure of the expedition from the place of meeting
occurred, according to [Ezr 8:31](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#031), on
the twelfth day of the first month. Since, however, they encamped three
days there, making the final preparations for their journey, eleven days
might easily elapse between the period when the whole caravan had
assembled, and the day of actual departure. The Keri offers no
appropriate signification; for since הוּא can only be taken for the
subject, and הם יסד for the predicate, the sentence would contain an
anacoluthon. To translate הוּא by ipsum cannot be justified by the
usages of the language, for there is no such emphasis on יסד as to cause
הוּא to be regarded as an emphatic reference to the following noun. יסד
must be pointed יסד or יסּד, as the third pers. perf. Kal or Piel,
meaning to arrange, to appoint, and הוּא referred to Ezra. On הטּובה
אלהיו כּיד, comp. [Ezr 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#006). The hand
of his God graciously arranged for him, for he had prepared his heart to
seek and to do the law of Jahve, i.e., to make the law of God his rule
of action. לבבו הכין, like [Ch2 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#014);
[Ch2 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#003); [Ch2
30:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#019). To teach in Israel statutes and
judgments, as both are prescribed in the law of God.

[Ezra 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ezr 7:11</span></span>

The commission given by Artachshasta to Ezra ([Ezr
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#011)), with a short postscript by Ezra
([Ezr 7:27](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#027) and [Ezr
7:28](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#028)). - [Ezr
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#011) The introductory title, "This is
the copy of the letter," On פּרשׁגן, comp. [Ezr
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#011), and on נשׁתּון, [Ezr
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#007). Ezra is here, as also in the
letter itself, [Ezr 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#012), [Ezr
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#021), and in [Neh
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#009); [Neh
12:26](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#026), called only הסּופר הכּהן, the
priest, the scribe; in other places we find merely one title or the
other: either the priest, [Neh 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#010),
[Neh 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#016), [Neh
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#002); or the scribe, [Neh
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#004), [Neh
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#013); [Neh
12:36](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#036). To designate him according to
his rank, as the priest, seems to have subsequently become more
customary; hence in the first book of Esdras he is constantly called ὁ
Ἱιερεύς. הסּופר is explained by the addition וגו דּברי ספר, scribe of
the words of the law of Jahve and of His statutes to Israel, i.e., the
scribe, whose investigations referred to the law of God. More briefly in
[Ezr 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#012) and [Ezr
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#021) : scribe of the law.

[Ezr 7:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#012)

The letter containing the royal commission is given in the Chaldee
original. It is questionable what explanation must be given to גּמיר in
the title. If it were the adjective belonging to דּתא ספר, we should
expect the emphatic state גּמירא. Hence Bertheau combines it with the
following וּכענת as an abbreviation, "completeness, etc.," which would
signify that in the royal commission itself this introductory formula
would be found fully given, and that all the words here missing are
represented by וּכענת. This would be, at all events, an extremely
strange expression. We incline to regard גּמיר as an adverb used
adjectively: To the scribe in the law of God perfectly, for the perfect
scribe, etc., corresponding with the translation of the Vulgate,
doctissimo. The commission begins with an order that those Israelites
who desire to go to Jerusalem should depart with Ezra, because the king
and his seven counsellors send him to order matters in Judah and
Jerusalem according to the law of God, and to carry thither presents and
free-will offerings as a contribution towards the sacrifices, and other
matters necessary for the worship of God, [Ezr
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#013). "By me is commandment given," as
in [Ezr 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#008). למהך...כּל־מתנדּב: Every
one of the people of Israel in my kingdom, who shows himself willing to
go up to Jerusalem, let him go up with thee. On יהך and the infin. מהך,
comp. [Ezr 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#005).

[Ezr 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#014)

"Forasmuch as thou (art) sent by the king and his seven counsellors to
inquire (to institute an inquiry) concerning Judah and Jerusalem,
according to the law of thy God, which is in thy hand," i.e., which thou
handlest or possessest and understandest. The seven counsellors of the
king formed the supreme court of the realm; see remarks on [Est
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#014). It is obvious from the context
that שׁליח must be completed by אנתּ, for it is evidently Ezra who is
addressed both in what precedes and follows. על בּקּרה, to inquire
concerning (the condition of) Judah, i.e., concerning the religious and
civil relations of the Jewish community, to arrange them in conformity
with the divine law.

[Ezr 7:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#015)

"To carry the silver and gold which the king and his counsellors have
freely offered to the God of Israel, whose habitation is at Jerusalem,
and all the silver and gold which thou shalt obtain in all the province
of Babylon, with the free-will offering of the people and the priests,
willingly offering for the house of their God at Jerusalem." Three kinds
of offerings for the temple are here spoken of: 1st, the gifts of the
king and his counsellors for the service of the God of Israel; 2nd, the
gold and the silver that Ezra should obtain in the province of Babylon,
i.e., by the collection which he was consequently empowered to make
among the non-Israelite population of Babylon; 3rd, the free-will
offerings of his fellow-countrymen. התנדּבוּת is an abstract formed from
the infin. Hithpael: the freely given. The participle מתנדּבין (not in
the stat. emph. i.e., without an article) is but slightly connected, in
the sense of, if they, or what they, may freely offer.

[Ezr 7:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#017)

The application of these contributions. דּנה כּל־קבל, for this very
reason, sc. because furnished by the king and his counsellors, and by
the heathen and Israelite inhabitants of Babylon, thou shalt diligently
buy with this money bullocks, rams, lambs, with their meat-offerings and
their drink-offerings (the meat and drink offerings pertaining by the
law, [Num 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#001), etc., to the
sacrifices), and offer them upon the altar ... The Pael תּקרב instead of
the Aphel, [Ezr 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#010), [Ezr
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#017). The distribution and collection
were thus chiefly destined for the support of public worship, but were
larger and more abundant than was necessary for this purpose. Hence the
further injunction, [Ezr 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#018) : "And
whatsoever shall seem good to thee and to thy brethren to do with the
rest of the gold and the silver, that do after the will of your God,"
i.e., according to the precept of the law in which the will of God is
expressed. "Thy brethren" are the priests, to whom was committed the
care of the temple and its worship.

[Ezr 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#019)

The gold and silver vessels, moreover, which, according to [Ezr
8:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#025), the king and his counsellors,
and the princes and all Israel, presented for the service of the house
of God, he is to deliver before the God at Jerusalem (an abbreviated
expression for the God whose dwelling is at Jerusalem). The noun פּלחן,
only here and in the Targums, in the Syriac פּוּלחן, the service,
corresponds with the Hebrew עבורה. שׁלם in the Aphel, to complete, to
make full, then to deliver entirely, to consign.

[Ezr 7:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#020)

Ezra is to defray the expenses of all other things necessary for the
temple from the royal treasury, on which account a royal order is
despatched to the treasurer on this side the river. "And whatsoever more
shall be needful for the house of thy God, which thou shalt have
occasion to give" (i.e., whatever necessary expenses shall be incurred
which cannot be determined beforehand), and for which the gifts and
contributions already furnished to Ezra shall not suffice, he is to
give, i.e., to defray, out of the house of the king's treasures, i.e.,
the royal treasury. For this purpose Artaxerxes commands all the
treasures on this side the river, that whatsoever Ezra shall require of
them shall be immediately done. אנה is an emphatic repetition of the
pronoun, as in [Dan 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#015), and
frequently in Hebrew.

[Ezr 7:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#022)

Unto one hundred talents of silver, one hundred cors of wheat, one
hundred baths of wine, one hundred baths of oil, and salt without
prescription, i.e., as much as is needed. Cor had already become, even
in Hebrew, the later word for chomer, e.g., [Kg1
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#002); [Eze
45:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#014). It was equal to ten ephahs or
baths, almost two sheffels; see by bibl. Archol. ii. 126. The command
closes with the injunction, [Ezr 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#023)
: Whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven, i.e., whatever is
needful according to the law for the service of God, let it be
completely done for the house of the God of heaven; for why should the
wrath of heaven come upon the realm of the king and of his sons? The ἁπ.
λεγ. אדרזדּא is derived from the Aryan, but is not to be regarded (as by
Hitzig and Bertheau) as compounded of אדר and אזדּא; but probably (as by
Haug in Ewald's bibl. Jahrb. v. p. 152) as formed of the Persian drsh,
dorest, with א prosthetic, from the Zend root dore, to grow, to
flourish, to become firm, in the meaning of perfect in all parts, exact.
The motive of the royal order, that the priests may offer acceptable
offerings to the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king and of
his sons, recalls [Ezr 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#010). On the
formula למה דּי, for why should wrath come, comp. [Ezr
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#022).

[Ezr 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#024)

The priests, the Levites, and all the servants of the temple, are also
to be free from all customs and taxes. מהודעין וּלכם, we also make known
to you (it is made known to you). These words also are addressed to the
treasures, as levyers of taxes on this side the river. That, with regard
to all priests, ... and (other) ministers of this house of God, it shall
not be lawful to impose upon them toll, tribute, or custom. The אלהא
בּית פּלחי are not worshippers in the house of God, but they who do
service in the house of God. The expression comprises any servants of
the temple who might have been omitted in the classes enumerated. On וגו
בּלו מנדּה, comp. [Ezr 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#013). שׁלּיט
לא, (any one) has no right, with an infinitive following: it is allowed
to no one to do. מרמא from רמא, Targ. for שׂים. On this matter, compare
Josephus, Ant. xii. 3. 3, according to which Antiochus the Great freed
the priests and Levites from taxation.

[Ezr 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#025)

Finally, Ezra is empowered to appoint over his whole people (all the
Jews) on this side the river, judges who know the law of God, and to
inflict severe penalties upon those who transgress it.

"Thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God which is in thy hand (בידך דּי
like [Ezr 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#014)), set magistrates and
judges, which may judge all the people that are on this side the river,
namely all such as know the laws of thy God, and teach ye them that know
them not." The form מנּי is imper. Pael for מנּי, the A sound probably
passing in rapid speech into the flatter E sound. "All the people on
this side the river" is limited to Israelites or Jews by the further
particulars, "who know the law of thy God," etc. These are to receive
from Ezra judges, viz., such as are acquainted with the law, i.e.,
Israelite judges, and thus to be placed under the jurisdiction
established at Jerusalem. The sentence, "and they who know it (the law)
not, them teach ye, make them acquainted with it," does not refer to the
heathen, but to born Israelites or Jews, who, living among the heathen,
had not hitherto made the Mosaic law the rule of their lives. Such were
the judges to constrain to the observance and obedience of the law.

[Ezr 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#026)

But whosoever will not do the law of thy God, and the law of the king,
let a court be speedily (מנּהּ) held on his account (i.e., let him be
brought to justice, and punished). This, too, applies chiefly to such as
were Israelites born. The law of the king is the present edict, the
commission therein entrusted to Ezra: whoever opposes, neglects, or
transgresses it, shall be condemned, whether to death, or to banishment,
or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment. הן ... הן = the Hebrew
אם ... אם = sive ... sive. שׁרשׁוּ (Keri שׁרשׁי), rooting our (from
שׁרשׁ, to root out), i.e., banishment, exilium (Vulg.), not παιδεία
(lxx).

[Ezr 7:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#027)

This royal commission granted to the Jews all they could possibly desire
from the heathen governors of the country, for the establishment and
furtherance of their civil and religious polity. By granting these
privileges, Artaxerxes was not only treading in the footsteps of Cyrus
and Darius Hystaspes, but even going beyond these princes in granting to
the Jews a jurisdiction of their own. Without a magistrate who was one
of themselves, the Jewish community could not well prosper in their own
land; for the social and religious life of Israel were so closely
connected, that heathen magistrates, however well-intentioned, were
incapable of exercising a beneficial influence upon the welfare of the
Jews. Hence Ezra, having thus reported the royal commission, adds a
thanksgiving to God for having put such a thing into the king's heart,
namely, to beautify the house of the Lord, and for having granted him
favour before the king and his counsellors. The sentence הטּה ועלי הטּה
e is a continuation of the preceding infinitive sentence in the tempus
finit. ל before כּל־שׂרי is the ל comprehensive. Ezra names the
beautifying of the house of God as the occasion of his thanksgiving, not
only because this formed the chief matter of the royal favour, but also
because the re-establishment of divine worship was the re-establishment
of the moral and religious life of the community. "And I felt myself
strengthened, and gathered together (so that I gathered together) the
heads of Israel to go up with me (to Jerusalem)." Ezra assembled the
heads, i.e., of houses, as fellow-travellers, because their decision
would be a rule for the families at the head of which they stood. With
their heads, the several races and families determined to return to the
land of their fathers.
