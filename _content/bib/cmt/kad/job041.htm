<p>  1  Dost thou draw the crocodile by a hoop-net,
<p>And dost thou sink his tongue into the line?!
<p>  2  Canst thou put a rush-ring into his nose,
<p>And pierce his cheeks with a hook?
<p>  3  Will he make many supplications to thee,
<p>Or speak flatteries to thee?
<p>  4  Will he make a covenant with thee,
<p>To take him as a perpetual slave?
<p>  5  Wilt thou play with him as a little bird,
<p>And bind him for thy maidens?
<p>In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#008">Job 3:8</A>, &#1500;&#1493;&#1497;&#1514;&#1503; signified the celestial dragon, that causes the eclipses of the sun (according to the Indian mythology, ra&#770;hu the black serpent, and ketu the red serpent); in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#026">Psa 104:26</A> it does not denote some great sea-saurian after the kind of the hydrarchus of the primeval world, 
<p>(Note: Vid., Grsse, Beitrge, S. 94ff.)
<p>but directly the whale, as in the Talmud (Lewysohn, Zoologie des Talm. 178f.). Elsewhere, however, the crocodile is thus named, and in fact as &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503; also, another appellation of this natural wonder of Egypt, as an emblem of the mightiness of Pharaoh (vid., on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#013">Psa 74:13</A>.), as once again the crocodile itself is called in Arab. el-fir&#8219;annu. The Old Testament language possesses no proper name for the crocodile; even the Talmudic makes use of &#1511;&#1512;&#1493;&#1511;&#1514;&#1488; = &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (Lewysohn, 271). &#1500;&#1493;&#1497;&#1514;&#1503; is the generic name of twisted, and &#1514;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503; long-extended monsters. Since the Egyptian name of the crocodile has not been Hebraized, the poet contents himself in &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498; with making a play upon its Egyptian, and in Arab. tmsa&#770;h&#803;, timsa&#770;h&#803;,
<p>(Note: Herodotus was acquainted with this name (&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; = &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;); thus is the crocodile called also in Palestine, where (as Tobler and Joh. Roth have shown) it occurs, especially in the river Damr near Tantra.)
<p>Arabized name (Ew. 324, a). To wit, it is called in Coptic temsah, Hierogl. (without the art.) msuh (emsuh), as an animal that creeps "out of the egg (suh)."
<p>(Note: Les naturalistes - says Chabas in his Papyr. magique, p. 190 - comptent cinq espces de crocodiles vivant dans le Nil, mais les hieroglyphes rapportent un plus grand nombre de noms dtermins par le signe du crocodile. Such is really the case, apart from the so-called land crocodile or &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (Arab. isqanqu&#770;r), the Coptic name of which, hankelf (according to Lauth ha. n. kelf, ruler of the bank), is not as yet indicated on the monuments. Among the many old Egyptian names for the crocodile, Kircher's charuki is, however, not found, which reminds one of the Coptic karus, as &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; of &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, for &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; is the proper name of the Lacerta viridis (Herod. ii. 69). Lauth is inclined to regard charuki as a fiction of Kircher, as also the name of the phoenix, &#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b7; (vid., p. 562). The number of names of the crocodile which remain even without charuki, leads one to infer a great variety of species, and crocodiles, which differ from all living species, have also actually been found in Egyptian tombs; vid., Schmarda, Verbreitung der Thiere, i. 89.)
<p>In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#001">Job 41:1</A>, Ges. and others falsely translate: Canst thou press its tongue down with a cord; &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1497;&#1506; does not signify demergere = deprimere, but immergere: canst thou sink its tongue into the line, i.e., make it bite into the hook on the line, and canst thou thus draw it up? <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#001">Job 41:1</A> then refers to what must happen in order that the &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498; of the msuh may take place. Herodotus (and after him Aristotle) says, indeed, ii. 68, the crocodile has no tongue; but it has one, only it cannot stretch it out, because the protruding part has grown to the bottom of the mouth, while otherwise the saurians have a long tongue, that can be stretched out to some length. In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#002">Job 41:2</A> the order of thought is the same: for first the Nile fishermen put a ring through the gills or nose of valuable fish; then they draw a cord made of rushes (&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;) through it, in order to put them thus bound into the river. "As a perpetual slave," <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#004">Job 41:4</A> is intended to say: like one of the domestic animals. By &#1510;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#005">Job 41:5</A>, can hardly be meant &#1510;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514; &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, the little bird of the vineyard, i.e., according to a Talmud. usage of the language, the golden beetle (Jesurun, p. 222), or a pretty eatable grasshopper (Lewysohn, 374), but, according to the words of Catullus, Passer deliciae meae puellae, the sparrow, Arab. &#8219;asfu&#770;r - an example of a harmless living plaything (&#1513;&#1474;&#1495;&#1511; &#1489;&#1468;, to play with anything, different from <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#026">Psa 104:26</A>, where it is not, with Ew., to be translated: to play with it, but: therein). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#006">Job 41:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">job 41:6</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>  6  Do fishermen trade with him,
<p>Do they divide him among the Canaanites?
<p>  7  Canst thou fill his skin with darts,
<p>And his head with fish-spears?
<p>  8  Only lay thy hand upon him
<p>Remember the battle, thou wilt not do it again!
<p>  9  Behold, every hope becometh disappointment:
<p>Is not one cast down even at the sight of him?
<p>The fishermen form a guild (Arab. s&#803;unf, sunf), the associated members of which are called &#1495;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; (distinct from &#1495;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;). On &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492; &#1506;&#1500;, vid., on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#027">Job 6:27</A>. "When I came to the towns of the coast," says R. Akiba, b. Rosch ha-Schana, 26b, "they called selling, which we call &#1502;&#1499;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492;, &#1499;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492;, there," according to which, then, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#005">Gen 50:5</A> is understood, as by the Syriac; the word is Sanscrito-Semitic, Sanscr. kri, Persic chir&#305;&#770;den (Jesurun, p. 178). lxx &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, according to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#023">Kg2 6:23</A>, to which, however, &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; is not suitable. &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1506;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; are Phoenicians; and then, because they were the merchant race of the ancient world, directly traders or merchants. The meaning of the question is, whether one sells the crocodile among them, perhaps halved, or in general divided up. Further, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#007">Job 41:7</A> : whether one can kill it &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, with pointed missiles (Arab. shauke, a thorn, sting, dart), or with fish-spears (&#1510;&#1500;&#1510;&#1500;, so called from its whizzing, &#1510;&#1500;&#1500;, ). In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#008">Job 41:8</A> the accentuation is the right indication: only seize upon him - remember the battle, i.e., thou wilt be obliged to remember it, and thou wilt have no wish to repeat it. &#1494;&#1499;&#1512; .ti t is a so-called imperat. consec.: if thou doest it, thou wilt ... , Ges. 130, 2. &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1505;&#1507; is the pausal form of &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1505;&#1507; (once &#834;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#006">Pro 30:6</A>), of which it is the original form.
<p>The suff. of &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1492;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493; refers to the assailant, not objectively to the beast (the hope which he indulges concerning it). &#1504;&#1499;&#1494;&#1489;&#1492;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#009">Job 41:9</A>, is 3 praet., like &#1504;&#1488;&#1500;&#1502;&#1492;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#007">Isa 53:7</A> (where also the participial accenting as Milra, occurs in Codd.); Frst's Concord. treats it as part., but the participial form &#1504;&#1511;&#1496;&#1500;&#1492;, to be assumed in connection with it, along with &#1504;&#1511;&#1496;&#1500;&#1492; and &#1504;&#1511;&#1496;&#1500;&#1514;, does not exist. &#1492;&#1490;&#1501;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#009">Job 41:9</A>, is, according to the sense, equivalent to &#1492;&#1500;&#1488; &#1490;&#1501;, vid., on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#004">Job 20:4</A>. &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1493; (according to Ges., Ew., and Olsh., sing., with the plural suff., without a plur. meaning, which is natural in connection with the primary form &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1497;; or what is more probable, from the plur. &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; with a sing. meaning, as &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;) refers to the crocodile, and &#1497;&#1496;&#1468;&#1500; (according to a more accredited reading, &#1497;&#1496;&#1468;&#1500; = &#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1496;&#1500;) to the hunter to whom it is visible.
<p>What is said in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#006">Job 41:6</A> is perfectly true; although the crocodile was held sacred in some parts of Egypt, in Elephantine and Apollonopolis, on the contrary, it was salted and eaten as food. Moreover, that there is a small species of crocodile, with which children can play, does not militate against <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#005">Job 41:5</A>. Everywhere here it is the creature in its primitive strength and vigour that is spoken of. But if they also knew how to catch it in very early times, by fastening a bait, perhaps a duck, on a barb with a line attached, and drew the animal to land, where they put an end to its life with a lance-thrust in the neck (Uhlemann, Thoth, S. 241): this was angling on the largest scale, as is not meant in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#001">Job 41:1</A>. If, on the other hand, in very early times they harpooned the crocodile, this would certainly be more difficult of reconcilement with v. 31, than that mode of catching it by means of a fishing-hook of the greatest calibre with <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#001">Job 41:1</A>. But harpooning is generally only of use when the animal can be hit between the neck and head, or in the flank; and it is very questionable whether, in the ancient times, when the race was without doubt of an unmanageable size, that has now died out, the crocodile hunt (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#012">Job 7:12</A>) was effected with harpoons. On the whole subject we have too little information for distinguishing between the different periods. So far as the questions of Jehovah have reference to man's relation to the two monsters, they concern the men of the present, and are shaped according to the measure of power which they have attained over nature. The strophe which follows shows what Jehovah intends by these questions. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#010">Job 41:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">job 41:10</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>10  None is so foolhardy that he dare excite him!
<p>And who is it who could stand before Me?
<p>11  Who hath given Me anything first of all, that I must requite it?
<p>Whatsoever is under the whole heaven is Mine.
<p>One sees from these concluding inferences, thus applied, what is the design, in the connection of this second speech of Jehovah, of the reference to behmoth and leviathan, which somewhat abruptly began in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#015">Job 40:15</A>. If even the strength of one of God's creatures admits no thought of being able to attack it, how much more should the greatness of the Creator deter man from all resistance! For no one has any claim on God, so that he should have the right of appearing before Him with a rude challenge. Every creature under heaven is God's; man, therefore, possesses nothing that was not God's property and gift, and he must humbly yield, whether God gives or takes away. &#1500;&#1488;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#010">Job 41:10</A>, is not directly equivalent to &#1488;&#1497;&#1503;, but the clause is exclamatory. &#1497;&#1506;&#1493;&#1512;&#1504;&#1493; Chethb, &#1497;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;&#1504;&#1493; Ker, is the Palestine reading, the reverse the Babylonian; the authorized text (chiefly without a Ker) is &#1497;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; from &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; in a transitive signification (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;), as &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#012">Job 39:12</A>, comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#010">Job 42:10</A>. The meaning of &#1492;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1502;&#1504;&#1497; is determined according to &#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501;: to anticipate, viz., by gifts presented as a person is approaching the giver (Arab. aqdama). &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#011">Job 41:11</A>, is neutral, as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#016">Job 13:16</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#009">Job 15:9</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#011">Job 31:11</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#028">Job 31:28</A>. &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514; is virtually a subj.: that which is under ... . After these apparently epiphonematic verses (2 and 3), one might now look for Job's answer. But the description of the leviathan is again taken up, and in fact hitherto it was only the invincibility of the animal that was spoken of; and yet it is not so described that this picture might form the exact pendent of the preceding. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#012">Job 41:12</A></p>

<p>12  I will not keep silence about his members,
<p>The proportion of his power and the comeliness of his structure.
<p>13  Who could raise the front of his coat of mail?
<p>Into his double teeth-who cometh therein?
<p>14  The doors of his face-who openeth them?
<p>Round about his teeth is terror.
<p>The Ker &#1500;&#1493; authorized by the Masora assumes an interrogative rendering: as to it, should I be silent about its members (&#1500;&#1493; at the head of the clause, as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#007">Lev 7:7-9</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#002">Isa 9:2</A>), - what perhaps might appear more poetic to many. &#1492;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; (once, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#003">Job 11:3</A>, to cause to keep silence) here, as usually: to be silent. &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;, as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#013">Job 18:13</A>. &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; signifies the relation of the matter, a matter of fact, as &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;, facts, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#004">Psa 65:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#027">Psa 105:27</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#005">Psa 145:5</A>. &#1495;&#1497;&#1503; (compared by Ew. with &#1492;&#1497;&#1503;, a measure) signifies grace, &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; (as synon. &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;), here delicate regularity, and is made easy of pronunciation from &#1495;&#1504;&#1503;, just as the more usual &#1495;&#1503;; the language has avoided the form &#1495;&#1504;&#1503;, as observed above. &#1500;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; . clothing, we have translated "coat of mail," which the Arab. liba&#770;s usually signifies; &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1500;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; is not its face's covering (Schlottm.), which ought to be &#1500;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;; but &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; is the upper or front side turned to the observer (comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#007">Isa 25:7</A>), as Arab. wjh, (wag'h), si rem desuper spectes, summa ejus pars, si ex adverso, prima (Fleischer, Glossae, i. 57). That which is the "doubled of its mouth" (&#1512;&#1505;&#1503;, prop. a bit in the mouth, then the mouth itself) is its upper and lower jaws armed with powerful teeth. The "doors of the face" are the jaws; the jaws are divided back to the ears, the teeth are not covered by lips; the impression of the teeth is therefore the more terrible, which the substantival clause, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#014">Job 41:14</A> (comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#020">Job 39:20</A>), affirms. &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493; gen. subjecti: the circle, &#x3b5;&#788;&#768;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, which is formed by its teeth (Hahn).

<p>15  A pride are the furrows of the shields,
<p>Shut by a rigid seal.
<p>16  One joineth on to the other,
<p>And no air entereth between them.
<p>17  One upon another they are arranged,
<p>They hold fast together, inseparably.
<p>Since the writer uses &#1488;&#1508;&#1497;&#1511; both in the signif. robustus, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#012">Job 12:12</A>, and canalis, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#018">Job 40:18</A>, it is doubtful whether it must be explained robusta (robora) scutorum (as e.g., Ges.), or canales scutorum (Hirz., Schlottm., and others). We now prefer the latter, but so that "furrows of the shields" signifies the square shields themselves bounded by these channels; for only thus is the &#1505;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, which refers to these shields, considered, each one for itself, suitably attached to what precedes. &#1495;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501; &#1510;&#1512; is an acc. of closer definition belonging to it: closed is (each single one) by a firmly attached, and therefore firmly closed, seal. lxx remarkably &#x3c9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1; &#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, i.e., (emery (vid., Krause's Pyrogeteles, 1859, S. 228). Six rows of knotty scales and four scales of the neck cover the upper part of the animal's body, in themselves firm, and attached to one another in almost impenetrable layers, as is described in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#007">Job 41:7</A> in constantly-varying forms of expression (where &#1497;&#1490;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468; with Pathach beside Athnach is the correct reading), - a &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1492;, i.e., an equipment of which the animal may be proud. Umbr. takes &#1490;&#1488;&#1493;&#1492;, with Bochart, = &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1492;, the back; but although in the language much is possible, yet not everything.

<p>18  His sneezing sendeth forth light,
<p>And his eyes are like the eyelids of the dawn;
<p>19  Out of his mouth proceed flames,
<p>Sparks of fire escape from him;
<p>20  Out of his nostrils goeth forth smoke
<p>Like a seething pot and caldron;
<p>21  His breath kindleth coals,
<p>And flames go forth out of his mouth.
<p>That the crocodile delights to sun itself on the land, and then turns its open jaws to the sunny side, most Nile travellers since Herodotus have had an opportunity of observing; 
<p>(Note: Dieterici, Reisebilder, i. 194: "We very often saw the animal lying in the sand, its jaws wide open and turned towards the warm sunbeams, while little birds, like the slender white water-wagtail, march quietly about in the deadly abyss, and pick out worms from the watery jaws." Herodotus, ii. 68, tells exactly the same story; as the special friend of the crocodile among little birds, he mentions &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; (the sand-piper, Pluvianus Aegyptius).)
<p>and in connection therewith the reflex action of sneezing may occur, since the light of the sun produces an irritation on the retina, and thence on the vagus; and since the sun shines upon the fine particles of watery slime cast forth in the act of sneezing, a meteoric appearance may be produced. This delicate observation of nature is here compressed into three words; in this concentration of whole, grand thoughts and pictures, we recognise the older poet. &#1506;&#1496;&#1513;&#1473; is the usual Semitic word for "sneezing" (Synon. &#1494;&#1512;&#1512;   <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#035">Kg2 4:35</A>). &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1500; shortened from &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1500;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#026">Job 31:26</A>, Hiph. of &#1492;&#1500;&#1500;. The comparison of the crocodile's eyes with &#1506;&#1508;&#1506;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1512; (as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#009">Job 3:9</A>, from &#1506;&#1508;&#1506;&#1507;, to move with quick vibrations, to wink, i.e., tremble), or the rendering of the same as &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#834;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; (lxx), is the more remarkable, as, according to Horus, i. 68, two crocodile's eyes are the hieroglyph
<p>(Note: The eyes of the crocodile alone by themselves are no hieroglyph: how could they have been represented by themselves as crocodile's eyes? But in the Ramesseum and elsewhere the crocodile appears with a head pointing upwards in company with couching lions, and the eyes of the crocodile are rendered specially prominent. Near this group it appears again in a curved position, and quite small, but this time in company with a scorpion which bears a disc of the sun. The former (&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bf; &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;) seems to me to be a figure of the longest night, the latter (&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c2; in Horapollo) of the shortest, so that consequently &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769; and &#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; do not refer to the rising and setting of the sun, but to the night as prevailing against or succumbing to the day (communicated by Lauth from his researches on the astronomical monuments). But since the growth of the day begins with the longest night, and vice vers, the notions &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769; and &#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; can, as it seems to me, retain their most natural signification; and the crocodile's eyes are, notwithstanding, a figure of the light shining forth from the darkness, as the crocodile's tail signifies black darkness (and Egypt as the black land).)
<p>for dawn, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;: &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1; (probably to be read &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;) &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;. There it is the peculiar brilliancy of the eyes of certain animals that is intended, which is occasioned either by the iris being furnished with a so-called lustrous substance, or there being in the pupil of the eye (as e.g., in the ostrich) that spot which, shining like metal, is called tapetum lucidum. For &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; of the eyes &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;, is the lustre of the pupil in the depth of the eye. The eyes of the crocodile, which are near together, and slanting, glimmer through the water, when it is only a few feet under water, with a red glow.
<p>Nevertheless the comparison in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#018">Job 41:18</A> might also be intended differently. The inner (third) eyelid
<p>(Note: Prof. Will refers the figure not to the third eyelid or the membrana nictitans, but to that spot on the choroidea, glistening with a metallic lustre, which the crocodile has in common with most animals of the night or the twilight, therefore to the brilliancy of its eye, which shines by virtue of its lustrous coating; vid., the magnificent head of a crocodile in Schlegel's Amphibien-Abbildungen (1837-44).)
<p>of the crocodile is itself a rose red; and therefore, considered in themselves, its eyes may also be compared with the "eyelids of the dawn." What is then said, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#019">Job 41:19</A>, of the crocodile, Achilles Tatius, iv. 2, says of the hippopotamus: &#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b1; &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#837;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b7; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c9;&#788;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;. Bartram has observed on the alligator, that as it comes on the land a thick smoke issues from its distended nostrils with a thundering sound. This thick, hot steam, according to the credible description which is presented here, produces the impression of a fire existing beneath, and bursting forth. The subjective truth of this impression is faithfully but poetically reproduced by the poet. On &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1491; (root &#1499;&#1491;, escudere). &#1492;&#1514;&#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1496; signifies no more than to disentangle one's self, here therefore: to fly out in small particles. &#1488;&#1490;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#019">Job 41:19</A>, is rendered by Saad., Gecat., and others, by qumqum (&#1511;&#1493;&#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1501;), a caldron; the modern expositors derive it from &#1488;&#1490;&#1501; = agama, to glow, and understand it of a "heated caldron." But the word signifies either heat or caldron; the latter signification, however, cannot be linguistically established; one would look for &#1488;&#1490;&#1468;&#1503; (Arab. igga&#770;ne, a copper Germ. Waschkessel). The noun &#1488;&#1490;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503; signifies, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#002">Job 40:2</A>, the reed &#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, and in the Jerusalem Talmud, Sota ix. 12, some menial service (comp. Arab. ugum); Ew. rightly retains the former signification, like a pot blown upon, i.e., fired, heated, and beside it (in combination with it) reeds as fuel, which in themselves, and especially together with the steaming water, produce a thick smoke. The Waw is to be compared to the Arabic Waw concomitantiae (which governs the acc.).

<p>22  Great strength resteth upon his neck,
<p>And despair danceth hence before him.
<p>23  The flanks of his flesh are thickly set,
<p>Fitting tightly to him, immoveable.
<p>24  His heart is firm like stone,
<p>And firm like the nether millstone.
<p>25  The mighty are afraid of his rising up;
<p>From alarm they miss their aim.
<p>Overpowering strength lodges on its neck, i.e., has its abiding place there, and before it despair, prop. melting away, dissolution (&#1491;&#1468;&#1488;&#1489;&#1492; from &#1491;&#1468;&#1488;&#1489;, Arab. d&#817;'b = &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; Hiph., Arab. d&#803;'b II, to bring into a loose condition, synon. &#1495;&#1502;&#1505;), dances hence, i.e., spring up and away (&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;, Arab. jadisu, to run away), i.e., it spreads before it a despondency which produces terror, and deprives of strength. Even the pendulous fleshy parts (&#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;), especially of its belly, hang close together, &#1491;&#1489;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;, i.e., they are not flabby, but fit to it, like a metal casting, without moving, for the skin is very thick and covered with thick scales; and because the digestive apparatus of the animal occupies but little space, and the scales of the back are continued towards the belly, the tender parts appear smaller, narrower, and closer together than in other animals. &#1497;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511; here is not, as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#002">Job 27:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#006">Job 29:6</A>, the fut. of &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;, but the part. of &#1497;&#1510;&#1511;, as also <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#024">Job 41:24</A>: its heart is firm and obdurate, as though it were of cast brass, hard as stone, and in fact as the nether millstone (&#1508;&#1500;&#1495; from &#1508;&#1500;&#1495;, falacha, to split, crush in pieces), which, because it has to bear the weight and friction of the upper, must be particularly hard. It is not intended of actual stone-like hardness, but only of its indomitable spirit and great tenacity of life: the activity of its heart is not so easily disturbed, and even fatal wounds do not so quickly bring it to a stand. &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1502;&#1493; from &#1513;&#1474;&#1514; = &#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1514; = &#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1514;), primary form &#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;, is better understood in the active sense: afraid of its rising, than the passive: of its exaltedness. &#1488;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; (according to another reading &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;) is not, with Ew., to be derived from &#1488;&#1497;&#1500; (Arab. &#305;&#770;jal), a ram; but &#1488;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#015">Exo 15:15</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#013">Eze 17:13</A> (comp. &#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#016">Ch2 2:16</A>, &#1504;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#029">Sa2 22:29</A>), &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#011">Eze 31:11</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#021">Eze 32:21</A>, and &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; Cheth. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#015">Kg2 24:15</A>, are only alternating forms and modes of writing of the participial adject., derived from &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500; (&#1488;&#1497;&#1500;) first of all in the primary form awil (as &#1490;&#1468;&#1512; = gawir). The signif. assigned to the verb &#1488;&#1493;&#1500;: to be thick = fleshy, which is said then to go over into the signif. to be stupid and strong (Ges. Handwrterb.), rests upon a misconception: a&#770;la is said of fluids "to become thick," because they are condensed, since they go back, i.e., sink in or settle (Ges. correctly in Thes.: notio crassitiei a retrocendendo). The verb a&#770;la, ja'u&#770;lu, unites in itself the significations to go backward, to be forward, and to rule; the last two: anteriorem and superiorem esse, probably belong together, and &#1488;&#1500; signifies, therefore, a possessor of power, who is before and over others. &#1492;&#1514;&#1495;&#1496;&#1468;&#1488;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#025">Job 41:25</A>, has the signif., which does not otherwise occur, to miss the mark (from &#1495;&#1496;&#1488;, Arab. chat&#803;iya, to miss, opp. Arab. s&#803;a&#770;b, to hit the mark), viz., (which is most natural where &#1488;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; is the subject spoken of) since they had designed the slaughter and capture of the monster. &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; is intended subjectively, as &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512;&#1488; = &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1491; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#016">Exo 15:16</A>, Targ.

<p>Sling stones are turned to stubble with him.

<p>&#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1497;&#1490;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, which stands first as nom. abs., "one reaching him," is equivalent to, if one or whoever reaches him, Ew. 357, c, to which &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; &#1514;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;, it does not hold fast (&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; with v. fin., as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#007">Hos 8:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#016">Hos 9:16</A>, Chethb), is the conclusion. &#1495;&#1512;&#1489; is instrumental, as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#013">Psa 17:13</A>. &#1502;&#1505;&#1468;&#1506;, from &#1504;&#1505;&#1506;, Arab. nz&#8219;, to move on, hasten on, signifies a missile, as Arab. minz&#8219;a, an arrow, manz&#8219;a, a sling. The Targ. supports this latter signification here (funda quae projicit lapidem); but since &#1511;&#1500;&#1488;, the handling, is mentioned separately, the word appears to men missiles in general, or the catapult. In this combination of weapons of attack it is very questionable whether &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492; is a cognate form of &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; (&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503;), a coat of mail; probably it is equivalent to Arab. sirwe (surwe), an arrow with a long broad edge (comp. ser&#305;&#770;je, a short, round, as it seems, pear-shaped arrow-head), therefore either a harpoon or a peculiarly formed dart.
<p>(Note: On the various kinds of Egyptian arrows, vid., Klemm. Culturgeschichte, v. 371f.)
<p>"The son of the bow" (and of the &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1492;, pharetra) is the arrow. That the &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;. &#1514;&#1493;&#1514;&#1495; signifies a club (war-club), is supported by the Arab. watacha, to beat. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1503;, in distinction from &#1495;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514; (a long lance), is a short spear, or rather, since &#1512;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473; implies a whistling motion, a javelin. Iron the crocodile esteems as &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1503;, tibn, chopped straw; sling stones are turned with him into &#1511;&#1513;&#1473;. Such is the name here at least, not for stumps of cut stubble that remain standing, but the straw itself, threshed and easily driven before the wind (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#025">Job 13:25</A>), which is cut up for provender (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#012">Exo 5:12</A>), generally dried (and for that reason light) stalks (e.g., of grass), or even any remains of plants (e.g., splinters of wood).
<p>(Note: The Egyptio-Arabic usage has here more faithfully preserved the ancient signification of the word (vid., Fleischer, Glossae, p. 37) than the Syro-Arabic; for in Syria cut but still unthreshed corn, whether lying in swaths out in the field and weighted with stones to protect it against the whirlwinds that are frequent about noon, or corn already brought to the threshing-floors but not yet threshed, is called qashsh. - Wetzst.)

Parchon's (and Kimchi's) reading &#1514;&#1493;&#1495;&#1495; is founded upon an error.

<p>Under it, or, &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493; taken like &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#011">Job 41:11</A>, as a virtual subject (vid., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#005">Job 28:5</A>): its under parts are the most pointed or sharpest shards, i.e., it is furnished with exceedingly pointed scales. &#1495;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491; is the intensive form of &#1495;&#1491; (Arab. had&#305;&#770;d, sharpened = iron, p. 542, note), as &#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;,   <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#040">Sa1 17:40</A>, of &#1495;&#1500;&#1511; (smooth),
<p>(Note: In Arabic also this substantival form is intensive, e.g., lebbu&#770;n, an exceedingly large kind of tile, dried in the open air, of which farm-yards are built, nearly eight times larger than the common tile, which is called libne (&#1500;&#1489;&#1504;&#1495;).)
<p>and the combination &#1495;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497; &#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1474; (equal the combination &#1495;&#1491;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497; &#1492;&#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501;, comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#006">Job 30:6</A>) is moreover superlative: in the domain of shards standing prominent as sharp ones, as Arab. chairu ummatin, the best people, prop. bon en fait de peuple (Ew. 313, c. Gramm. Arab. 532). lxx &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;, by drawing &#1497;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1491; to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#030">Job 41:30</A>, and so translating as though it were &#1512;&#1508;&#1497;&#1491;&#1514;&#1493; (Arab. rifa&#770;de, stratum). The verb &#1512;&#1508;&#1491; (rafada), cogn. &#1512;&#1489;&#1491;, signifies sternere (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#013">Job 17:13</A>), and then also culcire; what is predicated cannot be referred to the belly of the crocodile, the scales of which are smooth, but to the tail with its scales, which more or less strongly protrude, are edged round by a shallow cavity, and therefore are easily and sharply separated when pressed; and the meaning is, that when it presses its under side in the morass, it appears as though a threshing-sledge with its iron teeth had been driven across it.
<p>The pictures in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#031">Job 41:31</A> are true to nature; Bartram, who saw two alligators fighting, says that their rapid passage was marked by the surface of the water as it were boiling. With &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;, a whirlpool, abyss, depth (from &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500; = &#1510;&#1500;&#1500;, to hiss, clash; to whirl, surge), &#1497;&#1501; alternates; the Nile even in the present day is called bahr (sea) by the Beduins, and also compared, when it overflows its banks, to a sea. The observation that the animal diffuses a strong odour of musk, has perhaps its share in the figure of the pot of ointment (lxx &#x3c9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, which Zwingli falsely translates spongia); a double gland in the tail furnishes the Egyptians and Americans their (pseudo) musk. In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#032">Job 41:32</A> the bright white trail that the crocodile leaves behind it on the surface of the water is intended; in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#032">Job 41:32</A> the figure is expressed which underlies the descriptions of the foaming sea with &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, canus, in the classic poets. &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1489;&#1492;, hoary hair, was to the ancients the most beautiful, most awe-inspiring whiteness. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#033">Job 41:33</A>, understood by the Targ., Syr., Arab. version, and most moderns (e.g., Hahn: there is not on earth any mastery over it), according to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#010">Zac 9:10</A>, is certainly, with lxx, Jer., and Umbr., not to be understood differently from the Arab. mithlahu (its equal); whether it be an inflexion of &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;, or what is more probable, of &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500; (comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#006">Job 17:6</A>, where this nomen actionis signifies a proverb = word of derision, and &#1492;&#1514;&#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1500;, to compare one's self, be equal, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#019">Job 30:19</A>). &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1506;&#1508;&#1512; is also Hebr.-Arab.; the Arabic uses turbe, formed from tura&#770;b (vid., on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#025">Job 19:25</A>), of the surface of the earth, and et-tarba&#770;-u as the name of the earth itself. &#1492;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468; (for &#1492;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1497;, as &#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#022">Job 15:22</A>, Cheth. = &#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1497;, resolved from &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1493;, &#8219;asu&#770;w, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#018">Sa1 25:18</A>, Cheth.) is the confirmatory predicate of the logical subj. described in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#033">Job 41:33</A> as incomparable; and &#1500;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1470;&#1495;&#1514; (from &#1495;&#1514;, the a of which becomes i in inflexion), absque terrore (comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#004">Job 38:4</A>), is virtually a nom. of the predicate: the created one (becomes) a terrorless one (a being that is terrified by nothing). Everything high, as the &#1500;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1470;&#1495;&#1514;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#033">Job 41:33</A>, is more exactly explained, it looketh upon, i.e., remains standing before it, without turning away affrighted; in short, it (the leviathan) is king over all the sons of pride, i.e., every beast of prey that proudly roams about (vid., on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#008">Job 28:8</A>).
