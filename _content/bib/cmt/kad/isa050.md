### [Isaiah Chapter 50](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#001)

[Isaiah 50:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 50:1</span></span>

The words are no longer addressed to Zion, but to her children. "Thus
saith Jehovah, Where is your mother's bill of divorce, with which I put
her away? Or where is one of my creditors, to whom I sold you? Behold,
for your iniquities are ye sold, and for your transgressions is your
mother put away." It was not He who had broken off the relation in which
He stood to Zion; for the mother of Israel, whom Jehovah had betrothed
to Himself, had no bill of divorce to show, with which Jehovah had put
her away and thus renounced for ever the possibility of receiving her
again (according to [Deu 24:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#001)),
provided she should in the meantime have married another. Moreover, He
had not yielded to outward constraint, and therefore given her up to a
foreign power; for where was there on of His creditors (there is not any
one) to whom He would have been obliged to relinquish His sons, because
unable to pay His debts, and in this way to discharge them? - a harsh
demand, which was frequently made by unfelling creditors of insolvent
debtors ([Exo 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#007); [Kg2
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#001); [Mat
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#025)). On nōsheh, a creditor, see at
[Isa 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#002). Their present condition was
indeed that of being sold and put away; but this was not the effect of
despotic caprice, or the result of compulsion on the part of Jehovah. It
was Israel itself that had broken off the relation in which it stood to
Jehovah; they had been sold through their own faults, and "for your
transgressions is your mother put away." Instead of וּבפשׁעיה we have
וּבפשׁעיכם. This may be because the church, although on the one hand
standing higher and being older than her children (i.e., her members at
any particular time), is yet, on the other hand, orally affected by
those to whom she has given birth, who have been trained by her, and
recognised by her as her own.

[Isaiah 50:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 50:2</span></span>

The radical sin, however, which has lasted from the time of the
captivity down to the present time, is disobedience to the word of God.
This sin brought upon Zion and her children the judgment of banishment,
and it was this which made it last so long. "Why did I come, and there
was no one there? Why did I call, and there was no one who answered? Is
my hand too short to redeem? or is there no strength in me to deliver?
Behold, through my threatening I dry up the sea; turn streams into a
plain: their fish rot, because there is no water, and die for thirst. I
clothe the heavens in mourning, and make sackcloth their covering."
Jehovah has come, and with what? It follows, from the fact of His
bidding them consider, that His hand is not too short to set Israel
loose and at liberty, that He is not so powerless as to be unable to
draw it out; that He is the Almighty, who by His mere threatening word
([Psa 106:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#009); [Psa
104:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#007)) can dry up the sea, and turn
streams into a hard and barren soil, so that the fishes putrefy for want
of water ([Exo 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#018), etc.), and die
from thirst (thâmōth a voluntative used as an indicative, as in [Isa
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#001), and very frequently in poetical
composition); who can clothe the heavens in mourning, and make sackcloth
their (dull, dark) covering (for the expression itself, compare [Isa
37:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#001)); who therefore, fiat
applicatio, can annihilate the girdle of waters behind which Babylon
fancies herself concealed (see [Isa
42:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#015); [Isa
44:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#027)), and cover the empire, which is
now enslaving and torturing Israel, with a sunless and starless night of
destruction ([Isa 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#010)). It follows
from all this, that He has come with a gospel of deliverance from sin
and punishment; but Israel has given no answer, has not received this
message of salvation with faith, since faith is assent to the word of
God. And in whom did Jehovah come? Knobel and most of the commentators
reply, "in His prophets." This answer is not wrong, but it does not
suffice to show the connection between what follows and what goes
before. For there it is one person who speaks; and who is that, but the
servant of Jehovah, who is introduced in these prophecies with dramatic
directness, as speaking in his own name? Jehovah has come to His people
in His servant. We know who was the servant of Jehovah in the historical
fulfilment. It was He whom even the New Testament Scriptures describe as
τὸν παῖδα τοῦ κυρίου, especially in the Acts ([Act
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#013), [Act
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#026); [Act
4:27](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#027), [Act
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#030)). It was not indeed during the
Babylonian captivity that the servant of Jehovah appeared in Israel with
the gospel of redemption; but, as we shall never be tired of repeating,
this is the human element in these prophecies, that they regard the
appearance of the "servant of Jehovah," the Saviour of Israel and the
heathen, as connected with the captivity: the punishment of Israel
terminating, according to the law of the perspective foreshortening of
prophetic vision, with the termination of the captivity - a connection
which we regard as one of the strongest confirmations of the composition
of these addresses before the captivity, as well as of Isaiah's
authorship. But this ἀνθρώπινον does not destroy the θεῖον in them,
inasmuch as the time at which Jesus appeared was not only similar to
that of the Babylonian captivity, but stood in a causal connection with
it, since the Roman empire was the continuation of the Babylonian, and
the moral state of the people under the iron arm of the Roman rule
resembled that of the Babylonian exiles ([Eze
2:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#006)). At the same time, whatever our
opinion on this point may be, it is perfectly certain that it is to the
servant of Jehovah, who was seen by the prophet in connection with the
Babylonian captivity, that the words "wherefore did I come" refer.

[Isaiah 50:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 50:4</span></span>

He in whom Jehovah came to His nation, and proclaimed to it, in the
midst of its self-induced misery, the way and work of salvation, is He
who speaks in [Isa 50:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#004) : "The Lord
Jehovah hath given me a disciple's tongue, that I may know how to set up
the wearied with words: He wakeneth every morning; wakeneth mine ear to
attend in disciple's manner." The word limmūdı̄m, which is used in the
middle of the verse, and which is the older word for the later talmidı̄m,
μαθηταί, as in [Isa 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#016); [Isa
54:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#013), is repeated at the close of the
verse, according to the figure of palindromy, which is such a favourite
figure in both parts of the book of Isaiah; and the train of thought,
"He wakeneth morning by morning, wakeneth mine ear," recals to mind the
parallelism with reservation which is very common in the Psalms, and
more especially the custom of a "triolet-like" spinning out of the
thoughts, from which the songs of "degrees" (or ascending steps, shı̄r
hamma‛ălōth) have obtained their name. The servant of Jehovah affords us
a deep insight here into His hidden life. The prophets received special
revelations from God, for the most part in the night, either in dreams
or else in visions, which were shown them in a waking condition, but yet
in the more susceptible state of nocturnal quiet and rest. Here,
however, the servant of Jehovah receives the divine revelations neither
in dreams nor visions of the night; but every morning (babbōqer babbōqer
as in [Isa 28:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#019)), i.e., when his
sleep is over, Jehovah comes to him, awakens his ear, by making a sign
to him to listen, and then takes him as it were into the school after
the manner of a pupil, and teaches him what and how he is to preach.
Nothing indicates a tongue befitting the disciples of God, so much as
the gift of administering consolation; and such a gift is possessed by
the speaker here. "To help with words him that is exhausted" (with
suffering and self-torture): עוּת, Arab. gât̬, med. Vav, related to
אוּשׁ, חוּשׁ, signifies to spring to a person with words to help, Aq.
ὑποστηρίσαι, Jer. sustentare. The Arabic gât̬, med. Je, to rain upon or
water (Ewald, Umbreit, etc.), cannot possibly be thought of, since this
has no support in the Hebrew; still less, however, can we take עוּת as a
denom. from עת, upon which Luther has founded his rendering, "to speak
to the weary in due season" (also Eng. ver.). דּבר is an accusative of
more precise definition, like אשׁר in [Isa
50:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#001) (cf., [Isa
42:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#025); [Isa
43:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#023)). Jerome has given the correct
rendering: "that I may know how to sustain him that is weary with a
word."

[Isaiah 50:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 50:5</span></span>

His calling is to save, not to destroy; and for this calling he has
Jehovah as a teacher, and to Him he has submitted himself in docile
susceptibility and immoveable obedience. [Isa
50:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#005) "The Lord Jehovah hath opened
mine ear; and I, I was not rebellious, and did not turn back." He put
him into a position inwardly to discern His will, that he might become
the mediator of divine revelation; and he did not set himself against
this calling (mârâh, according to its radical meaning stringere, to make
one's self rigid against any one, ἀντιτείνειν), and did not draw back
from obeying the call, which, as he well knew, would not bring him
earthly honour and gain, but rather shame and ill-treatment. Ever since
he had taken the path of his calling, he had not drawn timidly back from
the sufferings with which it was connected, but had rather cheerfully
taken them upon him. V.6 "I offered my back to smiters, and my cheeks to
them that pluck off the hair; I hid not my face from shame and
spitting." He offered his back to such as smote it, his cheeks to such
as plucked out the hair of his beard (mârat as in [Neh
13:25](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#025)). He did not hide his face, to
cover it up from actual insults, or from being spit upon (on kelimmōth
with rōq, smiting on the cheek, κολαφίζειν, strokes with rods, ῥαπίζειν,
blows upon the head, τύπτειν εἰς τὴν κεφαλήν with ἐμπτύειν, compare [Mat
26:67](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#067); [Mat
27:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#030); [Joh
18:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#022)). The way of his calling leads
through a shameful condition of humiliation. What was typified in Job
(see [Isa 30:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#010); [Isa
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#006)), and prefigured typically and
prophetically in the Psalms of David (see [Psa
22:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#007); [Psa
69:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#008)), finds in him its perfect
antitypical fulfilment.

[Isaiah 50:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 50:7</span></span>

But no shame makes him faint-hearted; he trusts in Him who hath called
him, and looks to the end. "But the Lord Jehovah will help me; therefore
have I not suffered myself to be overcome by mockery: therefore did I
make my face like the flint, and knew that I should not be put to
shame." The ו introduces the thought with which his soul was filled
amidst all his sufferings. In נכלמתּי לא he affirms, that he did not
suffer himself to be inwardly overcome and overpowered by kelimmâh. The
consciousness of his high calling remained undisturbed; he was never
ashamed of that, nor did he turn away from it. The two על־כּן stand side
by side upon the same line. He made his face kachallâmı̄sh (from châlam,
related to gâlam in [Isa 49:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#021), with
the substantive termination ı̄sh: see Jeshurun, p. 229), i.e., he made it
as unfelling as a flint-stone to the attacks of his foes (cf., [Eze
3:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#008)). The lxx renders this ἔθηκα τὸ
πρόσωπον μου ὡς στερεὰν πέτραν; but ἐστήριξα τὸ πρός, which is the
rendering given to פני שׂים in [Jer
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#010), would have been just the proper
rendering here (see [Luk 9:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#051)). In
"holy hardness of endurance," as Stier says, he turned his face to his
antagonists, without being subdued or frightened away, and was well
assured that He whose cause he represented would never leave him in the
lurch.

[Isaiah 50:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 50:8</span></span>

In the midst of his continued sufferings he was still certain of
victory, feeling himself exalted above every human accusation, and
knowing that Jehovah would acknowledge him; whereas his opponents were
on the way to that destruction, the germ of which they already carried
with them. "He is near that justifieth me; who will contend with me?! We
will draw near together! Who is my adversary in judgment?! Let him draw
near to me! Behold, the Lord Jehovah will help me; who is he that could
condemn me?! Behold, they all shall fall to pieces like a garment; the
moth shall eat them up." הצדּיו and הרשׁיע are forensic antitheses: the
former signifies to set one forth, both practically and judicially, as
righteous ([Sa2 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#004); [Psa
82:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#003)); the latter as guilty, רשׁע
([Deu 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#001); [Psa
109:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#007)). נעמדה, which has lost the
principal tone on account of the following יחד (יּהד), has munach
instead of metheg in the antepenultimate. Ba‛al mishpâtı̄ means, "he who
has a judicial cause of lawsuit against me," just as in Roman law the
dominus litis is distinguished from the procurator, i.e., from the
person who represents him in court (syn. ba‛al debhârı̄m, [Exo
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#014), and 'ı̄sh rı̄bhı̄ in [Job
31:35](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#035); compare [Isa
41:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#011)). מי־הוּא are connected, and
form an emphatic τίς, [Rom 8:34](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#034) (Ewald
325, a). "All of them" (kullâm): this refers to all who are hostile to
him. They fall to pieces like a worn-out garment, and fall a prey to the
moth which they already carry within them - a figure which we meet with
again in [Isa 51:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#008) (cf., [Job
13:28](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#028); [Hos
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#012)), and one which, although
apparently insignificant, is yet really a terrible one, inasmuch as it
points to a power of destruction working imperceptibly and slowly, but
yet effecting the destruction of the object selected with all the
greater certainty.

[Isaiah 50:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 50:10</span></span>

Thus far we have the words of the servant. The prophecy opened with
words of Jehovah ([Isa 50:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#001)), and
with such words it closes, as we may see from the expression, "this
shall ye have at my hand," in [Isa
50:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#011). The first word of Jehovah is
addressed to those who fear Him, and hearken to the voice of His
servant. [Isa 50:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#010)"Who among you is
fearing Jehovah, hearkening to the voice of His servant? He that walketh
in darkness, and without a ray of light, let him trust in the name of
Jehovah, and stay himself upon his God." The question is asked for the
purpose of showing to any one who could reply, "I am one, or wish to be
such an one," what his duty and his privileges are. In the midst of the
apparent hopelessness of his situation (chăshēkhı̄m the accusative of the
object, and plural to chăshēkhâh, [Isa
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#022)), and of his consequent
despondency of mind, he is to trust in the name of Jehovah, that firmest
and surest of all grounds of trust, and to stay himself upon his God,
who cannot forsake or deceive him. He is to believe ([Isa
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#009); [Isa
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#016); [Hab
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#004)) in God and the word of salvation,
for בטח and נשׁען are terms applied to that fiducia fidei which is the
essence of faith. The second word of Jehovah is addressed to the
despisers of His word, of which His servant is the bearer. [Isa
50:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#011) "Behold, all ye that kindle
fire, that equip yourselves with burning darts, away into the glow of
your fire, and into the burning darts that ye have kindled! This comes
to you from my hand; ye shall lie down in sorrow." The fire is not the
fire of divine wrath ([Jer 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#004)), but
the fire of wickedness (rish‛âh, [Isa
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#017)), more especially that hellish
fire with which an evil tongue is set on fire ([Jam
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#006)); for the zı̄qōth (equivalent to
ziqqōth, from zēq = zinq, from zânaq, to spring, to let fly, Syr. to
shoot or hurl), i.e., shots, and indeed burning arrows ([Psa
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#014)), are figurative, and stand for
the blasphemies and anathemas which they cast at the servant of Jehovah.
It is quite unnecessary to read מאירי instead of מאזּרי, as Hitzig,
Ewald, and Knobel propose, or even, contrary to all usage of speech,
מאורי. The former is the more pictorial: they gird burning darts,
accingunt malleolos, i.e., they equip or arm themselves with them for
the purpose of attack ([Isa 45:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#005)). But
the destruction which they prepare for the servant of Jehovah becomes
their own. They themselves have to go into the midst of the burning fire
and the burning darts, that they have set on fire. The hand of Jehovah
suddenly inverts the position; the fire of wrath becomes the fire of
divine judgment, and this fire becomes their bed of torment. The lxx has
it correctly, ἐν λύπῃ κοιμηθήσεσθε. The Lamed indicates the situation
(Ewald, 217, d). תּשׁכּבוּן with the tone upon the last syllable gives a
dictatorial conclusion. It has a terrible sound, but still more terrible
(apart from the future state) is the historical fulfilment that presents
itself to the eye.
