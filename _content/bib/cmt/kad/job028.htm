<p>  1  For there is a mine for the silver,
<p>And a place for gold which they fine.
<p>  2  Iron is taken out of the dust,
<p>And he poureth forth stone as copper.
<p>  3  He hath made an end of darkness,
<p>And he searcheth all extremities
<p>For the stone of darkness and of the shadow of death.
<p>  4  He breaketh away a shaft from those who tarry above:
<p>There, forgotten by every foot,
<p>They hang and swing far from men.
<p>(Note: Among the expositors of this and the two following strophes, are two acquainted with mining: The director of mines, von Veltheim, whose observations J. D. Michaelis has contributed in the Orient. u. exeg. Bibliothek, xxiii. 7-17; and the inspector of mines, Rudolf Nasse, in Studien und Krit. 1863, 105-111. Umbreit's Commentary contains some observations by von Leonhard; he understands <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#004">Job 28:4</A> as referring to the descent upon a cross bar attached to a rope, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#005">Job 28:5</A> of the lighting up by burning poles, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#006">Job 28:6</A> of the lapis lazuli, and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#010">Job 28:10</A> of the earliest mode of "letting off the water.")
<p>According to the most natural connection demonstrated by us, Job desires to show that the final lot of the rich man is well merited, because the treasures which he made the object of his avarice and pride, though ever so costly, are still earthy in their nature and origin. Therefore he begins with the most precious metals, with silver, which has the precedence in reference to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#016">Job 27:16</A>, and with gold. &#1502;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488; without any secondary notion of fulness (Schultens) signifies the issuing place, i.e., the place fro which anything naturally comes forth (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#027">Job 38:27</A>), or whence it is obtained (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#028">Kg1 10:28</A>); here in the latter sense of the place where a mineral is found, or the mine, as the parall. &#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1501;, the place where the gold comes forth, therefore a gold mine. According to the accentuation (Rebia mugrasch, Mercha, Silluk), it is not to be translated: and a place for the gold where they refine it; but: a place for the gold which they refine. &#1494;&#1511;&#1511;, to strain, filter, is the technical expression for purifying the precious metals from the rock that is mingled with them (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#003">Mal 3:3</A>) by washing. The pure gold or silver thus obtained is called &#1502;&#1494;&#1511;&#1468;&#1511; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#007">Psa 12:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#018">Ch1 28:18</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#004">Ch1 29:4</A>). Diodorus, in his description of mining in Upper Egypt (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#011">Job 3:11</A>), after having described the operation of crushing the stone to small fragments, 
<p>(Note: Vid., the whole account skilfully translated in Klemm's Allgem. Cultur-Geschichte, v. 503f.)
<p>proceeds: "Then artificers take the crushed stone and lay it on a broad table, which is slightly inclined, and pour water over it; this washes away the earthy parts, and the gold remains on the slab. This operation is repeated several times, the mass being at first gently rubbed with the hand; then they press it lightly with thin sponges, and thus draw off all that is earthy and light, so that the gold dust is left quite clean. And, finally, other artificers take it up in a mass, shake it in an earthen crucible, and add a proportionate quantity of lead, grains of salt, and a little tin and barley bran; they then place a close-fitting cover over the crucible, and cement it with clay, and leave it five days and nights to seethe constantly in the furnace. After this they allow it to cool, and then finding nothing of the flux in the crucible, they take the pure gold out with only slight diminution." The expression for the first of these operations, the separation of the gold from the quartz by washing, or indeed sifting (straining, Seihen), is &#1494;&#1511;&#1511;; and for the other, the separation by exposure to heat, or smelting, is &#1510;&#1512;&#1507;.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#002">Job 28:2</A>
<p>From the mention of silver and gold, the description passes on to iron and ore (copper, cuprum = aes Cyprium). Iron is called &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1494;&#1500;, not with the noun-ending el like &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1502;&#1500; (thus Ges., Olsh., and others), but probably expanded from &#1489;&#1468;&#1494;&#1468;&#1500; (Frst), like &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1496; from &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1496; = &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1496;, &#1505;&#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512; from &#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;, &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; from &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1501;, since, as Pliny testifies, the name of basalt (iron-marble) and iron are related, 
<p>(Note: Hist. nat. xxxvi. 7, 11: Invenit eadem Aegyptus in Aethiopia quem vocant basalten (basaniten) ferrei coloris atque duritiae, unde et nomen ei dedit (vid., von Raumer, Palstina, S. 96, 4th edition). Neither Seetzen nor Wetzstein has found proper iron-ore in Basan. Basalt is all the more prevalent there, from which Basan may have its name. For there is no special Semitic word for basalt; Botchor calls in the aid of Arab. nw&#8219; rucha&#770;m 'swd, "a kind of black marble;" but, as Wetzstein informs me, this is only a translation of the phrase of a French dictionary which he had, for the general name of basalt, at least in Syria, is hagar aswad (black stone). Iron is called had&#305;&#770;d in Arabic (literally a pointed instrument, with the not infrequent transference of the name of the tool to the material from which it is made). &#1489;&#1512;&#1494;&#1500; (&#1508;&#1512;&#1494;&#1500;) is known in Arabic only in the form firzil, as the name for iron chains and great smith's shears for cutting iron; but it is remarkable that in Berber, which is related to Egyptian, iron is called even in the present day wazza&#770;l; vid., Lex. geographicum ed. Juynboll, tom. iv. (adnot.) p. 64, l. 16, and Marcel, Vocabulaire Franaisarabe de dialectes vulgaires africains, p. 249: "Fer Arab. h&#803;d&#305;&#770;d, hadyd (en berbere Arab. wzza&#770;l, ouezza&#770;l; Arab. 'wzza&#770;l, o&#770;ouzza&#770;l)." The Coptic name of iron is benipi (dialect. penipe), according to Prof. Lauth perhaps, as also baro&#770;t, ore, connected with ba, the hieroglyph name of a very hard mineral; the black basalt of an obelisk in the British Museum is called bechenen in the inscription. If it really be so, that iron and basalt are homonymous in Semitic, the reason could only be sought for in the dark iron-black colour of basalt, in its hardness, and perhaps also its weight (which, however, is only about half the specific gravity of pure iron), not in the magnetic iron, which has only in more modern times been discovered to be a substantial component part of basalt, the grains of which cannot be seen by the naked eye, and are only detected with the magnetic needle, or by chemical analysis.)
<p>and copper is called &#1504;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;, for which the book of Job (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#024">Job 20:24</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#002">Job 28:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#018">Job 40:18</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#019">Job 41:19</A>; comp. even <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#019">Lev 26:19</A>) always has &#1504;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; (aereum = aes, Arab. nuha&#770;s). Of the iron it is said that it is procured from the &#1506;&#1508;&#1512;, by which the bowels of the earth are meant here, as the surface of the earth in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#025">Job 41:25</A>; and of copper it is said that they pour out the stone into copper (vid., Ges. 139, 2), i.e., smelt copper from it: &#1497;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511; as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#006">Job 29:6</A>, fundit, here with a subj. of the most general kind: one pours; on the contrary, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#015">Job 41:15</A>. partic. of &#1497;&#1510;&#1511;. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#003">Job 28:3</A> distinctly shows that it is the bowels of the earth from which these metals are obtained: he (man) has made an end of the darkness, since he turns out and lights up the lightless interior of the earth; and &#1500;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1497;&#1514;, to every extremity, i.e., to the remotest depths, he searches out the stone of deep darkness and of the shadow of death, i.e., hidden in the deepest darkness, far beneath the surface of the earth (vid., on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#022">Job 10:22</A>; and comp. Pliny, h. n. xxxiii. proaem. of mining: imus in viscera ejus [terrae] et in sede Manium opes quaerimus). Most expositors (Hirz., Ew., Hahn, Schlottm., and others) take &#1500;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1500;&#1497;&#1514; adverbially, "to the utmost" or "most closely," but vid., on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#010">Job 26:10</A>; &#1500;&#1514;&#1499;&#1500;&#1497;&#1514; might be used thus adverbially, but &#1500;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1499;&#1500;&#1497;&#1514; is to be explained according to &#1500;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1512;&#1493;&#1495;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#010">Eze 5:10</A> (to all the winds).
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#004">Job 28:4</A>
<p>Job now describes the operation of mining more minutely; and it is worthy of observation that the last-mentioned metal, with which the description is closely connected, is copper. &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;, which signifies elsewhere a valley, the bed of a river, and the river itself, like the Arab. wa&#770;din (not from &#1504;&#1495;&#1500; = &#1504;&#1492;&#1500;, to flow on, as Ges. Thes. and Frst, but from &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;, root &#1495;&#1500; to hollow, whence &#1504;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492; = &#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;, a flute, as being a hollowed musical instrument), signifies here the excavation made in the earth, and in fact, as what follows shows, in a perpendicular direction, therefore the shaft. Nasse contends for the signification "valley," by which one might very well conceive of "the working of a surface vein:" "By this mode of working, a small shaft is made in the vein (consequently in a perpendicular direction), and the ore is worked from both sides at once. At a short distance from the first shaft a second is formed, and worked in the same way. Since thus the work progresses lengthwise, a cutting becomes formed in the mountain which may well be compared to a deep valley, if, as is generally the case where the stone is firm and the ways are almost perpendicular, the space that is hewn out remains open (that is, not broken in or filled in)." But if &#1504;&#1495;&#1500; everywhere else denotes a valley with its watercourse, it has not necessarily a like signification in mining technology. It signifies, perhaps not without reference to its usual signification, the shafts open above and surrounded by walls of rock (in distinction from the more or less horizontal galleries or pit-ways, as they were cut through the excavated rocks in the gold mines of Upper Egypt, often so crooked that, as Diodorus relates, the miners, provided with lights on their forehead, were always obliged to vary the posture of the body (according to the windings of the galleries); and &#1502;&#1506;&#1501;&#1470;&#1490;&#1468;&#1512;, away from him who remains above, shows that one is to imagine these shafts as being of considerable depth,; but what follows even more clearly indicates this: there forgotten (&#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;&#1501; with the demonstrative art. as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#005">Job 26:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#031">Psa 18:31</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#011">Psa 19:11</A>, Ges. 109 ad init.) of (every) foot (that walks above), they hang (comp. Rabb. &#1502;&#1491;&#1500;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500;, pendulus)
<p>(Note: Vid., Luzzatto on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#005">Isa 18:5</A>, where &#1494;&#1500;&#1494;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, of the trembling and quivering twigs, is correctly traced to &#1494;&#1500;&#1500; = &#1491;&#1500;&#1500; = &#1494;&#1500;&#1500;; on the other hand, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#019">Isa 14:19</A>, &#1488;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1470;&#1489;&#1493;&#1512; is wrongly translated fundo della fossa, by comparison with <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#003">Job 28:3</A>. &#1488;&#1489;&#1503; does not signify a shaft, still less the lowest shaft, but stone (rock).)
<p>far from men, hang and swing or are suspended: comp. Pliny, h. n. xxxiii. 4, 21, according to Sillig's text: is qui caedit funibus pendet, ut procul intuenti species no ferarum quidem sed alitum fiat. Pendentes majori ex parte librant et linias itineri praeducunt. &#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500; has here the primary signification proper also to the Arab. dll, deorsum pendeere; and &#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506; is related to &#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;, as nuere, &#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, to nutare. The &#1502;&#1504;&#1497; of &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1470;&#1512;&#1490;&#1500;, taken strictly, does not correspond to the Greek &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;, neither does it form an adverbial secondary definition standing by itself: far away from the foot; but it is to be understood as &#1502;&#1503; is also used elsewhere after &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1495;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#021">Deu 31:21</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#013">Psa 31:13</A> : forgotten out of the mouth, out of the heart; here: forgotten away from the foot, so that this advances without knowing that there is a man beneath; therefore: totally vanished from the remembrance of those who pass by above. &#1502;&#1488;&#1504;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473; is not to be connected with &#1504;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; (Hahn, Schlottm.), but with &#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, for Munach is the representative of Rebia mugrasch, according to Psalter, ii. 503, 2; and &#1491;&#1500;&#1493; is regularly Milel, whereas <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#014">Isa 38:14</A> is Milra without any evident reason. The accentuation here follows no fixed law with equally regulated exceptions (vid., Olsh. 233, c).
<p>Moreover, the perception that <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#004">Job 28:4</A> speaks of the shaft of the mine, and the descent of the miners by a rope, is due to modern exegesis; even Schultens, who here exclaims: Cimmeriae tenebrae, quas me exsuperaturum vix sperare ausim, perceived the right thing, but only imperfectly as yet. By &#1504;&#1495;&#1500; he understands the course or vein of the metal, where it is embedded; and, since he understands &#1490;&#1512; after the Arab. &#8219;garr, foot of the mountain, he translates: rumpit (homo) alveum de pede montis. Rosenm., on the other hand, correctly translates: canalem deorsum actum ex loco quo versatur homo. Schlottm. understands by gr the miner himself dwelling as a stranger in his loneliness; and if we imagine to ourselves the mining districts of the peninsula of Sinai, we might certainly at once conceive the miners' dwellings themselves which are found in the neighbourhood of the shaft in connection with &#1502;&#1506;&#1501;&#1470;&#1490;&#1512;. But in and for itself &#1490;&#1512; signifies only those settled (above), without the secondary idea of strangers.

<p>  5  The earth-from it cometh forth bread,
<p>And beneath it is turned up like fire.

<p>  7  The way, that no bird of prey knoweth,
<p>And the eye of the hawk hath not gazed at,
<p>  8  Which the proud beast of prey hath not trodden,
<p>Over which the lion hath not walked.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#005">Job 28:5</A> is not to be construed as Rosenm.: ad terram quod attinet, ex qua egreditur panis, quod subtus est subvertitur quasi igne; nor with Schlottm.: (they swing) in the earth, out of which comes bread, which beneath one turns about with fire; for <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#005">Job 28:5</A> is not formed so that the Waw of &#1493;&#1514;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1492; could be Waw apod., and &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; cannot signify "in the interior of the earth" as locativus; on the contrary, it stands in opposition to &#1514;&#1495;&#1514;&#1497;&#1492;, that which is beneath the earth, as denoting the surface of the earth (the proper name of which is &#1488;&#1491;&#1502;&#1492;, from the root &#1491;&#1501;, with the primary notion of a flat covering). They are two grammatically independent predicates, the first of which is only the foil of the other: the earth, out of it cometh forth bread (&#1500;&#1495;&#1501; as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#014">Psa 104:14</A>), and beneath it (the surface of the earth) = that which lies beneath it (&#1493;&#1514;&#1495;&#1514;&#1497;&#1492; only virtually a subj. in the sense of &#1493;&#1514;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1492;, since &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; occurs only as a preposition), is turned about (comp. the construction of the sing. of the verb with the plur. subj. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#015">Job 30:15</A>) as (by) fire Instar ignis, scil. subvertentis); i.e., the earth above furnishes nourishment to man, but that not satisfying him, he also digs out its inward parts (comp. Pliny, h. n. xxxiii. proaem.: in sede Manium opes quaerimus, tanquam parum benigna fertilique quaqua calcatur), since this is turned or tossed about (comp. &#1502;&#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1499;&#1492;, the special word for the overthrow of Sodom by fire) by mining work, as when fire breaks out in a house, or even as when a volcanic fire rumbles within a mountain (Castalio: agunt per magna spatia cuniculos et terram subeunt non secus ac ignis facet ut in Aetna et Vesuvio). The reading &#1489;&#1502;&#1493; (Schlottm.) instead of &#1499;&#1502;&#1493; is natural, since fire is really used to blast the rock, and to separate the ore from the stone; but, with the exception of Jerome, who has arbitrarily altered the text (terra, de qua oriebatur panis in loco suo, igni subversa est), all the old translations reproduce &#1499;&#1502;&#1493;, which even Nasse, in opposition to von Veltheim, thinks suitable: Man's restless search, which rummages everything through, is compared to the unrestrainable ravaging fire.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#006">Job 28:6</A> also consists of two grammatically independent assertions: the place (bed) of the sapphire is its rock. Must we refer &#1500;&#1493; to &#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;, and translate: "and it contains fine dust of gold" (Hirz., Umbr., Stick., Nasse)? It is possible, for Theophrastus (p. 692, ed. Schneider) says of the sapphire it is &#x3c9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1; &#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, as it were covered with gold dust or grains of gold; and Pliny, h. n. xxxvii. 9, 38f.: Inest ei (cyano) aliquando et aureus pulvis qualis in sapphiris, in iis enim aurum punctis conlucet, which nevertheless does not hold good of the proper sapphire, but of the azure stone (lapis lazuli) which is confounded with it, a variegated species of which, with gold, or rather with iron pyrites glittering like gold, is specially valued.
<p>(Note: Comp. Quenstedt, Handbuch der Mineralogie (1863), S. 355 and 302.)
<p>But Schultens rightly observes: vix cerdiderim, illum auratilem pulvisculum sapphiri peculiari mentione dignum; and Schlottm.: such a collateral definition to &#1505;&#1508;&#1497;&#1512;, expressed in a special clause (not a relative one), has something awkward about it. On the other hand, &#1506;&#1508;&#1512;&#1514; &#1494;&#1492;&#1489; is a perfectly suitable appellation of gold ore. "The earth, which is in itself black," says Diodorus in the passage quoted before, "is interspersed with veins of marble, which is of such pre-eminent whiteness, that its brilliance surpasses everything that glitters, and from it the overseers of the mine prepare gold with a large number of workmen." And further on, of the heating of this gold ore he says: "the hardest auriferous earth they burn thoroughly in a large fire; thus they make it soft, so that it can be worked by the hand." &#1506;&#1508;&#1512;&#1514; &#1494;&#1492;&#1489; is a still more suitable expression for such auriferous earth and ore than for the nuggets of &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; (i.e., unsmelted) of the size of a chestnut, which, according to Diodorus, ii. 50, are obtained in mines in Arabia (&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;). But it is inadmissible to refer &#1500;&#1493; to man, for the clause would then require to be translated: and gold ore is to him = he has, while it is the rather intended to be said that the interior of the earth has gold ore. &#1500;&#1493; is therefore, with Hahn and Schlottm., to be referred to &#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1501;: and this place of the sapphire, it contains gold. The poet might have written &#1500;&#1492;&#1468; but &#1500;&#1493; implies that where the sapphire is found, gold is also found. The following &#1504;&#1514;&#1497;&#1489; (with Dech), together with the following relative clause, is connected with &#1488;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;, or even with &#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1501;, which through <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#006">Job 28:6</A> is become the chief subj.: the place of the sapphire and of the gold is the rock of the bowels of the earth, - a way, which, etc., i.e., such a place is the interior of the earth, accessible to no living being of the earth's surface except to man alone. The sight of the bird of prey, the &#1506;&#1497;&#1496;, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, and of the &#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, i.e., the hawk or kite, reaches from above far and wide beneath;
<p>(Note: The &#1488;&#1497;&#1492; - says the Talmud b. Chullin, 63b - is in Babylon, and seeth a carcase in the land of Israel.)
<p>the sons of pride, &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1509; (also Talmud. arrogance, ferocia, from &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1509; = Arab. s&#780;achas&#803;a, to raise one's self, not: fatness, as Meier, after Arab. s&#780;achus&#803;a, to be fat, thick), i.e., the beasts of prey, especially the lion, &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1500; (vid., on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#010">Job 4:10</A>, from &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1500;, Arab. sh&#803;l, to roar, Arab. of the ass, comp. the Lat. rudere used both of the lion and of the ass), seek the most secret retreat, and shun no danger; but the way by which man presses forward to the treasures of the earth is imperceptible and inaccessible to them.

<p>  9  He layeth his hand upon the pebbles;
<p>He turneth up the mountains from the root.
<p>10  He cutteth canals through the rocks;
<p>And his eye seeth all kinds of precious things.
<p>11  That they may not leak, he dammeth up rivers;
<p>And that which is hidden he bringeth to light.
<p>12  But wisdom, whence is it obtained?
<p>And where is the place of understanding?
<p>Beneath, whither no other being of the upper world penetrates, man puts his hand upon the quartz or rock. &#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; (perhaps from &#1495;&#1500;&#1501;, to be strong, firm: Arabic, with the reduplication resolved, chalnubu&#770;s, like &#1506;&#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, Arab. &#8219;ancabu&#770;th, vid., Jesurun, p. 229) signifies here the quartz, and in general the hard stone; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; &#1497;&#1491; &#1489;&#1468; something like our "to take in hand" of an undertaking requiring strong determination and courage, which here consists in blasting and clearing away the rock that contains no ore, as Pliny, h. n. xxxiii. 4, 21, describes it: Occursant ... silices; hos igne et aceto rumpunt, saepius vero, quoniam id cuniculos vapore et fumo strangulat, caedunt fractariis CL libras ferri habentibus egeruntque umeris noctibus ac diebus per tenebras proxumis tradentes; lucem novissimi cernunt. Further: he (man, devoted to mining) overturns (subvertit according to the primary signification of &#1492;&#1508;&#1498;, Arab. 'fk, 'ft, to turn, twist) mountains from the roots. The accentuation &#1492;&#1508;&#1498; with Rebia mugrasch, &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; with Mercha, is false; it is, according to Codd. and old editions, to be accented &#1492;&#1508;&#1498; with Tarcha, &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; with Munach, and to be translated accordingly: subvertit a radice montes (for Munach is the transformation of a Rebia mugrasch), not a radice montium. Blasting in mining which lays bare the roots (the lowest parts) of the mountains is intended, the conclusion of which - the signal for the flight of the workmen, and the effective crash - is so graphically described by Pliny in the passage cited above: Peracto opere cervices fornicum ab ultumo cadunt; dat signum ruina eamque solus intellegit in cacumine ejus montis vigil. Hic voce, nutu evocari jubet operas pariterque ipse devolat. Mons fractus cadit ab sese longe fragore qui concipi humana mente non possit eque efflatu incredibili spectant victores ruinam naturae.
<p>The meaning of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#010">Job 28:10</A> depends upon the signification of the &#1497;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;. It is certainly the most natural that it should signify canals. The word is Egyptian; aur in the language of the hieroglyphs signifies a river, and especially the Nile; wherefore at the close of the Laterculus of Eratosthenes the name of the king, &#x3a6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834; (&#x3a6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;), is explained by &#x3b7;&#787;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x39d;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;. If water-canals are intended, they may be either such as go in or come away. In the first case it may mean water let in like a cataract over the ruins of the blasted auriferous rock, the corrugi of Pliny: Alius par labor ac vel majoris impendi: flumina ad lavandam hanc ruinam jugis montium obiter duxere a centesimo plerumque lapide; corrugos vocant, a corrivatione credo; mille et hic labores. But &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1506; is not a suitable word for such an extensive and powerful flooding with water for the purpose of washing the gold. It suits far better to understand the expression of galleries or ways cut horizontally in the rock to carry the water away. Thus von Veltheim explains it: "The miner makes ways through the hard rock into his section in which the perpendicular shaft terminates, guides the water which is found in abundance at that depth through it [i.e., the water as the bottom of the pit that hinders the progress of the work], and is able [thus <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#010">Job 28:10</A> naturally is connected with what precedes] to judge of the ore and fragments that are at the bottom, and bring them to the light. This mode of mining by constantly forming one gallery under the other [so that a new gallery is made under the pit that is worked out by extending the shaft, and also freeing this from water by making another outlet below the previous one] is the oldest of all, of which anything certain is known in the history of mining, and the most natural in the days when they had no notion of hydraulics." This explanation is far more satisfactory than that of Herm. Sam. Reimarus, of the "Wolfenbtteler Fragmente" (in his edition of the Neue Erkl. des B. Hiob, by John Ad. Hoffmann, 1734, iv. S. 772): "He breaks open watercourses in the rocks. What the miners call coming upon water, is when they break into a fissure from which strong streams of water gush forth. The miner not only knows how to turn such water to good account, but it is also a sign that there are rich veins of ore near at hand, as there is the most water by these courses and fissures. Hence follows: and then his eye sees all kinds of precious things." But there is no ground for saying that water indicates rich veins of ore, and &#1489;&#1511;&#1506; is much more appropriate to describe the designed formation of courses to carry off the water than an accidental discovery of water in course of the work; moreover, &#1497;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; is as appropriate to the former as it is inappropriate to the latter explanation, for it signifies elsewhere the arms of the Nile, into which the Nile is artificially divided; and therefore it may easily be transferred to the horizontal canals of the mine cut through the hard rock (or through the upper earth). Nevertheless, although the water plays an important part in mining operations, by giving rise to the greatest difficulties, as it frequently happens that a pit is deluged with water, and must be abandoned because no one can get down to it: it is improbable that <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#010">Job 28:10</A> as well as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#011">Job 28:11</A> refers to this; we therefore prefer to understand &#1497;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; as meaning the (horizontal) courses (galleries or drifts) in which the ore is dug, - a rendering which is all the more possible, since, on the one hand, in Coptic jaro (Sahidic jero) signifies the Nile of Egypt (phiaro ente che&#770;mi); on the other, ior (eioor) signifies a ditch, &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3be; (comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#021">Isa 33:21</A>, &#1497;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, lxx &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;), vid., Ges. Thes. Thus also <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#010">Job 28:10</A> is consistently connected with what precedes, since by cutting these cuniculi the courses of the ore (veins), and any precious stones that may also be embedded there, are laid bare.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#011">Job 28:11</A>
<p>Contrary to the correct indication of the accentuation, Hahn translates: he stops up the droppings of the watercourses; &#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1497; has Dech, and is therefore not to be connected with what follows as a genitive. But Reimarus' translation: from the drops he connects the streams, is inadmissible. "The trickling water," he observes, "is carefully caught in channels by the miners for use, and is thus brought together from several parts of the reservoir and the water-wheel. What Pliny calls corrugus, corrivatio,." On the contrary, Schlottm. remarks that &#1495;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473; cannot signify such a connection, i.e., gathering together of watercourses; it occurs elsewhere only of hunting, i.e., binding up wounds. Nevertheless, although &#1495;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473; cannot directly signify "to collect," the signification coercere (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#017">Job 34:17</A>), which is not far from this idea, - as is evident from the Arab. h&#803;ibs (h&#803;abs), a dam or sluice for collecting water, and Arab. mah&#803;bas 'l-ma&#770;', a reservoir, cistern, - is easily transferable to water, in the sense of binding = catching up and accumulating. But it is contrary to the form of the expression that &#1502;&#1489;&#1499;&#1497;, with this use of &#1495;&#1489;&#1513;, should denote the materia ex qua, and that &#1504;&#1492;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; should be referred to the miry ditches in which "the crushed ore is washed, for the purpose of separating the good from the worthless." On the contrary, from the form of the expression, it is to be translated: a fletu (not e fletu) flumina obligat, whether it be that a fletu is equivalent to ne flent s. stillent (Simeon Duran: &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1494;&#1500;&#1493;), or obligat equivalent to cohibet (Ralbag: &#1502;&#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;). Thus von Veltheim explains the passage, since he here, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#010">Job 28:10</A>, understands the channels for carrying off the water. "The miner covers the bottom with mire, and fills up the crevices so exactly i.e., he besmears it, where the channel is broken through, with some water-tight substance, e.g., clay, that it may entirely carry off the water that is caught by it out of the pit in which the shaft terminates, and not let it fall through the fissures crevices to the company of miners below to the vein that lies farther down; then the miner can descend still deeper since the water runs outwards and does not soak through, and bring forth the ore that lies below the channel." This explanation overlooks the fact that &#1497;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; is used in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#010">Job 28:10</A>, whereas <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#011">Job 28:11</A> has &#1504;&#1492;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;. It is not probable that these are only interchangeable expressions for the channels that carry off the water. &#1497;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; is an appropriate expression for it, but not &#1504;&#1492;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, which as appropriately describes the conflux of water in the mine itself.
<p>The meaning of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#011">Job 28:11</A> is, that he (the miner) binds or stops the watercourses which his working out of the pit has interfered with and injured, so that they may not leak, i.e., that they may not in the least ooze through, whether by building up a wall or by collecting the water that streams forth in reservoirs (Arab. mahbas) or in the channels which carry it outwards, - all these modes of draining off the water may be included in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#011">Job 28:11</A>, only the channel itself is not, with von Veltheim, to be understood by &#1504;&#1492;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, but the concourse of the water which, in one way or the other, is rendered harmless to the pit-work, so that he (the miner), as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#011">Job 28:11</A> says, can bring to light (&#1488;&#1493;&#1512; = &#1500;&#1488;&#1493;&#1512;) whatever precious things the bowels of the earth conceals (&#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1502;&#1492;&#1468;, according to Kimchi and others, with euphonic Mappik, as according to the Masora &#1499;&#1489;&#1499;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;&#1468; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#004">Isa 28:4</A>, &#1490;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1492;&#1468; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#024">Eze 22:24</A>, and also &#1493;&#1490;&#1500;&#1492;&#1468; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#002">Zac 4:2</A>, only &#1500;&#1514;&#1508;&#1488;&#1512;&#1514; &#1492;&#1511;&#1512;&#1497;&#1488;&#1492; &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1500;&#1499;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1497;, i.e., they have Mappik only for euphony, not as the expression of the suff.).

<p>With the question in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#012">Job 28:12</A> the description of mining attains the end designed: man can search after and find out silver, gold, and others metals and precious stones, by making the foundations of the earth accessible to him; but wisdom, whence shall be obtain it, and which (&#1493;&#1488;&#1497;&#1470;&#1494;&#1492;, according to another reading &#1493;&#1488;&#1497;&#1494;&#1492;) is the place of understanding? &#1492;&#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1492; has the art. to give prominence to its transcendency over the other attainable things. &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1492; is the principal name, and &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; interchanges with it, as &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#001">Pro 8:1</A>, and other synonyms in which the Chokma literature abounds elsewhere in Prov 1-9. &#1489;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; is properly the faculty of seeing through that which is distinguishable, consisting of the possession of the right criteria; &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1492;, however, is the perception, in general, of things in their true nature and their final causes.

<p>13  A mortal knoweth not its price,
<p>And it is not found in the land of the living.
<p>14  The abyss saith: It is not in me,
<p>And the sea saith: It is not with me.
<p>15  Pure gold cannot be given for it,
<p>And silver cannot be weighed as its price;
<p>16  And it is not outweighed with fine gold of Ophir,
<p>With the precious onyx and the sapphire.
<p>It is self-evident that wisdom is found nowhere directly present and within a limited space, as at the bottom of the sea, and cannot be obtained by a direct exchange by means of earthly treasures. It is, moreover, not this self-evident fact that is denied here; but the meaning is, that even if a man should search in every direction through the land of the living, i.e., (as e.g., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#007">Psa 52:7</A>) the world - if he should search through the &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1501;, i.e., the subterranean waters that feed the visible waters (vid., Gen. 39:25) - if he should search through the sea, the largest bounded expanse of this water that wells up from beneath - yea, even if he would offer all riches and precious things to put himself in possession of the means and instruments for the acquirement of wisdom, - wisdom, i.e., the profoundest perception of the nature of things, would still be beyond him, and unattainable. &#1506;&#1512;&#1498;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#013">Job 28:13</A>, an equivalent (from &#1506;&#1512;&#1498;, to range beside, to place at the side of), interchanges with &#1502;&#1495;&#1497;&#1512; (from &#1502;&#1495;&#1512;, cogn. &#1502;&#1492;&#1512;, &#1502;&#1499;&#1512;, mercari). &#1505;&#1490;&#1493;&#1512; is &#1494;&#1492;&#1489; &#1505;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#020">Kg1 6:20</A> and freq., which hardly signifies gold shut up = carefully preserved, rather: closed = compressed, unmixed; Targ. &#1491;&#1468;&#1492;&#1489; &#1505;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503;, aurum colatum (purgatum). Ewald compares Arab. sajara, to seethe, heat; therefore: heated, gained by smelting. On the other hand, &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1501; from &#1499;&#1514;&#1501;, Arab. ktm, occulere, seems originally to denote that which is precious, then precious gold in particular, lxx &#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#837; &#x3a9;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;, Cod.

Arab. musahham, striped (Mich.), would be more appropriate, since the onyx is marked through by white veins; but this is a denom. from sahm, a dart, prop. darted, and is therefore wide of the mark. On the etymology of &#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;, vid., Jesurun, p. 61. Nevertheless both &#1513;&#1473;&#1492;&#1501; and &#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512; are perhaps foreign names, as the name of the emerald (vid., ib. p. 108), which is Indian (Sanskr. marakata, or even marakta); and, on the other hand, it is called in hieroglyph (determined by the stone) uot, the green stone (in Coptic p. auanne&#772;se, the green colour) (Lauth).
<p>The transcendent excellence of wisdom above the most precious earthly treasures, which the author of the introduction to the book of Proverbs briefly describes, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#014">Job 3:14</A>, is now drawn out in detail.

<p>17  Gold and glass are not equal to it,
<p>Nor is it exchanged for jewels of gold.
<p>18  Pearls and crystal are not to be mentioned,
<p>And the acquisition of wisdom is beyond corals.
<p>19  The topaz of Ethiopia is not equal to it,
<p>It is not outweighed by pure fine gold.
<p>20  Whence, then, cometh wisdom,
<p>And which is the place of understanding?
<p>Among the separate &#1495;&#1508;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#015">Pro 3:15</A>, which are here detailed, apart from &#1494;&#1492;&#1489;, glass has the transparent name &#1494;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1497;&#1514;, or, as it is pointed in Codd., in old editions, and by Kimchi, &#1494;&#1499;&#1493;&#1499;&#1497;&#1514;, with Cholem (in the dialects with &#1490; instead of )&#1499;. Symm. indeed translates crystal, and in fact the ancient languages have common names for glass and crystal; but the crystal is here called &#1494;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, which signifies prop., like the Arab. 'gibs, ice; &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; also signifies prop. ice, and this only in Homer, then crystal, exactly as the cognate &#1511;&#1512;&#1495; unites both significations in itself. The reason of this homonymy lies deeper than in the outward similarity, - the ancients really thought the crystal was a product of the cold; Pliny, xxxvii. 2, 9, says: non alibi certe reperitur quam ubi maxume hibernae nives rigent, glaciemque esse certum est, unde nomen Graeci dedere. The Targ. translates &#1490;&#1489;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; by &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, certainly in the sense of the Arabico-Persic bullu&#770;r (bulu&#770;r), which signifies crystal, or even glass, and moreover is the primary word for &#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, although the identical Sanskrit word, according to the laws of sound, vaidurja (Pali, velurija), is, according to the lexicons, a name of the lapis lazuli (Persic, lagurd). Of the two words &#1512;&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; and &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, the one appears to mean pearls and the other corals; the ancient appellations of these precious things which belong to the sea are also blended; the Persic merga&#770;n (Sanskr. mangara) unites the signification pearl and coral in itself. The root &#1508;&#1503;, Arab. fn, which has the primary notion of pushing, especially of vegetation (whence Arab. fann, a branch, shoot, prop. motion; French, jet), and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#007">Lam 4:7</A>, where snow and milk, as figures of whiteness (purity), are placed in contrast with &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; as a figure of redness, favour the signification corals for &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;. The Coptic be no&#770;ni, which signifies gemma, favours (so far as it may be compared) corals rather than pearls. And the fact that &#1512;&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#016">Eze 27:16</A>, appears as an Aramaean article of commerce in the market of Tyre, is more favourable to the signification pearls than corals; for the Babylonians sailed far into the Indian Ocean, and brought pearls from the fisheries of Bahrein, perhaps even from Ceylon, into the home markets (vid., Layard, New Discoveries, 536). The name is perhaps, from the Western Asiatic name of the pearl,

<p>mutilated and Hebraized.
<p>(Note: Two reasons for &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; = pearls (in favour of which Bochart compares the name of the pearl-oyster, &#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;) and &#1512;&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; = corals, which are maintained by Carey, are worthy of remark. (1.) That &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; does not signify corals, he infers from <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#007">Lam 4:7</A>, for the redness of corals cannot be a mark of bodily beauty; "but when I find that there are some pearls of a slightly reddish tinge, then I can understand and appreciate the comparison." (2.) That &#1512;&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; signifies corals, is shown by the origin of the word, which properly signifies ree&#770;m-(wild oxen) horns, which is favoured by a mention of Pliny, h. n. xiii. 51: (Tradidere) juncos quoque lapideos perquam similes veris per litora, et in alto quasdam arbusculas colore bubuli cornus ramosas et cacuminibus rubentes. Although Pliny there speaks of marine petrified plants of the Indian Ocean (not, at least in his sense, of corals), this hint of a possible derivation of &#1512;&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; is certainly surprising. But as to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#007">Lam 4:7</A>, this passage is to be understood according to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#010">Sol 5:10</A> (my friend is &#1510;&#1495; &#1493;&#1488;&#1491;&#1493;&#1501;). The white and red are intended to be conceived of as mixed and overlapping one another, as our Germ. popular poetry speaks of cheeks which "shine with milk and purple;" and as in Homer, Il. iv. 141-146, the colour of the beautifully formed limbs of Menelaus is represented by the figure (which appears hideous to us): &#x3c9;&#788;&#x3c2; &#x3b4; &#787; &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3c4; &#787; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b9; &#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;&#837; (ebony stained with purple).)
<p>The name of the &#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492; of Ethiopia appears to be derived from to'paz by transposition; Pliny says of the topaz, xxxvii. 8, 32, among other passages; Juba Topazum insulam in rubro mari a continenti stadiis CCC abesse dicit, nebulosam et ideo quaesitam saepius navigantibus; ex ea causa nomen accepisse: topazin enim Troglodytarum lingua significationem habere quaerendi. This topaz, however, which is said to be named after an island of the same name, the Isle of Serpents in Agatharchides and Diodorus, is, according to Pliny, yellowish green, and therefore distinct from the otherwise so-called topaz. To make a candid confession, we grope about everywhere in the dark here, and the ancient versions are not able to help us out of our difficulty.

<p>The poet lays everything under contribution to illustrate the thought, that the worth of wisdom exceeds the worth of the most valuable earthly thing; besides which, in &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498; &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1492; &#1502;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, "the acquisition or possession (from  &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498;, Arab. msk, to draw to one's self, to take hold of) of wisdom is above corals," there is an indication that, although not by the precious things of the earth, still in some way or other, wisdom can be possessed, so that consequently the question repeated at the end of the strophe will not remain unanswered. This is its meaning: now if wisdom is not to be found in any of the places named, and is not to be attained by any of the means mentioned, whence can man hope to attain it, and whither must he turn to find it? for its existence is certain, and it is an indisputable need of man that he should partake of it.

<p>21  It is veiled from the eyes of all living,
<p>And concealed from the fowls of heaven.
<p>22  Destruction and death say:
<p>With our ears we heard a report of it. - 
<p>23  Elohim understandeth the way to it,
<p>And He - He knoweth its place.
<p>24  For He looketh to the ends of the earth,
<p>Under the whole heaven He seeth.
<p>No living created being (&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1495;&#1497;, as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#010">Job 12:10</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#023">Job 30:23</A>) is able to answer the question; even the birds that fly aloft, that have keener and farther-seeing eyes than man, can give us no information concerning wisdom; and the world at least proclaims its existence in a rich variety of its operations, but in the realm of Abaddon and of death below (comp. the combination &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500; &#1493;&#1488;&#1489;&#1491;&#1493;&#1503;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#011">Pro 15:11</A>, &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#837;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#018">Rev 1:18</A>) it is known only by an indistinct hearsay, and from confused impressions. Therefore: no creature, whether in the realm of the living or the dead, can help us to get wisdom. There is but One who possesses a perfect knowledge concerning wisdom, namely Elohim, whose gave extends to the ends of the earth, and who sees under the whole heaven, i.e., is everywhere present (&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;, definition of place, not equivalent to &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;; comp. on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#009">Job 24:9</A>), who therefore, after the removal of everything earthly (sub-celestial), alone remains. And why should He with His knowledge, which embraces everything, not also know the way and place of wisdom? Wisdom is indeed the ideal, according to which He has created the world.

<p>25  When He appointed to the wind its weight,
<p>And weighed the water according to a measure,
<p>26  When He appointed to the rain its law,
<p>And the course to the lightning of the thunder:
<p>27  Then He saw it and declared it,
<p>Took it as a pattern and tested it also,
<p>28  And said to man: Behold, the fear of the Lord is wisdom,
<p>And to depart from evil is understanding.
<p>It is impracticable to attach the inf. &#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514; to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#024">Job 28:24</A> as the purpose, because it is contrary to the meaning; but it is impossible, according to the syntax, to refer it to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#027">Job 28:27</A> as the purpose placed in advance, or to take it in the sense of perfecturus, because in both instances it ought to have been &#1497;&#1514;&#1499;&#1468;&#1503; instead of &#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1503;, or at least &#1493;&#1514;&#1499;&#1468;&#1503; with the verb placed first (vid., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#015">Job 37:15</A>). But even the temporal use of &#1500; in &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; at the turn (of morning, of evening, e.g., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#063">Gen 24:63</A>) cannot be compared, but &#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514; signifies perficiendo = quum perficeret (as e.g., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#029">Sa2 18:29</A>, mittendo = quum mitteret), it is a gerundival inf. Ngelsb. S. 197f., 2nd edition); and because it is the past that is spoken of, the modal inf. can be continued in the perf., Ges. 132, rem. 2. The thought that God, when He created the world, appointed fixed laws of equable and salutary duration, he particularizes by examples: He appointed to the wind its weight, i.e., the measure of its force or feebleness; distributed the masses of water by measure; appointed to the rain its law, i.e., the conditions of its development and of its beginning; appointed the way, i.e., origin and course, to the lightning (&#1495;&#1494;&#1497;&#1494; from &#1495;&#1494;&#1494;, Arab. h&#803;zz, secare). When He thus created the world, and regulated what was created by laws, then He perceived (&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;&#1468; with He Mappic. according to the testimony of the Masora) it, wisdom, viz., as the ideal of all things; then He declared it, enarravit, viz., by creating the world, which is the development and realization of its substance; then He gave it a place &#1492;&#1499;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492;&#1468; (for which Dderl. and Ewald unnecessarily read &#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492;&#1468;), viz., to create the world after its pattern, and to commit the arrangement of the world as a whole to its supreme protection and guidance; then He also searched it out or tested it, viz., its demiurgic powers, by setting them in motion to realize itself.
<p>If we compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#022">Pro 8:22-31</A> with this passage, we may say: the &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1492; is the divine ideal-world, the divine imagination of all things before their creation, the complex unity of all the ideas, which are the essence of created things and the end of their development. "Wisdom," says one of the old theologians,
<p>(Note: Vid., Jul. Hamberger, Lehre Jak. Bhme's, S. 55.)
<p>"is a divine imagination, in which the ideas of the angels and souls and all things were seen from eternity, not as already actual creatures, but as a man beholds himself in a mirror." It is not directly one with the Logos, but the Logos is the demiurg by which God has called the world into existence according to that ideal which was in the divine mind. Wisdom is the impersonal model, the Logos the personal master-builder according to that model. Nevertheless the notions, here or in the alter cognate portion of Scripture, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#022">Pro 8:22-31</A>, are not as yet so distinct as the New Testament revelation of God has first of all rendered possible. In those days, when God realized the substance of the &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1492;, this eternal mirror of the world, in the creation of the world, He also gave man the law, corresponding to which he corresponds to His idea and participates in wisdom. Fearing the supreme Lord (&#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;) only here in the book of Job, one of the 134 &#1493;&#1491;&#1488;&#1497;&#1503;, i.e., passages, where &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497; is not merely to be read instead of &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;, but is actually written),
<p>(Note: Vid., Buxtorf's Tiberias, p. 245; comp. Br's Psalterium, p. 133.)
<p>and renouncing evil (&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; &#1502;&#1512;&#1506;, according to another less authorized mode of writing &#1502;&#1512;&#1506;), - this is man's share of wisdom, this is his relative wisdom, by which he remains in connection with the absolute. This is true human &#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;, in contrast to all high-flown and profound speculations; comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#007">Pro 3:7</A>, where, in like manner, "fear Jehovah" is placed side by side with "depart from evil," and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#006">Pro 16:6</A>, according to which it is rendered possible &#1505;&#1493;&#1512; &#1502;&#1512;&#1506;, to escape the evil of sin and its punishment by fearing God. "The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#007">Pro 1:7</A>; comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#010">Psa 111:10</A>) is the symbolum, the motto and uppermost principle, of that Israelitish Chokma, whose greatest achievement is the book of Job. The whole of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#001">Job 28:1</A> is a minute panegyric of this principle, the materials of which are taken from the far-distant past; and it is very characteristic, that, in the structure of the book, this twenty-eighth chapter is the clasp which unites the half of the &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; with the half of the &#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, and that the poet has inscribed upon this clasp that sentence, "The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom." But, moreover, Job's closing speech, which ends in this celebration of the praise of the &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1492;, also occupies an important position, which must not be determined, in the structure of the whole.
<p>After Job has refuted Bildad, and, continuing his description, has celebrated in such lofty strains the majesty of God, it can hardly be expected that the poet will allow Zophar to speak fore the third time. Bildad is unable to advance anything new, and Zophar has already tried his utmost to terrify Job for the second time; besides, Job's speech furnishes no material for a reply (a motive which is generally overlooked), unless the controversy were designed to ramble on into mere personalities. Accordingly the poet allows Job to address the friends once more, but no longer in the extreme and excited tone of the previous dialogue, but, since the silence of the friends must produce a soothing impression on Job, tempering him to gentleness and forbearance, in a tone of confession conscious of victory, yet altogether devoid of haughty triumph, - a confession in which only one single word of reproach (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#012">Job 27:12</A>) escapes him. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#001">Job 27:1</A> contain this confession - Job's final address to his friends.
<p>Job once again most solemnly asserts his innocence before the friends; all attempts on the part of the friends to entice or to extort from him a confession which is against his conscience, have therefore been in vain: joyous and victorious he raises his head, invincible, even to death, in the conviction of that which is a fact of his consciousness that cannot be got rid of by denial. He is not an evil-doer; accordingly he must stand convicted as an evil-doer who treats him as such. For although he is not far from death, and is in sore vexation, he has not manifested the hopelessness and defection from God in which the evil-doer passes away. Job has indeed even expressed himself despondingly, and complained of God's wrath; but the true essence of his relation to God came to light in such words as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#019">Job 16:19-21</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#009">Job 17:9</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#025">Job 19:25-27</A>. If the friends had not been blind to such brilliant aspirations of his life in God, how could they regard him as a godless man, and his affliction as the punishment of such an one! His affliction has, indeed, no connection with the terrible end of the evil-doer. Job here comes before the friends with the very doctrine they have so frequently advanced, but infatuated with the foolish notion that it is suited to his case. He here gives it back to them, to show them that it is not suited to him. He also does not deny, that in the rule the evil-doer meets a terrible end, although he has hitherto disputed the assertion of the friends, because of the exclusiveness with which it was maintained by them. His counter-assertion respecting the prosperity of the evil-doer, which from the beginning was not meant by him so exclusively as the friends meant theirs respecting the misfortune of the evil-doer, is here indirectly freed from the extreme appearance of exclusiveness by Job himself, and receives the necessary modification. Job does not deny, yea, he here brings it under the notice of the friends, that the sword, famine, and pestilence carry off the descendants of the evil-doer, and even himself; that his possessions at length fall into the hands of the righteous, and contain within themselves the germ of destruction from the very first; that God's curse pursues, and suddenly destroys, the godless rich man himself. Thus it comes to pass; for while silver and other precious things come from the depths of the earth, wisdom, whose worth far transcends all earthly treasures, is to be found with no created being, but is with God alone; and the fear of God, to avoid evil, is the share of wisdom to which man is directed according to God's primeval decree.
<p>The object of the section, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#001">Job 28:1</A>, is primarily to confirm the assertion concerning the judgment that befalls the evil-doer, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#013">Job 27:13-23</A>; the confirmation is, however, at the same time, according to the delicately laid plan of the poet, a glorious general confession, in which Job's dialogue with the friends comes to a close. This panegyric of wisdom (similar to Paul's panegyric of charity, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#001">Co1 13:1-13</A>) is the presentation of Job's predominant principle, and as such, is like a song of triumph, with which, without vain-glory, he closes the dialogue in the most appropriate manner. If God's life has such a basis, it is not possible that his affliction should be the punishment of an ungodly man. And if the fear of God is the wisdom appointed to man, he also teaches himself that, though unable to see through the mystery of his affliction, he must still hold on to the fear of God, and teaches the friends that they must do the same, and not lay themselves open to the charge of injustice and uncharitableness towards him, the suffering one, in order to solve the mystery. Job's conclusion, which is first intended to show that he who does not fear God is overtaken by the merited fate of a fool who rebels against God's moral government, shows at the same time that the afflictive lot of those who fear God must be judged of in an essentially different manner from that of the ungodly.
<p>We may imagine what impression these last words of Job to the friends must have made upon them. Since they were obliged to be silent, they will not have admitted that they are vanquished, although the drying up of their thoughts, and their involuntary silence, is an actual proof of it. But does Job make them feel this oppressively? Now that they are become so insignificant, does he read them a severe lecture? does he in general act towards them as vanquished? No indeed, but solemnly, and without vaunting himself over his accusers, he affirms his innocence; earnestly, but in a winning manner, he admonishes them, by tempering and modifying what was vehement and extreme in his previous replies. He humbly submits himself to the divine wisdom, by setting the fear of God, as man's true wisdom, before himself and the friends as their common aim. Thus he utters "the loftiest words, which must surprise the opponents as they exhibit him as the not merely mighty, but also wonderfully calm and modest conqueror, who here for the first time wears the crown of true victory, when, in outward victory conquering himself, he struggles on towards a more exalted clearness of perception."
