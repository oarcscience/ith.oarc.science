### [Psalms Chapter 117](../../../bib/kjv/psa117.htm#001)

[Psalms 117:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa117.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 117:1</span></span>

The thanksgiving Psalm ending in Hallelujah is followed by this shortest
of all the Psalms, a Hallelujah addressed to the heathen world. In its
very brevity it is one of the grandest witnesses of the might with
which, in the midst of the Old Testament, the world-wide mission of the
religion of revelation struck against or undermined the national
limitation. It is stamped by the apostle in [Rom
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#011) as a locus classicus for the
fore-ordained (gnadenrathschlussmssig) participation of the heathen in
the promised salvation of Israel.

Even this shortest Psalm has its peculiarities in point of language.
אמּים (Aramaic אמיּא, Arabic umam) is otherwise alien to Old Testament
Hebrew. The Old Testament Hebrew is acquainted only with אמּות as an
appellation of Ismaelitish of Midianitish tribes. כּל־גּוים are, as in
[Psa 72:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#011), [Psa
72:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#017), all peoples without
distinction, and כּל־האמּים all nations without exception. The call is
confirmed from the might of the mercy or loving-kindness of Jahve, which
proves itself mighty over Israel, i.e., by its intensity and fulness
superabundantly covering (גּבר as in [Psa
103:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#011); cf. ὑπερεπερίσσευσε, [Rom
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#020), ὑπερεπλεόνασε, [Ti1
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#014)) human sin and infirmity; and
from His truth, by virtue of which history on into eternity ends in a
verifying of His promises. Mercy and truth are the two divine powers
which shall one day be perfectly developed and displayed in Israel, and
going forth from Israel, shall conquer the world.
