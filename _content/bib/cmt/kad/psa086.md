Prayer of a Persecuted Saint

A Psalm "by David" which has points of contact with [Psa
85:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#001) (cf. [Psa
86:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#002), חסיד, with [Psa
85:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#009); [Psa
86:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#015), חסד ואמת, with [Psa
85:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#011)) is here inserted between
Korahitic Psalms: it can only be called a Psalm by David as having grown
out of Davidic and other model passages. The writer cannot be compared
for poetical capability either with David or with the authors of such
Psalms as Ps 116 and [Psa 130:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#001). His
Psalm is more liturgic than purely poetic, and it is also only entitled
תּפּלּה, without bearing in itself any sign of musical designation. It
possesses this characteristic, that the divine name אדני occurs seven
times,

(Note: For the genuine reading in [Psa
86:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#004) (where Heidenheim reads יהוה) and
in [Psa 86:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#005) (where Nissel reads יהוה)
is also אדני (Bomberg, Hutter, etc.). Both the divine names in [Psa
86:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#004) and [Psa
86:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#005) belong to the 134 ודּאין. The
divine name אדני, which is written and is not merely substituted for
יהוה, is called in the language of the Masora ודאי (the true and real
one).)

just as it occurs three times in [Psa
130:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#001), forming the start for a
later, Adonajic style in imitation of the Elohimic.

[Psalms 86:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 86:1</span></span>

The prayer to be heard runs like [Psa
55:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#003); and the statement of the ground
on which it is based, [Psa 86:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#001), word
for word like Ps 40:18. It is then particularly expressed as a prayer
for preservation (שׁמרה, as in [Psa
119:167](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#167), although imperative, to be
read shāmerah; cf. [Psa 30:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#004) מיּרדי,
[Psa 38:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#021) רדפי or רדפי, and what we
have already observed on [Psa 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#001)
שׁמרני); for he is not only in need of God's help, but also because חסיד
([Psa 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#004); [Psa
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#010)), i.e., united to Him in the
bond of affection (חסד, [Hos 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#004); [Jer
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#002)), not unworthy of it. In [Psa
86:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#002) we hear the strains of [Psa
25:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#020); [Psa
31:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#007); in [Psa
86:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#003), of [Psa
57:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#002).: the confirmation in [Psa
86:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#004) is taken verbally from [Psa
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#001), cf. also [Psa
130:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#006). Here, what is said in [Psa
86:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#004) of this shorter Adonajic Psalm,
[Psa 130:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#001), is abbreviated in the
ἅπαξ γεγραμ. סלּח (root סל, של, to allow to hang loose, χαλᾶν, to give
up, remittere). The Lord is good (טּוב), i.e., altogether love, and for
this very reason also ready to forgive, and great and rich in mercy for
all who call upon Him as such. The beginning of the following group also
accords with [Psa 130:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#001) in [Psa
86:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#002).

[Psalms 86:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 86:6</span></span>

Here, too, almost everything is an echo of earlier language of the
Psalms and of the Law; viz., [Psa 86:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#007)
follows [Psa 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#006) and other passages;
[Psa 86:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#008) is taken from [Exo
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#011), cf. [Psa
89:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#009), where, however, אלהים, gods, is
avoided; [Psa 86:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#008) follows [Deu
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#024); [Psa
86:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#009) follows [Psa
22:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#028); [Psa
86:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#011) is taken from [Psa
27:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#011); [Psa
86:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#011) from [Psa
26:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#003); [Psa
86:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#013), שׁאול תּחתּיּה from [Deu
32:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#022), where instead of this it is
תּחתּית, just as in [Psa 130:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#002)
תּחנוּני (supplicatory prayer) instead of תּחנוּנותי (importunate
supplications); and also [Psa 86:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#010)
(cf. [Psa 72:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#018)) is a doxological
formula that was already in existence. The construction הקשׁיב בּ is the
same as in [Psa 66:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#019). But although
for the most part flowing on only in the language of prayer borrowed
from earlier periods, this Psalm is, moreover, not without remarkable
significance and beauty. With the confession of the incomparableness of
the Lord is combined the prospect of the recognition of the incomparable
One throughout the nations of the earth. This clear unallegorical
prediction of the conversion of the heathen is the principal parallel to
[Rev 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#004). "All nations, which Thou
hast made" - they have their being from Thee; and although they have
forgotten it (vid., [Psa 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#018)), they
will nevertheless at last come to recognise it. כּל־גּוים, since the
article is wanting, are nations of all tribes (countries and
nationalities); cf. [Jer 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#016) with
[Psa 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#018); Tobit 13:11, ἔθνη πολλά,
with ibid. [Psa 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#006), πάντα τὰ ἔθνη.
And how weightily brief and charming is the petition in [Psa
86:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#011) : uni cor meum, ut timeat nomen
tuum! Luther has rightly departed from the renderings of the lxx,
Syriac, and Vulgate: laetetur (יחדּ from חדה). The meaning, however, is
not so much "keep my heart near to the only thing," as "direct all its
powers and concentrate them on the one thing." The following group shows
us what is the meaning of the deliverance out of the hell beneath (שׁאול
תּחתּיּה, like ארץ תּחתּית, the earth beneath, the inner parts of the
earth, [Eze 31:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#014).), for which the
poet promises beforehand to manifest his thankfulness (כּי, [Psa
86:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#013), as in Ps 56:14).

[Psalms 86:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 86:14</span></span>

The situation is like that in the Psalms of the time of Saul. The writer
is a persecuted one, and in constant peril of his life. He has taken
[Psa 86:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#014) out of the Elohimic [Psa
54:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#005), and retained the Elohim as a
proper name of God (cf. on the other hand [Psa
86:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#008), [Psa
86:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#010)); he has, however, altered זרים
to זרים, which here, as in [Isa 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#011)
(cf. however, ibid. [Psa 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#005)), is the
alternating word to עריצים. In [Psa
86:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#015) he supports his petition that
follows by Jahve's testimony concerning Himself in [Exo
34:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#006). The appellation given to himself
by the poet in [Psa 86:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#016) recurs in
[Psa 116:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#016) (cf. Wisd. 9:5). The poet
calls himself "the son of Thy handmaid" as having been born into the
relation to Him of servant; it is a relationship that has come to him by
birth. How beautifully does the Adonaj come in here for the seventh
time! He is even from his mother's womb the servant of the sovereign
Lord, from whose omnipotence he can therefore also look for a miraculous
interposition on his behalf. A "token for good" is a special
dispensation, from which it becomes evident to him that God is kindly
disposed towards him. לטובה as in the mouth of Nehemiah, [Neh
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#019); [Neh
13:31](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#031); of [Ezr
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#022); and also even in Jeremiah and
earlier. ויבשׁוּ is just as parenthetical as in [Isa
26:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#011).
