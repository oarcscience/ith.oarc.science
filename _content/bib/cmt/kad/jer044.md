Warning Against Idolatry, and Intimation of Its Punishment

When the Jews had settled down in Egypt in different places, they betook
themselves zealously to the worship of the queen of heaven; to this they
were probably induced by the example of the heathen round about them,
and by the vain expectation of thereby promoting their interests as
members of the community (cf. [Jer
44:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#017).). Accordingly, when all the
people who were living here and there through the country had assembled
in Upper Egypt ([Jer 44:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#015)) for the
celebration of the festival, the prophet seized the opportunity of
setting before them, in an earnest manner, the ruinous consequences of
their doings. First of all, he reminds them of the judgments which they
and their fathers, by their continued apostasy from the Lord, and by
their idolatry, had brought on Jerusalem and Judah ([Jer
44:2-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#002)); and he warns them not to
bring destruction on the remnant of Judah still left, by continuing in
their idolatry ([Jer 44:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#008)). The
threatening also is expressed, that the Lord will destroy all those who
marched to Egypt with the sword, famine, and pestilence ([Jer
44:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#011)). But the whole assembly
declare to him that they will not obey his word, but persist in
worshipping the queen of heaven; alleging that their fathers prospered
so long as they honoured her, and war and famine had come on them only
after they ceased to do so ([Jer
44:15-19](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#015)). Jeremiah refutes this false
notion ([Jer 44:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#020)), and once more
solemnly announces to them the sentence of destruction by sword and
famine in Egypt. As a sign that the Lord will keep His word, he finally
predicts that King Hophra shall be delivered into the hand of
Nebuchadnezzar.

[Jeremiah 44:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 44:1</span></span>

"The word that came to Jeremiah regarding all the Jews who were living
in the land of Egypt, who dwelt in Migdol, in Tahpanhes, in Noph, and in
the land of Pathros." From this heading we perceive that those who
(according to [Jer 43:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#001)) had gone
to Egypt, had settled there in various parts of the country, and that
the following denunciations, which at the same time form his last
prophecy, were uttered a long time after that which is given in [Jer
43:8-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#008) as having been delivered at
Tahpanhes. The date of it cannot, indeed, be determined exactly. From
the threatening that King Hophra shall be delivered over to the power of
Nebuchadnezzar ([Jer 44:24-30](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#024)), only
this much is clear, that Egypt was not yet occupied by the Chaldeans,
which, as we have shown above (p. 353), did not take place before the
year 572. But it by no means follows from this that Jeremiah did not
utter these words of threatening till shortly before this event. He may
have done so even five or ten years before, in the period between 585
and 580, as we have already observed on p. 12. The Jews had settled
down, not merely in the two northern frontier towns, Migdol (i.e.,
Magdolo, Μαγδώλος, according to the Itiner. Anton., twelve Roman miles
from Pelusium, Copt. Meschtl, Egypt. Ma'ktr, the most northerly place in
Egypt; see on [Eze 29:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#010)) and
Tahpanhes (i.e., Daphne, see on [Jer
43:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#007)), but also in more inland places,
in Noph (i.e., Memphis, see on [Jer
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#016)) and the land of Pathros (lxx
Παθούρης, Egypt. Petorees, i.e., Southland, viz., Upper Egypt, the
Thebais of the Greeks and Romans; see on [Eze
29:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#014)). The word of the Lord runs as
follows: -

[Jeremiah 44:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 44:2</span></span>

The warning and threatening. - "Thus saith Jahveh of hosts, the God of
Israel: Ye yourselves have been all the evil which I have brought on
Jerusalem, and on all the cities of Judah; and, behold, they are a
desolation this day, and there is no inhabitant in them; [Jer
44:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#003). Because of their wickedness
which they have done, by provoking me through going to burn incense,
(and) to serve other gods whom they knew not, (neither) they (nor) ye,
nor your fathers. [Jer 44:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#004). And I
sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising early and sending
(them), to say, Do not this abominable thing which I hate. [Jer
44:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#005). But they did not hear, nor
inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, by not burning incense
to other gods. [Jer 44:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#006). Therefore my
wrath and mine anger poured itself out, and burned up the cities of
Judah and the streets of Jerusalem; so that they have become a
desolation and a waste, as at this day. [Jer
44:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#007). Now therefore thus saith Jahveh
of hosts, the God of Israel: Why do ye great evil against your souls, by
cutting off from yourselves man and women, child and suckling, out of
the midst of Judah, so leaving no remnant for yourselves; [Jer
44:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#008). Through provoking me by the
works of your hands, burning incense to other gods in the land of Egypt,
whither ye have gone to sojourn, that ye might bring destruction on
yourselves, and that ye might become a curse and a reproach among all
the nations of the earth? [Jer 44:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#009).
Have ye forgotten the evil deeds of your fathers, and the evil deeds of
the kings of Judah, and the evil deeds of their wives, and your own evil
deeds, and the evil deeds of your wives, which they committed in the
land of Judah and on the streets of Jerusalem? [Jer
44:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#010). They have not been contrite to
this day, and are not afraid, nor do they walk in my law, and in my
statutes, which I have set before you and before your fathers. [Jer
44:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#011). Therefore thus saith Jahveh of
hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will set my face against you for
evil, and to cut off all Judah. [Jer
44:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#012). And I will take the remnant of
Judah, that have set their faces to go to the land of Egypt in order to
sojourn there, and they shall all be consumed; in the land of Egypt
shall they fall, by sword and famine shall they be consumed; small and
great, by sword and famine shall they die, and they shall become an
execration and an astonishment, and a curse and a reproach. [Jer
44:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#013). And I will punish those who
dwell in the land of Egypt, as I punished Jerusalem, by sword, and
famine, and pestilence. [Jer 44:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#014).
There shall not be one escaped or left to the remnant of Judah that came
to sojourn there in the land of Egypt, so as to return to the land of
Judah, whither they long to return and dwell; for they shall not return
except as escaped ones."

[Jer 44:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#002)

In order to make an impression on the people by his warning against
idolatry, Jeremiah begins his address with a reference to the great
calamity which the fathers have brought on the kingdom of Judah through
their continued idolatry ([Jer
44:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#002)). "Ye have seen all the evil,"
etc.; all the cities are laid waste and depopulated, because their
inhabitants have roused the anger of the Lord, and have not let
themselves be dissuaded by the admonitions of the prophets whom God has
sent. "This day," i.e., now, at present. On [Jer
44:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#003), cf. [Jer
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#017); [Jer
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#004); [Jer
32:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#032), etc.; and as to the meaning of
קטּר, see on [Jer 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#016). In [Jer
44:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#003) the address becomes more direct,
through the change into the second person, "ye;" the audience then
present only continue these sins of their fathers. On [Jer
44:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#004), cf. [Jer
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#025); [Jer
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#004), etc. דּבר התּעבה הזּאת, "the
thing of this abomination," which is equivalent to "this abominable
idolatry." דּבר serves to render the subject more prominent, as in [Jdg
19:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#024). On [Jer
44:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#006), cf. [Jer
42:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#018); [Jer
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#020). The wrath of God burned in the
cities, for the fire of destruction was a manifestation of the divine
wrath. As to כּיום הזּה, see on [Jer
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#005).

[Jer 44:7-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#007)

In [Jer 44:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#007) follows the
application of what has been said to those present, who are asked how
they come to continue in the old sins, to their own destruction, "doing
evil in regard to your souls," i.e., for the injury, destruction of your
souls, yourself; cf. [Jer 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#019), where
על־נ' stands for אל־נ'. This is immediately afterwards more exactly
specified by 'להכרית וגו, to exterminate the whole of you, without an
exception. As to the enumeration "man and woman," etc., cf. [Sa1
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#003); [Sa1
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#019). The infs. להכעיסני and לקטּר
are used as gerundives: "inasmuch as (through this that) ye provoke me."
For the expression "the works of your hands," see on [Jer
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#016). In [Jer
44:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#008), an object must be supplied from
[Jer 44:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#007) for the expression למען
הכרית לכם; for, to take לכם (with Hitzig) in a reflexive sense is a very
harsh construction. On 'לקללה וגו, cf. [Jer
42:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#018); [Jer
26:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#006). The answer to the question now
asked follows in [Jer 44:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#009) and [Jer
44:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#010), in the form of the further
question, whether they have forgotten those former sins, and that these
sins have been the cause of the evil which has befallen the land. The
interrogation expresses the reproach that they have been able to forget
both, as is evidenced by their continuance in sin. In [Jer
44:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#009), the expression "the evil deeds
of his wives" (נשׁיו) is remarkable. Hitzig and Ngelsbach, following
Kimchi, refer the suffix to the kings, since there was always but one
king at a time. But this is an unnatural explanation; the suffix refers
to Judah as a nation, and is used in order to comprehend the wives of
the fathers and of the kings together. It is quite arbitrary in Ewald
and Graf to change נשׁיו to שׂריו, following the lxx τῶν ἀρχόντων ὑμῶν;
for these translators have mutilated the text by the omission of the
following ואת רעתיכם. רעות נשׁיו is not merely conserved, but even
required, by ואת רעת נשׁיכם. But the prophet gives special prominence to
the evil deeds of the wives, since it was they who were most zealous in
worshipping the queen of heaven; cf. [Jer
44:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#015) and [Jer
44:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#019). לא דכּאוּ, "they have not been
crushed," viz., by repentance and sorrow for these sins. The transition
to the third person is not merely accounted for by the fact that the
subject treated of is the sins of the fathers and of the present
generation, - for, as is shown by the expression "till this day," the
prophet has chiefly his own contemporaries in view; but he speaks of
these in the third person, to signify the indignation with which he
turns away from men so difficult to reform. On the expression, "they had
not walked in my law," cf. [Jer 26:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#004);
[Jer 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#012). For this the Lord will
punish them severely, [Jer 44:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#011).
All those who have fled to Egypt, with the intention of remaining there,
will be quite exterminated. On "Behold, I will set my face," etc., cf.
[Jer 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#010). "For evil" is more exactly
defined by "to cut off all Judah," i.e., those of Judah who are in
Egypt, not those who are in Babylon. This limitation of the words "all
Judah" is necessarily required by the context, and is plainly expressed
in [Jer 44:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#012), where "Judah" is
specified as "the remnant of Judah that were determined to go to Egypt."
לקחתּי has the meaning of taking away, as in [Jer
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#015). ותמּוּ are to be taken by
themselves; and בּארץ מצרים, as is shown by the accents, is to be
attached to what follows, on which, too, the emphasis is placed; in like
manner, 'בּחרב are to be attached to the succeeding verb. The
arrangement of the words, like the accumulation of sentences all
expressing the same meaning, reveals the spirit of the address in which
God vents His wrath. On "they shall become an execration," etc., see
[Jer 42:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#018). In [Jer
44:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#013), [Jer
44:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#014), the threatened extermination is
further set forth. Those who dwelling Egypt shall be punished with
sword, famine, and plague, like Jerusalem. The inhabitants of Egypt
generally are meant; and by the judgment which is to fall on that
country, the remnant of Judah there shall be so completely destroyed,
that none shall escape. The leading member of the sentence is continued
by ולשׁוּב, "and that they should return to the land of Judah, after
which their soul longs, that they may live there." A reason is further
assigned, and with this the address, reduced within becoming limits,
concludes: "for there shall return none except (כּי אם) fugitives,"
i.e., except a few individual fugitives who shall come back. This last
clause shows that we are not to understand the declaration "none shall
escape" in the strictest meaning of the words. Those who escape and
return to Judah shall be so few, in comparison with those who shall
perish in Egypt, as to be quite inconsiderable. Cf. the like instance of
a seeming contradiction in [Jer 44:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#027),
[Jer 44:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#028). On נשּׂא את־נפשׁם, cf.
[Jer 22:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#027).

[Jeremiah 44:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 44:15</span></span>

The answer of the people to this threatening address. - [Jer
44:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#015). "Then all the men who knew that
their wives burned incense to other gods, and all the women standing
\[there\], a great multitude, and all the people who dwelt in the land
of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying, [Jer
44:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#016). \[As for\] the word which thou
hast spoken unto us in the name of Jahveh, we will not hearken unto
thee: [Jer 44:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#017). But we will
certainly perform every word that has proceeded out of our own mouth, by
burning incense to the queen of heaven, and pouring out libations to
her, just as we have done, we and our fathers, our kings and our
princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem; and we
were filled with bread, and became prosperous, and saw no evil. [Jer
44:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#018). But since we ceased to offer
incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out libations to her, we
have been in want of everything, and are consumed by sword and famine.
[Jer 44:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#019). And when we \[women\] have
been burning incense to the queen of heaven, and poured out libations to
her, have we made cakes to her without our husbands, making an image of
her, and offering libations to her?" To the word of the prophet the men
and women oppose their pretended experience, that the adoration of the
queen of heaven has brought them comfort and prosperity, while the
neglect of this worship, on the other hand, has brought want and
misfortune. No doubt they inferred this, by the argument post hoc, ergo
propter hoc, from the fact that, after idolatry had been rooted out by
Josiah, adversity had befallen the land of Judah; while, up till that
time, the kingdom of Judah had been independent, and, for more than a
century before, had been spared the suffering of misfortune. Thus,
through their blindness, peculiar to the natural man, they had
overlooked the minor transient evils with which the Lord visits His
people when they sin. Not till near the end of Josiah's reign did
misfortune fall on Judah: this was when the Egyptian army, under
Pharaoh-Necho, marched through Palestine; Josiah was slain in the battle
he had lost, the land was laid waste by the enemy, and its inhabitants
perished by sword and famine. In [Jer
44:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#015), those who are represented
speaking are all the men who knew of their wives' idolatry, i.e., who
permitted it, and all the women, "a great company," i.e., gathered
together in great numbers, and all the rest of the people who lived in
Egypt. The specification "in Pathros" is not in apposition to the words
"in the land of Egypt," but belongs to the verb ויּענוּ; it tells where
the gathering took place, viz., in a district of Upper Egypt. From the
presence of a large number of women, we may conclude that the assembly
was a festival in honour of the queen of heaven. The former portion of
[Jer 44:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#016) forms an absolute clause,
from הדּבר to בּשׁם, "as regards the word which...we will not listen to
thee," i.e., with regard to this word we obey thee not. The expression,
"the word which has gone forth out of our mouth," points to the uttering
of vows: cf. [Num 30:13](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#013); [Deu
23:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#024). 'כּל־הדּבר means "all that we
have uttered as a vow," every vow to offer incense, etc., i.e., to
present meat and drink offerings to the queen of heaven, - that shall we
keep, fulfil, as we and our fathers have done in the land of Judah. On
this mode of worship, cf. [Jer 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#017).,
and the remarks there made. "And we were satisfied with bread," i.e., in
consequence of this worship we had amply sufficient food. Towbiym טובים,
"good," well, comfortable; cf. [Jer
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#016). מן אז, "from that time" =
since. תּמנוּ is for תּמּנוּ, from תּמם, as in [Num
17:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#001) :28; cf. Ewald, 197, a. To
this statement on the part of the men, the women further add, [Jer
44:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#019), that they do not engage in this
sacrificial worship or prepare the sacrificial cakes without their
husbands, i.e., without their knowledge and approval. This is put
forward by the women in the way of self-vindication; for, according to
the law, [Num 30:9](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#009)., the husband could
annul, i.e., declare not binding, any vow which had been made by his
wife without his knowledge. Although it is women who are speaking, the
masc. מקטּרים is used as being the gender which most commonly occurs; it
also pretty often stands for the feminine. The inf. constr. וּלהסּך
(with ל) is here employed, in conformity with later usage, instead of
the inf. abs., for the finite verb, by way of continuation; cf. Ewald,
351, c, where, however, many passages have been set down as falling
under this rule that demand a different explanation. The meaning of
להעצבה is disputed; the final ה is a suffix, written with Raphe, though
Mappik also occurs in some MSS. The Hiphil of this verb is found
elsewhere only in [Psa 78:40](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#040), and
there in the signification of vexing, grieving, like the Piel in [Isa
63:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#010); [Psa
66:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#006). Ewald translates "in order to
move her," i.e., make her well-disposed, - but quite arbitrarily, for to
provoke is the very opposite of rendering propitious. The verb עצּב also
signifies "to form, shape," [Job 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#008);
and in this sense the Hiphil is used here, "in order to put them into
shape," i.e., to form the moon-goddess (queen of heaven) in or on the
sacrificial cakes (Kimchi, Raschi, Dahler, Maurer, Graf, etc.). The
sacrificial cakes (כּוּנים, see on [Jer
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#018)) probably had the form of a
crescent, or even of the full moon, like the σελῆναι of the Greeks,
which used to be offered in Athens at the time of the full moon in the
month of Munychion, to Artemis, as goddess of the moon; cf. Hermann,
gottesdienstliche Alterthmer der Griechen, 2 Ausg. S. 146, Anm. 13, u.
S. 414.

[Jeremiah 44:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 44:20</span></span>

Refutation of these statements of the people. - [Jer
44:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#020). "And Jeremiah spake to all the
people, to the men and women, and to all the people that had given him
answer, saying, [Jer 44:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#021). Did not
the incense-burning which he performed in the cities of Judah and in the
streets of Jerusalem, ye and your fathers, your kings and your princes,
and the people of the land-did not Jahveh remember them, and did it not
arise in His mind? [Jer 44:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#022). And
Jahveh could no longer endure it, because of the wickedness of your
deeds, because of the abominations which ye committed; thus your land
became a desolation, and a waste, and a curse, without an inhabitant, as
at this day. [Jer 44:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#023). Because ye
burned incense and sinned against Jahveh, and did not hearken to the
voice of Jahveh, and in His law, in His statutes, and in His testimonies
ye walked not; therefore this evil hath befallen you, as at this day."
Jeremiah answers them that their idol-worship, by which they have
provoked the Lord their God, is the very cause of the misfortune that
has befallen them, because God could no longer endure this abomination
which they would not forsake. הקּטּר is a noun, "the burning of
incense," which includes, besides, all the other elements of idolatrous
worship hence the word is resumed, at the close, under the plur. אותם,
"these things." ותּעלה is 3rd pers. sing. neut., lit., "it has come into
His mind," i.e., He has carefully considered it, and that in the way of
punishment, for He could no longer endure such abomination. The imperf.
יוּכל is used for the historic tense (imperf. with ו consec.), because
the ו would necessarily be separated from the verb by the לא; and it is
employed instead of the perfect, which we would be inclined to expect
after the preceding זכר, since that which is treated of is something
that endures for a considerable time; cf. Ewald, 346, b. On the
expression "because of the evil," etc., cf. [Jer
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#012); [Jer
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#004), etc.; on the last clause in [Jer
44:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#022), cf. [Jer
44:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#006) and [Jer
44:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#012).

[Jeremiah 44:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 44:23</span></span>

Announcement of the punishment for this idolatry. - [Jer
44:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#024). "And Jeremiah said unto all the
people, and unto all the women, Hear the word of Jahveh, all of Judah
that are in the land of Egypt; [Jer
44:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#025). Thus saith Jahve of hosts, the
God of Israel: Ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouth, and
fulfilled it with your hands, saying, We will assuredly perform our vows
which we have vowed, by burning incense to the queen of heaven, and by
pouring out libations to her: ye will by all means perform your vows,
and carry out your vows. [Jer 44:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#026).
Therefore hear the word of Jahveh, all Judah that dwell in the land of
Egypt: Behold, I have sworn by my great name, saith Jahveh, truly my
name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah, saying,
'As the Lord Jahveh liveth,' in all the land of Egypt. [Jer
44:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#027). Behold, I will watch over them
for evil, and not for good; and all the men of Judah that are in the
land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by famine, till they
are annihilated. [Jer 44:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#028). And those
who escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt to the land
of Judah, a small number; and all the remnant of Judah, that went to the
land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall know whose word shall stand, mine
or theirs. [Jer 44:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#029). And this shall
be the sign to you, saith Jahveh, that I will punish you in this place,
that ye may know that my words shall surely rise up against you for
evil: [Jer 44:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#030). Thus hath Jahveh
spoken, Behold, I will give Pharaoh-Hophra into the hand of his enemies,
and into the hand of those who seek his life, just as I have given
Zedekiah the king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar the king of
Babylon, who was his enemy, and sought his life."

After refuting the false assertion of the people, Jeremiah once more
announces to them, on behalf of God, in the most solemn manner, the
punishment of extermination by sword and famine in Egypt; this he does
for the purpose of giving the greatest possible emphasis to his warning
against persevering in idolatry. For substance, this announcement is
similar to that of [Jer 44:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#011), but
the expression is stronger. Even in the summary account of their
offences, [Jer 44:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#025), the words are so
chosen and arranged as to bring out clearly the determination of the
people to persevere in worshipping the queen of heaven. "As for you and
your wives, ye have spoken with your mouth and fulfilled it with your
hand" (on the Vav consec. attached to תּדבּרנה, cf. Ewald, 344, b),
i.e., ye have uttered vows and then carried them out; for ye say, We
must keep the vows that we have vowed. It is to be observed that the
verbs תּדבּרנה, and in the concluding portion תּקימנה and תּעשׂינה, are
feminine, since the address chiefly applies to the wives, who clung most
tenaciously to idolatry. In the clause 'הקים תּקימנה וגו, "ye will make
your vows and perform them," there is unmistakeable irony, in which the
reference is to the wilfulness of the people in this idolatry. This
ἑθελοθρησκεία is shown by the inf. abs. הקים, which strengthens תּקימנה.
"To establish vows," i.e., to make them, was not a thing commanded, but
left to one's free determination. Hence, also, no appeal to the maxim
that vows which have been made or uttered must be fulfilled, can justify
the making of the vows. The form תּקימנה for תּקמנה is an unusual one;
and the י which the Hirik takes after it is occasioned by the form הקים;
cf. Ewald, 196, c. - The announcement of the punishment is introduced by
a solemn oath on the part of God. Jahveh swears by His great name, i.e.,
as the one who has shown Himself God by His mighty deeds - who has the
power of keeping His word. The name is, of course, only a manifestation
of His existence. אם as a particle used in swearing = certainly not. His
name shall no more be named in the mouth of any Jew in the land of
Egypt, i.e., be used in asseverations, because all the Jews in Egypt
shall be exterminated. On the expression, "Behold, I will watch over
them," etc., cf. [Jer 31:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#028) and [Jer
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#010). In [Jer
44:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#028), it is more exactly stated that
only a few individuals shall escape the sword and return to Judah; thus,
no one shall remain behind in Egypt. By this judgment, all the remnant
of Judah that went to Egypt shall find out whose word - Jahveh's or
theirs - will endure, i.e., prove true. ממּנּי properly depends on דבר,
"the word from me or from them" (the people).

In confirmation of this threatening, the Lord gives them another sign
which, when it is fulfilled, will let them know that the destruction
announced to them shall certainly befall them. The token consists in the
giving up of King Hophra into the hand of his enemies. As certainly as
this shall take place, so certainly shall the extermination of the Jews
in Egypt ensue. The name חפרע is rendered Οὐάφρις in Manetho, in the
classical writers ̓Απρίης, Apris, who, according to Herodotus (ii. 161),
reigned twenty-five years, but nineteen according to Manetho (cf.
Boeckh, Manetho, etc., p. 341ff.). His death took place in the year 570
b.c. This date is reached by a comparison of the following facts: -
Cambyses conquered Egypt in the year 525; and in the preceding year
Amasis had died, after a reign of forty-four years (Herod. iii. 10).
Hence Amasis - who took Apris prisoner, and gave him up to the common
people, who killed him (Herod. ii. 161-163, 169) - must have commenced
his reign in the year 570. On the death of Apris, or Hophra, cf. the
explanation given on p. 353f., where we have shown that the words, "I
will give him into the hand of his enemies, and of those who seek his
life," when compared with what is said of Zedekiah, "into the hand of
Nebuchadnezzar his enemy," do not require us to assume that Hophra was
killed by Nebuchadnezzar, and can very well be harmonized with the
notice of Herodotus regarding the death of this king.

Hitzig and Graf have taken objection to this sign given by Jeremiah, and
regard [Jer 44:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#029), [Jer
44:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#030) as a spurious vaticinium ex
eventu, the work of another hand. The reasons they urge are, that it is
scarcely possible Jeremiah could have lived till 570; that [Jer
44:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#029). would be the only place where
Jeremiah offered such a criterion; and that, even as it is, these verses
contain nothing original, but, by their stiff and lifeless parallelism,
are easily seen to be an artificial conclusion. Of these three
arguments, the last can prove nothing, since it is merely a subjective
opinion on an aesthetic point. The second, again, rather declares for
than against the genuineness. For "if it were not Jeremiah's usual,
elsewhere, to offer some criterion, then such an interpolation would
have been all the more carefully avoided" (Ngelsbach). Of course we do
not find any other signs of this kind in Jeremiah; but it does not
follow from this that he could not offer such a thing in a special case.
Yet the ground taken up by Ngelsbach, as sufficient to establish this
position, seems quite untenable, viz., that the announcement of the fate
in store for the king must have been the answer of the true God to the
presumptuous boast of Apris, mentioned by Herodotus, "that even God
could not dethrone him, so firmly did he think he was established:" this
view of the matter seems too remote from the object of Jeremiah's
address. And finally, the first-named objection receives importance only
on the supposition that "an event which was intended to serve as אות, a
sign or criterion, must be something that was to happen immediately, or
within a brief appointed period of time, so that a person might be able,
from the occurrence of the one, to conclude that what had been foretold
about a later period would as certainly take place" (Graf). But there
are no sufficient grounds for this hypothesis. If no definite time be
fixed for the occurrence of this sign, then it may not appear till a
considerable time afterwards, and yet be a pledge for the occurrence of
what was predicted for a still later period. That Jeremiah lived till
the year 570 is certainly not inconceivable, but it is not likely that
he uttered the prophecy now before us at the advanced age of nearly
eighty years. Now, if his address is allowed to be a real prophecy, and
not a mere vaticinium ex eventu, as Hitzig, looking from his dogmatic
standpoint, considers it, then it must have been uttered before the year
570; but whether this was two, or five, or ten years before, makes no
material difference. The address itself contains nothing to justify the
assumption of Graf, that it is closely connected with the prophecy in
[Jer 43:8-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#008), and with the warning
against the migration into Egypt, Jer 42. That the Jews spoken of had
not been long in Egypt, cannot be inferred from [Jer
44:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#008), [Jer
44:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#012), and [Jer
44:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#018); on the contrary, the fact that
they had settled down in different parts of Egypt, and had assembled at
Pathros for a festival, shows that they had been living there for a
considerable time before. Nor does it follow, from the statement in [Jer
44:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#014) that they longed to return to
Judah, that they had gone to Egypt some months before. The desire to
return into the land of their fathers remains, in a measure, in the
heart of the Jew even at the present day. After all, then, no valid
reason can be assigned for doubting the genuineness of these verses.

On the fulfilment of these threatenings Ngelsbach remarks: "Every one
must be struck on finding that, in Jer 44, the extermination of the Jews
who dwelt in Egypt is predicted; while some centuries later, the Jews in
Egypt were very numerous, and that country formed a central point for
the Jewish exiles (cf. Herzog, Real-Encycl. xvii. S. 285). Alexander the
Great found so many Jews in Egypt, that he peopled with Jews, in great
measure, the city he had founded and called after himself (cf. Herzog,
i. S. 235). How did these Jews get to Egypt? Whence the great number of
Jews whom Alexander found already in Egypt? I am inclined to think that
we must consider them, for the most part, as the descendants of those
who had come into the country with Jeremiah. But, according to this view
of the matter, Jeremiah's prophecy has not been fulfilled." Ngelsbach
therefore thinks we must assume that idolatrous worship, through time,
almost entirely ceased among the exiled Jews in Egypt as it did among
those in Babylon, and that the Lord then, in return, as regards the
penitents, repented of the evil which He had spoken against them ([Jer
26:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#013), [Jer
26:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#019)). But this whole explanation is
fundamentally wrong, since the assertion, that Alexander the Great found
so many Jews in Egypt, that with them mainly he peopled the city of
Alexandria which he had founded, is contrary to historic testimony. In
Herzog (Real-Encycl. i. S. 235), to which Ngelsbach refers for proof on
the point, nothing of the kind is to be found, but rather the opposite,
viz., the following: "Soon after the foundation of Alexandria by
Alexander the Great, this city became not merely the centre of Jewish
Hellenism in Egypt, but generally speaking the place of union between
Oriental and Occidental Jews. The external condition of the Jews of
Alexandria must, on the whole, be characterized as highly prosperous.
The first Jewish settlers had, indeed, been compelled by Alexander the
Great to take up their residence in the city (Josephus, Antt. xv. 3. 1);
so, too, were other Jews, by Ptolemy I. or Lagi (ibid. xii. 2. 4). But
both of these monarchs granted them the same rights and privileges as
the Macedonians, including Greek citizenship; and in consequence of the
extremely advantageous position of the city, it speedily increased in
importance. A still larger number, therefore, soon went thither of their
own accord, and adopted the Greek language." In this account, the
quotation from Josephus, Antt. xv. 3. 1, is certainly incorrect; for
neither is there in that passage any testimony borne to the measures
attributed to Alexander, nor are there any other historical testimonies
given from antiquity. But as little can we find any proofs that
Alexander the Great found so many Jews in Egypt that he could, to a
large extent, people with them the city he had founded. It is merely
testified by Josephus (Antt. xi. 8. 5), and by Hecataeus in Josephus
(contra Ap. i. 22; p. 457, ed. Haverc.), that Alexander had Jewish
soldiers in his army; it is further evident, from a notice in Josephus,
de bell. Jud. ii. 18. 7, contra Ap. ii. 4) cf. Curtius Rufus, iv. 8),
that the newly founded city, even under Alexander, immediately after it
was commenced, and still more under Ptolemy Lagi (cf. Josephus, Antt.
xii. 1, and Hecataeus in Jos. contra Ap. i. 22, p. 455), attracted a
constantly increasing multitude of Jewish immigrants. This same Ptolemy,
after having subdued Phoenicia and Coele-Syria in the year 320, and
taken Jerusalem also, it would seem, by a stratagem on a Sabbath day,
transported many captives and hostages out of the whole country into
Egypt; many, too, must have been sold at that time as slaves to the
inhabitants of such a wealthy country as Egypt: see a statement in the
book of Aristeas, at the end of Havercamp's edition of Josephus, ii. p.
104. In the same place, and in Josephus' Antt. xii. 1, Ptolemy is said
to have armed 30,000 Jewish soldiers, placed them as garrisons in the
fortresses, and granted them all the rights of Macedonian citizens
(ἰσοπολιτεία). Ewald well says, History of the People of Israel, vol.
iv. of second edition, p. 254: "When we further take into consideration,
that, in addition to all other similar disasters which had previously
befallen them, many Jews were removed to Egypt (especially by Ochus,
after Egypt had been reconquered), we can easily explain how Ptolemy
Philadelphus can be said to have liberated 100,000 Egyptian Jews.
Aristeas' Book, p. 105." This much, at least, is proved by these various
notices, - that, in order to understand how such a vast increase took
place in the number of the Jews in Egypt, we do not need to regard them
as the descendants of those who removed thither with Jeremiah, and so to
question the fulfilment of the prophecy now before us. Jeremiah does
not, of course, threaten with destruction all those Jews who live in
Egypt, but only those who at that time went thither against the divine
will, and there persevered in their idolatry. We do not know how great
may have been the number of these immigrants, but they could hardly
exceed two thousand, - perhaps, indeed, there were not so many. All
these, as had been foretold them, may have perished in the conquest of
Egypt by the Chaldeans, and afterwards, through the sword, famine, and
pestilence; for the myriads of Jews in Egypt at the time of Ptolemy Lagi
could easily have removed thither during the period of 250 years
intermediate between the immigration in Jeremiah's time and the
foundation of Alexandria, partly as prisoners and slaves, partly through
voluntary settlement.
