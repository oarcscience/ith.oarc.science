### [Jeremiah Chapter 28](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 28:1</span></span>

Against the False Prophet Hananiah. - [Jer
28:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#001). This man's prophecy. At the
same time, namely in the fourth year of Zedekiah (cf. rem. on [Jer
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#001). The Chet. בּשׁנת is supported by
[Jer 46:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#002) and [Jer
51:59](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#059); the Keri בּשּׁנה is an
unnecessary alteration), in the fifth month, spake Hananiah the son of
Azur, - a prophet not otherwise known, belonging to Gibeon, a city of
the priests ([Jos 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#017); now Jib, a
large village two hours north-west of Jerusalem; see on [Jos
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#003)), possibly therefore himself a
priest - in the house of the Lord, in the presence of the priests and
people assembled there, saying: [Jer
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#002). "Thus hath Jahveh of hosts, the
God of Israel, said: I break the yoke of the king of Babylon. [Jer
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#003). Within two years I bring again
into this place the vessels of the house of Jahveh, which Nebuchadnezzar
the king of Babylon took away from this place and carried them to
Babylon. [Jer 28:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#004). And Jechoniah, the
son of Jehoiakim the king of Judah, and all the captives of Judah that
went into Babylon, bring I again to this place, saith Jahveh; for I will
break the yoke of the king of Babylon." - The false prophet endeavours
to stamp on his prediction the impress of a true, God-inspired prophecy,
by copying the title of God, so often used by Jeremiah, "Jahveh of
hosts, the God of Israel," and by giving the utmost definiteness to his
promise: "within two years" (in contrast to Jeremiah's seventy years).
"Two years" is made as definite as possible by the addition of ימים: two
years in days, i.e., in two full years.See on [Gen
41:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#001); [Sa2
13:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#023).

[Jeremiah 28:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 28:5</span></span>

Jeremiah's reply. - First Jeremiah admits that the fulfilment of this
prediction would be desirable ([Jer
28:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#006)), but then reminds his opponent
that all the prophets of the Lord up till this time have prophesied of
war and calamity ([Jer 28:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#007) and [Jer
28:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#008)). So that if a prophet, in
opposition to these witnesses of God, predicts nothing but peace and
safety, then nothing short of the fulfilment of his prediction can make
good his claim to be a true prophet ([Jer
28:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#009)). - Jeremiah's answer is to this
effect: [Jer 28:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#006). "Amen (i.e., yea),
may Jahveh so do! may Jahveh perform thy words which thou hast
prophesied, to bring again the vessels of Jahveh's house and all the
captives from Babylon into this place. [Jer
28:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#007). Only hear now this word that I
speak in thine ears, and in the ears of all the people. [Jer
28:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#008). The prophets that were before me
and before thee from of old, they prophesied concerning many lands and
great kingdoms, of war, and of trouble, and of pestilence. [Jer
28:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#009). The prophet that prophesieth of
peace, when the word of the prophet cometh to pass, shall be known as
the prophet that Jahveh hath truly sent. - As to אמן, yea, see on [Jer
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#005). The scope of this assent is
straightway defined in "may Jahveh so do." But in order that the hearers
may not misunderstand his assent, Jeremiah proceeds to show that
hitherto only threatening predictions have carried with them the
presumption of their being true prophecies, inasmuch as it is these
alone that have been in harmony with the predictions of all previous
prophets. ויּנּבאוּ ([Jer 28:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#008)) is
explained by the fact that "the prophets" with the accompany relative
clause is made to precede absolute-wise. In the same absolute manner the
clause "the prophet...peace" is disposed so that after the verb יוּדע
the word הנּביא is repeated. For לרעה many MSS have לרעב; manifestly an
adaptation to passages like [Jer
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#012); [Jer
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#009); [Jer
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#010); [Jer
27:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#008), [Jer
27:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#013); [Jer
29:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#017)., where sword, famine, and
pestilence are mentioned together as three modes of visitation by God;
whereas only the general word רעה seems in place here, when mentioned
alongside of "war." For this very reason Hitz. rejects רעב as being the
least difficult reading, while Ew. takes it under his protection on
account of the parallel passages, not considering that the train of
thought is different there. - The truth expressed in [Jer
28:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#009) is based on the Mosaic law
concerning prophecy, [Deu 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#021).,
where the fulfilment of the prediction is given as the test of true,
God-inspired prophecy.

[Jeremiah 28:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#010)

Had Hananiah been sent by the Lord, he might have been satisfied with
Jeremiah's opinion, and have contentedly awaited the issue. But instead
of this, he seeks by means of violence to secure credence for his
prophesying. He takes the yoke from off the neck of the prophet, and
breaks it in pieces, as he repeats before the people his former
prediction: "Thus hath Jahveh said: Even so will I break the yoke of
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all nations within two
years." - Thereupon Jeremiah went his way without answering a word,
calmly entrusting to the Lord the vindication of the truth of His own
word.

[Jeremiah 28:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 28:12</span></span>

The Lord's testimony against Hananiah. - Apparently not long after
Jeremiah had departed, he received from the Lord the commission to go to
Hananiah and to say to him: [Jer
28:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#013). "Thus saith Jahveh: Yokes of
wood hast thou broken, but hast made in place of them yokes of iron.
[Jer 28:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#014). For thus saith Jahveh of
hosts, the God of Israel: A yoke of iron I lay upon the neck of all
these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and
they shall serve him; and the beasts of the field also have I given
him." - When the prophet says: Yokes of wood hast thou broken, etc., we
are not to understand him as speaking of the breaking of the wooden yoke
Jeremiah had been wearing; he gives the deeper meaning of that
occurrence. By breaking Jeremiah's wooden yoke, Hananiah has only
signified that the yoke Nebuchadnezzar lays on the nations will not be
so easily broken as a wooden one, but is of iron, i.e., not to be
broken. The plural "yokes" is to be explained by the emblematical import
of the words, and is not here to be identified, as it sometimes may be,
with the singular, [Jer 28:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#010). [Jer
28:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#014) shows in what sense Hananiah put
an iron yoke in the place of the wooden one: Jahveh will lay iron yokes
on all nations, that they may serve the king of Babel. Hananiah's
breaking the wooden yoke does not alter the divine decree, but is made
to contribute to its fuller revelation. With the last clause of [Jer
28:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#014), cf. [Jer
27:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#006). - Hereupon Jeremiah forewarns
the false prophets what is to be God's punishment on them for their
false and audacious declarations. [Jer
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#015). "Hear now, Hananiah: Jahveh
hath not sent thee, and thou hast made this people to believe a lie.
[Jer 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#016). Therefore thus saith
Jahveh: Behold, I cast thee from off the face of the earth; this year
shalt thou die, for thou hast spoken rebellion against Jahveh." "The
year" = this year, as in [Isa 37:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#030).
The words "for thou hast spoken," etc., recall [Deu
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#006). They involve an application to
Hananiah's case of the command there given to put such a prophet to
death, and show how it can with justice be said that the Lord will cast
him from off the face of the earth. The verb משׁלּחך is chosen for the
sake of the play on לא שׁלחך. God has not sent him as prophet to His
people, but will send him away from off the earth, i.e., cause him to
die. - In [Jer 28:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#017) it is recorded
that this saying was soon fulfilled. Hananiah died in the seventh month
of that year, i.e., two months after his controversy with Jeremiah (cf.
[Jer 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#001)).
