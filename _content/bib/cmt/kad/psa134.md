### [Psalms Chapter 134](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

Night-Watch Greeting and Counter-Greeting

This Psalm consists of a greeting, [Psa
134:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#001), and the reply thereto. The
greeting is addressed to those priests and Levites who have the
night-watch in the Temple; and this antiphon is purposely placed at the
end of the collection of Songs of degrees in order to take the place of
a final beracha. In this sense Luther styles this Psalm epiphonema
superiorum. It is also in other respects (vid., Symbolae, p. 66) an
appropriate finale.

[Psalms 134:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 134:1</span></span>

The Psalm begins, like its predecessor, with הנּה; there is directs
attention to an attractive phenomenon, here to a duty which springs from
the office. For that it is not the persons frequenting the Temple who
are addressed is at once clear from the fact that the tarrying of these
in the Temple through the night, when such a thing did actually occur
([Luk 2:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#037)), was only an exception.
And then, however, from the fact that עמד is the customary word for the
service of the priests and Levites, [Deu
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#008); [Deu
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#007); [Ch1
23:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#030); [Ch2
29:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#011) (cf. on [Isa
61:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#010), and [Psa
110:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#004)), which is also continued in the
night, [Ch1 9:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#033). Even the Targum
refers [Psa 134:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#001) to the Temple-watch.
In the second Temple the matter was arranged thus. After midnight the
chief over the gate-keepers took the keys of the inner Temple and went
with some of the priests through the little wicket of the Fire Gate
(שׁער בית המוקד). In the inner court this patrol divided into two
companies, each with a burning torch; one company turned west, the other
east, and so they compassed the court to see whether everything was in
readiness for the service of the dawning day. At the bakers' chamber, in
which the Mincha of the high priest was baked (לשׁכת עשׂי הביתין), they
met with the cry: All is well. In the meanwhile the rest of the priests
also arose, bathed, and put on their garments. Then they went into the
stone chamber (one half of which was the place of session of the
Sanhedrim), where, under the superintendence of the chief over the
drawing of the lots and of a judge, around whom stood all the priests in
their robes of office, the functions of the priests in the service of
the coming day were assigned to them by lot ([Luk
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#009)). Accordingly Tholuck, with Kster,
regards [Psa 134:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#001). and [Psa
134:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#003) as the antiphon of the
Temple-watch going off duty and those coming on. It might also be the
call and counter-call with which the watchmen greeted one another when
they met. But according to the general keeping of the Psalm, [Psa
134:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#001). have rather to be regarded as a
call to devotion and intercession, which the congregation addresses to
the priests and Levites entrusted with the night-service in the Temple.
It is an error to suppose that "in the nights" can be equivalent to
"early and late." If the Psalter contains Morning Psalms ([Psa
3:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#001), [Psa
63:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#001)) and Evening Psalms ([Psa
4:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#001), [Psa
141:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#001)), why should it then not
contain a vigil Psalm? On this very ground Venema's idea too, that
בּלּילות is syncopated from בּהלּילות, "with Hallels, i.e., praises," is
useless. Nor is there any reason for drawing ἐν ταῖς νυξίν, as the lxx
does, to [Psa 134:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#002),

(Note: The lxx adjusts the shortening of [Psa
134:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#001) arising from this, by reading
בחצרות בית אלהינו העמדים בבית ה after [Psa
135:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#002).)

or, what would be more natural, to the בּרכוּ that opens the Psalm,
since it is surely not strange that, so long as the sanctuary was
standing, a portion of the servants of God who ministered in it had to
remain up at night to guard it, and to see to it that nothing was
wanting in the preparations for the early service. That this ministering
watching should be combined with devotional praying is the purport of
the admonition in [Psa 134:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#002). Raising
suppliant hands (ידכם, negligently written for ידיכם) towards the Most
Holy Place (τὰ ἅγια), they are to bless Jahve. קדשׁ (according to B.
Sota 39a, the accusative of definition: in holiness, i.e., after washing
of hands), in view of [Psa 28:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#002); [Psa
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#008); [Psa
138:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#002) (cf. רום in [Hab
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#010)), has to be regarded as the
accusative of the direction.

[Psalms 134:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 134:3</span></span>

Calling thus up to the Temple-hill, the church receives from above the
benedictory counter-greeting: Jahve bless thee out of Zion (as in [Psa
128:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#005)), the Creator of heaven and
earth (as in [Psa 115:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#015); [Psa
121:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#002); [Psa
124:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#008)). From the time of [Num
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#024) jebaréchja is the ground-form of
the priestly benediction. It is addressed to the church as one person,
and to each individual in this united, unit-like church.
