<p>  1  Then began Job, and said: 
<p>  2  Oh that my vexation were but weighed,
<p>And they would put my suffering in the balance against it!
<p>  3  Then it would be heavier than the sand of the sea:
<p>Therefore my words are rash.
<p>  4  The arrows of the Almighty are in me,
<p>The burning poison whereof drinketh up my spirit;
<p>The terrors of Eloah set themselves in array against me.
<p>Vexation (&#1499;&#1468;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;) is what Eliphaz has reproached him with (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#002">Job 5:2</A>). Job wishes that his vexation were placed in one scale and his &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; (Keri &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492;) in the other, and weighed together (&#1497;&#1495;&#1491;). The noun &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; (&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492;), from &#1492;&#1493;&#1492; (&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;), flare, hiare, signifies properly hiatus, then vorago, a yawning gulf, &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;, then some dreadful calamity (vid., Hupfeld on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#010">Psa 5:10</A>). &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;, like &#1504;&#1496;&#1500;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#015">Isa 11:15</A>, to raise the balance, as pendere, to let it hang down; attollant instead of the passive. This is his desire; and if they but understood the matter, it would then be manifest (&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1470;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#013">Job 3:13</A>, which see), or: indeed then would it be manifest (&#1499;&#1468;&#1497; certainly in this inferential position has an affirmative signification: vid., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#022">Gen 26:22</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#032">Gen 29:32</A>, and comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#034">Sa1 25:34</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#027">Sa2 2:27</A>) that his suffering is heavier than the unmeasurable weight of the sand of the sea. &#1497;&#1499;&#1489;&#1468;&#1491; is neuter with reference to &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;. &#1500;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;, with the tone on the penult., which is not to be accounted for by the rhythm as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#020">Psa 37:20</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#007">Psa 137:7</A>, cannot be derived from &#1500;&#1506;&#1492;, but only from &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;, not however in the signification to suck down, but from &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506; = &#1500;&#1506;&#1492;, Arab. lagiya or also laga&#770;, temere loqui, inania effutire, - a signification which suits excellently here.
<p>(Note: &#1497;&#1500;&#1506;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#025">Pro 20:25</A>, which is doubly accented, and must be pronounced as oxytone, has also this meaning: the snare of a man who has thoughtlessly uttered what is holy (an interjectional clause = such an one has implicated himself), and after (having made) vows will harbour care (i.e., whether he will be able to fulfil them).)
<p>His words are like those of one in delirium. &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497; is to be explained according to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#003">Psa 38:3</A>; &#1495;&#1502;&#1514;&#1501;, according to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#015">Psa 7:15</A>. &#1497;&#1506;&#1512;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; is short for &#1506;&#1500;&#1497; &#1502;&#1500;&#1495;&#1502;&#1492; &#1497;&#1506;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497;, they make war against me, set themselves in battle array against me. Bttcher, without brachylogy: they cause me to arm myself, put one of necessity on the defensive, which does not suit the subject. The terrors of God strike down all defence. The wrath of God is irresistible. The sting of his suffering, however, is the wrath of God which his spirit drinks as a draught of poison (comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#020">Job 21:20</A>), and consequently wrings from him, even from his deepest soul, the thought that God is become his enemy: therefore his is an endless suffering, and therefore is it that he speaks so despondingly. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#005">Job 6:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">job 6:5</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>  5  Doth the wild ass bray at fresh grass?
<p>Or loweth an ox over good fodder?
<p>  6  Is that which is tasteless eaten unsalted?
<p>Or is there flavour in the white of an egg?
<p>  7  That which my soul refused to touch,
<p>The same is as my loathsome food.
<p>The meaning of the first two figures is: He would not complain, if there were really no cause for it; of the two others: It is not to be expected that he should smile at his suffering, and enjoy it as delicate food. &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493; I have translated "over good fodder," for &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500; is mixed fodder of different kinds of grain, farrago. "Without salt" is virtually adjective to &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1500;, insipid, tasteless. What is without salt one does not relish, and there is no flavour in the slime of the yolk of an egg, i.e., the white of an egg (Targ.), 
<p>(Note: Saadia compares b. Aboda zara, 40, a, where it is given as a mark of the purity of the eggs in the roe of fish: &#1502;&#1489;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1493;&#1495;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503; &#1502;&#1489; &#1502;&#1489;&#1495;&#1493;&#1509; &#1495;&#1500;&#1489;&#1493;&#1503;, when the white is outside and the yellow within.)
<p>or in the slime of purslain (according to Chalmetho in the Peschito, Arab. h&#803;amqa&#770;), fatua = purslain), which is less probable on account of &#1512;&#1497;&#1512; (slime, not: broth): there is no flavour so that it can be enjoyed. Thus is it with his sufferings. Those things which he before inwardly detested (dirt and dust of leprosy) are now sicut fastidiosa cibi mei, i.e., as loathsome food which he must eat. The first clause, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#007">Job 6:7</A>, must be taken as an elliptic relative clause forming the subject: vid., Ges. 123, 3, c. Such disagreeable counsel is now like his unclean, disgusting diet. Eliphaz desires him to take them as agreeable. &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497; in &#1499;&#1468;&#1491;&#1512;&#1497; is taken by Ges. Ew., Hahn, Schlottm., Olsh. (165, b), as constr. from &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;, sickness, filth; but &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;, as plur. from &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1492;, sick, unclean (especially of female menstruation, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#022">Isa 30:22</A>), as Heiligst. among modern commentators explains it, is far more suitable. Hitz. (as anonym. reviewer of Ewald's Job in the liter. Centralblatt) translates: they (my sufferings) are the morsels of my food; but the explanation of &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; is not correct, nor is it necessary to go to the Arabic for an explanation of &#1499;&#1468;&#1491;&#1512;&#1497;. It is also unnecessary, with Bttcher, to read &#1499;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1497; (such is my food in accordance with my disease); Job does not here speak of his diet as an invalid. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#008">Job 6:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">job 6:8</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>  8  Would that my request were fulfilled,
<p>And that Eloah would grant my expectation,
<p>  9  That Eloah were willing and would crush me,
<p>Let loose His hand and cut me off:
<p>10  Then I should still have comfort - 
<p>(I should exult in unsparing pain) - 
<p>That I have not disowned the words of the Holy One.
<p>His wish refers to the ending of his suffering by death. Hupfeld prefers to read &#1493;&#1514;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497; instead of &#1493;&#1514;&#1511;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#008">Job 6:8</A>); but death, which he desires, he even indeed expects. This is just the paradox, that not life, but death, is his expectation. "Cut me off," i.e., my soul or my life, my thread of life (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#008">Job 27:8</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#012">Isa 38:12</A>). The optative &#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; &#1502;&#1497; (Ges. 136, 1) is followed by optative futt., partly of the so-called jussive form, as &#1497;&#1488;&#1500;, velit (Hiph. from &#1493;&#1488;&#1500;, velle), and &#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;, solvat (Hiph. from &#1504;&#1514;&#1512;). In the phrase &#1497;&#1491; &#1492;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;, the stretching out of the hand is regarded as the loosening of what was hitherto bound. The conclusion begins with &#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492;&#1497;, just like <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#005">Job 13:5</A>. But it is to be asked whether by consolation speedy death is to be understood, and the clause with &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; gives the ground of his claim for the granting of the wish, - or whether he means that just this: not having disowned the words of the Holy One (comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#011">Job 23:11</A>., and &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1470;&#1488;&#1500; in the mouth of Balaam, the non-Israelitish prophet, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#004">Num 24:4</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#016">Num 24:16</A>), would be his consolation in the midst of death. With Hupfeld we decide in favour of the latter, with <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#050">Psa 119:50</A> in view: this consciousness of innocence is indeed throughout the whole book Job's shield and defence. If, however, &#1504;&#1495;&#1502;&#1514;&#1497; (with Kametz impurum) points towards &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, quod, etc., the clause &#1493;&#1488;&#1505;&#1500;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492; is parenthetical. The cohortative is found thus parenthetical with a conjunctive sense also elsewhere (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006">Psa 40:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#018">Psa 51:18</A>). Accordingly: my comfort - I would exult, etc. - would be that I, etc. The meaning of &#1505;&#1500;&#1491;, tripudiare, is confirmed by the lxx &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;, in connection with the Arabic s&#803;alada (of a galloping horse which stamps hard with its fore-feet), according to which the Targ. also translates &#1493;&#1488;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506; (I will rejoice).
<p>(Note: The primary meaning of &#1505;&#1500;&#1491;, according to the Arabic, is to be hard, then, to tread hard, firm, as in pulsanda tellus; whereas the poetry of the synagogue (Pijut) uses &#1505;&#1500;&#1468;&#1491; in the signification to supplicate, and &#1505;&#1500;&#1491;, litany (not: hymn, as Zunz gives it); and the Mishna-talmudic &#1505;&#1500;&#1491; signifies to singe, burn one's self, and to draw back affrighted.)
<p>For &#1497;&#1495;&#1502;&#1500; &#1500;&#1488;, comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#014">Isa 30:14</A>. (break in pieces unsparingly). &#1497;&#1495;&#1502;&#1500; &#1500;&#1488; certainly appears as though it must be referred to God (Ew., Hahn, Schlottm., and others), since &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492; sounds feminine; but one can either pronounce &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492; = &#1495;&#1497;&#1500; as Milel (Hitz.), or take &#1497;&#1495;&#1502;&#1500; &#1500;&#1488; adverbially, and not as an elliptical dependent clause (as Ges. 147, rem. 1), but as virtually an adjective: in pain unsparing. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#011">Job 6:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">job 6:11</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>11  What is my strength, that I should wait,
<p>And my end, that I should be patient?
<p>12  Is my strength like the strength of stones?
<p>Or is my flesh brazen?
<p>13  Or am I then not utterly helpless,
<p>And continuance is driven from me?
<p>The meaning of the question (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#011">Job 6:11</A>); is: Is not my strength already so wasted away, and an unfortunate end so certain to me, that a long calm waiting is as impossible as it is useless? &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1498;, to draw out the soul, is to extend and distribute the intensity of the emotion, to be forbearing, to be patient. The question (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#011">Job 6:11</A>) is followed by &#1488;&#1501;, usual in double questions: or is my strength stone, etc. &#1492;&#1488;&#1501;, which is so differently explained by commentators, is after all to be explained best from Num. 17:28, the only other passage in which it occurs. Here it is the same as &#1492; &#1488;&#1501;, and in Num. &#1492;&#1500;&#1488; &#1488;&#1501;: or is it not so: we shall perish quickly altogether? Thus we explain the passage before us. The interrogative &#1492; is also sometimes used elsewhere for &#1492;&#1500;&#1488;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#004">Job 20:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#001">Job 41:1</A> (Ges. 153, 3); the additional &#1488;&#1501; stands per inversionem in the second instead of the first place: nonne an = an nonne, annon: or is it not so: is not my help in me = or am I not utterly helpless? Ewald explains differently (356, a), according to which &#1488;&#1501;, from the formula of an oath, is equivalent to &#1500;&#1488;. The meaning is the same. Continuance, &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, i.e., power of endurance, reasonable prospect is driven away, frightened away from him, is lost for him. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#014">Job 6:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">job 6:14</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>14  To him who is consumed gentleness is due from his friend,
<p>Otherwise he might forsake the fear of the Almighty.
<p>15  My brothers are become false as a torrent,
<p>As the bed of torrents which vanish away - 
<p>16  They were blackish from ice,
<p>Snow is hidden in them - 
<p>17  In the time, when warmth cometh to them, they are destroyed.
<p>It becometh hot, they are extinguished from their place.
<p>Ewald supplies between <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#014">Job 6:14</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#014">Job 6:14</A> two lines which have professedly fallen out ("from a brother sympathy is due to the oppressed of God, in order he may not succumb to excessive grief"). Hitzig strongly characterizes this interpolation as a "pure swindle." There is really nothing wanting; but we need not even take &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;, with Hitz., in the signification reproach (like <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#034">Pro 14:34</A>): if reproach cometh to the sufferer from his friend, he forsaketh the fear of God. &#1502;&#1505; (from &#1502;&#1505;&#1505;, liquefieri) is one who is inwardly melted, the disheartened. Such an one should receive &#1495;&#1505;&#1491; from his friend, i.e., that he should restore him &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#836;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#001">Gal 6:1</A>). The waw (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#014">Job 6:14</A>) is equivalent to alioqui with the future subjunctive (vid., Ges. 127, 5). Harshness might precipitate him into the abyss from which love will keep him back. So Schnurrer: Afflicto exhibenda est ab amico ipsius humanitas, alioqui hic reverentiam Dei exuit. Such harshness instead of charity meets him from his brothers, i.e., friends beloved as brothers. In vain he has looked to them for reviving consolation. Theirs is no comfort; it is like the dried-up water of a wady. &#1504;&#1495;&#1500; is a mountain or forest brook, which comes down from the height, and in spring is swollen by melting ice and the snow that thaws on the mountain-tops; &#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;, i.e., a torrent swollen by winter water. The melting blocks of ice darken the water of such a wady, and the snow falling together is quickly hidden in its bosom (&#1492;&#1514;&#1506;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501;). If they begin to be warmed (Pual &#1494;&#1512;&#1489;, cognate to &#1510;&#1512;&#1489;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#003">Eze 21:3</A>, aduri, and &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1507;, comburere), suddenly they are reduced to nothing (&#1504;&#1510;&#1502;&#1514;, exstingui); they vanish away &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;, when it becomes hot. The suffix is, with Ew., Olsh., and others, to be taken as neuter; not with Hirz., to be referred to a suppressed &#1488;&#1514;: when the season grows hot. job bewails the disappointment he has experienced, the "decline" of charity 
<p>(Note: Oetinger says that <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#015">Job 6:15-20</A> describe those who get "consumption" when they are obliged to extend "the breasts of compassion" to their neighbour.)
<p>still further, by keeping to the figure of the mountain torrent. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#018">Job 6:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">job 6:18</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>18  The paths of their course are turned about,
<p>They go up in the waste and perish.
<p>19  The travelling bands of Tma looked for them,
<p>The caravans of Saba hoped for them;
<p>20  They were disappointed on account of their trust,
<p>They came thus far, and were red with shame.
<p>As the text is pointed, &#1488;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#018">Job 6:18</A>, are the paths of the torrents. Hitz., Ew., and Schlottm., however, correct &#1488;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;, caravans, which Hahn even thinks may be understood without correction, since he translates: the caravans of their way are turned about (which is intended to mean: aside from the way that they are pursuing), march into the desert and perish (i.e., because the streams on which they reckoned are dried up). So, in reality, all modern commentators understand it; but is it likely that the poet would let the caravans perish in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#018">Job 6:18</A>, and in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#019">Job 6:19</A>. still live? With this explanation, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#019">Job 6:19</A>. drag along tautologically, and the feebler figure follows the stronger. Therefore we explain as follows: the mountain streams, &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, flow off in shallow serpentine brooks, and the shallow waters completely evaporate by the heat of the sun. &#1489;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; &#1506;&#1500;&#1492; signifies to go up into nothing (comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#023">Isa 40:23</A>), after the analogy of &#1489;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;, to pass away in smoke. Thus e.g., also Mercier: in auras abeunt, in nihilum rediguntur. What next happens is related as a history, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#019">Job 6:19</A>., hence the praett. Job compares his friends to the wady swollen by ice and snow water, and even to the travelling bands themselves languishing for water. He thirsts for friendly solace, but the seeming comfort which his friends utter is only as the scattered meandering waters in which the mountain brook leaks out. The sing. &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1495; individualizes; it is unnecessary with Olsh. to read &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;.

<p>21  For now ye are become nothing;
<p>You see misfortune, and are affrighted.
<p>22  Have I then said, Give unto me,
<p>And give a present for me from your substance,
<p>23  And deliver me from the enemy's hand,
<p>And redeem me from the hand of the tyrant?
<p>In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#021">Job 6:21</A>, the reading wavers between &#1500;&#1493; and &#1500;&#1488;, with the Keri &#1500;&#1493;; but &#1500;&#1493;, which is consequently the lectio recepta, gives no suitable meaning, only in a slight degree appropriate, as this: ye are become it, i.e., such a mountain brook; for &#1492;&#1497;&#1497;&#1514;&#1501; is not to be translated, with Stickel and others, estis, but facti estis. The Targum, however, translates after the Chethib: ye are become as though ye had never been, i.e., nothingness. Now, since &#1500;&#1488;, Aramaic &#1500;&#1492;, can (as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#032">Dan 4:32</A> shows) be used as a substantive (a not = a null), and the thought: ye are become nothing, your friendship proves itself equal to null, suits the imagery just used, we decide in favour of the Chethib; then in the figure the &#1489;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; &#1506;&#1500;&#1492; corresponds most to this, and is also, therefore, not to be explained away. The lxx, Syr., Vulg., translate &#1500;&#1497; instead of &#1500;&#1493;: ye are become it (such deceitful brooks) to me. Ewald proposes to read &#1500;&#1497; &#1492;&#1497;&#1497;&#1514;&#1501; &#1506;&#1514;&#1492; &#1499;&#1503; (comp. the explanation, Ges. 137, rem. 3), - a conjecture which puts aside all difficulty; but the sentence with &#1500;&#1488; commends itself as being bolder and more expressive. All the rest explains itself. It is remarkable that in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#021">Job 6:21</A> the reading &#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; is also found, instead of &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;: ye dreaded misfortune, and ye were then affrighted. &#1492;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; is here, as an exception, properispomenon, according to Ges. 29, 3. &#1499;&#1468;&#1495;, as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#010">Pro 5:10</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#020">Lev 26:20</A>, what one has obtained by putting forth one's strength, syn. &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;, outward strength.

<p>24  Teach me, and I will be silent,
<p>And cause me to understand wherein I have failed.
<p>25  How forcible are words in accordance with truth!
<p>But what doth reproof from you reprove?
<p>26  Do you think to reprove words?
<p>The words of one in despair belong to the wind.
<p>27  Ye would even cast lots for the orphan,
<p>And traffic about your friend.
<p>&#1504;&#1502;&#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#025">Job 6:25</A>, in the signification of &#1504;&#1502;&#1500;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#103">Psa 119:103</A>), would suit very well: how smooth, delicate, sweet, are, etc. (Hirz., Ew., Schlottm.); but this meaning does not suit <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#003">Job 16:3</A>. Hupfeld, by comparison with mar, bitter, translates: quantumvis acerba; but &#1502;&#1492; may signify quidquid, though not quantumvis. Hahn compares the Arabic verb to be sick, and translates: in what respect are right words bad; but physical disease and ethical badness are not such nearly related ideas. Ebrard: honest words are not taken amiss; but with an inadmissible application of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#003">Job 16:3</A>. Von Gerl. is best: how strong or forcible are, etc. &#1502;&#1512;&#1509; is taken as related to &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1509;, in the signification to penetrate; Hiph. to goad; Niph. to be furnished with the property of penetrating, - used here of penetrating speech; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#008">Kg1 2:8</A>, of a curse inevitably carried out; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#010">Mic 2:10</A>, of unsparing destruction. Words which keep the straight way to truth, go to the heart; on the contrary, what avails the reproving from you, i.e., which proceeds from you? &#1492;&#1493;&#1499;&#1495;, inf. absol. as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#027">Pro 25:27</A>, and in but a few other passages as subject; &#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1501;, as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#015">Job 5:15</A>, the sword going forth out of their mouth. In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#026">Job 6:26</A> the waw introduces a subordinate adverbial clause: while, however, the words of one in despair belong to the wind, that they may be carried away by it, not to the judgment which retains and analyzes them, without considering the mood of which they are the hasty expression. The futt. express the extent to which their want of feeling would go, if the circumstances for it only existed; they are subjunctive, as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#013">Job 3:13</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#016">Job 3:16</A>. &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1500;, the lot, is to be supplied to &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#042">Sa1 14:42</A>. The verb &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;, however, does not here signify to dig, so that &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1514;, a pit, should be supplied (Heiligst.), still less: dig out earth, and cast it on any one (Ebrard); but has the signification of buying and selling with &#1506;&#1500; of the object, exactly like <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#027">Job 39:27</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#028">Job 6:28</A></p>

<p>28  And now be pleased to observe me keenly,
<p>I will not indeed deceive you to your face.
<p>29  Try it again, then: let there be no injustice;
<p>Try it again, my righteousness still stands.
<p>30  Is there wrong on my tongue?
<p>Or shall not my palate discern iniquity?
<p>He begs them to observe him more closely; &#1489;&#1468; &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;, as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#011">Ecc 2:11</A>, to observe scrutinizingly. &#1488;&#1501; is the sign of negative asseveration (Ges. 155, 2, f). He will not indeed shamelessly give them the lie, viz., in respect to the greatness and inexplicableness of his suffering. The challenging &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; we do not translate: retrace your steps, but: begin afresh, to which both the following clauses are better suited. So Schlottm. and von Gerlach. Hahn retains the Chethib &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1489;&#1497;, in the signification: my answer; but that is impossible: to answer is &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;, not &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;. The &#1506;&#1493;&#1491; drawn to &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1489;&#1493; by Rebia mugrasch is more suitably joined with &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1497;&#1470;&#1489;&#1492;, in which &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; refers neutrally to the matter of which it treats. They are to try from the beginning to find that comfort which will meet the case. Their accusations are &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492;; his complaints, on the contrary, are fully justified. He does not grant that the outburst of his feeling of pain (Job 3) is &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492;: he has not so completely lost his power against temptation, that he would not restrain himself, if he should fall into &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;. Thus wickedness, which completely contaminates feeling and utterance, is called (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#004">Psa 52:4</A>).
