Thanksgiving Hymn in Honour of God Who Is Attested in the Earliest
History of Israel

We have here another Psalm closing with Hallelujah, which opens the
series of the Hodu-Psalms. Such is the name we give only to Psalms which
begin with הודו (Ps 105, Ps 107, Ps 118, Ps 136), just as we call those
which begin with הללויה (Ps 106, [Psa
111:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#001), [Psa
117:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/psa117.htm#001), Ps 135, [Psa
146:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#001)) Hallelujah-Psalms
(alleluiatici). The expression להלּל וּלהודות, which frequently occurs
in the books of Chronicles, Ezra, and Nehemiah, points to these two
kinds of Psalms, or at least to their key-notes.

The festival song which David, according to [Ch1
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#007), handed over to Asaph and his
brethren for musical execution at the setting down of the Ark and the
opening of divine service on Zion, is, so far as its first part is
concerned ([Ch1 16:8-22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#008)), taken from
our Psalm ([Psa 105:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#001)), which is then
followed by [Psa 96:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001) as a second
part, and is closed with [Psa 106:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#001),
[Psa 106:47-48](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#047). Hitzig regards the
festival song in the chronicler as the original, and the respective
parallels in the Psalms as "layers or shoots." "The chronicler," says
he, "there produces with labour, and therefore himself seeking foreign
aid, a song for a past that is dead." But the transition from [Psa
105:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#022) to [Psa
105:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#023) and from [Psa
105:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#033) to [Psa
105:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#034), so devoid of connection, the
taking over of the verse out of Ps 106 referring to the Babylonian exile
into [Psa 105:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#035), and even of the
doxology of the Fourth Book, regarded as an integral part of the Psalm,
into [Psa 105:36](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#036), refute that
perversion of the right relation which has been attempted in the
interest of the Maccabaean Psalms. That festival song in the chronicler,
as has been shown again very recently by Riehm and Kצhler, is a
compilation of parts of songs already at hand, arranged for a definite
purpose. Starting on the assumption that the Psalms as a whole are
Davidic (just as all the Proverbs are Salomonic), because David called
the poetry of the Psalms used in religious worship into existence, the
attempt is made in that festival song to represent the opening of the
worship on Zion, at that time in strains belonging to the Davidic
Psalms.

So far as the subject-matter is concerned, Psalms 105 attaches itself to
the Asaph Ps 78, which recapitulates the history of Israel. The
recapitulation here, however, is made not with any didactic purpose, but
with the purpose of forming a hymn, and does not come down beyond the
time of Moses and Joshua. Its source is likewise the Tפra as it now lies
before us. The poet epitomizes what the Tפra narrates, and clothes it in
a poetic garb.

[Psalms 105:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 105:1</span></span>

Invitation to the praise - praise that resounds far and wide among the
peoples - of the God who has become manifest wondrously in the deeds and
words connected with the history of the founding of Israel. הודה לה, as
in [Psa 33:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#002); [Psa
75:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#002), of a praising and thankful
confession offered to God; קרא בשׁם ה, to call with the name of Jahve,
i.e., to call upon it, of an audible, solemn attestation of God in
prayer and in discourse (Symmachus, κηρύσσετε). The joy of heart

(Note: The Mugrash of ישׂמח with the following Legarme seems here to be
of equal value with Zakeph, [Ch1
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#010).)

that is desired is the condition of a joyous opening of the mouth and
Israel's own stedfast turning towards Jahve, the condition of all
salutary result; for it is only His "strength" that breaks through all
dangers, and His "face" that lightens up all darkness. משׁפּטי־פּיו, as
[Psa 105:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#007) teaches, are God's judicial
utterances, which have been executed without any hindrance, more
particularly in the case of the Egyptians, their Pharaoh, and their
gods. The chronicler has פּיהוּ and זרע ישׂראל, which is so far
unsuitable as one does not know whether עבדו is to be referred to
"Israel" the patriarch, or to the "seed of Israel," the nation; the
latter reference would be deutero-Isaianic. In both texts the lxx reads
עבדו (ye His servants).

[Psalms 105:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 105:7</span></span>

The poet now begins himself to do that to which he encourages Israel.
Jahve is Israel's God: His righteous rule extends over the whole earth,
whilst His people experience His inviolable faithfulness to His
covenant. יהוה in [Psa 105:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#007) is in
apposition to הוּא, for the God who bears this name is as a matter of
course the object of the song of praise. זכר is the perfect of
practically pledges certainty (cf. [Psa
111:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#005), where we find instead the
future of confident prospect). The chronicler has זכרוּ instead (lxx
again something different: μνημονεύωμεν); but the object is not the
demanding but the promissory side of the covenant, so that consequently
it is not Israel's remembering but God's that is spoken of. He remembers
His covenant in all time to come, so that exile and want of independence
as a state are only temporary, exceptional conditions. צוּה has its
radical signification here, to establish, institute, [Psa
111:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#009). לאלף דּור (in which expression
דור is a specifying accusative) is taken from [Deu
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#009). And since דּבר is the covenant
word of promise, it can be continued אשׁר כּרת; and [Hag
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#005) (vid., Khler thereon) shows that
אשׁר is not joined to בריתו over [Psa
105:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#008). וּשׁבוּעתו, however, is a
second object to זכר (since דּבר with what belongs to it as an
apposition is out of the question). It is the oath on Moriah ([Gen
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#016)) that is meant, which applied to
Abraham and his seed. לישׂחק (chronicler ליצחק), as in [Amo
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#009); [Jer
33:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#026). To זכר is appended ויּעמרדה;
the suffix, intended as neuter, points to what follows, viz., this, that
Canaan shall be Israel's hereditary land. From Abraham and Isaac we come
to Jacob-Israel, who as being the father of the twelve is the
twelve-tribe nation itself that is coming into existence; hence the
plural can alternate with the singular in [Psa
105:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#011). את־ארץ כּנען (chronicler,
without the את) is an accusative of the object, and חבל נחלתכם
accusative of the predicate: the land of Canaan as the province of your
own hereditary possession measured out with a measuring line ([Psa
78:55](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#055)).

[Psalms 105:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 105:12</span></span>

The poet now celebrates the divine preservation which had sway over the
small beginnings of Israel, when it made the patriarchs proof against
harm on their wanderings. "Men of number" are such as can be easily
counted, vid., the confessions in [Gen
34:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#030); [Deu
26:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#005); ויּתהלּכוּ places the claim upon
the hospitality at one time of this people and at another time of that
people in the connection with it of cause and effect. כּמעט, as a small
number, only such a small number, signifies, as being virtually an
adjective: inconsiderable, insignificant, worthless ([Pro
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#020)). בּהּ refers to Canaan. In [Psa
105:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#013) the way in which the words גּוי
and עם alternate is instructive: the former signifies the nation, bound
together by a common origin, language, country, and descent; the latter
the people, bound together by unity of government.

(Note: For this reason a king says עמּי, not גּויי; and גּוי only occurs
twice with a suffix, which refers to Jahve ([Psa
106:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#005); [Zep
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#009)); for this reason גּוי, frequently
side by side with עם, is the nobler word, e.g., in [Deu
32:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#021); [Jer
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#011); for this reason עם is frequently
added to גּוי as a dignitative predicate, [Exo
33:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#013); [Deu
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#006); and for this reason גּוים and עם
ה are used antithetically.)

The apodosis does not begin until [Psa
105:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#014). It is different in connection
with בּהיותכם in the text of the chronicler, and in this passage in the
Psalter of the Syriac version, according to which [Psa
105:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#012) ought to be jointed to the
preceding group. The variation ומממלכה instead of מממלכה is of no
consequence; but לאישׁ (to any one whomsoever) instead of אדם, in
connection with הניח, restores the current mode of expression ([Ecc
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#011); [Sa2
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#011); [Hos
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#017)) instead of one which is without
support elsewhere, but which follows the model of נתן, נטשׁ, [Gen
31:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#028) (cf. supra p. 171); whilst on
the other hand ובנביאי instead of ולנביאי substitutes an expression that
cannot be supported for the current one ([Gen
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#009); [Rut
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#021)). In [Psa
105:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#014) the poet has the three
histories of the preservation of the wives of the patriarchs in his
mind, viz., of Sarah in Egypt (Gen. 12), and of Sarah and of Rebekah
both in Philistia ([Psa 20:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#001), [Psa
26:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#001), cf. especially [Psa
26:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#011)). In the second instance God
declares the patriarch to be a "prophet" ([Psa
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#007)). The one mention has reference
to this and the other to Gen. 17, where Abram is set apart to be the
father of peoples and kings, and Sarai to be a princess. They are called
משׁיהים (a passive form) as eing God-chosen princes, and נביאים (an
intensive active form, from נבא, root נב, to divulge), not as being
inspired ones (Hupfeld), but as being God's spokesmen (cf. [Exo
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#001). with [Exo
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#015).), therefore as being the
recipients and mediators of a divine revelation.

[Psalms 105:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 105:16</span></span>

"To call up a famine" is also a prose expression in [Kg2
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#001). To break the staff of bread
(i.e., the staff which bread is to man) is a very old metaphor, [Lev
26:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#026). That the selling of Joseph was,
providentially regarded, a "sending before," he himself says in [Gen
45:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#005). [Psa
102:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#024) throws light upon the meaning
of ענּה ב. The Kerמ רגלו is just as much without any occasion to justify
it as עינו in [Ecc 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#008) (for עיניו).
The statement that iron came upon his soul is intended to say that he
had to endure in iron fetters sufferings that threatened his life. Most
expositors take בּרזל as equivalent to בּבּרזל, but Hitzig rightly takes
נפשׁו as an object, following the Targum; for ברזל as a name of an iron
fetter

(Note: Also in ancient Arabic firzil (after the Aramaic פרזלא) directly
signifies an iron fetter (and the large smith's shears for cutting the
iron), whence the verb. denom. Arab. farzala, c. acc. pers., to put any
one into iron chains. Iron is called בּרזל from בּרז, to pierce, like
the Arabic ḥdı̂d, as being the material of which pointed tools are made.)

can change its gender, as do, e.g., צפון as a name of the north wind,
and כבוד as a name of the soul. The imprisonment (so harsh at the
commencement) lasted over ten years, until at last Joseph's word cam to
pass, viz., the word concerning this exaltation which had been revealed
to him in dreams ([Gen 42:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#009)).
According to [Psa 107:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#020), דברו appears
to be the word of Jahve, but then one would expect from [Psa
105:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#019) a more parallel turn of
expression. What is meant is Joseph's open-hearted word concerning his
visions, and אמרת ה is the revelation of God conveying His promises,
which came to him in the same form, which had to try, to prove, and to
purify him (צרף as in [Psa 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#003), and
frequently), inasmuch as he was not to be raised to honour without
having in a state of deep abasement proved a faithfulness that wavered
not, and a confidence that knew no despair. The divine "word" is
conceived of as a living effectual power, as in [Psa
119:50](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#050). The representation of the
exaltation begins, according to [Gen
41:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#014), with שׁלח־מלך

(Note: Here שׁלח is united by Makkeph with the following word, to which
it hurries on, whereas in [Psa 105:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#028)
it has its own accent, a circumstance to which the Masora has directed
attention in the apophthegm: שׁלוחי דמלכא זריזין שׁלוחי דחשׁוכא מתינין
(the emissaries of the king are in haste, those of darkness are tardy);
vid., Baer, Thorath Emeth, p. 22.)

and follows [Gen 41:39-41](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#039), [Gen
41:44](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#044), very closely as to the rest,
according to which בּנפשׁו is a collateral definition to לאסּר (with an
orthophonic Dag.) in the sense of בּרצונו: by his soul, i.e., by virtue
of his will (vid., Psychology, S. 202; tr. p. 239). In consequence of
this exaltation of Joseph, Jacob-Israel came then into Egypt, and
sojourned there as in a protecting house of shelter (concerning גּוּר,
vid., supra, p. 414). Egypt is called ([Psa
105:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#023), [Psa
105:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#027)) the land of Chaam, as in [Psa
78:51](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#051); according to Plutarch, in the
vernacular the black land, from the dark ashy grey colouring which the
deposited mud of the Nile gives to the ground. There Israel became a
powerful, numerous people ([Exo 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#007);
[Deu 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#005)), greater than their
oppressors.

[Psalms 105:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">psa 105:25</span></span>

Narration of the exodus out of Egypt after the plagues that went forth
over that land. [Psa 105:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#025) tells how
the Egyptians became their "oppressors." It was indirectly God's work,
inasmuch as He gave increasing might to His people, which excited their
jealousy. The craft reached its highest pitch in the weakening of the
Israelites that was aimed at by killing all the male children that were
born. דּברי signifies facts, instances, as in [Psa
65:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#004); [Psa
145:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#005). Here, too, as in Ps 78, the
miraculous judgments of the ten plagues to not stand in exactly
historical order. The poet begins with the ninth, which was the most
distinct self-representation of divine wrath, viz., the darkness ([Exo
10:21-29](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#021)): shā'lach chō'shech. The
former word (שׁלח) has an orthophonic Gaja by the final syllable, which
warns the reader audibly to utter the guttural of the toneless final
syllable, which might here be easily slurred over. The Hiph. החשׁיך has
its causative signification here, as also in [Jer
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#016); the contracted mode of writing
with i instead of ı̂ may be occasioned by the Waw convers. [Psa
105:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#028) cannot be referred to the
Egyptians; for the expression would be a mistaken one for the final
compliance, which was wrung from them, and the interrogative way of
taking it: nonne rebellarunt, is forced: the cancelling of the לא,
however (lxx and Syriac), makes the thought halting. Hitzig proposes ולא
שׁמרו: they observed not His words; but this, too, sounds flat and
awkward when said of the Egyptians. The subject will therefore be the
same as the subject of שׂמוּ; and of Moses and Aaron, in contrast to the
behaviour at Mê-Merı̂bah ([Num 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#024);
[Num 27:14](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#014); cf. [Kg1
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#021), [Kg1
13:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#026)), it is said that this time they
rebelled not against the words (Ker, without any ground: the word) of
God, but executed the terrible commands accurately and willingly. From
the ninth plague the poet in [Psa
105:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#029) passes over to the first ([Exo
7:14-25](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#014)), viz., the red blood is
appended to the black darkness. The second plague follows, viz., the
frogs ([Exo 8:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#001)); [Psa
105:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#020) looks as though it were
stunted, but neither has the lxx read any ויבאו (ויעלו), Ex. 7:28. In
[Psa 105:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#031) he next briefly touches
upon the fourth plague, viz., the gad-fly, ערב, lxx κυνόμυια ([Exo
8:20-32](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#020), vid., on [Psa
78:45](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#045)), and the third ([Exo
8:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#016)), viz., the gnats, which are
passed over in Ps 78. From the third plague the poet in [Psa
105:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#032), [Psa
105:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#033) takes a leap over to the
seventh, viz., the hail (Ex 9:13-35). In [Psa
105:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#032) he has [Exo
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#024) before his mind, according to
which masses of fire descended with the hail; and in [Psa
105:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#033) (as in [Psa
78:47](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#047)) he fills in the details of [Exo
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#025). The seventh plague is followed
by the eighth in [Psa 105:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#034), [Psa
105:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#035), viz., the locust (Ex 10:1-20),
to which ילק (the grasshopper) is the parallel word here, just as חסיל
(the cricket) is in [Psa 78:46](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#046). The
expression of innumerableness is the same as in [Psa
104:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#025). The fifth plague, viz., the
pestilence, murrain ([Exo 9:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#001)), and
the sixth, viz., שׁחין, boils ([Exo
9:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#008)), are left unmentioned; and the
tenth plague closes, viz., the smiting of the first-born ([Exo
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#001).), which [Psa
105:36](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#036) expresses in the Asaphic
language of [Psa 78:51](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#051). Without any
mention of the institution of the Passover, the tenth plague is followed
by the departure with the vessels of silver and gold asked for from the
Egyptians ([Exo 12:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#035); [Exo
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#002); [Exo
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#022)). The Egyptians were glad to get
rid of the people whose detention threatened them with total destruction
([Exo 12:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#033)). The poet here draws from
[Isa 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#027); [Isa
14:31](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#031); [Isa
63:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#013), and [Exo
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#016). The suffix of שׁבטיו refers to
the chief subject of the assertion, viz., to God, according to [Psa
122:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#004), although manifestly enough the
reference to Israel is also possible ([Num
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#002)).

[Psalms 105:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">psa 105:39</span></span>

Now follows the miraculous guidance through the desert to the taking
possession of Canaan. The fact that the cloud (ענן, root ען, to meet, to
present itself to view, whence the Arabic ‛ănăn, the visible outward
side of the vault of heaven) by day, and becoming like fire by night,
was their guide ([Exo 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#021)), is left
out of consideration in [Psa 105:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#039).
With למסך we are not to associate the idea of a covering against foes,
[Exo 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#019)., but of a covering from
the smiting sun, for פּרשׁ ([Exo
40:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#019)), as in [Isa
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#005)., points to the idea of a canopy.
In connection with the sending of the quails the tempting character of
the desire is only momentarily dwelt upon, the greater emphasis is laid
on the omnipotence of the divine goodness which responded to it. שׁאלוּ
is to be read instead of שׁאל, the w before w having been overlooked;
and the Kerמ writes and points שׂליו (like סתיו, עניו) in order to
secure the correct pronunciation, after the analogy of the plural
termination יו-. The bread of heaven ([Psa
78:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#024).) is the manna. In [Psa
105:41](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#041) the giving of water out of the
rock at Rephidim and at Kadesh are brought together; the expression
corresponds better to the former instance ([Exo
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#006), cf. [Num
20:11](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#011)). הלכוּ refers to the waters,
and נהר for כּנּהרות, [Psa 78:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#016), is,
as in [Psa 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#014), an equation instead
of a comparison. In this miraculous escort the patriarchal promise moves
on towards its fulfilment; the holy word of promise, and the stedfast,
proved faith of Abraham - these were the two motives. The second את is,
like the first, a sign of the object, not a preposition (lxx, Targum),
in connection with which [Psa 105:42](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#042)
would be a continuation of [Psa
105:42](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#042), dragging on without any
parallelism. Joy and exulting are mentioned as the mood of the redeemed
ones with reference to the festive joy displayed at the Red Sea and at
Sinai. By [Psa 105:43](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#043) one is reminded
of the same descriptions of the antitype in Isaiah, [Isa
35:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#010); [Isa
51:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#011); [Isa
55:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#012), just as [Psa
105:41](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#041) recalls [Isa
48:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#021). "The lands of the heathen" are
the territories of the tribes of Canaan. עמל is equivalent to יגיע in
[Isa 45:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#014) : the cultivated ground,
the habitable cities, and the accumulated treasures. Israel entered upon
the inheritance of these peoples in every direction. As an independent
people upon ground that is theirs by inheritance, keeping the revealed
law of their God, was Israel to exhibit the pattern of a holy nation
moulded after the divine will; and, as the beginning of the Psalm shows,
to unite the peoples to themselves and their God, the God of redemption,
by the proclamation of the redemption which has fallen to their own lot.
