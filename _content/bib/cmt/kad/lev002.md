### [Leviticus Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#001)

[Leviticus 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 2:1</span></span>

The first kind consisted of soleth, probably from סלה = סלל to swing,
swung flour, like πάλη from πάλλω, i.e., fine flour; and for this no
doubt wheaten flour was always used, even when חטּים is not added, as in
[Exo 29:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#002), to distinguish it from קמח,
or ordinary meal (σεμίδαλις: [Kg1
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#002)). The suffix in קרבּנו (his
offering) refers to נפשׁ, which is frequently construed as both
masculine and feminine ([Lev 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#002), [Lev
4:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#027), [Lev
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#001), etc.), or as masculine only ([Num
31:28](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#028)) in the sense of person, any
one. "And let him pour oil upon it, and put incense thereon (or add
incense to it)." This was not spread upon the flour, on which oil had
been poured, but added in such a way, that it could be lifted from the
minchah and burned upon the altar ([Lev
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#002)). The priest was then to take a
handful of the gift that had been presented, and cause the azcarah of it
to evaporate above (together with) all the incense. קמצו מלא: the
filling of his closed hand, i.e., as much as he could hold with his hand
full, not merely with three fingers, as the Rabbins affirm. Azcarah
(from זכר, formed like אשׁמרה from שׁמר) is only applied to Jehovah's
portion, which was burned upon the altar in the case of the
meat-offering ([Lev 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#009), [Lev
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#016), and [Lev
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#008)), the sin-offering of flour ([Lev
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#011)), and the jealousy-offering ([Num
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#026)), and to the incense added to the
shew-bread ([Lev 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#007)). It does not
mean the prize portion, i.e., the portion offered for the glory of God,
as De Dieu and Rosenmller maintain, still less the fragrance-offering
(Ewald), but the memorial, or remembrance-portion, μνημόσυνον or
ἀνάμνησις ([Lev 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#007), lxx), memoriale
(Vulg.), inasmuch as that part of the minchah which was placed upon the
altar ascended in the smoke of the fire "on behalf of the giver, as a
practical mememto ('remember me') to Jehovah:" though there is no
necessity that we should trace the word to the Hiphil in consequence.
The rest of the minchah was to belong to Aaron and his sons, i.e., to
the priesthood, as a most holy thing of the firings of Jehovah. The term
"most holy" is applied to all the sacrificial gifts that were
consecrated to Jehovah, in this sense, that such portions as were not
burned upon the altar were to be eaten by the priests alone in a holy
place; the laity, and even such of the Levites as were not priests,
being prohibited from partaking of them (see at [Exo
26:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#033) and [Exo
30:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#010)). Thus the independent
meat-offerings, which were not entirely consumed upon the altar ([Lev
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#003), [Lev
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#010), [Lev
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#010); [Lev
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#012)), the sin-offerings and
trespass-offerings, the flesh of which was not burned outside the camp
([Lev 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#018), [Lev
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#022); [Lev
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#001), [Lev
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#006); [Lev
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#017); [Lev
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#013); [Num
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#009)), the shew-bread ([Lev
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#009)), and even objects put under the
ban and devoted to the Lord, whether men, cattle, or property of other
kinds ([Lev 27:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#028)), as well as the
holy incense ([Exo 30:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#036)), - in fact,
all the holy sacrificial gifts, in which there was any fear lest a
portion should be perverted to other objects, - were called most holy;
whereas the burnt-offerings, the priestly meat-offerings ([Lev
6:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#012)) and other sacrifices, which
were quite as holy, were not called most holy, because the command to
burn them entirely precluded the possibility of their being devoted to
any of the ordinary purposes of life.

[Leviticus 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lev 2:4</span></span>

The second kind consisted of pastry of fine flour and oil prepared in
different forms. The first was maapheh tannur, oven-baking: by תּנּוּר
we are not to understand a baker's over ([Hos
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#004), [Hos
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#006)), but a large pot in the room,
such as are used for baking cakes in the East even to the present day
(see my Archol. 99, 4). The oven-baking might consist either of "cakes
of unleavened meal mixed (made) with oil," or of "pancakes of unleavened
meal anointed (smeared) with oil." Challoth: probably from חלל to
pierce, perforated cakes, of a thicker kind. Rekkim: from רקק to be
beaten out thin; hence cakes or pancakes. As the latter were to be
smeared with oil, we cannot understand בּלוּל as signifying merely the
pouring of oil upon the baked cakes, but must take it in the sense of
mingled, mixed, i.e., kneaded with oil (pefurame'nous lxx, or according
to Hesychius, μεμιγμένους).

[Lev 2:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#005)

Secondly, if the minchah was an offering upon the pan, it was also to be
made of fine flour mixed with oil and unleavened. Machabath is a pan,
made, according to [Eze 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#003), of
iron-no doubt a large iron plate, such as the Arabs still use for baking
unleavened bread in large round cakes made flat and thin (Robinson,
Palestine i. 50, ii. 180). These girdles or flat pans are still in use
among the Turcomans of Syria and the Armenians (see Burckhardt, Syr. p.
1003; Tavernier, Reise 1, p. 280), whilst the Berbians and Cabyles of
Africa use shallow iron frying-pans for the purpose, and call them
tajen, - the same name, no doubt, as τήγανον, with which the lxx have
rendered machabath. These cakes were to be broken in pieces for the
minchah, and oil to be poured upon them (the inf. abs. as in [Exo
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#003); [Exo
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#008), vid., Ges. 131, 4); just as the
Bedouins break the cakes which they bake in the hot ashes into small
pieces, and prepare them for eating by pouring butter or oil upon them.

[Lev 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#007)

Thirdly, "If thy oblation be a tigel-minchah, it shall be made of fine
flour with oil." Marchesheth is not a gridiron (ἔσχαρα, lxx); but, as it
is derived from חרשׁ, ebullivit, it must apply to a vessel in which food
was boiled. We have therefore to think of cakes boiled in oil.

[Leviticus 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">lev 2:12</span></span>

The presentation of the minchah "made of these things," i.e., of the
different kinds of pastry mentioned in [Lev
2:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#004), resembled in the main that
described in [Lev 2:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#001). The מן הרים
in [Lev 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#009) corresponds to the מן קמץ
in [Lev 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#002), and does not denote any
special ceremony of heaving, as is supposed by the Rabbins and many
archaeological writers, who understand by it a solemn movement up and
down. This will be evident from a comparison of [Lev
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#003) with [Lev
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#008), [Lev
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#031), [Lev
4:35](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#035), and [Lev
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#003). In the place of ממּנּוּ ירים in
[Lev 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#008) we find מזּבח הקריב in [Lev
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#010), חלב חוּסר כּאשׁר חוּ in [Lev
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#031) and [Lev
4:35](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#035); so that מן הרים evidently
denotes simply the lifting off or removal of those parts which were to
be burned upon the altar from the rest of the sacrifice (cf. Bhr, ii.
357, and my Archologie i. p. 244-5). - In [Lev
2:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#011) there follow two laws which
were applicable to all the meat-offerings: viz., to offer nothing
leavened ([Lev 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#011)), and to salt
every meat-offering, and in fact every sacrifice, with salt ([Lev
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#013)). Every minchah was to be
prepared without leaven: "for all leaven, and all honey, ye shall not
burn a firing of it for Jehovah. As an offering of first-fruits ye may
offer them (leaven and honey, i.e., pastry made with them) to Jehovah,
but they shall not come upon the altar." Leaven and honey are mentioned
together as things which produce fermentation. Honey has also an
acidifying or fermenting quality, and was even used for the preparation
of vinegar (Plin. h. n. 11, 15; 21, 14). In rabbinical writings,
therefore, הדבישׁ signifies not only dulcedinem admittere, but
corrumpsi, fermentari, fermentescere (vid., Buxtorf, lex. chald. talm.
et rabb. p. 500). By "honey" we are to understand not grape-honey, the
dibs of the Arabs, as Rashi and Bhr do, but the honey of bees; for,
according to [Ch2 31:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#005), this alone was
offered as an offering of first-fruits along with corn, new wine, and
oil; and in fact, as a rule, this was the only honey used by the
ancients in sacrifice (see Bochart, Hieroz. iii. pp. 393ff.). The loaves
of first-fruits at the feast of Weeks were leavened; but they were
assigned to the priests, and not burned upon the altar ([Lev
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#017), [Lev
23:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#020)). So also were the cakes offered
with the vow-offerings, which were applied to the sacrificial meal ([Lev
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#013)); but not the shew-bread, as
Knobel maintains (see at [Lev 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#005).).
Whilst leaven and honey were forbidden to be used with any kind of
minchah, because of their producing fermentation and corruption, salt on
the other hand was not to be omitted from any sacrificial offering.
"Thou shalt not let the salt of the covenant of thy God cease from thy
meat-offering," i.e., thou shalt never offer a meat-offering without
salt. The meaning which the salt, with its power to strengthen food and
preserve it from putrefaction and corruption, imparted to the sacrifice,
was the unbending truthfulness of that self-surrender to the Lord
embodied in the sacrifice, by which all impurity and hypocrisy were
repelled. The salt of the sacrifice is called the salt of the covenant,
because in common life salt was the symbol of covenant; treaties being
concluded and rendered firm and inviolable, according to a well-known
custom of the ancient Greeks (see Eustathius ad Iliad. i. 449) which is
still retained among the Arabs, by the parties to an alliance eating
bread and salt together, as a sign of the treaty which they had made. As
a covenant of this kind was called a "covenant of salt," equivalent to
an indissoluble covenant ([Num 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#019);
[Ch2 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#005)), so here the salt added to
the sacrifice is designated as salt of the covenant of God, because of
its imparting strength and purity to the sacrifice, by which Israel was
strengthened and fortified in covenant fellowship with Jehovah. The
following clause, "upon (with) every sacrificial gift of thine shalt
thou offer salt," is not to be restricted to the meat-offering, as
Knobel supposes, nor to be understood as meaning that the salt was only
to be added to the sacrifice externally, to be offered with or beside
it; in which case the strewing of salt upon the different portions of
the sacrifice ([Eze 43:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#024); [Mar
9:49](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#049)) would have been a departure from
the ancient law. For korban without any further definition denotes the
sacrificial offerings generally, the bleeding quite as much as the
bloodless, and the closer definition of על הקריב (offer upon) is
contained in the first clause of the verse, "season with salt." The
words contain a supplementary rule which was applicable to every
sacrifice (bleeding and bloodless), and was so understood from time
immemorial by the Jews themselves (cf. Josephus, Ant. iii. 9, 1).

(Note: The Greeks and Romans also regarded salt as indispensable to a
sacrifice. Maxime in sacris intelligitur auctoritas salis, quando nulla
conficiuntur sine mola salsa. Plin. h. n. 31, 7, (cf. 41).)

[Leviticus 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lev 2:14</span></span>

The third kind was the meat-offering of first-fruits, i.e., of the first
ripening corn. This was to be offered in the form of "ears parched or
roasted by the fire; in other words, to be made from ears which had been
roasted at the fire. To this is added the further definition כּרמל גּרשׂ
"rubbed out of field-fruit." גּרשׂ, from גּרשׂ = גּרס, to rub to pieces,
that which is rubbed to pieces; it only occurs here and in [Lev
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#014) and [Lev
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#016). כּרמל is applied generally to a
corn-field, in [Isa 29:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#017) and [Isa
32:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#016) to cultivated ground, as
distinguished from desert; here, and in [Lev
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#014) and [Kg2
4:42](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#042), it is used metonymically for
field-fruit, and denotes early or the first-ripe corn. Corn roasted by
the fire, particularly grains of wheat, is still a very favourite food
in Palestine, Syria, and Egypt. The ears are either burnt along with the
stalks before they are quite ripe, and then rubbed out in a sieve; or
stalks of wheat are bound up in small bundles and roasted at a bright
fire, and then the grains are eaten (Seetzen, i. p. 94, iii. p. 221;
Robinson, Biblical Researches, p. 393). Corn roasted in this manner is
not so agreeable as when (as is frequently the case in harvest, [Rut
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#014)) the grains of wheat are taken
before they are quite dry and hard, and parched in a pan or upon an iron
plate, and then eaten either along with or in the place of bread
(Robinson, Pal. ii. 394). The minchah mentioned here was prepared in the
first way, viz., of roasted ears of corn, which were afterwards rubbed
to obtain the grains: it consisted, therefore, not of crushed corn or
groats, but only of toasted grains. In the place of קלוּי אביב we find
קלי ([Lev 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#014)), or קלוּי ([Jos
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#011)), afterwards employed. Oil and
incense were to be added, and the same course adopted with the offering
as in the case of the offering of flour ([Lev
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#002), [Lev
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#003)).

If therefore, all the meat-offerings consisted either of flour and
oil-the most important ingredients in the vegetable food of the
Israelites, - or of food already prepared for eating, there can be no
doubt that in them the Israelite offered his daily bread to the Lord,
though in a manner which made an essential difference between them and
the merely dedicatory offerings of the first-fruits of corn and bread.
For whilst the loaves of first-fruits were leavened, and, as in the case
of the sheaf of first-fruits, no part of them was burnt upon the altar
([Lev 23:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#010); 17, 20), every
independent meat-offering was to be prepared without leaven, and a
portion given to the Lord as fire-food, for a savour of satisfaction
upon the altar; and the rest was to be scrupulously kept from being used
by the offerer, as a most holy thing, and to be eaten at the holy place
by the sanctified priests alone, as the servants of Jehovah, and the
mediators between Him and the nation. On account of this peculiarity,
the meat-offerings cannot have denoted merely the sanctification of
earthly food, but were symbols of the spiritual food prepared and
enjoyed by the congregation of the Lord. If even the earthly life is not
sustained and nourished merely by the daily bread which a man procures
and enjoys, but by the power of divine grace, which strengthens and
blesses the food as means of preserving life; much less can the
spiritual life be nourished by earthly food, but only by the spiritual
food which a man prepares and partakes of, by the power of the Spirit of
God, from the true bread of life, or the word of God. Now, as oil in the
Scriptures is invariably a symbol of the Spirit of God as the principle
of all spiritual vis vitae, so bread-flour and bread, procured from the
seed of the field, are symbols of the word of God ([Deu
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#003); [Luk
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#011)). As God gives man corn and oil
to feed and nourish his bodily life, so He gives His people His word and
Spirit, that they may draw food from these for the spiritual life of the
inner man. The work of sanctification consists in the operation of this
spiritual food, through the right use of the means of grace for growth
in pious conversation and good works ([Mat
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#016); [Pe1
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#012)). The enjoyment of this food
fills the inner man with peace, joy, and blessedness in God. This fruit
of the spiritual life is shadowed forth in the meat-offerings. They were
to be kept free, therefore, both from the leaven of hypocrisy ([Luk
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#001)) and of malice and wickedness
([Co1 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#008)), and also from the honey of
the deliciae carnis, because both are destructive of spiritual life;
whilst, on the other hand, the salt of the covenant of God (i.e., the
purifying, strengthening, and quickening power of the covenant, by which
moral corruption was averted) and the incense of prayer were both to be
added, in order that the fruits of the spiritual life might become
well-pleasing to the Lord. It was upon this signification that the most
holy character of the meat-offerings was founded.
