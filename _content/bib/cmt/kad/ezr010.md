### [Ezra Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#001)

[Ezra 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ezr 10:1</span></span>

The separation of the strange wives from the congregation. - [Ezr
10:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#001). While Ezra was making this
confession before God, a numerous assemblage gathered around him, and
wept aloud. From this point onwards Ezra relates the further course of
events in such wise as to cast his own person in the background, and
speaks of himself in the third person. The matter of his prayer is more
definitely declared by וּכהתודּתו, and his posture in prayer by וּמתנפּל
בּכה, weeping and casting himself down (lying on his knees, [Ezr
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#005)). "Before the house of God," i.e.,
in the court of the temple. The confirmatory clause: for the people wept
much (בכה הרבּה, a weeping in mass), furnishes the motive of so great a
number of men, women, and children gathering around Ezra. Very many were
as distressed as he was at the marriages with strange wives, and
regarded them as a grievous trespass; hence they assembled weeping
around him.

[Ezra 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ezr 10:2</span></span>

Then one of the sons of Elam, Shecaniah, the son of Jehiel, stood forth
from amidst the assembly, and uttered the confession: "We have been
unfaithful towards our God by marrying strange wives, but there is yet
hope for Israel concerning this thing. We will now make a covenant with
God to put away all the strange wives and their children from the
congregation, according to the counsel of the Lord, and of those who
fear the commandment of our God, that it may be done according to the
law." Shecaniah, of the sons of Elam (comp. [Ezr
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#007); [Ezr
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#007)), is a different person from the
descendant of Zattu, mentioned [Ezr
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#005); nor is Jehiel identical with the
individual whose name occurs in [Ezr
10:26](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#026). ונּשׁב, and have brought home
strange wives. הושׁיב, to cause to dwell (in one's house), said in [Ezr
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#010), [Ezr
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#014), [Ezr
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#017), [Ezr
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#018), and [Neh
13:23](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#023), [Neh
13:27](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#027), of bringing a wife home.
Shecaniah founds his hope for Israel in this trespass upon the
circumstance, that they bind themselves by a solemn covenant before God
to put away this scandal from the congregation, and to act in conformity
with the law. To make a covenant with our God, i.e., to bind themselves
by an oath with respect to God, comp. [Ch2
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#010). הוציא, to put away - the
opposite of הושׁיב. All the wives are, according to the context, all the
strange women ([Ezr 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#002)), and that
which is born of them, their children. Instead of אדני בּעצת, according
to the counsel of the Lord, De Wette, Bertheau, and others, following
the paraphrase in the lxx and 1 Esdras, read אדני, according to the
counsel of my lord, i.e., of Ezra. But this paraphrase being of no
critical authority, there is no sufficient reason for the alteration.
For Shecaniah to call Ezra my lord sounds strange, since usually this
title was only given by servants to their master, or subjects to their
sovereign, and Shecaniah afterwards addresses him simply as thou.
Besides, Ezra had given no advice at all in this matter, and still less
had he come to any resolution about it with the God-fearing members of
the community. יעשׂה after the preceding נכרת־בּרית, we will make a
covenant, must be taken as hortative: and let it be done according to
the law. בּ חרד, caring for with trembling.

[Ezra 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ezr 10:4</span></span>

"Up! for this matter concerns thee (thou art called to carry it out),
and we are with thee (will assist thee therein); be strong (courageous)
and do it."

[Ezra 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ezr 10:5</span></span>

Then Ezra (who during this speech had continued upon his knees) arose,
and made the chiefs of the priests, of the Levites, and of all Israel
swear to do according to this word; and they swore. הזּה הדּבר is
Shecaniah's proposal to put away the strange wives.

[Ezra 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ezr 10:6</span></span>

Hereupon Ezra left the place before the house of God, and went into the
chamber of Johanan the son of Eliashib, to fast and mourn there for the
unfaithfulness (transgression) of them that had been carried away
(הגּולה מעל like [Ezr 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#004)). Johanan
the son of Eliashib cannot actually be Johanan ben Eliashib ([Neh
12:23](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#023)) the high priest, however
natural it may be to understand by the chamber of Johanan one of the
chambers in the out-buildings of the temple, called after the name of
some well-known individual. For the high priest Eliashib was a
contemporary of Nehemiah, and the high priest Johanan was not the son,
but, according to the definite statement, [Neh
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#010), the grandson, of Eliashib, and
the son of Joiada (the correct reading of [Neh
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#011) being: Joiada begat Johanan and
Jonathan). Now a chamber of the temple could not in Ezra's time have
been as yet called after a grandson of Eliashib the contemporary of
Nehemiah;

(Note: This would not, indeed, be impossible, because, as we shall
subsequently show (in our Introduction to the book of Nehemiah, 2),
Eliashib's grandson Johanan might be already ten years of age at the
time of the transaction in question; so that his grandfather, the high
priest Eliashib, might have called a chamber of the temple after the
name of his grandson. This view is not, however, a very probable one.)

and both Johanan and Eliashib being names which frequently occur (comp.
[Ezr 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#024), [Ezr
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#027), [Ezr
10:36](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#036)), and one of the twenty-four
orders of priests being called after the latter ([Ch1
24:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#012)), we, with Ewald (Gesch. iv. p.
228), regard the Johanan ben Eliashib here mentioned as an individual of
whom nothing further is known-perhaps a priest descended from the
Eliashib of [Ch1 24:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#012), and who
possessed in the new temple a chamber called by his name. For there is
not the slightest reason to suppose, with Bertheau, that a subsequent
name of this chamber is used in this narrative, because the narrator
desired to state the locality in a manner which should be intelligible
to his contemporaries. Cler. and Berth. desire, after 1 Esdr. 9:1 (καὶ
αὐλισθεὶς ἐκεῖ), to change שׁם ויּלך into שׁם ויּלן: and he passed the
night there without eating bread or drinking water. But the lxx having
καὶ ἐπορεύθη ἐκεῖ, and the repetition of the same word being, moreover,
by no means infrequent, comp. e.g., ויּקם in [Ezr
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#005), [Ezr
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#006), and finally שׁם repeatedly
standing for thither, e.g., [Sa1 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#014)
(שׁם הבּאים), there are no adequate grounds for an alteration of the
text. The paraphrase of 1 Esdr. arises merely from the connection, and
is devoid of critical value. To eat no bread, etc., means to fast: comp.
[Exo 34:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#028); [Deu
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#009).

[Ezra 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ezr 10:7</span></span>

The resolution carried into execution. - [Ezr
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#007), [Ezr
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#008). A proclamation was sent forth
throughout Judah and Jerusalem (קול העביר, comp. [Ezr
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001)) to all the children of the
captivity to assemble at Jerusalem under pain of the punishment, that
whoever should not come within three days, all his substance should be
forfeited and himself excluded from the congregation, according to the
decision of the princes and elders, who, as the heads of the community,
had taken the matter in hand, and made this announcement. The forfeiture
of substance is not its destruction, as prescribed [Deu
13:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#013) in the case of a city fallen
into idolatry, but its appropriation to the benefit of the temple, after
the analogy of [Lev 27:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#028).

[Ezra 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ezr 10:9</span></span>

After three days all the men of Judah and Benjamin assembled at
Jerusalem. This took place on the twentieth day of the ninth month. On
this statement of time, see the remark in [Ezr
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#001). The assembled multitude sat there
on the open space of the house of God, i.e., probably the open space
(הרחוב) in front of the water-gate, [Neh
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#001), [Neh
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#003), [Neh
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#016), at the eastern or south-eastern
side, before the temple court; see remarks on [Neh
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#001). "Trembling" because of this
matter, the seriousness of which they might perceive from the heavy
penalty attached to their non-appearance within three days, and "because
of the rain." The ninth month, corresponding with our December, is in
the cold rainy time of the year (comp. [Ezr
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#013)), "when the rain usually falls
in torrents" (Robinson, Phys. Geog. p. 287).

[Ezra 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ezr 10:10</span></span>

Ezra then stood up and reproved the assembled multitude, saying: You
have brought home (הושׁיב, comp. [Ezr
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#002)) strange wives to increase the
trespass of Israel (comp. Ezra's confession, [Ezr
9:6-15](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#006)), and exhorted them to give
glory to God and to do His pleasure, (viz.) to separate themselves from
the people of the land, and from the strange wives. On תודה תּנוּ, comp.
[Jos 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#019). Separation from the people
of the land consisted, under the circumstances, in the dismissal of the
strange wives.

[Ezra 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ezr 10:12</span></span>

The whole assembly replied with a loud voice, and therefore with firm
resolve: According to thy word it is our duty to do. עלינוּ must not be
drawn to what precedes, as in the Vulgate, juxta verbum tuum ad nos, sic
fiat, but to what follows, as in [Ezr
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#004), [Neh
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#013); [Sa2
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#011). But - they further remark, [Ezr
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#013) - the people are many, - i.e.,
the assemblage is very large to be able to deal immediately with the
several cases; and it is (now) the time of the heavy rains, and there is
no power to stand without, - i.e., at the present season we are not able
to remain in the open air until the business is discharged; neither is
this the work of one day, or of two, for we have transgressed much in
this matter, - i.e., one or two days will not suffice to investigate and
decide upon all cases, because very many have broken the law in this
respect.

[Ezra 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ezr 10:14</span></span>

"Let then our rulers stand for the whole congregation, and let all who
in all our cities have brought home strange wives come at appointed
times, and with them the elders of each city, and the judges thereof,
until the fierce wrath of our God be turned away from us, as long as
this matter lasts." There were so many cases to deal with, that the
rulers, as the judicial authorities, must decide in this matter; and
those who in all the cities of the land had transgressed, were to appear
before these authorities, and submit their individual cases to their
jurisdiction. The choice of the verb יעמדוּ, to stand or set oneself to
discharge some business, here therefore to give judgment, is occasioned
by the preceding לעמוד. The whole community had assembled according to
the proclamation, and was standing there for the purpose of bringing the
matter to a close. This they were not, however, able to do, for the
reasons stated [Ezr 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#013); hence the
princes, as rulers of the community, are to remain for the discharge of
the business. לכל־הקּהל is not a genitive dependent on שׂרינוּ, and
explanatory of the suffix of this word-our, viz., the whole
congregation's, princes (Bertheau) - an unnatural and superfluous
elucidation; for if the whole congregation say: our princes, it is
self-evident that not the princes of a section or portion of the people,
but of the whole congregation, must be intended. לכל־הקּהל is the object
of יעמדוּ: let them stand for the whole congregation (ל עמד like ל קוּם,
[Psa 94:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#016)), not instead of, but for
the good of the congregation, and transact its business. In our cities,
i.e., including the capital, for there is here no contrast between
Jerusalem and the other cities. The article to ההשׁיב stands, as is
often the case, for the relative אשׁר, e.g., [Ezr
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#017), [Ezr
8:25](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#025). מזמּנים עתּים, appointed times,
stated terms, used only here and in [Neh
10:35](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#035); [Neh
13:31](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#031). זמּן is a Chaldaistic
expression. With the accused were to come the elders and judges of every
city, to furnish the necessary explanations and evidence. להשׁיב עד,
until the turning away of the fierceness of the wrath (ל עד according to
the later usage of the language instead of עד only, comp. Ewald, 315, a,
not instead of ל only, as Bertheau seeks, by incorrectly interpreted
passages, to prove). The meaning is: until the fierce wrath of God
concerning these marriages shall be turned away, by their dissolution
and the dismissal of the strange women from the congregation. The last
words, הזּה לדּבר עד, offer some difficulty. De Wette and Bertheau
translate them: on account of this matter, which ל עד can by no means
signify. We regard ל עד = עד of the older language, in the sense of
during, like [Kg2 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#022), according to
which the meaning is: as long as this thing lasts; but we connect these
words, not, as J. H. Michaelis, with the immediately preceding clause:
the wrath which is fierce during this matter (quae usque, i.e.,
constanter ardet), but take them as more exactly defining the leading
idea of the verse: the princes are to stand and judge the guilty as long
as this matter lasts, so that הזּה לדּבר עד is co-ordinate with וגו
להשׁיב עד.

[Ezra 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ezr 10:15</span></span>

Jonathan the son of Asahel, and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah, indeed
opposed this proposal on the part of the community, and were supported
in their opposition by two Levites, but without being able to carry it
out. This statement is introduced by אך, only, in the form of a
qualification to the remark that the whole assembly ([Ezr
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#012)) made this resolution:
nevertheless Jonathan ... stood up against this. For על עמד, to stand up
against, or as elsewhere על קוּם, comp. [Ch1
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#001); [Ch2
20:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#023); [Dan
8:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#025); [Dan
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#014). Such also is the view of R.
Sal. and Lightf., while older expositors understand it as meaning: only
Jonathan ... stood up for this matter, like the steterunt super hoc of
the Vulgate, or as the decidedly incorrect explanation of J. H. Mich.:
praefecti sunt huic negotio. - Nothing further is known of the four
opponents here named. That they did not succeed in this opposition
appears from what follows. [Ezr 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#016)
The children of the captivity, i.e., the returned exiles, did so; i.e.,
the congregation carried their resolve into execution. And Ezra the
priest, and men, heads of houses according to their houses, - i.e., so
that each house was represented by its head, - were separated, i.e.,
chosen to conduct the investigation. The ו copulative before אנשׁים has
been lost, as asyndeton seeming in this case inadmissible. Bertheau, on
the contrary, unnecessarily changes ויבּרלוּ into לו ויּבדל after 1
Esdras 9:16. "And they all by names," comp. [Ezr
8:20](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#020). ויּשׁבוּ, and they held a
sitting (i.e., their first sitting) on the first day of the tenth month,
and therefore only ten days after the assembly just spoken of. הדּבר
לדריושׁ, to inquire into the matter. It is impossible in Hebrew to form
דּריושׁ from דּרשׁ, and this word can only arise from דּרושׁ, as Ewald,
239, a, note, Olshausen, Lehrb. d. hebr. Spr. p. 150, and Bttcher, ausf.
Lehrb. der hebr. Spr. i. 1, p. 162, note, unanimously agree.

[Ezra 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ezr 10:17</span></span>

And they made an end with all, with respect to the men who had brought
home strange wives. בּכּל (with the article) cannot be so connected with
אנשׁים, from which it is separated by the accentuation of the latter, as
to admit of the repetition, as by older expositors, of the preposition
בּ before אנשׁים: with all, namely, with the men. Still less can בּכּל,
as Bertheau thinks, be taken in the sense of "in every place," and
אנשׁים connected as an accusative with ויכלּוּ: they finished in every
place the men (!); for כּלּה with an accusative of the person signifies
to annihilate, to make an end of, while ב כּלּה means to finish, to make
an end with, comp. [Gen 44:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#012). If, as
the accentuation requires, we take בּכּל independently, אנשׁים can only
be an accusative of more exact definition: in respect of the men (אנשׁים
being without the article, because words which define it follow). As
this gives a suitable meaning, it seems unnecessary to alter the
punctuation and read בּכל־אנשׁים, or with Ewald, 290, c, note 1, to
regard אנשׁים בּכּל as a singular combination. - Till the first day of
the first month (of the next year), therefore in three months, their
sittings having begun, according to [Ezr
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#013), on the first day of the tenth
month. - The account of this transaction closes with -

The list of the men who had taken strange wives, vv. 18-44; among whom
were priests ([Ezr 10:18-22](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#018)), Levites
([Ezr 10:23](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#023), [Ezr
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#024)), and Israelites, i.e., laymen
(vv. 25-43).

[Ezra 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ezr 10:18</span></span>

Among the priests there stand first, four names of sons and brethren of
the high priest Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, who returned to Jerusalem
with Zerubbabel. אחיו, his (Jeshua's) brethren. Judging by [Ezr
2:36](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#036), these were among the descendants
of Jedaiah, a section of the house of the high-priestly family (see rem.
on [Ezr 2:36](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#036)), and were therefore
distant cousins of the high priest. They gave their hands, i.e., bound
themselves by shaking hands, to put away their wives, i.e., to dismiss
them, and to sever them from the congregation of Israel, ואשׁמים, "and
guilty a ram for their trespass," i.e., condemned to bring a ram as a
trespass-offering. ואשׁמים is to be regarded as the continuation of the
infinitive clause להוציא. As elsewhere, infinitive clauses are continued
without anything further in the verb. finit. (comp. Ewald, 350); so here
also does the adjective אשׁמים follow, requiring that להיות should be
mentally supplied. איל־צאן, a ram of the flock, is, as an accusative of
more exact definition, dependent on אשׁמים. This trespass-offering was
imposed upon them according to the principle of the law, [Lev
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#014), etc., because they had committed
a מעל against the Lord, which needed expiation; see on [Lev
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#014). - In what follows, only the
names of the individuals, and a statement of the families they belonged
to, are given, without repeating that the same obligations, namely, the
dismissal of their strange wives, and the bringing of a
trespass-offering, were imposed on them also, this being self-evident
from the context. - Among the sons of Immer were three, among the sons
of Harim five, among the sons of Pashur six offenders; in all, eighteen
priests. By comparing [Ezr 2:36-39](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#036), we
perceive that not one of the orders of priests who returned with
Zerubbabel was free from participation in this transgression. Some of
the names given, [Ezr 10:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#020),
reappear in the lists in [Neh 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#004) and
[Neh 10:2-9](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#002), and may belong to the
same individuals.

[Ezra 10:23](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ezr 10:23</span></span>

Of Levites, only six names are given, and that without stated the houses
to which they belonged. From [Ezr
2:40](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#040), however, it appears that they
were of the sons of Jeshua and Kadmiel there mentioned. "Kelaiah, the
same is Kelita;" the latter is the usual name of the person in question,
and that which he bears in [Neh 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#007)
and [Neh 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#011). Jozabad also reappears
in [Neh 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#007).

[Ezra 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ezr 10:24</span></span>

Of singers one, and of porters three names are given; comp. [Ezr
2:41-42](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#041). In all, ten Levites.

[Ezra 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">ezr 10:25</span></span>

Of Israel, as distinguished from priests and Levites, i.e., of the
laity. Of these latter are given in all eighty-six names, belonging to
ten races, vv. 25-43, who returned with Zerubbabel. See Nos. 1, 5, 6, 9,
8, 4, 30, 17, and 27 of the survey of these races. ירמות in [Ezr
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#029) should, according to the
Chethiv, be read ירמות. - The twofold naming of sons of Bani in this
list ([Ezr 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#029) and [Ezr
10:34](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#034)) is strange, and Bani is
evidently in one of these places a mistake for some other name. Bertheau
supposes that Bigvai may have stood in the text in one of these places.
The error undoubtedly lies in the second mention of Bani ([Ezr
10:34](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#034)), and consists not merely in the
wrong transcription of this one name. For, while of every other race
four, six, seven, or eight individuals are named, no less than seven and
twenty names follow בּני מבּני, though all these persons could hardly
have belonged to one race, unless the greater number of males therein
had married strange wives. Besides, no names of inhabitants of cities of
Judah and Benjamin are given in this list (as in [Ezr
2:21-28](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#021), and [Ezr
2:33-35](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#033)), although it is stated in
[Ezr 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#007) and [Ezr
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#014) that not only the men of
Jerusalem, but also dwellers in other cities, had contracted these
prohibited marriages, and been summoned to Jerusalem, that judgment
might be pronounced in their several cases. These reasons make it
probable that the twenty-seven persons enumerated in [Ezr
10:34-42](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#034) were inhabitants of various
localities in Judah, and not merely individuals belonging to a single
house. This supposition cannot, however, be further corroborated, since
even the lxx and 1 Esdr. read the name Bani in [Ezr
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#027) and [Ezr
10:34](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#034), nor can any conjecture
respecting the correct reading laying claim to probability be ventured
on. In the single names, the Greek texts of the Septuagint and 1 Esdras
frequently differ from the Hebrew text, but the differences are almost
all of a kind to furnish no material for criticism. A considerable
number of these names reappear in the lists of names in the book of
Nehemiah, but under circumstances which nowhere make the identity of the
persons bearing them certain.

[Ezra 10:44](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">ezr 10:44</span></span>

[Ezr 10:44](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#044) contains the statement with
which the account of this transaction closes. The Chethiv נשׂאיּ seems
to be an error of transcription for נשׂאוּ (the Keri), which the sense
requires. וגו מהם וישׁ, "and there were among them women who had brought
forth sons." מהם must be referred to women, notwithstanding the
masculine suffix. ישׂימוּ, too, can only be referred to נשׁים, and
cannot be explained, as by J. H. Mich.: unde etiam filios susceperant
seu procreaverant. The gender of the verb is adapted to the form of the
word נשׁים, an incorrectness which must be attributed to the increasing
tendency of the language to use the masculine instead of the feminine,
or to renounce a distinction of form between the genders. There are no
adequate reasons for such an alteration of the text as Bertheau
proposes; for the lxx already had our text before them, and the καὶ
ἀπέλυσαν αὐτὰς σὺν τέκνοις of 1 Esdr. 9:36 is a mere conjecture from the
context. The remark itself, that among the women who were sent away were
some who had already brought children into the world, is not
superfluous, but added for the purpose of showing how thoroughly this
matter was carried out. Separation from women who already have children
is far more grievous, ob communium liberorum caritatem, than parting
with childless wives.

Strictly as this separation was carried out, this evil was not thereby
done away with for ever, nor even for very long. After the arrival of
Nehemiah at Jerusalem, when the building of the wall was concluded, the
congregation again bound themselves by an oath, on the occasion of a day
of prayer and fasting, to contract no more such illegal marriages ([Neh
10:31](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#031)). Nevertheless, Nehemiah, on his
second return to Jerusalem, some five and twenty to thirty years after
the dissolution of these marriages by Ezra, again found Jews who had
married women of Ashdod, Moab, and Ammon, and children of these
marriages who spoke the tongue of Ashdod, and could not speak the Jews'
language, and even one of the sons of the high priest Jehoiada allied to
a daughter of Sanballat the Horonite ([Neh
13:28](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#028), etc.). Such a phenomenon,
however strange it may appear on a superficial view of the matter,
becomes comprehensible when we consider more closely the circumstances
of the times. The nucleus of the Israelite community in Jerusalem and
Judah was formed by those exiles who returned from Babylon with
Zerubbabel and Ezra; and to this nucleus the remnant of Jewish and
Israelite descent which had been left in the land was gradually united,
after the rebuilding of the temple and the restoration of the worship of
Jahve. Those who returned from Babylon, as well as those who remained in
the land, had now, however, lived seventy, and some of them one hundred
and fifty, years (from the captivity of Jehoiachin in 599, to the return
of Ezra in 457) among the heathen, and in the midst of heathen
surroundings, and had thus become so accustomed to intercourse with them
in civil and social transactions, that the consciousness of the barriers
placed by the Mosaic law between Israel, the people of Jahve, and the
Gentiles, was more and more obliterated. And this would specially be the
case when the Gentiles who entered into matrimonial alliance with
Israelites did not flagrantly practise idolatrous worship, i.e., did not
offer sacrifice to heathen deities. Under such circumstances, it must
have been extremely difficult to do away entirely with these unlawful
unions; although, without a thorough reform in this respect, the
successful development of the new community in the land of their fathers
was not to be obtained.

Ezra's narrative of his agency in Jerusalem closes with the account of
the dissolution of the unlawful marriages then existing. What he
subsequently effected for the revival of religion and morality in the
re-established community, in conformity with the law of God, was more of
an inward and spiritual kind; and was either of such a nature that no
striking results ensued, which could furnish matter for historical
narrative, or was performed during the period of his joint agency with
Nehemiah, of which an account is furnished by the latter in the record
he has handed down to us ([Neh 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#010)).
