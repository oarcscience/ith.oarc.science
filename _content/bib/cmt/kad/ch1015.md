[1 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001)

The Bringing of the Ark into Jerusalem - 1 Chronicles 15:1-16:3

In the parallel account, [Sa2 6:11-23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#011),
only the main facts as to the transfer of the holy ark to Jerusalem, and
the setting of it up in a tent erected for its reception on Mount Zion,
are shortly narrated; but the author of the Chronicle elaborately
portrays the religious side of this solemn act, tells of the
preparations which David had made for it, and gives a special
enumeration of the Levites, who at the call of the king laboured with
him to carry it out according to the precepts of the law. For this
purpose he first gives an account of the preparations (1 Chron 15:1-24),
viz., of the erection of a tent for the ark in the city of David ([Ch1
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#001)), of the consultation of the king
with the priests and Levites ([Ch1
15:2-13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#002)), and of the accomplishment of
that which they had determined upon (vv. 14-29).

[1 Chronicles 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 15:1</span></span>

In [Sa2 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#012) the whole matter is
introduced by a statement that the motive which had determined the king
to bring the ark to Jerusalem, was his having heard of the blessing
which the ark had brought upon the house of Obed-edom. In our narrative
([Ch1 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#001)), the remark that David,
while building his house in Jerusalem, prepared a place for the ark of
God, and erected a tent for it, forms the transition from the account of
his palace-building ([Ch1 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#001).) to
the bringing in of the ark. The words, "he made unto himself houses," do
not denote, as Bertheau thinks, the building of other houses besides the
palaces built with the help of King Hiram ([Ch1
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#001)). For עשׂה is not synonymous with
בּנה, but expresses the preparation of the building for a dwelling, and
the words refer to the completion of the palace as a dwelling-place for
the king and his wives and children. In thus making the palace which had
been built fit for a habitation, David prepared a place for the ark,
which, together with its tent, was to be placed in his palace. As to the
reasons which influenced David in determining to erect a new tabernacle
for the ark, instead of causing the old and sacred tabernacle to be
brought from Gibeon to Jerusalem for the purpose, see the remarks
introductory to 2 Sam 6.

[1 Chronicles 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch1 15:2</span></span>

The reason for the preparations made on this occasion for the solemn
progress is assigned in the statement that David had resolved to cause
the ark to be carried by the Levites alone, because God had chosen them
thereto; cf. [Num 1:50](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#050); [Num
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#015); [Num
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#009); [Num
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#017). אז, "at that time," i.e., at
the end of the three months, [Ch1
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#014). לשׂאת לא, "there is not to
bear," i.e., no other shall bear the ark than the Levites. "By this
arrangement, it is expressly acknowledged that it was contrary to the
law to place it upon a cart; [Ch1
13:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#001) :17" (Berth.). For this
purpose, the king assembled "the whole of Israel" in Jerusalem, i.e.,
the elders, the rulers over thousands, the heads of families; cf. [Sa2
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#015), where it is stated that ישׂאל
כּל־בּית took part in the solemn march.

[1 Chronicles 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch1 15:4</span></span>

From among assembled Israel David then specially gathered together the
heads of the priests and Levites, to determine upon the details of this
solemn procession. "The sons of Aaron" are the high priests Zadok and
Abiathar, [Ch1 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#011); and the
"Levites" are the six princes named in [Ch1
15:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#005), with their brethren, viz.,
([Ch1 15:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#005)) the three heads of the
families into which the tribe of Levi was divided, and which
corresponded to the three sons of Levi, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari,
respectively ([Exo 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#016)): Uriel head
of the Kohathites, Asaiah of the Merarites, and Joel head of the
Gershonites, with their brethren. Kohath is first enumerated, because
Aaron the chief of the priests was descended from Kohath, and because to
the Kohathites there fell, on account of their nearer relationship to
the priests, the duty of serving in that which is most holy, the bearing
of the holiest vessels of the tabernacle. See [Num
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#004), [Num
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#015); [Num
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#009); as to Uriel, see on [Num
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#024); for Asaiah, see 6:30; and as to
Joel, see [Ch1 6:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#033). Then in [Ch1
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#008), [Ch1
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#009) we have the heads of three other
Kohathite families: Shemaiah, chief of the sons of Elizaphan, i.e.,
Elizaphan son of the Kohathite Uzziel ([Exo
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#022)); Eliel, chief of the sons of
Hebron the Kohathite ([Exo 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#018)); and
Amminadab, chief of the sons of Uzziel. The sons of Uzziel,
consequently, were divided into two fathers'-houses: the one founded by
Uzziel's son Elizaphan, and named after him ([Ch1
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#008)); the other founded by his other
sons, and called by his name. Of the fathers'-houses here enumerated,
four belong to Kohath, and one each to Merari and Gershon; and the
Kohathites were called to take part in the solemn act in greater numbers
than the Merarites and Gershonites, since the transport of the ark was
the Kohathites' special duty.

[1 Chronicles 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch1 15:11</span></span>

Zadok of the line of Eleazar ([Ch1
6:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#001)), and Abiathar of the line of
Ithamar, were the heads of the two priestly lines, and at that time both
held the office of high priest ([Ch1
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#003); cf. [Sa2
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#024)., [Sa2
20:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#025)). These priests and the six
princes of the Levites just enumerated were charged by David to
consecrate themselves with their brethren, and to bring up the ark of
God to the place prepared for it. התקדּשׁ, to consecrate oneself by
removal of all that is unclean, washing of the body and of the clothes
([Gen 35:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#002)), and careful keeping aloof
from every defilement, avoiding coition and the touching of unclean
things; cf. [Exo 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#010), [Exo
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#015). לו אל־כינותי, to (the place)
which I have prepared for it. לו הכינותי is a relative clause with אשׁר,
construed with a preposition as though it were a substantive: cf.
similar constructions, [Ch1 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#003); [Ch2
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#009); [Ch2
30:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#018); [Neh
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#010); and Ew. 33, b.

[1 Chronicles 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch1 15:13</span></span>

"For because in the beginning (i.e., when the ark was removed from the
house of Amminadab, [Ch1 13:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#001)) it
was not you (sc., who brought it up), did Jahve our God made a breach
upon us," sc. by the slaying of Uzza, [Ch1
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#011). In the first clause the
predicate is wanting, but it may easily be supplied from the context.
The contracted form למבּרשׁונה, made up of למה and בּראשׁונה, is unique,
since מה is so united only with small words, as in מזּה, [Exo
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#002), מלּכם, [Isa
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#015); but we find מתּלאה for מה־תּלאה,
[Mal 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#013); cf. Ew. 91, d. למה here
signifies: on account of this which = because; cf.'Ew. 222, a, and 353,
a. "This was done, because we did not seek Him according to the right,"
which required that the ark, upon which Jehovah sits enthroned, should
be carried by Levites, and touched by no unholy person, or one who is
not a priest ([Num 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#015)).

[1 Chronicles 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch1 15:14</span></span>

The Levites consecrated themselves, and bare - as [Ch1
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#015) anticipatively remarks-the ark
of God upon their shoulders, according to the prescription in [Num
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#009), עליהם בּמּומות, by means of poles
upon them (the shoulders). מוטה, the flexible pole used for carrying
burdens, [Num 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#023). Those used to
carry the ark are called בּדּים in the Pentateuch, [Exo
25:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#013).

[1 Chronicles 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch1 15:16</span></span>

David gave the princes of the Levites a further charge to appoint
singers with musical instruments for the solemn procession, which they
accordingly did. שׁיר כּלי, instruments to accompany the song. In [Ch1
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#016) three kinds of these are named:
נבלים, nablia, ψαλτήρια, which Luther has translated by psalter,
corresponds to the Arabic santir, which is an oblong box with a broad
bottom and a somewhat convex sounding-board, over which strings of wire
are stretched; an instrument something like the cithara. כּנּרות, harps,
more properly lutes, as this instrument more resembled our lute than the
harp, and corresponded to the Arabic catgut instrument el ‛ûd (l-cûd);
cf. Wetzstein in Delitzsch, Isaiah, S. 702, der 2 Aufl., where, however,
the statement that the santir is essentially the same as the old German
cymbal, vulgo Hackebrett, is incorrect, and calculated to bring
confusion into the matter, for the cymbal was an instrument provided
with a small bell. מצלתּים, the later word for צלצלים, cymbals,
castanets; see on [Sa2 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#005). משׁמיעים
does not belong to the three before-mentioned instruments (Berth.), but,
as is clear from [Ch1 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#019), [Ch1
15:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#028), [Ch1
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#005), [Ch1
16:42](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#042), undoubtedly only to מצלתּים
(Bttcher, Neue krit. Aehrenlese, iii. S. 223); but the meaning is not
"modulating," but "sounding clear or loud," - according to the proper
meaning of the word, to make to hear. The infinitive clause וגו להרים
belongs to the preceding sentence: "in order to heighten the sound (both
of the song and of the instrumental music) to joy," i.e., to the
expression of joy. לשׂימחה is frequently used to express festive joy:
cf. [Ch1 15:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#025), [Ch2
23:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#018); [Ch2
29:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#030); but also as early as in [Sa2
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#012); [Sa1
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#006); [Jdg
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#023), etc. - In [Ch1
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#017), [Ch1
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#018) the names of the singers and
players are introduced; then in [Ch1
15:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#019) they are named in connection
with the instruments they played; and finally, in [Ch1
15:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#022), the other Levites and
priests who took part in the celebration are mentioned. The three chief
singers, the Kohathite Heman, the Gershonite Asaph, and the Merarite
Ethan, form the first class. See on [Ch1
6:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#033), [Ch1
6:39](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#039), and [Ch1
6:44](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#044). To the second class (המּשׁנים,
cf. המּשׁנה, [Kg2 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#004)) belonged
thirteen or fourteen persons, for in [Ch1
15:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#021) an Azaziah is named in the last
series who is omitted in [Ch1 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#018);
and it is more probable that his name has been dropped out of [Ch1
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#018) than that it came into our text,
[Ch1 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#021), by an error. In [Ch1
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#018) בּן comes in after זכריהוּ by an
error or transcription, as we learn from the w before the following
name, and from a comparison of [Ch1
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#020) and [Ch1
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#025). The name יעזיאל is in [Ch1
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#020) written עזיאל, Yodh being
rejected; and in [Ch1 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#005) it is
יעיאל, which is probably only a transcriber's error, since יעיאל occurs
along with it both in [Ch1 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#018) and
in [Ch1 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#005). The names Benaiah and
Maaseiah, which are repeated in [Ch1
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#020), have been there transposed. All
the other names in vv.18 and 20 coincide.

[1 Chronicles 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch1 15:19</span></span>

These singers formed three choirs, according to the instruments they
played. Heman, Asaph, and Ethan played brazen cymbals להשׁמיע ([Ch1
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#019)); Benaiah and the seven who
follow played nablia (psalteria) עלמות על ([Ch1
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#020)); while the last six played
lutes (harps) לנצּח השּׁמינית על ([Ch1
15:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#021)). These three Hebrew words
plainly denote different keys in singing, but are, owing to our small
acquaintance with the music of the Hebrews, obscure, and cannot be
interpreted with certainty. נצּח, going over from the fundamental
signification glitter, shine, into the idea of outshining and superior
capacity, overwhelming ability, might also, as a musical term, denote
the conducting of the playing and singing as well as the leading of
them. The signification to direct is here, however, excluded by the
context, for the conductors were without doubt the three chief musicians
or bandmasters (Capellenmeister), Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, with the
cymbals, not the psaltery and lute players belonging to the second rank.
The conducting must therefore be expressed by להשׁמיע, and this word
must mean "in order to give a clear tone," i.e., to regulate the tune
and the tone of the singing, while לנצּח signifies "to take the lead in
playing;" cf. Del. on [Psa 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#001). This
word, moreover, is probably not to be restricted to the singers with the
lutes, the third choir, but must be held to refer also to the second
choir. The meaning then will be, that Heman, Asaph, and Ethan had
cymbals to direct the song, while the other singers had partly
psalteries, partly lutes, in order to play the accompaniment to the
singing. The song of these two choirs is moreover distinguished and
defined by עלמות על and השּׁמינית על. These words specify the kind of
voices; עלמות על after the manner of virgins, i.e., in the soprano;
השּׁמינית על, after the octave, i.e., in bass - al ottava bassa. See
Del. on [Psa 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#001); [Psa
46:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#001). In [Ch1
15:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#022) the still remaining priests
who were engaged in the solemn procession are enumerated.

[1 Chronicles 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch1 15:22</span></span>

"Chenaniah, the prince of the Levites, for the bearing, teacher in
bearing; for he was instructed in it." Since Chenaniah does not occur
among the six princes of the Levites in [Ch1
15:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#005), and is called in [Ch1
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#027) המּשּׂא השׂר, we must here also
join בּמשּׂא (as most editions punctuate the first במשׂא, while
according to Norzi בּמּשּׂא is the right reading even in the first case)
closely with שׂר־הלויּם, with the meaning that Chenaniah was captain of
the Levites who had charge of the bearing of the ark, a chief of the
Levites who bore it. The word משּׂא is,however, very variously
interpreted. The lxx have ἄρχων τῶν ᾠδῶν, and the Vulgate, prophetiae
praeerat ad praecinendam melodiam; whence Luther translates: the master
in song to teach them to sing. This translation cannot, however, be
linguistically upheld; the word משּׂא means only the bearing of the
burden ([Num 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#019), [Num
4:27](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#027), etc.; [Ch2
35:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#003)), and a prophetical utterance of
an oppressive or threatening character ([Isa
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#001), and [Isa
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#001), etc.). But from this second
signification neither the general meaning prophetia, nor, if we wish to
go back upon the קול נשׂא, to raise the voice, the signification master
of song, supremus musicus (Lavat.), or qui principatum tenebat in cantu
illo sublimiore (Vatabl.), can be derived. The meaning prophetia,
moreover, does not suit the context, and we must consequently, with
Bertheau and others, hold fast the signification of bearing. We are
determined in favour of this, (1) by the context, which here treats of
the bearing of the ark, for which משּׂא is the usual word; and (2) by
the circumstance that in [Ch1 26:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#029)
Chenaniah is mentioned as the chief of the Levites for the external
business, which goes to show, if the persons are identical, that he here
had the oversight of the external business of the transport. יסר is not
the inf. absol., which cannot stand directly for the verb. finit.; nor
is it the imperf. of סרר in the signification of שׂרר (Bertheau and
others), but a nominal formation from יסר (cf. on this formation as the
most proper designation of the actor, Ew. 152, b), in the signification
teacher, which is shown by [Isa 28:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#026)
certainly to belong to יסר. The clause בּמּשּׂא יסר gives the
explanation of the preceding בּמשּׂא, or it specifies what Chenaniah had
to do in the procession. He had to take the lead in the bearing because
he was מבין in it, i.e., was instructed in that which was to be observed
in it. - In [Ch1 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#023) two doorkeepers
for the ark are named; and in [Ch1
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#024), at the end of the enumeration
of the Levites who were busied about the transport, two additional names
are mentioned as those of men who had the same duty. The business of
these doorkeepers was, as Seb. Schmidt has already remarked on 2 Sam 6,
non tam introitum aperire arcae, quam custodire, ne ad eam irrumperetur.
Between these two pairs of doorkeepers in [Ch1
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#024), the priests, seven in number,
who blew the trumpets, are named. The Kethibh מחצצרים is to be read
מחצצרים, a denom. from חצצרה; the Keri מחצרים is Hiph. of חצר, as in
[Ch2 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#006); [Ch2
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#014), and [Ch2
29:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#028). In [Ch2
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#012) and [Ch2
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#013), on the contrary, מחצּרים is
partic. Pi. The blowing of the silver trumpets by the priests in this
solemn procession rests on the prescription in [Num
10:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#001), which see. The place assigned
to these trumpet-blowing priests was either immediately before the ark,
like the priestly trumpeters in the march round Jericho ([Jos
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#004), [Jos
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#006)), or immediately after it. For,
that these priests entered in the immediate vicinity of the ark, may be
inferred from the fact that before and behind them were doorkeepers of
the ark. The procession, then, was probably arranged in this way: (1)
the singers and players in front, in three division; (2) Chenaniah, the
captain of the bearers; (3) two doorkeepers; (4) the priests with the
trumpets immediately before or after the ark; (5) two doorkeepers; (6)
the king with the elders and captains of thousands ([Ch1
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#025)). The two doorkeepers Obededom
and Jehiah (יחיּה), Rashi, Berth.,and others consider to be the same
persons as the singers Obededom and Jeiel (יעיאל), supposing that the
latter name is wrongly written in one of the passages. This, however, is
incorrect, for the identity of the name Obededom is no sufficient ground
for supposing the persons to be the same, since in [Ch1
16:38](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#038) the singer Obededom and the
doorkeeper Obededom the son of Jeduthun seem to be distinguished. And
besides that, Obededom and his colleagues could not possibly at the same
time as porters precede, and as singers come after, the priests and the
ark, and there is consequently no reason to doubt that the name יחיּה is

narrate the further proceedings connected with the bring of the ark to
Jerusalem; cf. [Sa2 6:12-19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#012). By the
words וגו דויד ויהי the account of the execution of the design is
connected with the statements as to the preparations (vv. 2-24): "And so
were David ... who went to bring up the ark."

[1 Chronicles 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">ch1 15:26</span></span>

When God had helped the Levites who bare the ark of the covenant of
Jahve, they offered seven bullocks and seven rams, i.e., after the
journey had been happily accomplished. Instead of this, in [Sa2
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#013), the offering which was made at
the commencement of the journey to consecrate it is mentioned; see on
the passage.

[1 Chronicles 15:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">ch1 15:27</span></span>

The discrepancy between [Ch1 15:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#027) and
[Sa2 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#014) is more difficult of
explanation. Instead of the words יהוה לפני בּכל־אז מכרכּר דּוד, David
danced with all his might before Jahve, we read in the Chronicle בּוּץ
בּמעיל מכרבּל דויד, David was clothed with a robe of byssus. But since
מכרכר differs from מכרבל only in the last two letters, and כר might be
easily exchanged for בל, we may suppose that מכרבל has arisen out of
מכרכר. Bertheau accordingly says: "Any one who remembered that in this
verse David's clothing was spoken of might write מכרכר as מכרבל, while
the words עז בכל, which were probably illegible,were conjecture to be
בוץ במעיל." This opinion would be worthy of consideration, if only the
other discrepancies between the Chronicle and Samuel were thereby made
more comprehensible. That, besides David, the bearers of the ark, the
singers, and Chenaniah are mentioned, Bertheau thinks can be easily
explained by what precedes; but how can that explain the absence of the
יהוה לפני of Samuel from our text? Bertheau passes this over in silence;
and yet it is just the absence of these words in our text which shows
that בוץ במעיל מכרבל cannot have arisen from an orthographical error and
the illegibility of עז בכל, since יהוה לפני must have been purposely
omitted. Bttcher's opinion (N. kr. Aehrenl. iii. S. 224), that the
Chaldaizing מכרבל can scarcely have been written by the chronicler,
because it is not at all like his pure Hebrew style, and that
consequently a later reader, who considered it objectionable that a
Levite should dance, and perhaps impossible that the bearers should
(forgetting that they were released in turn from performing their
office), while holding as closely to the letter of the text as possible,
corrected עז בכל מכרכר into בוץ במעיל מכרבל, and that the same person,
or perhaps a later, added besides וּכנניה והמשׁררים, is still less
probable. In that way, indeed, we get no explanation of the main
difficulty, viz., how the words from הלויּם to המּשׁררים came into the
text of the Chronicle, instead of the יהוה לפני of Samuel. The
supposition that originally the words from וכל־הלויּם בּכל־עז מכרכּר
ודויד to והמשׁררים stood in the text, when of course the statement would
be, not only that David danced with all his might, but also that all the
Levites who bore the ark danced, is in the highest degree
unsatisfactory; for this reason, if for no other, that we cannot
conceive how the singers could play the nebel and the kinnor and dance
at the same time, since it is not alternations between singing and
playing, and dancing and leaping that are spoken of.

The discrepancy can only be got rid of by supposing that both narratives
are abridged extracts from a more detailed statement, which contained,
besides David's dancing, a completer account of the clothing of the
king, and of the Levites who took part in the procession. Of these the
author of the books of Samuel has communicated only the two
characteristic facts, that David danced with all his might before the
Lord, and wore an ephod of white; while the author of the Chronicle
gives us an account of David's clothing and that of the Levites, while
he omits David's dancing. This he does, not because he was scandalized
thereby, for he not only gives a hint of it in [Ch1
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#029), but mentions it in [Ch1
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#008), which is parallel to [Sa2
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#005); but because the account of the
king's clothing, and of that of the Levites, in so far as the religious
meaning of the solemn progress was thereby brought out, appeared to him
more important for his design of depicting at length the religious side
of the procession. For the clothing of the king had a priestly
character; and not only the ephod of white (see on [Sa2
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#014)), but also the me‛il of בּוּץ,
white byssus, distinguished the king as head of a priestly people. The
me‛il as such was,it is true, an outer garment which every Israelite
might wear, but it was worn usually only by persons of rank and
distinction (cf. [Sa1 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#019); [Sa1
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#027); [Sa1
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#004); [Sa1
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#005); [Ezr
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#003); [Job
29:14](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#014)), and white byssus was the
material for the priests' garments. Among the articles of clothing which
the law prescribed for the official dress of the simple priest ([Exo
28:40](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#040)) the מעיל was not included, but
only the כּתונת, a tight close-fitting coat; but the priests were not
thereby prevented from wearing a me‛il of byssus on special festive
occasions, and we are informed in [Ch2
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#012) that even the Levites and singers
were on such occasions clad in byssus. In this way the statement of our
verse, that David and all the Levites and bearers of the ark, the
singers, and the captain Chenaniah, had put on me‛ilim of byssus, is
justified and shown to be in accordance with the circumstances. The
words therefore are to be so understood. The words from וכל־הלויּם to
המּשּׂא השּׂר are co-ordinate with ודויד, and may translate the verse
thus: "David was clothed in a me‛il of byssus, as also were all the
Levites," etc. No objection can be taken to the המּשּׂא השּׂר when we
have the article with a nomen regens, for cases of this kind frequently
occur where the article, as here, has a strong retrospective force; cf.
Ew. 290, d. On the contrary, המּשׁררים after המּשּׂא is meaningless, and
can only have come into the text, like בּן in [Ch1
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#018), by an error of the transcriber,
although it was so read as early as the time of the lxx. For the last
clause, cf. [Sa2 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#014).

[1 Chronicles 15:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">ch1 15:28</span></span>

[Ch1 15:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#028) is, as compared with [Sa2
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#005), somewhat enlarged by the
enumeration of the individual instruments.

[1 Chronicles 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">ch1 15:29</span></span>

[Ch1 16:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#029) and [Ch1
16:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#001) agree in substance with [Sa2
6:15-19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#015), only some few words being
explained: e.g., וּמשׂחק מרקּד, [Ch1
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#029), instead of וּמכרכּר מפזּז
(Sam.), and יהוה בּרית ארון instead of והוה ערון (Sam.); see the
commentary on 2 Sam. l.c.
