<p>A Twenty-Two-Fold String of Aphorisms by One Who Is Persecuted for the Sake of His Faith
<p>To the Hodu Ps 118, written in gnome-like, wreathed style, is appended the throughout gnomico-didactic Psalms 119, consisting of one hundred and seventy-six Masoretic verses, or regarded in relation to the strophe, distichs, which according to the twenty-two letters of the alphabet fall into twenty-two groups (called by the old expositors the &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; or octonarii of this Psalmus literatus s. alphabetites); for each group contains eight verses (distichs), each of which begins with the same consecutive letter (8 x 22 = 176). The Latin Psalters (as the Psalterium Veronense, and originally perhaps all the old Greek Psalters) have the name of the letter before each group; the Syriac has the signs of the letters; and in the Complutensian Bible, as also elsewhere, a new line begins with each group. The Talmud, B. Berachoth, says of this Psalm: "it consists of eight Alephs," etc.; the Masora styles it &#1488;&#1500;&#1508;&#1488; &#1489;&#1497;&#1514;&#1488; &#1512;&#1489;&#1488;; the Midrash on it is called &#1502;&#1491;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; &#1488;&#1500;&#1508;&#1488; &#1489;&#1497;&#1514;&#1488;, and the Pesikta &#1508;&#1505;&#1497;&#1511;&#1514;&#1488; &#1491;&#1514;&#1502;&#1504;&#1497;&#1488; &#1488;&#1508;&#1497;. In our German version it has the appropriate inscription, "The Christian's golden A B C of the praise, love, power, and use of the word of God;" for here we have set forth in inexhaustible fulness what the word of God is to a man, and how a man is to behave himself in relation to it. The Masora observes that the Psalm contains only the one <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#122">Psa 119:122</A>, in which some reference or other to the word of revelation is not found as in all the 175 others 
<p>(Note: "In every verse," this is the observation of the Masora on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#122">Psa 119:122</A>, "v. 122 only excepted, we find one of the ten (pointing to the ten fundamental words or decalogue of the Sinaitic Law) expressions: word, saying, testimonies, way, judgment, precept, commandment (&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1497;), law, statute, truth" (according to another reading, righteousness).)
<p> - a many-linked chain of synonyms which runs through the whole Psalm. In connection with this ingenious arrangement, so artfully devised and carried out, it may also not be merely accidental that the address Jahve occurs twenty-two times, as Bengel has observed: bis et vicesies pro numero octonariorum.
<p>All kinds of erroneous views have, however, been put forth concerning this Psalm. Kster, von Gerlach, Hengstenberg, and Hupfeld renounce all attempts to show that there is any accordance whatever with a set plan, and find here a series of maxims without any internal progression and connection. Ewald begins at once with the error, that we have before us the long prayer of an old experienced teacher. But from <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#009">Psa 119:9</A>. it is clear that the poet himself is a "young man," a fact that is also corroborated by <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#099">Psa 119:99</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#100">Psa 119:100</A>. The poet is a young man, who finds himself in a situation which is clearly described: he is derided, oppressed, persecuted, and that by those who despise the divine word (for apostasy encompasses him round about), and more particularly by a government hostile to the true religion, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#023">Psa 119:23</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#046">Psa 119:46</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#161">Psa 119:161</A>. He is lying in bonds (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#061">Psa 119:61</A>, cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#083">Psa 119:83</A>), expecting death (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#109">Psa 119:109</A>), and recognises in his affliction, it is true, God's salutary humbling, and in the midst of it God's word is his comfort and his wisdom, but he also yearns for help, and earnestly prays for it. - The whole Psalm is a prayer for stedfastness in the midst of an ungodly, degenerate race, and in the midst of great trouble, which is heightened by the pain he feels at the prevailing apostasy, and a prayer for ultimate deliverance which rises in group Kaph to an urgent how long! If this sharply-defined physiognomy of the Psalm is recognised, then the internal progression will not fail to be discerned.
<p>After the poet has praised fidelity to the word of God (Aleph), and described it as the virtue of all virtues which is of service to the young man and to which he devotes himself (Beth), he prays, in the midst of the scoffing and persecuting persons that surround him, for the grace of enlightenment (Gimel), of strengthening (Daleth), of preservation (He), of suitable and joyful confession (Vav); God's word is all his thought and pursuit (Zajin), he cleaves to those who fear God (H&#803;eth), and recognises the salutary element of His humbling (T&#803;eth), but is in need of comfort (Jod) and signs: how long! (Kaph). Without the eternal, sure, mighty word of God he would despair (Lamed); this is his wisdom in difficult circumstances (Mem); he has sworn fidelity to it, and maintains his fidelity as being one who is persecuted (Nun), and abhors and despises the apostates (Samech). He is oppressed, but God will not suffer him to be crushed (Ajin); He will not suffer the doings of the ungodly, which wring from him floods of tears, to prevail over him (Phe) - over him, the small (still youthful) and despised one whom zeal concerning the prevailing godlessness is consuming away (Tsade). Oh that God would hear his crying by day and by night (K&#803;oph), would revive him speedily with His helpful pity (Resh) - him, viz., who being persecuted by princes clings fast to Him (Shin), and would seek him the isolated and so sorely imperilled sheep! (Tav). This outline does not exhaust the fundamental thoughts of the separate ogdoades, and they might surely be still more aptly reproduced, but this is sufficient to show that the Psalm is not wanting in coherence and progressive movement, and that it is not an ideal situation and mood, but a situation and mood based upon public relationships, from which this manifold celebration of the divine word, as a fruit of its teaching, has sprung.
<p>It is natural to suppose that the composition of the Psalm falls in those times of the Greek domination in which the government was hostile, and a large party from among the Jews themselves, that was friendly towards the government, persecuted all decided confessors of the Tra. Hitzig says, "It can be safely maintained that the Psalm was written in the Maccabaean age by a renowned Israelite who was in imprisonment under Gentile authorities." It is at least probable that the plaited work of so long a Psalm, which, in connection with all that is artificial about it, from beginning to end gives a glimpse of the subdued afflicted mien of a confessor, is the work of one in prison, who whiled away his time with this plaiting together of his complaints and his consolatry thoughts.

<p>The eightfold Aleph. Blessed are those who act according to the word of God; the poet wishes to be one of these. The alphabetical Psalm on the largest scale begins appropriately, not merely with a simple (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#001">Psa 112:1</A>), but with a twofold ashr. It refers principally to those integri viae (vitae). In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#003">Psa 119:3</A> the description of those who are accounted blessed is carried further. Perfects,a s denoting that which is habitual, alternate with futures used as presents. In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#004">Psa 119:4</A> &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512; expresses the purpose of the enjoining, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#005">Psa 119:5</A> the goal of the directing. &#1488;&#1495;&#1500;&#1497; (whence &#1488;&#1495;&#1500;&#1497;,    <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#003">Kg2 5:3</A>) is compounded of &#1488;&#1495; (vid., supra, p. 273) and &#1500;&#1497; (&#1500;&#1493;&#1497;), and consequently signifies o si. On &#1497;&#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#026">Pro 4:26</A> (lxx &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;). The retrospective &#1488;&#1494; is expanded anew in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#006">Psa 119:6</A>: then, when I namely. "Judgment of Thy righteousness" are the decisions concerning right and wrong which give expression to and put in execution the righteousness of God.
<p>(Note: The word "judgments" of our English authorized version is retained in the text as being the most convenient word; it must, however, be borne in mind that in this Psalm it belongs to the "chain of synonyms," and does not mean God's acts of judgment, its more usual meaning in the Old Testament Scriptures, but is used as defined above, and is the equivalent here of the German Rechte, not Gerichte. - Tr.)
<p>&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1502;&#1491;&#1497; refers to Scripture in comparison with history.

<p>The eightfold Beth. Acting in accordance with the word of God, a young man walks blamelessly; the poet desires this, and supplicates God's gracious assistance in order to it. To purify or cleanse one's way or walk (&#1494;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;, cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#013">Psa 73:13</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#009">Pro 20:9</A>) signifies to maintain it pure (&#1494;&#1498;, root &#1494;&#1498;, Arab. zk, to prick, to strike the eye, nitere; 
<p>(Note: The word receives the meaning of &#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3bd; (vid., supra, p. 367), like Arab. d&#817;hr and bhr, from the signification of outshining = overpowering.) 
<p>vid., Fleischer in Levy's Chaldisches Wrterbuch, i. 424) from the spotting of sin, or to free it from it. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#009">Psa 119:9</A> is the answer to the question in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#009">Psa 119:9</A>; &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512; signifies custodiendo semetipsum, for &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512; can also signify "to be on one's guard" without &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#018">Jos 6:18</A>). The old classic (e.g., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#031">Psa 18:31</A>) &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1498; alternates throughout with &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1498;; both are intended collectively. One is said to hide (&#1510;&#1508;&#1503;) the word in one's heart when one has it continually present with him, not merely as an outward precept, but as an inward motive power in opposition to selfish action (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#012">Job 23:12</A>). In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#012">Psa 119:12</A> the poet makes his way through adoration to petition. &#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#013">Psa 119:13</A> does not mean enumeration, but recounting, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#007">Deu 6:7</A>. &#1506;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514; is the plural to &#1506;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;; &#1506;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514;, on the contrary, in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#138">Psa 119:138</A> is the plural to &#1506;&#1491;&#1492;: both are used of God's attestation of Himself and of His will in the word of revelation. &#1499;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; signifies, according to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#162">Psa 119:162</A>, "as over" (short for &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1506;&#1500;), not: as it were more than (Olshausen); the &#1499;&#1468; would only be troublesome in connection with this interpretation. With reference to &#1492;&#1493;&#1503;, which has occurred already in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#013">Psa 44:13</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#003">Psa 112:3</A> (from &#1492;&#1493;&#1503;, Arab. hawn, to be light, levem), aisance, ease, opulence, and concrete, goods, property, vid., Fleischer in Levy's Chald. Wrterb. i. 423f. &#1488;&#1512;&#1495;&#1514;&#1497;&#1498;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#015">Psa 119:15</A>, are the paths traced out in the word of God; these he will studiously keep in his eye.

<p>The eightfold Gimel. This is his life's aim: he will do it under fear of the curse of apostasy; he will do it also though he suffer persecution on account of it. In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#017">Psa 119:17</A> the expression is only &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1492; as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#019">Psa 118:19</A>, not &#1493;&#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1492; as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#077">Psa 119:77</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#116">Psa 119:116</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#144">Psa 119:144</A> : the apodosis imper. only begins with &#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492;, whereas &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1492; is the good itself for the bestowment of which the poet prays. &#1490;&#1468;&#1500; in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#018">Psa 119:18</A> is imper. apoc. Piel for &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, like &#1490;&#1505; in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#012">Dan 1:12</A>. &#1504;&#1508;&#1500;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; is the expression for everything supernatural and mysterious which is incomprehensible to the ordinary understanding and is left to the perception of faith. The T&#1508;ra beneath the surface of its letter contains an abundance of such "wondrous things," into which only eyes from which God has removed the covering of natural short-sightedness penetrate; hence the prayer in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#018">Psa 119:18</A>. Upon earth we have no abiding resting-place, we sojourn here as in a strange land (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#019">Psa 119:19</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#013">Psa 39:13</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#015">Ch1 29:15</A>). Hence the poet prays in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#019">Psa 119:19</A> that God would keep His commandments, these rules of conduct for the journey of life, in living consciousness for him. Towards this, according to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#020">Psa 119:20</A>, his longing tends. &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1505; (Hiph. in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#016">Lam 3:16</A>) signifies to crush in pieces, Arab. jrs&#780;, and here, like the Aramaic &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1505;, &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1505;, to be crushed, broken in pieces. &#1500;&#1514;&#1488;&#1489;&#1492; (from &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1489;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#040">Psa 119:40</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#174">Psa 119:174</A>, a secondary form of &#1488;&#1489;&#1492;) states the bias of mind in or at which the soul feels itself thus overpowered even to being crushed: it is crushing form longing after God's judgment, viz., after a more and more thorough knowledge of them. In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#021">Psa 119:21</A> the lxx has probably caught the meaning of the poet better than the pointing has done, inasmuch as it draws &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#021">Psa 119:21</A>, so that <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#021">Psa 119:21</A> consists of two words, just like <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#059">Psa 119:59</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#089">Psa 119:89</A>; and Kamphausen also follows this in his rendering. For &#1488;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; as an attribute is unpoetical, and as an accusative of the predicate far-fetched; whereas it comes in naturally as a predicate before &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1490;&#1497;&#1501; &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1498;: cursed (&#1488;&#1512;&#1512; = Arab. harra, detestari), viz., by God. Instead of &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;, "roll" (from &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#009">Jos 5:9</A>), it is pointed in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#022">Psa 119:22</A> (&#1502;&#1506;&#1500;) &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;, "uncover" = &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#018">Psa 119:18</A>, reproach being conceived of as a covering or veil (as e.g., in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#008">Psa 69:8</A>), cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#008">Isa 22:8</A> (perhaps also <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#014">Lam 2:14</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#022">Lam 4:22</A>, if &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; &#1506;&#1500; there signifies "to remove the covering upon anything"). &#1490;&#1468;&#1501; in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#023">Psa 119:23</A>, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#025">Jer 36:25</A>, has the sense of &#1490;&#1468;&#1501;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, etiamsi; and &#1490;&#1468;&#1501; in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#024">Psa 119:24</A> the sense of nevertheless, &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;, Ew. 354, a.

<p>The eightfold Daleth. He is in deep trouble, and prays for consolation and strengthening by means of God's word, to which he resigns himself. His soul is fixed to the dust (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#026">Psa 44:26</A>) in connection with such non-recognition and proscription, and is incapable of raising itself. In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#025">Psa 119:25</A> he implores new strength and spirits (&#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#020">Psa 71:20</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#007">Psa 85:7</A>) from God, in conformity with and by reason of His word. He has rehearsed his walk in every detail to God, and has not been left without an answer, which has assured him of His good pleasure: may He then be pleased to advance him ever further and further in the understanding of His word, in order that, though men are against him, he may nevertheless have God on his side, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#026">Psa 119:26-27</A>.

In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#029">Psa 119:29-30</A> the way of lies or of treachery, and the way of faithfulness or of perseverance in the truth, stand in opposition to one another. &#1495;&#1504;&#1503; is construed with a double accusative, inasmuch as &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492; has not the rigid notion of a fixed teaching, but of living empirical instruction. &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; (short for &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1492; &#1500;&#1504;&#1490;&#1491;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#008">Psa 16:8</A>) signifies to put or set, viz., as a norma normans that stands before one's eyes.

He runs, i.e., walks vigorously and cheerfully, in the way of God's commandments, for He has widened his heart, by granting and preserving to the persecuted one the joyfulness of confession and the confidence of hope.

<p>The eightfold He. He further prays for instruction and guidance that he may escape the by-paths of selfishness and of disavowal. The noun &#1506;&#1511;&#1489;, used also elsewhere as an accus. adverb., in the signification ad extremum (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#033">Psa 119:33</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#112">Psa 119:112</A>) is peculiar to our poet. &#1488;&#1510;&#1468;&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; (with a Sheb&#1490; which takes a colouring in accordance with the principal form) refers back to &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498;. In the petition "give me understanding" (which occurs six times in this Psalm) &#1495;&#1489;&#1497;&#1503; is causative, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#008">Job 32:8</A>, and frequently in the post-exilic writings. &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1506; (from &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1506;, abscindere, as &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; accords in sound with &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;) signifies gain and acquisition by means of the damage which one does to his neighbour by depreciating his property, by robbery, deceit, and extortion (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#003">Sa1 8:3</A>), and as a name of a vice, covetousness, and in general selfishness. &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488; is that which is without real, i.e., without divine, contents or intrinsic worth, - God-opposed teaching and life. &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1512;&#1499;&#1498;

Establishing, in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#038">Psa 119:38</A>, is equivalent to a realizing of the divine word or promise. The relative clause &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1500;&#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514;&#1498; is not to be referred to &#1500;&#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1468;&#1498; according to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#085">Psa 119:85</A> (where the expression is different), but to &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1498;: fulfil to Thy servant Thy word or promise, as that which (quippe quae) aims at men attaining the fear of Thee and increasing therein (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#004">Psa 130:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#004">Psa 40:4</A>). The reproach which the poet fears in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#039">Psa 119:39</A> is not the reproach of confessing, but of denying God. Accordingly &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1497;&#1498; are not God's judgments i.e., acts of judgment, but revealed decisions or judgments: these are good, inasmuch as it is well with him who keeps them. He can appeal before God to the fact that he is set upon the knowledge and experience of these with longing of heart; and he bases his request upon the fact that God by virtue of His righteousness, i.e., the stringency with which He maintains His order of grace, both as to its promises and its duties, would quicken him, who is at present as it were dead with sorrow and weariness.

<p>The eightfold Vav. He prays for the grace of true and fearlessly joyous confession. The lxx renders <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#041">Psa 119:41</A>: &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0; &#787; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3b5; &#787; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;; but the Targum and Jerome rightly (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#077">Psa 119:77</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#007">Isa 63:7</A>) have the plural: God's proofs of loving-kindness in accordance with His promises will put him in the position that he will not be obliged to be dumb in the presence of him who reproaches him (&#1495;&#1512;&#1507;, prop. a plucker, cf. Arab. charu&#770;f, a lamb = a plucker of leaves or grass), but will be able to answer him on the ground of his own experience. The verb &#1506;&#1504;&#1492;, which in itself has many meanings, acquires the signification "to give an answer" through the word, &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;, that is added (synon. &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;). <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#043">Psa 119:43</A> also refers to the duty of confessing God. The meaning of the prayer is, that God may not suffer him to come to such a pass that he will be utterly unable to witness for the truth; for language dies away in the mouth of him who is unworthy of its before God. The writer has no fear of this for himself, for his hope is set towards God's judgments (&#1500;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1498;, defective plural, as also in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#149">Psa 119:149</A>; in proof of which, compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#156">Psa 119:156</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#175">Psa 119:175</A>), his confidence takes its stand upon them. The futures which follow from <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#044">Psa 119:44</A> to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#048">Psa 119:48</A> declare that what he would willingly do by the grace of God, and strives to do, is to walk &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1495;&#1489;&#1492;, in a broad space (elsewhere &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1495;&#1489;), therefore unstraitened, which in this instance is not equivalent to happily, but courageously and unconstrainedly, without allowing myself to be intimidated, and said of inward freedom which makes itself known outwardly. In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#046">Psa 119:46</A> the Vulgate renders: Et loquebar de (in) testimoniis tuis in conspectu regum et non confundebar - the motto of the Augsburg Confession, to which it was adapted especially in connection with this historical interpretation of the two verbs, which does not correspond to the original text. The lifting up of the hands in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#048">Psa 119:48</A> is an expression of fervent longing desire, as in connection with prayer, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#002">Psa 28:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#005">Psa 63:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#002">Psa 134:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#002">Psa 141:2</A>, and frequently.

<p>The eightfold Zajin. God's word is his hope and his trust amidst all derision; and when he burns with indignation at the apostates, God's word is his solace. Since in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#049">Psa 119:49</A> the expression is not &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1498; but &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;, it is not to be interpreted according to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#003">Psa 98:3</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#045">Psa 106:45</A>, but: remember the word addressed to Thy servant, because Thou hast made me hope (Piel causat. as e.g., &#1504;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1492;, to cause to forget, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#051">Gen 41:51</A>), i.e., hast comforted me by promising me a blessed issue, and hast directed my expectation thereunto. This is his comfort in his dejected condition, that God's promissory declaration has quickened him and proved its reviving power in his case. In &#1492;&#1500;&#1497;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; (&#1492;&#1500;&#1497;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;), ludificantur, it is implied that the &#1494;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; eht taht d are just &#1500;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501;, frivolous persons, libertines, free-thinkers (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#024">Pro 21:24</A>). &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1497;&#1498;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#052">Psa 119:52</A>, are the valid, verified decisions (judgments) of God revealed from the veriest olden times. In the remembrance of these, which determine the lot of a man according to the relation he holds towards them, the poet found comfort. It can be rendered: then I comforted myself; or according to a later usage of the Hithpa.: I was comforted. Concerning &#1494;&#1500;&#1506;&#1508;&#1492;, aestus, vid., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#006">Psa 11:6</A>, and on the subject-matter, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#021">Psa 119:21</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#104">Psa 119:104</A>. The poet calls his earthly life "the house of his pilgrimage;" for it is true the earth is man's (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#016">Psa 115:16</A>), but he has no abiding resting-place there (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#015">Ch1 29:15</A>), his &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#005">Ecc 12:5</A>) is elsewhere (vid., supra, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#019">Psa 119:19</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#013">Psa 39:13</A>). God's statutes are here his "songs," which give him spiritual refreshing, sweeten the hardships of the pilgrimage, and measure and hasten his steps. The Name of God has been in his mind hitherto, not merely by day, but also by night; and in consequence of this he has kept God's law (&#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492;, as five times besides in this Psalm, cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#006">Psa 3:6</A>, and to be distinguished from &#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#044">Psa 119:44</A>). Just this, that he keeps (observat) God's precepts, has fallen to his lot. To others something else is allotted (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#008">Psa 4:8</A>), to him this one most needful thing.

<p>The eightfold Heth. To understand and to keep God's word is his portion, the object of his incessant praying and thanksgiving, the highest grace or favour that can come to him. According to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#005">Psa 16:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#026">Psa 73:26</A>, the words &#1495;&#1500;&#1511;&#1497; &#1492; belong together. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#057">Psa 119:57</A> is an inference drawn from it (&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; &#1500; as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#014">Exo 2:14</A>, and frequently), and the existing division of the verse is verified. &#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#013">Psa 45:13</A>, is an expression of caressing, flattering entreaty; in Latin, caput mulcere (demulcere). His turning to the word of God the poet describes in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#059">Psa 119:59</A> as a result of a careful trying of his actions. After that he quickly and cheerfully, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#060">Psa 119:60</A>, determined to keep it without any long deliberation with flesh and blood, although the snares of wicked men surround him. The meaning of &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497; is determined according to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#110">Psa 119:110</A> : the pointing does not distinguish so sharply as one might have expected between &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;, &#x3c9;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, and &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;, snares, bonds (vid., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#005">Psa 18:5</A>.); but the plural nowhere, according to the usage of the language as we now have it, signifies bands (companies), from the singular in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#005">Sa1 10:5</A> (Bttcher, 800). Thankfulness urges him to get up at midnight (acc. temp. as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#020">Job 34:20</A>) to prostrate himself before God and to pray. Accordingly he is on friendly terms with, he is closely connected with (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#024">Pro 28:24</A>), all who fear God. Out of the fulness of the loving-kindness of God, which is nowhere unattested upon earth (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#064">Psa 119:64</A> = <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#005">Psa 33:5</A>), he implores for himself the inward teaching concerning His word as the highest and most cherished of mercies.

<p>The eightfold Teth. The good word of the gracious God is the fountain of all good; and it is learned in the way of lowliness. He reviews his life, and sees in everything that has befallen him the good and well-meaning appointment of the God of salvation in accordance with the plan and order of salvation of His word. The form &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1468;&#1498;, which is the form out of pause, is retained in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#065">Psa 119:65</A> beside Athnach, although not preceded by Olewejored (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#019">Psa 35:19</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#011">Psa 48:11</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#021">Pro 30:21</A>). Clinging believingly to the commandments of God, he is able confidently to pray that He would teach him "good discernment" and "knowledge." &#1496;&#1506;&#1501; is ethically the capacity of distinguishing between good and evil, and of discovering the latter as it were by touch; &#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; &#1496;&#1506;&#1501;, good discernment, is a coupling of words like &#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; &#1500;&#1489;, a happy disposition, cheerfulness. God has brought him into this relationship to His word by humbling him, and thus setting him right out of his having gone astray. &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492; in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#067">Psa 119:67</A>, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#011">Psa 119:11</A>, is not God's utterance conveying a promise, but imposing a duty. God is called &#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489; as He who is graciously disposed towards man, and &#1502;&#1514;&#1497;&#1489; as He who acts out this disposition; this loving and gracious God he implores to become his Teacher. In his fidelity to God's word he does not allow himself to be led astray by any of the lies which the proud try to impose upon him (Bttcher), or better absolutely (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#004">Job 13:4</A>): to patch together over him, making the true nature unrecognisable as it were by means of false plaster or whitewash (&#1496;&#1508;&#1500;, to smear over, bedaub, as the Targumic, Talmudic, and Syriac show). If the heart of these men, who by slander make him into a caricature of himself, is covered as it were with thick fat (a figure of insensibility and obduracy, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#010">Psa 17:10</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#007">Psa 73:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#010">Isa 6:10</A>, lxx &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;, Aquila &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;, Symmachus &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;) against all the impressions of the word of God, he, on the other hand, has his delight in the law of God (&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; with an accusative of the object, not of that which is delighted, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#019">Psa 94:19</A>, but of that which delights). How beneficial has the school of affliction through which he has attained to this, been to him! The word proceeding from the mouth of God is now more precious to him than the greatest earthly riches. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#073">Psalms 119:73</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_073">psa 119:73</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The eightfold Jod. God humbles, but He also exalts again according to His word; for this the poet prays in order that he may be a consolatory example to the God-fearing, to the confusion of his enemies. It is impossible that God should forsake man, who is His creature, and deny to him that which makes him truly happy, viz., the understanding and knowledge of His word. For this spiritual gift the poet prays in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#073">Psa 119:73</A> (cf. on 73a, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#006">Deu 32:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#008">Job 10:8</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#015">Job 31:15</A>); and he wishes in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#074">Psa 119:74</A> that all who fear God may see in him with joy an example of the way in which trust in the word of God is rewarded (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#003">Psa 34:3</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#027">Psa 35:27</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#033">Psa 69:33</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#042">Psa 107:42</A>, and other passages). He knows that God's acts of judgment are pure righteousness, i.e., regulated by God's holiness, out of which they spring, and by the salvation of men, at which they aim; and he knows that God has humbled him &#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; (accus. adverb. for &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;), being faithful in His intentions towards him; for it is just in the school of affliction that one first learns rightly to estimate the worth of His word, and comes to feel its power. But trouble, though sweetened by an insight into God's salutary design, is nevertheless always bitter; hence the well-justified prayer of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#076">Psa 119:76</A>, that God's mercy may notwithstanding be bestowed upon him for his consolation, in accordance with the promise which is become his (&#1500; as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#049">Psa 119:49</A>), His servant's. &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#078">Psa 119:78</A>, instead of being construed with the accusative of the right, or of the cause, that is perverted, is construed with the accusative of the person upon whom such perversion of right, such oppression by means of misrepresentation, is inflicted, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#006">Job 19:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#036">Lam 3:36</A>. Chajug' reads &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#061">Psa 119:61</A>. The wish expressed in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#079">Psa 119:79</A> is to be understood according to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#010">Psa 73:10</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#019">Jer 15:19</A>, cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#004">Pro 9:4</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#016">Pro 9:16</A>. If instead of &#1493;&#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1497; (which is favoured by <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#063">Psa 119:63</A>), we read according to the Chethb &#1493;&#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#125">Psa 119:125</A>), then what is meant by &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; &#1500;&#1468;&#1497; is a turning towards him for the purpose of learning: may their knowledge be enriched from his experience. For himself, however, in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#080">Psa 119:80</A> he desires unreserved, faultless, unwavering adherence to God's word, for only thus is he secure against being ignominiously undeceived.

<p>The eightfold Kaph. This strengthening according to God's promise is his earnest desire (&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;) now, when within a very little his enemies have compassed his ruin (&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;). His soul and eyes languish (&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492; as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#004">Psa 69:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#003">Psa 84:3</A>, cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#027">Job 19:27</A>) for God's salvation, that it may be unto him according to God's word or promise, that this word may be fulfilled. In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#083">Psa 119:83</A> &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; is hypothetical, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#012">Psa 21:12</A> and frequently; here, as perhaps also in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#010">Psa 27:10</A>, in the sense of "although" (Ew. &#1431;362, b). He does not suffer anything to drive God's word out of his mind, although he is already become like a leathern bottle blackened and shrivelled up in the smoke. The custom of the ancients of placing jars with wine over the smoke in order to make the wine prematurely old, i.e., to mellow it (vid., Rosenm&#1516;ller), does not yield anything towards the understanding of this passage: the skin-bottle that is not intended for present use is hung up on high; and the fact that it had to withstand the upward ascending smoke is intelligible, notwithstanding the absence of any mention of the chimney. The point of comparison, in which we agree for the most part with Hitzig, is the removal of him who in his dungeon is continually exposed to the drudgery of his persecutors. &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#084">Psa 119:84</A> is equivalent to "how few." Our life here below is short, so also is the period within which the divine righteousness can reveal itself. &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; (instead of which the lxx erroneously reads &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;), pits, is an old word, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#007">Psa 57:7</A>. The relative clause, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#085">Psa 119:85</A>, describes the "proud" as being a contradiction to the revealed law; for there was no necessity for saying that to dig a pit for others is not in accordance with this law. All God's commandments are an emanation of His faithfulness, and therefore too demand faithfulness; but it is just this faithfulness that makes the poet an object of deadly hatred. They have already almost destroyed him"in the land." It is generally rendered "on earth;" but "in heaven" at the beginning of the following octonary is too far removed to be an antithesis to it, nor does it sound like one (cf. on the other hand &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; ouranoi's, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#012">Mat 5:12</A>). It is therefore: in the land (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#003">Psa 58:3</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#009">Psa 73:9</A>), where they think they are the only ones who have any right there, they have almost destroyed him, without shaking the constancy of his faith. But he stands in need of fresh grace in order that he may not, however, at last succumb.

<p>The eightfold Lamed. Eternal and imperishable in the constant verifying of itself is the vigorous and consolatory word of God, to which the poet will ever cling. It has heaven as its standing-place, and therefore it also has the qualities of heaven, and before all others, heaven-like stability. Ps 89 (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#003">Psa 89:3</A>) uses similar language in reference to God's faithfulness, of which here <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#090">Psa 119:90</A> says that it endureth into all generations. The earth hath He creatively set up, and it standeth, viz., as a practical proof and as a scene of His infinite, unchangeable faithfulness. Heaven and earth are not the subjects of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#091">Psa 119:91</A> (Hupfeld), for only the earth is previously mentioned; the reference to the heavens in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#089">Psa 119:89</A> is of a very different character. Hitzig and others see the subject in &#1500;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1497;&#1498;: with respect to Thy judgments, they stand fast unto this day; but the &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1497;&#1498; which follows requires another meaning to be assigned to &#1506;&#1502;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;: either of taking up one's place ready for service, or, since &#1506;&#1502;&#1491; &#1500;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496; is a current phrase in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#012">Num 35:12</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#006">Jos 20:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#024">Eze 44:24</A>, of placing one's self ready to obey (Bttcher). The subject of &#1506;&#1502;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;, as the following &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500; shows, is meant to be thought of in the most general sense (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#014">Job 38:14</A>): all beings are God's servants (subjects), and have accordingly to be obedient and humble before His judicial decisions - &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501;, "even to this day," the poet adds, for these judicial decisions are those which are formulated beforehand in the Tra. Joy in this ever sure, all-conditioning word has upheld the poet in his affliction, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#092">Psa 119:92</A>. He who has been persecuted and cast down as it were to death, owes his reviving to it, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#093">Psa 119:93</A>. From Him whose possession or property he is in faith and love he also further looks for his salvation, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#094">Psa 119:94</A>. Let evil-doers lie in wait for him (&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; in a hostile sense, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#007">Psa 56:7</A>, &#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492;, cf. &#1495;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;, going back to &#1511;&#1493;&#1492;, Arab. qawiya, with the broad primary signification, to be tight, firm, strong) to destroy him, he meditates on God's testimonies. He knows from experience that all (earthly) perfection (&#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1492;) has an end (inasmuch as, having reached its height, it changes into its opposite); God's commandment (singular as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#022">Deu 11:22</A>), on the contrary, is exceeding broad (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#009">Job 11:9</A>), unlimited in its duration and verification.

<p>The eightfold Mem. The poet praises the practical wisdom which the word of God, on this very account so sweet to him, teaches. God's precious law, with which he unceasingly occupies himself, makes him superior in wisdom (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#006">Deu 4:6</A>), intelligence, and judgment to his enemies, his teachers, and the aged (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#020">Job 12:20</A>). There were therefore at that time teachers and elders (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;), who (like the Hellenizing Sadducees) were not far from apostasy in their laxness, and hostilely persecuted the young and strenuous zealot for God's law. The construction of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#098">Psa 119:98</A> is like <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#020">Joe 1:20</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#012">Isa 59:12</A>, and frequently. &#1492;&#1497;&#1488; refers to the commandments in their unity: he has taken possession of them for ever (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#111">Psa 119:111</A>). The Mishna (Aboth iv. 1) erroneously interprets: from all my teachers do I acquire understanding. All three &#1502;&#1503; in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#098">Psa 119:98-100</A> signify prae (lxx &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#768;&#x3c1;). In &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#101">Psa 119:101</A>, from the mode of writing we see the verb Lamed Aleph passing over into the verb Lamed He. &#1492;&#1493;&#1512;&#1514;&#1504;&#1497; is, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#011">Pro 4:11</A> (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#015">Exo 4:15</A>), a defective mode of writing for &#1492;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;&#1504;&#1497;. &#1504;&#1502;&#1500;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#103">Psa 119:103</A>, is not equivalent to &#1504;&#1502;&#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#025">Job 6:25</A> (vid., Job, at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#025">Job 6:25</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#002">Job 16:2-5</A>), but signifies, in consequence of the dative of the object &#1500;&#1495;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, that which easily enters, or that which tastes good (lxx &#x3c9;&#788;&#x3c2; gluke'a); therefore surely from &#1502;&#1500;&#1509; = &#1502;&#1500;&#1496;, to be smooth: how smooth, entering easily (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#031">Pro 23:31</A>), are Thy words (promises) to my palate or taste! The collective singular &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1498; is construed with a plural of the predicate (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#010">Exo 1:10</A>). He has no taste for the God-estranged present, but all the stronger taste for God's promised future. From God's laws he acquires the capacity for proving the spirits, therefore he hates every path of falsehood (= <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#128">Psa 119:128</A>), i.e., all the heterodox tendencies which agree with the spirit of the age.

<p>The eightfold Nun. The word of God is his constant guide, to which he has entrusted himself for ever. The way here below is a way through darkness, and leads close past abysses: in this danger of falling and of going astray the word of God is a lamp to his feet, i.e., to his course, and a light to his path (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#023">Pro 6:23</A>); his lamp or torch and his sun. That which he has sworn, viz., to keep God's righteous requirements, he has also set up, i.e., brought to fulfilment, but not without being bowed down under heavy afflictions in confessing God; wherefore he prays (as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#025">Psa 119:25</A>) that God would revive him in accordance with His word, which promises life to those who keep it. The confessions of prayer coming from the inmost impulse of his whole heart, in which he owns his indebtedness and gives himself up entirely to God's mercy, he calls the free-will offerings of his mouth in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#108">Psa 119:108</A> (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#014">Psa 50:14</A>; 19:15). He bases the prayer for a gracious acceptance of these upon the fact of his being reduced to extremity. "To have one's soul in one's hand" is the same as to be in conscious peril of one's life, just as "to take one's soul into one's hand" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#003">Jdg 12:3</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#005">Sa1 19:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#021">Sa1 28:21</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#014">Job 13:14</A>) is the same as to be ready to give one's life for it, to risk one's life.
<p>(Note: Cf. B. Taanth 8a: "The prayer of a man is not answered &#1488;&#1500;&#1488; &#1488;&#1501; &#1499;&#1503; &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; &#1489;&#1499;&#1508;&#1493;, i.e., if he is not ready to sacrifice his life.")
<p>Although his life is threatened (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#087">Psa 119:87</A>), yet he does not waver and depart from God's word; he has taken and obtained possession of God's testimonies for ever (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#098">Psa 119:98</A>); they are his "heritage," for which he willingly gives up everything else, for they (&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; inexactly for &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;) it is which bless and entrance him in his inmost soul. In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#112">Psa 119:112</A> it is not to be interpreted after <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#012">Psa 19:12</A> : eternal is the reward (of the carrying out of Thy precepts), but in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#033">Psa 119:33</A> &#1506;&#1511;&#1489; is equivalent to &#1500;&#1506;&#1491;, and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#044">Psa 119:44</A> proves that <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#112">Psa 119:112</A> need not be a thought that is complete in itself.

<p>The eightfold Samech. His hope rests on God's word, without allowing itself to be led astray by doubters and apostates. &#1505;&#1506;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501; (the form of nouns which indicate defects or failings) are those inwardly divided, halting between two opinions (&#1505;&#1506;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;),    <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#021">Kg1 18:21</A>, who do homage partly to the worship of Jahve, partly to heathenism, and therefore are trying to combine faith and naturalism. In contrast to such, the poet's love, faith, and hope are devoted entirely to the God of revelation; and to all those who are desirous of drawing him away he addresses in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#115">Psa 119:115</A> (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#009">Psa 6:9</A>) an indignant "depart." He, however, stands in need of grace in order to persevere and to conquer. For this he prays in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#116">Psa 119:116-117</A>. The &#1502;&#1503; in &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497; is the same as in &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473; &#1502;&#1503;. The ah of &#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1492; is the intentional ah (Ew. 228, c), as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#023">Isa 41:23</A>. The statement of the ground of the &#1505;&#1500;&#1497;&#1514;, vilipendis, does not mean: unsuccessful is their deceit (Hengstenberg, Olshausen), but falsehood without the consistency of truth is their self-deceptive and seductive tendency. The lxx and Syriac read &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1514;&#1501;, "their sentiment;" but this is an Aramaic word that is unintelligible in Hebrew, which the old translators have conjured into the text only on account of an apparent tautology. The reading &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;&#1468; or &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;&#1468; (Aquila, Symmachus, and Jerome; lxx &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;, therefore &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;&#1497;) instead of &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;&#1468; might more readily be justified in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#119">Psa 119:119</A>; but the former gives too narrow a meaning, and the reading rests on a mistaking of the construction of &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497;&#1514; with an accusative of the object and of the effect: all the wicked, as many of them as are on the earth, dost Thou put away as dross (&#1505;&#1490;&#1497;&#1501;( ssor). Accordingly &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496;&#1497;&#1498; in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#120">Psa 119:120</A> are God's punitive judgments, or rather (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#091">Psa 119:91</A>) God's laws (judgments) according to which He judges. What is meant are sentences of punishment, as in Lev. 26, Deut. 28. Of these the poet is afraid, for omnipotence can change words into deeds forthwith. In fear of the God who has attested Himself in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#007">Exo 34:7</A> and elsewhere, his skin shudders and his hair stands on end.

In the consciousness of his godly behaviour (elsewhere always &#1510;&#1491;&#1511; &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;, here in one instance &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496; &#1493;&#1510;&#1491;&#1511;) the poet hopes that God will surely not (&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;) leave him to the arbitrary disposal of his oppressors. This hope does not, however, raise him above the necessity and duty of constant prayer that Jahve would place Himself between him and his enemies. &#1506;&#1512;&#1489; seq. acc. signifies to stand in any one's place as furnishing a guarantee, and in general as a mediator, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#003">Job 17:3</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#014">Isa 38:14</A>; &#1500;&#1496;&#1493;&#1489; similar to &#1500;&#1496;&#1493;&#1489;&#1492;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#017">Psa 86:17</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#019">Neh 5:19</A> : in my behalf, for my real advantage. The expression of longing after redemption in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#123">Psa 119:123</A> sounds like <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#081">Psa 119:81</A>. "The word of Thy righteousness" is the promise which proceeds from God's "righteousness," and as surely as He is "righteous" cannot remain unfulfilled. The one chief petition of the poet, however, to which he comes back in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#124">Psa 119:124</A>., has reference to the ever deeper knowledge of the word of God; for this knowledge is in itself at once life and blessedness, and the present calls most urgently for it. For the great multitude (which is the subject to &#1492;&#1508;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;) practically and fundamentally break God's law; it is therefore time to act for Jahve (&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1500; as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#030">Gen 30:30</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#004">Isa 64:4</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#020">Eze 29:20</A>), and just in order to this there is need of well-grounded, reliable knowledge. Therefore the poet attaches himself with all his love to God's commandments; to him they are above gold and fine gold (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#011">Psa 19:11</A>), which he might perhaps gain by a disavowal of them. Therefore he is as strict as he possibly can be with God's word, inasmuch as he acknowledges and observes all precepts of all things (&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497; &#1499;&#1500;), i.e., all divine precepts, let them have reference to whatsoever they will, as &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, right (&#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1512;, to declare both in avowal and deed to be right); and every false (lying) tendency, all pseudo-Judaism, he hates. It is true <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#126">Psa 119:126</A> may be also explained: it is time that Jahve should act, i.e., interpose judicially; but this thought is foreign to the context, and affords no equally close union for &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1503;; moreover it ought then to have been accented &#1506;&#1514; &#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514; &#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;. On &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497; &#1499;&#1500;, "all commands of every purport," cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#011">Isa 29:11</A>, and more as to form, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#016">Num 8:16</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#030">Eze 44:30</A>.
<p>The expression is purposely thus heightened; and the correction &#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1511;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497;&#1498; (Ewald, Olshausen, and Hupfeld) is also superfluous, because the reference of what is said to the God of revelation is self-evident in this connection.

<p>The eightfold Phe. The deeper his depression of spirit concerning those who despise the word of God, the more ardently does he yearn after the light and food of that word. The testimonies of God are &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;, wonderful and strange (paradoxical) things, exalted above every-day life and the common understanding. In this connection of the thoughts &#1504;&#1510;&#1512;&#1514;&#1501; is not intended of careful observance, but of attentive contemplation that is prolonged until a clear penetrating understanding of the matter is attained. The opening, disclosure (&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495;, apertio, with Tsere in distinction from &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495;, porta) of God's word giveth light, inasmuch as it makes the simple (&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501; as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#003">Pro 22:3</A>) wise or sagacious; in connection with which it is assumed that it is God Himself who unfolds the mysteries of His word to those who are anxious to learn. Such an one, anxious to learn, is the poet: he pants with open mouth, viz., for the heavenly fare of such disclosures (&#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512; like &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512; &#1508;&#1468;&#1492; in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#023">Job 29:23</A>, cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#011">Psa 81:11</A>). &#1497;&#1488;&#1489; is a hapaxlegomenon, just as &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1489; is also exclusively peculiar to the Psalm before us; both are secondary forms of &#1488;&#1489;&#1492;. Love to God cannot indeed remain unresponded to. The experience of helping grace is a right belonging to those who love the God of revelation; love in return for love, salvation in return for the longing for salvation, is their prerogative. On the ground of this reciprocal relation the petitions in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#133">Psa 119:133-135</A> are then put up, coming back at last to the one chief prayer "teach me." &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#133">Psa 119:133</A>, is not merely a "promise" in this instance, but the declared will of God in general. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503; refers pre-eminently to all sin of disavowal (denying God), into which he might fall under outward and inward pressure (&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;). For he has round about him those who do not keep God's law. On account of these apostates (&#1506;&#1500; &#1500;&#1488; as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#009">Isa 53:9</A>, equivalent to &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1500;&#1488;) his eyes run down rivers of water (&#1497;&#1512;&#1491; as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#048">Lam 3:48</A>, with an accusative of the object). His mood is not that of unfeeling self-glorying, but of sorrow like that of Jeremiah, because of the contempt of Jahve, and the self-destruction of those who contemn Him.

<p>The eightfold Tsade. God rules righteously and faithfully according to His word, for which the poet is accordingly zealous, although young and despised. The predicate &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512; in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#137">Psa 119:137</A> precedes its subject &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1497;&#1498; (God's decisions in word and in deed) in the primary form (after the model of the verbal clause <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#005">Psa 124:5</A>), just as in German [and English] the predicative adjective remains undeclined. The accusatives &#1510;&#1491;&#1511; and &#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#138">Psa 119:138</A> are not predicative (Hitzig), to which the former ("as righteousness") - not the latter however - is not suited, but adverbial accusatives (in righteousness, in faithfulness), and &#1502;&#1488;&#1491; according to its position is subordinate to &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492; as a virtual adjective (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#009">Isa 47:9</A>): the requirements of the revealed law proceed from a disposition towards and mode of dealing with men which is strictly determined by His holiness (&#1510;&#1491;&#1511;), and beyond measure faithfully and honestly designs the well-being of men (&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492; &#1502;&#1488;&#1491;). To see this good law of God despised by his persecutors stirs the poet up with a zeal, which brings him, from their side, to the brink of extreme destruction (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#010">Psa 69:10</A>, cf. &#1510;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1514;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#017">Psa 88:17</A>). God's own utterance is indeed without spot, and therefore not to be carped at; it is pure, fire-proved, noblest metal (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#031">Psa 18:31</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#007">Psa 12:7</A>), therefore he loves it, and does not, though young (lxx &#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, Vulgate adolescentulus) and lightly esteemed, care for the remonstrances of his proud opponents who are old and more learned than himself (the organization of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#141">Psa 119:141</A> is like <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#095">Psa 119:95</A>, and frequently). The righteousness (&#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492;) of the God of revelation becomes eternal righteousness (&#1510;&#1491;&#1511;), and His law remains eternal truth (&#1488;&#1502;&#1514;). &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492; is here the name of the attribute and of the action that is conditioned in accordance with it; &#1510;&#1491;&#1511; the name of the state that thoroughly accords with the idea of that which is right. So too in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#144">Psa 119:144</A> : &#1510;&#1491;&#1511; are Jahve's testimonies for ever, so that all creatures must give glory to their harmony with that which is absolutely right. To look ever deeper and deeper into this their perfection is the growing life of the spirit. The poet prays for this vivifying insight.

<p>The eightfold Koph. Fidelity to God's word, and deliverance according to His promise, is the purport of his unceasing prayer. Even in the morning twilight (&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1507;) he was awake praying. It is not &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1507;, I anticipated the twilight; nor is &#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, according to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#014">Psa 89:14</A>, equivalent to &#1511;&#1491;&#1502;&#1514;&#1497;&#1498;, but &#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;...&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; is the resolution of the otherwise customary construction &#1511;&#1491;&#1502;&#1514;&#1497; &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#002">Jon 4:2</A>, inasmuch as &#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1501; may signify "to go before" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#026">Psa 68:26</A>), and also "to make haste (with anything):" even early before the morning's dawn I cried. Instead of &#1500;&#1491;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1498; the Ker (Targum, Syriac, Jerome) more appropriately reads &#1500;&#1491;&#1489;&#1512;&#1498; after <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#074">Psa 119:74</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#081">Psa 119:81</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#114">Psa 119:114</A>. But his eyes also anticipated the night-watches, inasmuch as they did not allow themselves to be caught not sleeping by any of them at their beginning (cf. &#1500;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#019">Lam 2:19</A>). &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492; is here, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#140">Psa 119:140</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#158">Psa 119:158</A>, and frequently, the whole word of God, whether in its requirements or its promises. In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#149">Psa 119:149</A> &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1498; is a defective plural as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#043">Psa 119:43</A> (vid., on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#037">Psa 119:37</A>), according to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#156">Psa 119:156</A>, although according to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#132">Psa 119:132</A> the singular (lxx, Targum, Jerome) would also be admissible: what is meant is God's order of salvation, or His appointments that relate thereto. The correlative relation of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#150">Psa 119:150</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#151">Psa 119:151</A> is rendered natural by the position of the words. With &#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; (cf. &#1511;&#1512;&#1489;) is associated the idea of rushing upon him with hostile purpose, and with &#1511;&#1512;&#1493;&#1489;, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#019">Psa 69:19</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#002">Isa 58:2</A>, of hastening to his succour. &#1494;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; is infamy that is branded by the law: they go forth purposing this, but God's law is altogether self-verifying truth. And the poet has long gained the knowledge from it that it does not aim at merely temporary recompense. The sophisms of the apostates cannot therefore lead him astray. &#1497;&#1505;&#1491;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; for &#1497;&#1505;&#1491;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503;, like &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#111">Psa 119:111</A>.

<p>The eightfold Resh. Because God cannot suffer those who are faithful to His word to succumb, he supplicates His help against his persecutors. &#1512;&#1497;&#1489;&#1492; is Milra before the initial (half-guttural) Resh, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#001">Psa 43:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#022">Psa 74:22</A>. The Lamed of &#1500;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1498; is the Lamed of reference (with respect to Thine utterance), whether the reference be normative (= &#1499;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1498;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#058">Psa 119:58</A>), as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#003">Isa 11:3</A>, or causal, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#002">Isa 25:2</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#005">Isa 55:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#005">Job 42:5</A>. The predicate &#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1511;, like &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512; in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#137">Psa 119:137</A>, stands first in the primary, as yet indefinite form.

If he reckons up the word of God in its separate parts and as a whole, truth is the denominator of the whole, truth is the sum-total. This supplicatory &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; is repeated three times in this group. The nearer it draws towards its end the more importunate does the Psalm become.

<p>The eightfold &#1513; (both Shin and Sin)
<p>(Note: Whilst even in the oldest alphabetical Pijutim the Sin perhaps represents the Samech as well, but never the Shin, it is the reverse in the Biblical alphabetical pieces. Here Sin and Shin coincide, and Samech is specially represented.)).
<p>In the midst of persecution God's word was still his fear, his joy, and his love, the object of his thanksgiving, and the ground of his hope. Princes persecute him without adequate cause, but his heart does not fear before them, but before God's words (the Ker likes the singular, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#147">Psa 119:147</A>), to deny which would be to him the greatest possible evil. It is, however, a fear that is associated with heartfelt joy (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#111">Psa 119:111</A>). It is the joy of a conflict that is rewarded by rich spoil (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#030">Jdg 5:30</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#003">Isa 9:3</A>). Not merely morning and evening, not merely three times a day (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#018">Psa 55:18</A>), but seven times (&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506; as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#018">Lev 26:18</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#016">Pro 24:16</A>), i.e., ever again and again, availing himself of every prayerful impulse, he gives thanks to God for His word, which so righteously decides and so correctly guides, is a source of transcendent peace to all who love it, and beside which one is not exposed to any danger of stumbling (&#1502;&#1499;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1500;, lxx &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#010">Jo1 2:10</A>) without some effectual counter-working. In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#166">Psa 119:166</A> he speaks like Jacob in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#018">Gen 49:18</A>, and can speak thus, inasmuch as he has followed earnestly and untiringly after sanctification. He endeavours to keep God's law most conscientiously, in proof of which he is able to appeal to God the Omniscient One. &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492; is here the 3rd praet., whereas in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#002">Psa 86:2</A> it is imperat.

<p>The eightfold Tav. May God answer this his supplication as He has heard his praise, and interest Himself on behalf of His servant, the sheep that is exposed to great danger. The petitions "give me understanding" and "deliver me" go hand-in-hand, because the poet is one who is persecuted for the sake of his faith, and is just as much in need of the fortifying of his faith as of deliverance from the outward restraint that is put upon him. &#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; is a shrill audible prayer; &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;, a fervent and urgent prayer. &#1506;&#1504;&#1492;, prop. to answer, signifies in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#172">Psa 119:172</A> to begin, strike up, attune (as does &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; also sometimes). According to the rule in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#023">Psa 50:23</A> the poet bases his petition for help upon the purpose of thankful praise of God and of His word. Knowing how to value rightly what he possesses, he is warranted in further supplicating and hoping for the good that he does not as yet possess. The "salvation" for which he longs (&#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1489; as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#040">Psa 119:40</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#020">Psa 119:20</A>) is redemption from the evil world, in which the life of his own soul is imperilled. May then God's judgments (defective plural, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#043">Psa 119:43</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#149">Psa 119:149</A>, which the Syriac only takes a singular) succour him (&#1497;&#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1512;&#1504;&#1497;, not &#1497;&#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1504;&#1497;). God's hand, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#173">Psa 119:173</A>, and God's word afford him succour; the two are involved in one another, the word is the medium of His hand. After this relationship of the poet to God's word, which is attested a hundredfold in the Psalm, it may seem strange that he can say of himself &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497; &#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1488;&#1489;&#1491;; and perhaps the accentuation is correct when it does not allow itself to be determined by <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#006">Isa 53:6</A>, but interprets: If I have gone astray - seek Thou like a lost sheep Thy servant. &#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1488;&#1489;&#1491; is a sheep that is lost (cf. &#1488;&#1489;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; as an appellation of the dispersion, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#013">Isa 27:13</A>) and in imminent danger of total destruction (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#013">Psa 31:13</A> with <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#038">Lev 26:38</A>). In connection with that interpretation which is followed by the interpunction, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#176">Psa 119:176</A> is also more easily connected with what precedes: his going astray is no apostasy; his home, to which he longs to return when he has been betrayed into by-ways, is beside the Lord.
