The Punishment That Awaits the Evil Tongue

With [Psa 52:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#001), which, side by side
with Ps 51, exhibits the contrast between the false and the right use of
the tongue, begins a series of Elohimic Maskı̂ls (Ps 52-55) by David. It
is one of the eight Psalms which, by the statements of the inscriptions,
of which some are capable of being verified, and others at least cannot
be replaced by anything that is more credible, are assigned to the time
of his persecution by Saul (Ps 7, 59, [Psa
56:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#001), 34, [Psa
52:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#001), [Psa
57:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001), [Psa
142:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#001), [Psa
54:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#001)). Augustine calls them Psalmos
fugitivos. The inscription runs: To the Precentor, a meditation (vid.,
[Psa 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001)), by David, when Doeg the
Edomite came and told Saul and said to him: David is gone in to the
house of Ahimelech. By בּבוא, as in [Psa
51:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#002); [Psa
54:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#002), the writer of the inscription
does not define the exact moment of the composition of the Psalm, but
only in a general way the period in which it falls. After David had
sojourned a short time with Samuel, he betook himself to Nob to
Ahimelech the priest; and he gave him without hesitation, as being the
son-in-law of the king, the shew-bread that had been removed, and the
sword of Goliath that had been hung up in the sanctuary behind the
ephod. Doeg the Edomite was witness of this; and when Saul, under the
tamarisk in Gibea, held an assembly of his serving men, Doeg, the
overseer of the royal mules, betrayed what had taken place between David
and Ahimelech to him. Eighty-five priests immediately fell as victims of
this betrayal, and only Abiathar (Ebjathar) the son of Ahimelech escaped
and reached David, [Sa1 22:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#006)
(where, in [Psa 52:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#009), פרדי is to be
read instead of עבדי, cf. [Psa 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#008)).

[Psalms 52:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 52:1</span></span>

It is bad enough to behave wickedly, but bad in the extreme to boast of
it at the same time as an heroic act. Doeg, who causes a massacre, not,
however, by the strength of his hand, but by the cunning of his tongue,
does this. Hence he is sarcastically called גּבּור (cf. [Isa
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#022)). David's cause, however, is not
therefore lost; for it is the cause of God, whose loving-kindness
endures continually, without allowing itself to be affected, like the
favour of men, by calumny. Concerning הוּות vid., on [Psa
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#010). לשׁון is as usual treated as
fem; עשׂה רמיּה (according to the Masora with Tsere) is consequently
addressed to a person. In [Psa 52:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#005) רע
after אהבתּ has the Dagesh that is usual also in other instances
according to the rule of the אתי מרחיק, especially in connection with
the letters כפתבגד (with which Resh is associated in the Book of Jezira,
Michlol 96b, cf. 63b).

(Note: אתי מרחיק is the name by which the national grammarians designate
a group of two words, of which the first, ending with Kametz or Segol,
has the accent on the penult., and of which the second is a
monosyllable, or likewise is accented on the penult. The initial
consonant of the second word in this case receives a Dagesh, in order
that it may not, in consequence of the first ictus of the group of words
"coming out of the distance," i.e., being far removed, be too feebly and
indistinctly uttered. This dageshing, however, only takes place when the
first word is already of itself Milel, or at least, as e.g., מצאה בּית,
had a half-accented penult., and not when it is from the very first
Milra and is only become Milel by means of the retreating of the accent,
as עשׂה פלא, [Psa 78:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#012), cf. [Deu
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#001). The penultima-accent has a
greater lengthening force in the former case than in the latter; the
following syllables are therefore uttered more rapidly in the first
case, and the Dagesh is intended to guard against the third syllable
being too hastily combined with the second. Concerning the rule, vid.,
Baer's Thorath Emeth, p. 29f.)

The מן or מטּוב and מדּבּר is not meant to affirm that he loves good,
etc., less than evil, etc., but that he does not love it at all (cf.
[Psa 118:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#008)., [Hab
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#016)). The music which comes in after
[Psa 52:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#005) has to continue the
accusations con amarezza without words. Then in [Psa
52:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#006) the singing again takes them up,
by addressing the adversary with the words "thou tongue of deceit" (cf.
[Psa 120:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#003)), and by reproaching him
with loving only such utterances as swallow up, i.e., destroy without
leaving a trace behind (בּלע, pausal form of בלע, like בּצע in [Psa
119:36](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#036), cf. the verb in [Psa
35:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#025), [Sa2
17:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#016); [Sa2
20:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#019).), his neighbour's life and
honour and goods. Hupfeld takes [Psa
52:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#006) as a second object; but the
figurative and weaker expression would then follow the unfigurative and
stronger one, and "to love a deceitful tongue" might be said with
reference to this character of tongue as belonging to another person,
not with reference to his own.

[Psalms 52:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 52:5</span></span>

The announcement of the divine retribution begins with גּם as in [Isa
66:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#004); [Eze
16:43](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#043); [Mal
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#009). The אהל is not, as one might
suppose, the holy tent or tabernacle, that he has desecrated by making
it the lurking-place of the betrayer ([Sa1
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#007)), which would have been expressed
by מאהלו, but his own dwelling. God will pull him, the lofty and
imperious one, down (נתץ, like a tower perhaps, [Jdg
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#009); [Eze
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#009)) from his position of honour and
his prosperity, and drag him forth out of his habitation, much as one
rakes a coal from the hearth (חתה Biblical and Talmudic in this sense),
and tear him out of this his home (נסח, cf. נתק, [Job
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#014)) and remove him far away ([Deu
28:63](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#063)), because he has betrayed the
homeless fugitive; and will root him out of the land of the living,
because he has destroyed the priests of God ([Sa1
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#018)). It then proceeds in [Psa
52:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#008) very much like [Psa
40:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#004), [Psa
40:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#005), just as the figure of the razor
also coincides with Psalms belonging to exactly the same period ([Psa
51:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#008); [Psa
57:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#005), cf. לטשׁ, [Psa
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#013)). The excitement and indignant
anger against one's foes which expresses itself in the rhythm and the
choice of words, has been already recognised by us since Ps 7 as a
characteristic of these Psalms. The hope which David, in [Psa
52:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#008), attaches to God's judicial
interposition is the same as e.g., in [Psa
64:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#010). The righteous will be
strengthened in the fear of God (for the play of sounds cf. [Psa
40:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#004)) and laugh at him whom God has
overthrown, saying: Behold there the man, etc. According to [Psa
58:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#011), the laughing is joy at the
ultimate breaking through of justice long hidden and not discerned; for
even the moral teaching of the Old Testament ([Pro
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#017)) reprobates the low malignant
joy that glories at the overthrow of one's enemy. By ויּבטח the former
trust in mammon on the part of the man who is overtaken by punishment is
set forth as a consequence of his refusal to put trust in God, in Him
who is the true מעוז = Arab. m‛âḏ, hiding-place or place of protection
(vid., on 31;3, [Psa 37:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#039), cf. [Psa
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#007); 22:33). הוּה is here the passion
for earthly things which rushes at and falls upon them (animo fertur).

[Psalms 52:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 52:8</span></span>

The gloomy song now brightens up, and in calmer tones draws rapidly to a
close. The betrayer becomes like an uprooted tree; the betrayed,
however, stands firm and is like to a green-foliaged olive ([Jer
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#016)) which is planted in the house
of Elohim ([Psa 90:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#014)), that is to
say, in sacred and inaccessible ground; cf. the promise in [Isa
60:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#013). The weighty expression כּי
עשׂית refers, as in Ps 22:32, to the gracious and just carrying out of
that which was aimed at in the election of David. If this be attained,
then he will for ever give thanks and further wait on the Name, i.e.,
the self-attestation, of God, which is so gracious and kind, he will
give thanks and "wait" in the presence of all the saints. This
"waiting," ואקוּה, is open to suspicion, since what he intends to do in
the presence of the saints must be something that is audible or visible
to them. Also "hoping in the name of God" is, it is true, not an
unbiblical notional combination ([Isa
36:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#008)); but in connection with שׁמך כי
טוב which follows, one more readily looks for a verb expressing a
thankful and laudatory proclamation (cf. Ps 54:8). Hitzig's conjecture
that we should read ואחוּה is therefore perfectly satisfactory. נגד
חסידיך does not belong to טוב, which would be construed with בּעיני htiw
deurtsnoc , and not נגד, but to the two votive words; cf. [Psa
22:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#026); [Psa
138:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#001), and other passages. The whole
church ([Psa 22:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#023)., [Psa
40:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#010).) shall be witness of his
thankfulness to God, and of his proclamation of the proofs which God
Himself has given of His love and favour.
