### [Exodus Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#001)

[Exodus 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 11:1</span></span>

Proclamation of the Tenth Plague; or the Decisive Blow. - [Exo
11:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#001). The announcement made by
Jehovah to Moses, which is recorded here, occurred before the last
interview between Moses and Pharaoh ([Exo
10:24-29](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#024)); but it is introduced by the
historian in this place, as serving to explain the confidence with which
Moses answered Pharaoh ([Exo 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#029)).
This is evident from [Exo 11:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#004),
where Moses is said to have foretold to the king, before leaving his
presence, the last plague and all its consequences. ויּאמר therefore, in
[Exo 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#001), is to be taken in a
pluperfect sense: "had said;" and may be grammatically accounted for
from the old Semitic style of historical writing referred to in the
commentary on [Gen 2:18-22](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#018), as [Gen
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#001) and [Gen
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#002) contain the foundation for the
announcement in [Gen 2:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#004). So far as
the facts are concerned, [Gen 2:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#001)
point back to [Exo 3:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#019). One stroke
more (נגע) would Jehovah bring upon Pharaoh and Egypt, and then the king
would let the Israelites go, or rather drive them out. כּלה כּשׁלּחו,
"when he lets you go altogether (כּלה adverbial as in [Gen
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#021)), he will even drive you away."

[Exodus 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">exo 11:2</span></span>

In this way Jehovah would overcome the resistance of Pharaoh; and even
more than that, for Moses was to tell the people to ask the Egyptians
for articles of silver and gold, for Jehovah would make them willing to
give. The renown acquired by Moses through his miracles in Egypt would
also contribute to this. (For the discussion of this subject, see [Exo
3:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#021).) The communication of these
instructions to the people is not expressly mentioned; but it is
referred to in [Exo 12:35-36](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#035), as
having taken place.

[Exodus 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">exo 11:4</span></span>

Moses' address to Pharaoh forms the continuation of his brief answer in
[Exo 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#029). At midnight Jehovah would
go out through the midst of Egypt. This midnight could not be "the one
following the day on which Moses was summoned to Pharaoh after the
darkness," as Baumgarten supposes; for it was not till after this
conversation with the king that Moses received the divine directions as
to the Passover, and they must have been communicated to the people at
least four days before the feast of the Passover and their departure
from Egypt ([Exo 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#003)). What midnight
is meant, cannot be determined. So much is certain, however, that the
last decisive blow did not take place in the night following the
cessation of the ninth plague; but the institution of the Passover, the
directions of Moses to the people respecting the things which they were
to ask for from the Egyptians, and the preparations for the feast of the
Passover and the exodus, all came between. The "going out" of Jehovah
from His heavenly seat denotes His direct interposition in, and judicial
action upon, the world of men. The last blow upon Pharaoh was to be
carried out by Jehovah Himself, whereas the other plagues had been
brought by Moses and Aaron. מצרים בּתוך "in (through) the midst of
Egypt:" the judgment of God would pass from the centre of the kingdom,
the king's throne, over the whole land. "Every first-born shall die,
from the first-born of Pharaoh, that sitteth upon his throne, even unto
the first-born of the maid that is behind the mill," i.e., the meanest
slave (cf. [Exo 12:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#029), where the
captive in the dungeon is substituted for the maid, prisoners being
often employed in this hard labour, [Jdg
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#021); [Isa
47:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#002)), "and all the first-born of
cattle." This stroke was to fall upon both man and beast as a punishment
for Pharaoh's conduct in detaining the Israelites and their cattle; but
only upon the first-born, for God did not wish to destroy the Egyptians
and their cattle altogether, but simply to show them that He had the
power to do this. The first-born represented the whole race, of which it
was the strength and bloom ([Gen
49:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#003)). But against the whole of the
people of Israel "not a dog shall point its tongue" ([Exo
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#007)). The dog points its tongue to
growl and bite. The thought expressed in this proverb, which occurs
again in [Jos 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#021) and Judith 11:19,
was that Israel would not suffer the slightest injury, either in the
case of "man or beast." By this complete preservation, whilst Egypt was
given up to death, Israel would discover that Jehovah had completed the
separation between them and the Egyptians. The effect of this stroke
upon the Egyptians would be "a great cry," having no parallel before or
after (cf. [Exo 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#014)); and the
consequence of this cry would be, that the servants of Pharaoh would
come to Moses and entreat them to go out with all the people. "At thy
feet," i.e., in thy train (vid., [Deu
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#006); [Jdg
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#005)). With this announcement Moses
departed from Pharaoh in great wrath. Moses' wrath was occasioned by the
king's threat ([Exo 10:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#028)), and
pointed to the wrath of Jehovah, which Pharaoh would soon experience. As
the more than human patience which Moses had displayed towards Pharaoh
manifested to him the long-suffering and patience of his God, in whose
name and by whose authority he acted, so the wrath of the departing
servant of God was to show to the hardened king, that the time of grace
was at an end, and the wrath of God was about to burst upon him.

[Exodus 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">exo 11:9</span></span>

In [Exo 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#009) and [Exo
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#010) the account of Moses'
negotiations with Pharaoh, which commenced at [Exo
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#008), is brought to a close. What God
predicted to His messengers immediately before sending them to Pharaoh
([Exo 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#003)), and to Moses before his
call ([Exo 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#021)), had now come to
pass. And this was the pledge that the still further announcement of
Jehovah in [Exo 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#004) and [Exo
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#023), which had already been made
known to the hardened king ([Exo
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#004).), would be carried out. As these
verses have a terminal character, the vav consecutive in ויּאמר denotes
the order of thought and not of time, and the two verses are to be
rendered thus: "As Jehovah had said to Moses, Pharaoh will not hearken
unto you, that My wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt, Moses
and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh; and Jehovah hardened
Pharaoh's heart, so that he did not let the children of Israel go out of
his land."
