<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">pro 19:1</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The plur. &#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#024">Pro 18:24</A>, is emphatic and equivalent to &#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;. The group <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#001">Pro 19:1-4</A> closes with a proverb which contains this catchword. The first proverb of the group comes by &#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493; into contact with <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#020">Pro 18:20</A>, the first proverb of the preceding group.
<p>1 Better a poor man walking in his innocence,
<p>   Than one with perverse lips, and so a fool.
<p>The contrast, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#006">Pro 28:6</A>, is much clearer. But to correct this proverb in conformity with that, as Hitzig does, is unwarrantable. The Syr., indeed, translates here as there; but the Chald. assimilates this translation to the Heb. text, which Theodotion, and after him the Syro-Hexapl., renders by &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;. But does 1a form a contrast to 1b? Fleischer remarks: "From the contrast it appears that he who is designated in 1b must be thought of as &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1512;" [rich]; and Ewald, "Thus early the ideas of a rich man and of a fool, or a despiser of God, are connected together." Saadia understands &#1499;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500; [a fool], after <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#024">Job 31:24</A>, of one who makes riches his &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1500; [confidence]. Euchel accordingly translates: the false man, although he builds himself greatly up, viz., on his riches. But &#1499;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500; designates the intellectually slothful, in whom the flesh overweighs the mind. And the representation of the rich, which, for 1b certainly arises out of 1a, does not amalgamate with &#1499;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500; htiw , but with &#1506;&#1511;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; &#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493;. Arama is on the right track, for he translates: the rich who distorts his mouth, for he gives to the poor suppliant a rude refusal. Better Zckler: a proud man of perverse lips and haughty demeanour. If one with haughty, scornful lips is opposed to the poor, then it is manifestly one not poor who thinks to raise himself above the poor, and haughtily looks down on him. And if it is said that, in spite of this proud demeanour, he is a fool, then this presents the figure of one proud of his wealth, who, in spite of his emptiness and nequitia, imagines that he possesses a greatness of knowledge, culture, and worth corresponding to the greatness of his riches. How much better is a poor man than such an one who walketh (vid., on &#1514;&#1468;&#1501;, vol. i, p. 79) in his innocence and simplicity, with his pure mind wholly devoted to God and to that which is good! - his poverty keeps him in humility which is capable of no malicious conduct; and this pious blameless life is of more worth than the pride of wisdom of the distinguished fool. There is in contrast to &#1506;&#1511;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; a simplicity, &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;, of high moral worth; but, on the other side, there is also a simplicity which is worthless. This is the connecting thought which introduces the next verse. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#002">Proverbs 19:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">pro 19:2</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>2 The not-knowing of the soul is also not good,
<p>   And he who hasteneth with the legs after it goeth astray.
<p>Fleischer renders &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; as the subj. and &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1496;&#1493;&#1489; as neut. pred.: in and of itself sensual desire is not good, but yet more so if it is without foresight and reflection. With this explanation the words must be otherwise accentuated. Hitzig, in conformity with the accentuation, before us: if desire is without reflection, it is also without success. But where &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; denotes desire or sensuality, it is always shown by the connection, as e.g., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#002">Pro 23:2</A>; here &#1491;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514;, referring to the soul as knowing (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#014">Psa 139:14</A>), excludes this meaning. But &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; is certainly gen. subjecti; Luzzatto's "self-knowledge" is untenable, for this would require &#1491;&#1506;&#1514; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;; Meri rightly glosses &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; &#1491;&#1506;&#1514; by &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1500;. After this Zckler puts Hitzig's translation right in the following manner: where there is no consideration of the soul, there is no prosperity. But that also is incorrect, for it would require &#1488;&#1497;&#1503;&#1470;&#1496;&#1493;&#1489;; &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1496;&#1493;&#1489; is always pred., not a substantival clause. Thus the proverb states that &#1489;&#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; is not good, and that is equivalent to &#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514; &#1489;&#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; (for the subject to &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1496;&#1493;&#1489; is frequently, as e.g., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#026">Pro 17:26</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#005">Pro 18:5</A>, an infinitive); or also: &#1489;&#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; is a virtual noun in the sense of the not-knowing of the soul; for to say &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514; was syntactically inadmissible, but the expression is &#1489;&#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;, not &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; &#1491;&#1506;&#1514; (&#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;), because this is used in the sense unintentionally or unexpectedly. The &#1490;&#1468;&#1501; which begins the proverb is difficult. If we lay the principal accent in the translation given above on "not good," then the placing of &#1490;&#1501; first is a hyperbaton similar to that in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#026">Pro 17:26</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#011">Pro 20:11</A>; cf. &#1488;&#1498;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#011">Pro 17:11</A>; &#1512;&#1511;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#010">Pro 13:10</A>, as if the words were: if the soul is without knowledge, then also (eo ipso) it is destitute of anything good. But if we lay the principal accent on the "also," then the meaning of the poet is, that ignorance of the soul is, like many other things, not good; or (which we prefer without on that account maintaining
<p>(Note: The old interpreters and also the best Jewish interpreters mar the understanding and interpretation of the text, on the one side, by distinguishing between a nearest and a deeper meaning of Scripture (&#1491;&#1512;&#1498; &#1504;&#1490;&#1500;&#1492; and &#1491;&#1512;&#1498; &#1504;&#1505;&#1514;&#1512;); on the other by this, that they suppose an inward connection of all the proverbs, and expend useless ingenuity in searching after the connection. The former is the method especially adopted by Immanuel and Meri, the latter has most of all been used by Arama.)
<p>the original connection of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#001">Pro 19:1</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#002">Pro 19:2</A>), that as on the one side the pride of wisdom, so on the other ignorance is not good. In this case &#1490;&#1501; belongs more to the subject than to the predicate, but in reality to the whole sentence at the beginning of which it stands. To hasten with the legs (&#1488;&#1509;, as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#020">Pro 28:20</A>) means now in this connection to set the body in violent agitation, without direction and guidance proceeding from the knowledge possessed by the soul. He who thus hastens after it without being intellectually or morally clear as to the goal and the way, makes a false step, goes astray, fails (vid., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#036">Pro 8:36</A>, where &#1495;&#1496;&#1488;&#1497; is the contrast to &#1502;&#1510;&#1488;&#1497;). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#003">Proverbs 19:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">pro 19:3</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>3 The foolishness of a man overturneth his way,
<p>   And his heart is angry against Jahve.
<p>Regarding &#1505;&#1500;&#1507;, vid., at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#003">Pro 11:3</A>; also the Arab. signification "to go before" proceeds from the root conception pervertere, for first a letting precede, or preceding (e.g., of the paying before the delivery of that which is paid for: salaf, a pre-numbering, and then also: advanced money), consisting in the reversal of the natural order, is meant. The way is here the way of life, the walking: the folly of a man overturns, i.e., destroys, his life's-course; but although he is himself the fabricator of his own ruin, yet the ill-humour (&#1494;&#1506;&#1507;, aestuare, vid., at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#006">Psa 11:6</A>) of his heart turns itself against God, and he blames (lxx essentially correct: &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;) God instead of himself, viz., his own madness, whereby he has turned the grace of God into lasciviousness, cast to the winds the instruction which lay in His providences, and frustrated the will of God desiring his good. A beautiful paraphrase of this parable is found at Sir. 15:11-20; cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#039">Lam 3:39</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#004">Proverbs 19:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">pro 19:4</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>4 Wealth bringeth many friends;
<p>   But the reduced - his friend separateth himself.
<p>The very same contrast, though otherwise expressed, we had at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#020">Pro 14:20</A>. Regarding &#1492;&#1493;&#1503;, vid., vol. i, p. 63. &#1491;&#1500; is the tottering, or he who has fallen into a tottering condition, who has no resources, possesses no means. The accentuation gives Mugrash to the word (according to which the Targ. translates), for it is not the subject of &#1497;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491;: the reduced is separated (pass. Niph.) by his misfortunes, or must separate himself (reflex. Niph.) from his friend (&#1502;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#004">Ecc 4:4</A>, prae socio suo); but subject of the virtual pred. &#1502;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; &#1497;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491;: the reduced - his friend (&#1502;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;&#1493;, as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#007">Pro 19:7</A>) separates himself, i.e., (according to the nature of the Semitic substantival clause) he is such (of such a fate) that his friend sets himself free, whereby &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; may be omitted as self-obvious; &#1504;&#1508;&#1512;&#1491; means one who separates himself, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#001">Pro 18:1</A>. If we make &#1491;&#1500; the subject of the separatur, then the initiative of the separation from the friend is not expressed. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#005">Proverbs 19:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">pro 19:5</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#005">Pro 19:5</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#009">Pro 19:9</A> we have the introductory proverb of two groups, the former of which, in its close as well as its beginning, cannot be mistaken.
<p>5 A lying witness remaineth not unpunished;
<p>   And he who breathes out lies escapeth not.
<p>Regarding &#1497;&#1508;&#1497;&#1495;, vid., vol. i, p. 148: as here we read it of false witness at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#019">Pro 6:19</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#005">Pro 14:5</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#025">Pro 14:25</A>. &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1504;&#1468;&#1511;&#1492; occurs four times before, the last of which is at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#005">Pro 17:5</A>. The lxx elsewhere translates &#1497;&#1508;&#1497;&#1495; &#1499;&#1494;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; by &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#834;, to kindle lies; but here by &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;, and at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#009">Pro 19:9</A> by &#x3bf;&#788;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b4; &#787; &#x3b1;&#787;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#837; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;, both times changing only because &#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c2; goes before, and instead of &#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#834;, the choice of a different rendering commended itself. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#006">Proverbs 19:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">pro 19:6</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>6 Many stroke the cheeks of the noble;
<p>   And the mass of friends belongeth to him who gives.
<p>The phrase '&#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1508;&#1500; signifies to stroke the face of any one, from the fundamental meaning of the verb &#1495;&#1500;&#1492;, to rub, to stroke, Arab. khala, with which the Heb., meaning to be sick, weak (viribus attritum esse), and the Arabic: to be sweet (properly laevem et politum, glabrum esse, or palatum demulcere, leniter stringere, contrast asperum esse ad gustum), are connected (Fl.). The object of such insinuating, humble suing for favour is the &#1504;&#1491;&#1497;&#1489; (from &#1504;&#1491;&#1489;, instigare), the noble, he who is easily incited to noble actions, particularly to noble-mindedness in bestowing gifts and in doing good, or who feels himself naturally impelled thereto, and spontaneously practises those things; cf. the Arab. krym, nobilis and liberalis (Fl.), and at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#028">Job 21:28</A>; parall. &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503;, a man who gives willingly, as &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1495;&#1502;&#1492;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#018">Pro 15:18</A>, one who is easily kindled into anger. Many (&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#019">Job 11:19</A>) stroke the face of the liberal (Lat. caput mulcent or demulcent); and to him who gives willingly and richly belongs &#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1512;&#1506;, the mass (the totality) of good friends, cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#017">Pro 15:17</A>; there the art. of &#1492;&#1512;&#1506;, according to the manner of expression of the Arab. grammarians, stood for "the exhaustion of the characteristic properties of the genus": the friend who corresponds to the nature (the idea) of such an one; here it stands for "the comprehension of the individuals of the genus;" all that is only always friend. It lies near with Ewald and Hitzig to read &#1493;&#1499;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; &#1512;&#1506; (and every one is friend...) (&#1499;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; = &#1499;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;, as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#010">Jer 8:10</A>, etc.); but why could not &#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1512;&#1506; be used as well as &#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1491;&#1501;, perhaps with the sarcastic appearance which the above translation seeks to express? The lxx also had &#1493;&#1499;&#1500; &#1492;&#1512;&#1506; in view, which it incorrectly translates &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, whereby the Syr. and the Targ. are led into error; but &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; is not one and the same with &#1513;&#1474;&#1495;&#1491;, vid., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#006">Pro 18:6</A>. On the contrary, there certainly lies before us in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#007">Pro 19:7</A> a mutilated text. The tristich is, as we have shown, vol. i, p. 15, open to suspicion; and the violence which its interpretation needs in order to comprehend it, as a formal part of 7ab, places it beyond a doubt, and the lxx confirms it that 7c is the remainder of a distich, the half of which is lost. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#007">Proverbs 19:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">pro 19:7</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>7ab. We thus first confine our attention to these two lines - 
<p>All the brethren of the poor hate him;
<p>How much more do his friends withdraw themselves from him?
<p>Regarding &#1488;&#1507; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, quanto magis, vid., at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#031">Pro 11:31</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#011">Pro 15:11</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#007">Pro 17:7</A>. In a similar connection <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#020">Pro 14:20</A> spake of hatred, i.e., the cooling of love, and the manifesting of this coldness. The brethren who thus show themselves here, unlike the friend who has become a brother, according to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#017">Pro 17:17</A>, are brothers-german, including kindred by blood relation. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500; has Mercha, and is thus without the Makkeph, as at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#010">Psa 35:10</A> (vid., the Masora in Baer's Liber Psalmorum, 1861, p. 133). Kimchi (Michlol 205a), Norzi, and others think that ca&#772;l (with &#1511;&#1502;&#1509; &#1512;&#1495;&#1489;) is to be read as at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#012">Isa 40:12</A>, where &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493; is a verb. But that is incorrect. The case is the same as with &#1488;&#1514;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#012">Pro 3:12</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#005">Psa 47:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#002">Psa 60:2</A>. As here e&#780; with Mercha remains, so o&#780; with Mercha in that twice occurring &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;; that which is exceptional is this, that the accentuated &#1499;&#1500; is written thus twice, not as the usual &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;, but as &#1499;&#1468;&#1500; with the Makkeph. The ground of the exception lies, as with other peculiarities, in the special character of metrical accentuation; the Mercha represents the place of the Makkeph, and a&#772; thus remains in the unchanged force of a Kametz-Chatuph. The plur. &#1512;&#1495;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468; does not stamp &#1502;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; as the defectively written plur.; the suffix e&#772;hu is always sing., and the sing. is thus, like &#1492;&#1512;&#1506;, 6b, meant collectively, or better: generally (in the sense of kind), which is the linguistic usage of these two words, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#026">Sa1 30:26</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#010">Job 42:10</A>. But it is worthy of notice that the Masoretic form here is not &#1502;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, but m&#1502;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, with Sheva. The Masora adds to it the remark &#1500;&#1497;&#1514;, and accordingly the word is thus written with Sheva by Kimchi (Michlol 202a and Lex. under the word &#1512;&#1506;&#1492;), in Codd., and older editions. The Venet., translating by &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;, has not noticed that. But how? Does the punctuation &#1502;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;&#1493; mean that the word is here to be derived from &#1502;&#1512;&#1506;, maleficus? Thus understood, it does not harmonize with the line of thought. From this it is much more seen that the punctuation of the inflected &#1502;&#1512;&#1506;, amicus, fluctuates. This word &#1502;&#1512;&#1506; is a formation so difficult of comprehension, that one might almost, with Olshausen, 210; Bttcher, 794; and Lagarde, regard the &#1502; as the partitive &#1502;&#1503;, like the French des amis (cf. Eurip. Med. 560: &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;), or: something of friend, a piece of friend, while Ewald and others regard it as possible that &#1502;&#1512;&#1506; is abbreviated from &#1502;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;. The punctuation, since it treats the Tsere in &#1502;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;&#1493;, 4b
<p>(Note: In vol. i. p. 266, we have acknowledged &#1502;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;&#1493;, from &#1502;&#1512;&#1506;, friend, only for <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#007">Pro 19:7</A>, but at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#004">Pro 19:4</A> we have also found amicus ejus more probable than ab amico suo (= &#1502;&#1503; &#1512;&#1506;&#1492;&#1493;).) and elsewhere, as unchangeable, and here in &#1502;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;&#1493; as changeable, affords proof that in it also the manner of the formation of the word was incomprehensible.
<p>Seeking after words which are vain.
<p>7c. If now this line belongs to this proverb, then &#1502;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1507; must be used of the poor, and &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, or &#1500;&#1493;&#1470;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; (vid., regarding the 15 Kers, &#1500;&#1468;&#1493; for &#1500;&#1488;, at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa100.htm#003">Psa 100:3</A>), must be the attributively nearer designation of the &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;. The meaning of the Ker&#305;&#770; would be: he (the poor man) hunts after mere words, which - but no actions corresponding to them - are for a portion to him. This is doubtful, for the principal matter, that which is not a portion to him, remains unexpressed, and the &#1500;&#1493;&#1470;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; eht  [to him they belong] affords only the service of guarding one against understanding by the &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; the proper words of the poor. This service is not in the same way afforded by &#1500;&#1488; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; they are not; but this expression characterizes the words as vain, so that it is to be interpreted according to such parallels as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#002">Hos 12:2</A> : words which are not, i.e., which have nothing in reality corresponding to them, verba nihili, i.e., the empty assurances and promises of his brethren and friends (Fl.). The old translators all
<p>(Note: Lagarde erroneously calls Theodotion's &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; a translation of the Ker&#305;&#770;; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3ba; is, however, &#1500;&#1488;, and instead of &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; the expression &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;, which is the translation of &#1492;&#1502;&#1492;, is also found.)
<p>read &#1500;&#1488;, and the Syr. and Targ. translate not badly: &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497; &#1500;&#1488; &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1512;; Symmachus, &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;. The expression is not to be rejected: &#1500;&#1488; &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; sometimes means to come to &#1500;&#1488;, i.e., to nothing, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#021">Job 6:21</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#032">Eze 21:32</A>, cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#006">Isa 15:6</A>; and &#1500;&#1488; &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, he is not = has no reality, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#012">Jer 5:12</A>, &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1492;&#1502;&#1492;, may thus mean words which are nothing (vain). But how can it be said of the poor whom everything forsakes, that one dismisses him with words behind which there is nothing, and now also that he pursues such words? The former supposes always a sympathy, though it be a feigned one, which is excluded by &#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1488;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; [they hate him] and &#1512;&#1495;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468; [withdraw themselves]; and the latter, spoken of the poor, would be unnatural, for his purposed endeavour goes not out after empty talk, but after real assistance. So 7c: pursuing after words which (are) nothing, although in itself not falling under critical suspicion, yet only of necessity is connected with this proverb regarding the poor. The lxx, however, has not merely one, but even four lines, and thus two proverbs following 7b. The former of these distichs is: &#x395;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;; it is translated from the Hebr. (&#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#002">Pro 5:2</A> = &#1502;&#1494;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;), but it has a meaning complete in itself, and thus has nothing to do with the fragment 7c. The second distich is: &#x39f;&#788; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;, &#x3bf;&#788;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787; &#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;. This &#x3bf;&#788;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; is, without doubt, a translation of &#1502;&#1512;&#1491;&#1507; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; (7c); &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; is probably a corruption of &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; (thus the Complut.), not, he who pursueth words, but he who incites by words, as Homer (Il. iv. 5f.) uses the expression &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;. The concluding words, &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787; &#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, are a repetition of the Heb. &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1502;&#1500;&#1496; (cf. lxx 19:5 with 28:26), perhaps only a conjectural emendation of the unintelligible &#1500;&#1488; &#1492;&#1502;&#1492;. Thus we have before us in that &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;, &#x3ba;.&#x3c4;.&#x3bb;., the line lost from the Heb. text; but it is difficult to restore it to the Heb. We have attempted it, vol. i, p. 15. Supposing that the lxx had before them &#1500;&#1488; &#1492;&#1502;&#1492;, then the proverb is - 
<p>"He that hath many friends is rewarded with evil,
<p>Hunting after words which are nothing;"
<p>i.e., since this his courting the friendship of as many as possible is a hunting after words which have nothing after them and come to nothing.

<p>10 Luxury becometh not a fool;
<p>     How much less a servant to rule over princes.
<p>Thus also with &#1500;&#1488; &#1504;&#1488;&#1493;&#1492; (3 p. Pil. non decet, cf. the adj. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#001">Pro 26:1</A>) <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#007">Pro 17:7</A> begins. &#1488;&#1507; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; rises here, as at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#007">Pro 19:7</A>, a minori ad majus: how much more is it unbecoming = how much less is it seemly. The contrast in the last case is, however, more rugged, and the expression harsher. "A fool cannot bear luxury: he becomes by it yet more foolish; one who was previously a humble slave, but who has attained by good fortune a place of prominence and power, from being something good, becomes at once something bad: an insolent sceleratus" (Fl.). Agur, xxx. 22f., describes such a homo novus as an unbearable calamity; and the author of the Book of Ecclesiastes, written in the time of the Persian domination, speaks, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#007">Ecc 10:7</A>, of such.

<p>11 The discretion of a man maketh him long-suffering,

The Venet. also translates: &#x39d;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;; the correct word would be &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;: the discretion (intellectus or intelligentia; vid., regarding &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1500;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#004">Pro 3:4</A>) of a man extends his anger, i.e., brings it about that it continues long before it breaks out (vid., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#029">Pro 14:29</A>).

Opposed to the &#1494;&#1506;&#1507; stands the beneficial effect of the &#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1503;, i.e., of the pleasure, the delight, the satisfaction, the disposition which shows kindness (lxx &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;). In the former case all are afraid; in the latter, everything lives, as when the refreshing dew falls upon the herbs of the field. The proverb presents a fact, but that the king may mirror himself in it.

<p>13 A foolish son is destruction for his father,
<p>     And a continual dropping are the contentions of a wife.
<p>Regarding &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, vid., at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#004">Pro 17:4</A>, cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#003">Pro 10:3</A>. Line 2a is expanded, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#015">Pro 27:15</A>, into a distich. The dropping is &#1496;&#1512;&#1491;, properly striking (cf. Arab. tirad, from tarad III, hostile assault) when it pours itself forth, stroke (drop) after stroke = constantly, or with unbroken continuity. Lightning-flashes are called (Jer Berachoth, p. 114, Shitomir's ed.) &#1496;&#1493;&#1512;&#1491;&#1497;&#1503;, opp. &#1502;&#1508;&#1505;&#1497;&#1511;&#1497;&#1503;, when they do not follow in intervals, but constantly flash; and b. Bechoroth 44a; &#1491;&#1493;&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514;, weeping eyes, &#1491;&#1493;&#1500;&#1508;&#1493;&#1514;, dropping eyes, and &#1496;&#1493;&#1512;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514;, eyes always flowing, are distinguished. An old interpreter (vid., R. Ascher in Pesachim II No. 21) explains &#1491;&#1500;&#1507; &#1496;&#1512;&#1491; by: "which drops, and drops, and always drops." An Arab proverb which I once heard from Wetzstein, says that there are three things which make our house intolerable: a&#770;lt&#803;ak&#803;k&#803; (= a&#770;ldhalf), the trickling through of rain; a&#770;lnak&#803;k&#803;, the contention of the wife; and a&#770;lbak&#803;k&#803;, bugs.

<p>14 House and riches are a paternal inheritance,
<p>     But from Jahve cometh a prudent wife.
<p>House and riches (opulentia), which in themselves do not make men happy, one may receive according to the law of inheritance; but a prudent wife is God's gracious gift, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#022">Pro 18:22</A>. There is not a more suitable word than &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514; (fem. of &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;) to characterize a wife as a divine gift, making her husband happy. &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1500; (&#1492;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;) is the property which says: "I am named modesty, which wears the crown of all virtues."

<p>15 Slothfulness sinketh into deep sleep,
<p>     And an idle soul must hunger.
<p>Regarding &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492; and its root-word &#1512;&#1491;&#1501;, vid., at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#005">Pro 10:5</A>. &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;, to befall, to make to get, is to be understood after <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#021">Gen 3:21</A>; the obj. &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1491;&#1501;, viz., &#1492;&#1506;&#1510;&#1500;, is naturally to be supplied. In 15b the fut. denotes that which will certainly happen, the inevitable. In both of its members the proverb is perfectly clear; Hitzig, however, corrects 15a, and brings out of it the meaning, "slothfulness gives tasteless herbs to eat." The lxx has two translations of this proverb, here and at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#008">Pro 18:8</A>. That it should translate &#1512;&#1502;&#1497;&#1492; by &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; was necessary, as Lagarde remarks, for the exposition of the "works of a Hebrew Sotades." But the Hebrew literature never sunk to such works, wallowing in the mire of sensuality, and &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; is not at all thus enigmatical; the Greek word was also used of an effeminate man, a man devoid of manliness, a weakling, and was, as the lxx shows, more current in the Alexandrine Greek than elsewhere.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">pro 19:16</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>16 He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his soul;
<p>     He that taketh no heed to his ways dies.
<p>As at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#023">Pro 6:23</A>, cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#005">Ecc 8:5</A>, &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1492; is here the commandment of God, and thus obligatory, which directs man in every case to do that which is right, and warns him against that which is wrong. And &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1494;&#1492; &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497;&#1493; (according to the Masora with Tsere, as in Codd. and old editions, not &#1489;&#1493;&#1494;&#1492;) is the antithesis of &#1504;&#1510;&#1512; &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#017">Pro 16:17</A>. To despise one's own way is equivalent to, to regard it as worth no consideration, as no question of conscience whether one should enter upon this way or that. Hitzig's reading, &#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1494;&#1512;, "he that scattereth his ways," lets himself be drawn by the manifold objects of sensuality sometimes in one direction and sometimes in another, is supported by <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#013">Jer 3:13</A>, according to which it must be &#1502;&#1508;&#1494;&#1468;&#1512;; the conj. is not in the style of the Book of Proverbs, and besides is superfluous. The lxx, which is fond of a quid pro quo - it makes, 13b, a courtesan offering a sacrifice she had vowed of the wages of sin of the quarrelsome woman - has here, as the Heb. text: &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;. Thus after the Ker&#305;&#770; &#1497;&#1502;&#1514;, as also the Targ., Syro-Hexap., and Luther; on the contrary, the Syr., Jerome, the Venet. adopt the Cheth&#305;&#770;b &#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514;: he will become dead, i.e., dies no natural death. The Ker&#305;&#770; is more in the spirit and style of the Book of Proverbs (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#010">Pro 15:10</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#013">Pro 23:13</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#021">Pro 10:21</A>).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">pro 19:17</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>These verses we take together. But we have no other reason for making a pause at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#021">Pro 19:21</A>, than that <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#022">Pro 19:22</A> is analogous to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#017">Pro 19:17</A>, and thus presents itself to us as an initial verse.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#017">Pro 19:17</A>
<p>17 He lendeth to Jahve who is compassionate to the lowly,
<p>     And his bounty He requites to him.
<p>As at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#031">Pro 14:31</A>, &#1495;&#1493;&#1504;&#1503; is part. Kal. The Masoretically exact form of the word is &#1495;&#1493;&#1504;&#1503; (as &#1493;&#1488;&#1493;&#1494;&#1500;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#014">Pro 20:14</A>) with Mercha on the first syllable, on which the tone is thrown back, and the &#1492;&#1506;&#1502;&#1491;&#1492; on the second. The Roman legal phrase, mutui datione contrahitur obligatio, serves to explain the fundamental conception of &#1500;&#1493;&#1492;, mutuo accipere, and &#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1492;, mutuum dare (vid., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#007">Pro 22:7</A>). The construction, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#024">Exo 22:24</A>, "to make any one bound as a debtor, obligare," lies at the foundation of the genitive connection '&#1502;&#1500;&#1493;&#1492; &#1492; (not &#1502;&#1500;&#1493;&#1492;). With 17b cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#014">Pro 12:14</A>, where the subject of &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; (Ker&#305;&#770;) remains in the background. &#1490;&#1502;&#1500;&#1493; (not &#1490;&#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;) is here his work done in the sense of good exhibited. "Love," Hedinger once said, "is an imperishable capital, which always bears interest." And the Archbishop Walther: nam Deo dat qui dat inopibus, ipse Deus est in pauperibus. Dr. Jonas, as Dchsel relates, once gave to a poor man, and said, "Who knows when God restores it!" There Luther interposed: "As if God had not long ago given it beforehand!" This answer of Luther meets the abuse of this beautiful proverb by the covetous.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#018">Pro 19:18</A>
<p>This proverb brings to view once more the pedagogic character of this Older Book of Proverbs:
<p>Correct thy son, for yet there is hope;
<p>But go not too far to kill him.
<p>That &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; tahT is meant relatively, as at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#015">Pro 11:15</A>, is seen from <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#018">Job 11:18</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#007">Job 14:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#016">Jer 31:16</A>.; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1470;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1492; is the usual expression for etemin spes est. Though a son show obstinacy, and manifest a bad disposition, yet there is hope in the training of the youth of being able to break his self-will, and to wean him from his bad disposition; therefore his education should be carried forward with rigorous exactness, but in such a way that wisdom and love regulate the measure and limits of correction: ad eum interficiendum animam ne tollas (animum ne inducas). &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498; is not the subject, for in that case the word would have been &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1488;&#1498; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#010">Kg2 14:10</A>). It is the object: To raise the soul to something is equivalent to, to direct his desire to it, to take delight in it. The teacher should not seek correction as the object, but only as the means; he who has a desire after it, to put the child to death in the case of his guilt, changes correction into revenge, permits himself to be driven by passion from the proper end of correction, and to be pushed beyond its limits. The lxx translates freely &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, for &#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; is unrestrained abuse, &#1502;&#1493;&#1505;&#1512; &#1488;&#1499;&#1494;&#1512;&#1497; as Immanuel glosses. Besides, all the ancients and also the Venet. translate &#1492;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493; as the inf. of &#1492;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514;. But Oetinger (for he translates: lift not thy soul to his cry, for which Euchel: let not his complaining move thy compassion) follows the derivation from &#1492;&#1502;&#1492; suggested by Kimchi, Meri, and Immanuel, and preferred by Ralbag, so that &#1492;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493; after the from &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1497;&#1514; is equivalent to &#1492;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493;. But leaving out of view that &#1492;&#1502;&#1492; means strepere, not lamentari, and that &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; means attention, not desire, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#013">Pro 23:13</A> points out to us a better interpretation.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#019">Pro 19:19</A>
<p>Another proverb with &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;:
<p>A man of excessive wrath must suffer punishment;
<p>For if thou layest hold of it, hindering it, thou makest it only worse.
<p>The lxx, Syr., and Targ. translate as if the words were &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; &#1495;&#1502;&#1492; (as &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; &#1495;&#1502;&#1492;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#022">Pro 29:22</A>). Theodotion, the Venet., and Luther render the Ker&#305;&#770; &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1500;&#1470;; Jerome's impatiens is colourless. The Cheth&#305;&#770;b &#1490;&#1512;&#1500; gives no appropriate meaning. The Arab. jaril means lapidosus (whence &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1500;, cf. Aram. &#1508;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1488; = &#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;), and Schultens translates accordingly aspere scruposus iracundiae, which is altogether after the manner of his own heavy style. Ewald translates &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1500; as derived from the Arab jazyl, largus, grandis; but the possibility of the passing over of &#1512; into &#1494;, as maintained by Ewald and also by Hitzig, or the reverse, is physiologically undemonstrable, and is confirmed by no example worthy of mention. Rather it may be possible that the Heb. had an adj. &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1500; or &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1500; in the sense of stony, gravel-like, hard as gravel, but tow rather than gravel would be appropriate to &#1495;&#1502;&#1492;. Hitzig corrects &#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500; &#1495;&#1502;&#1492;, "who acts in anger;" but he says &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501; &#1495;&#1502;&#1492;, to recompense anger, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#018">Isa 59:18</A>; &#1490;&#1502;&#1500; &#1495;&#1502;&#1492; is without support. This correction, however, is incomparably more feasible than Bttcher's, "moderate inheritance bears expiation;" &#1495;&#1502;&#1492; = &#1495;&#1502;&#1488;&#1492; must mean not only thick [curdled] milk, but also moderation, and Bttcher finds this "sound." From all these instances one sees that &#1490;&#1512;&#1500; is an error in transcription; the Ker&#305;&#770; &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1500;&#1470;&#1495;&#1502;&#1492; rightly improves it, a man is thus designated whose peculiarity it is to fall into a high degree of passionate anger (&#1495;&#1502;&#1492; &#1490;&#1491;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#044">Dan 11:44</A>): such an one has to bear &#1506;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;, a fine, i.e., to compensate, for he has to pay compensation or smart-money for the injury suffered, as e.g., he who in strife with another pushes against a woman with child, so that injury befalls her, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#022">Exo 21:22</A>. If we compare this passage with <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#006">Sa2 14:6</A>, there appears for &#1514;&#1468;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500; the meaning of taking away of the object (whether a person or a thing) against which the passionate hothead directs himself. Therewith the meaning of &#1493;&#1506;&#1493;&#1491; &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1505;&#1507; accords. The meaning is not that, &#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;, once is not enough, but much rather must be repeated, and yet is without effect; but that one only increases and heightens the &#1495;&#1502;&#1492; thereby. It is in vain to seek to spare such a violent person the punishment into which he obstinately runs; much more advisable is it to let him rage till he ceases; violent opposition only makes the evil the greater. With &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1501;, "denn wenn" [for then], cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#003">Pro 2:3</A>, "ja wenn" [yea if], and with &#1493;&#1506;&#1493;&#1491; in the conclusion, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#007">Job 14:7</A> (a parallelism syntactically more appropriate than <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#018">Psa 139:18</A>).
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#020">Pro 19:20</A>
<p>20 Hearken to counsel, and receive instruction,
<p>     That thou mayest become wise afterwards.
<p>The rule of morals, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#015">Pro 12:15</A>, receives here the paraenetic tone which is the keynote of the introduction chap. 1-9. Lwenstein translates: that thou mayest finally become wise. But &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;&#1498; corresponds rather to our "hinfort" [posthac] than to "endlich" [finally]. He to whom the warning is directed must break with the self-willed, undisciplined &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514; beginning of his life, and for the future (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#002">Pe1 4:2</A>) become wise.

<p>     But Jahve's counsel, that stands.
<p>In &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; lies, as at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#008">Isa 40:8</A>, both: that the counsel of God (His plan of the world and of salvation) is accomplished and comes into actual fact, and that it continues. This counsel is the true reality elevated above the checkered manifoldness of human purposes, aims, and subjectivities, which penetrates and works itself out in history. The thoughts of a man thus gain unity, substance, endurance, only in so far as he subjects himself to this counsel, and makes his thoughts and actions conformable and subordinate to this counsel.

<p>A man's delight is his beneficence;
<p>And better is a poor man than a liar.
<p>The right interpretation will be that which presses upon &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; no strange meaning, and which places the two parts of the verse in an inner mutual relation ethically right. In any case it lies nearer to interpret &#1514;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;, in relation to man, actively than passively: that which makes man worthy of desire (Rashi), adorns and distinguishes him (Kimchi, Aben-Ezra); or, that which is desired by man, is above all things sought for (Luzzatto); and, in like manner, the Heb. meaning for &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493; lies nearer than the Aram. (vid., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#034">Pro 14:34</A>): the pleasure of a man is his disgrace (Ralbag). Thus Bertheau's translation: the desire of a man is his charitas, must mean: that which brings to a man true joy is to act amiably. But is that, thus generally expressed, true? And if this were the thought, how much more correctly and distinctly would it be expressed by &#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1495;&#1492; &#1500;&#1488;&#1491;&#1501; &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514; &#1495;&#1505;&#1491; (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#015">Pro 21:15</A>)! Hitzig so rightly reminded by &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;&#1493; of the Pharisee who thanks God that he is not as other men; the word ought to have been &#1495;&#1505;&#1491; to remove every trace of self-satisfaction. Hitzig therefore proposes from the lxx and the Vulgate the text-correction &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514; no, and translates, "from the revenue of a man is his kind gift;" and Ewald, who is satisfied with &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514;, "the gain of a man is his pious love." The latter is more judicious: &#1495;&#1505;&#1491; (love) distributed is in reality gain (according to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#017">Pro 19:17</A>); but 22b corresponds rather with the former: "better is he who from want does not give &#1514;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;&#1492;, than he who could give and says he has nothing." But was there then need for that &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; of the lxx? If a poor man is better than a lord given to lying - for &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; with &#1512;&#1513;&#1473; is a man of means and position - i.e., a poor man who would give willingly, but has nothing, than that man who will not give, and therefore lies, saying that he has nothing; then 22a means that the will of a man (cf. &#1514;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#023">Pro 11:23</A>) is his doing good (vid., regarding &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;, ad <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#003">Pro 3:3</A>), i.e., is its soul and very essence. Euchel, who accordingly translates: the philanthropy of a man consists properly in his goodwill, rightly compares the Rabbinical proverb, &#1488;&#1495;&#1491; &#1492;&#1502;&#1512;&#1489;&#1492; &#1493;&#1488;&#1495;&#1491; &#1492;&#1502;&#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1496; &#1493;&#1489;&#1500;&#1489;&#1491; &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514;&#1489;&#1493;&#1493;&#1503;, i.e., one may give more or less, it all depends on the intention, the disposition.

<p>23 The fear of Jahve tendeth to life;
<p>     Satisfied, one spendeth the night, not visited by evil.
<p>The first line is a variation of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#027">Pro 14:27</A>. How the fear of God thus reacheth to life, i.e., helps to a life that is enduring, free from care and happy, 23b says: the promises are fulfilled to the God-fearing, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#015">Deu 11:15</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#006">Lev 26:6</A>; he does not go hungry to bed, and needs fear no awakening in terror out of his soft slumber (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#024">Pro 3:24</A>). With &#1493; explic., 23a is explained. &#1500;&#1497;&#1503; &#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1506; means to spend the night (the long night) hungry. as &#1500;&#1497;&#1503; &#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#007">Job 24:7</A>, to pass the night in nakedness (cold). &#1504;&#1508;&#1511;&#1491;, of visitation of punishment, we read also at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#006">Isa 29:6</A>, and instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;, as it might be according to this passage, we have here the accus. of the manner placing the meaning of the Niph. beyond a doubt (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#015">Pro 11:15</A>, &#1512;&#1506;, in an evil manner). All is in harmony with the matter, and is good Heb.; on the contrary, Hitzig's ingenuity introduces, instead of &#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1506;&#1493;, an unheard of word, &#1493;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1506;, "and he stretches himself." One of the Greeks excellently translates: &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c2;. The lxx, which instead of &#1512;&#1506;, &#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, translates thus, &#1491;&#1468;&#1506;, discredits itself. The Midrash - Lagarde says of its translation - varies in colour like an opal. In other words, it handles the text like wax, and forms it according to its own taste, like the Midrash with its "read not so, but so."

<p>24 The slothful hath thrust his hand into the dish;
<p>     He bringeth it not again to his mouth.
<p>This proverb is repeated in a different form, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#015">Pro 26:15</A>. The figure appears, thus understood, an hyperbole, on which account the lxx understand by &#1510;&#1500;&#1495;&#1514; the bosom or lap, &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;; Aquila and Symmachus understand by it the arm-pit, &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bd; or &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;; and the Jewish interpreters gloss it by &#1495;&#1497;&#1511; (Kimchi) or &#1511;&#1512;&#1506; &#1492;&#1495;&#1500;&#1493;&#1511;, the slit (Ita. fenditura) of the shirt. But the domestic figure, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#013">Kg2 21:13</A>, places before us a dish which, when it is empty, is wiped and turned upside down;
<p>(Note: While &#1510;&#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;, s&#803;ah&#803;fat, in the sense of dish, is etymologically clear, for &#1510;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;, neither s&#803;alah&#803; (to be good for), nor salakh (to be deaf, mangy), offers an appropriate verbal meaning. The Arab. zuluh (large dishes) stands under zalah (to taste, of the tasting of good), but is scarcely a derivative from it. Only &#1510;&#1500;&#1495;, which in the meaning of good for, proceeding from the idea of penetrating through, has retained the root-meaning of cleft, furnishes for &#1510;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514; and &#1510;&#1500;&#1493;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514; a root-word in some measure useful.)
<p>and that the slothful when he eats appears too slothful to bring his hand, e.g., with the rice or the piece of bread he has taken out of the dish, again to his mouth, is true to nature: we say of such a man that he almost sleeps when he eats. The fut. after the perf. here denotes that which is not done after the former thing, i.e., that which is scarcely and only with difficulty done; &#1500;&#1468;&#1493; ... &#1490;&#1468;&#1501; may have the meaning of "yet not," as at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#002">Psa 129:2</A>; but the sense of "not once" = ne ... quidem, lies here nearer <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#003">Deu 23:3</A>.

<p>25 The scorner thou smitest, and the simple is prudent;
<p>     And if one reprove the man of understanding, he gaineth knowledge
<p>Hitzig translates in a way that is syntactically inexact: smite the scorner, so the simple becomes prudent; that would have required at least the word &#1493;&#1497;&#1506;&#1512;&#1501;: fut. and fut. connected by &#1493; is one of many modes of expression for the simultaneous, discussed by me at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#010">Hab 3:10</A>. The meaning of the proverb has a complete commentary at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#011">Pro 21:11</A>, where its two parts are otherwise expressed with perfect identity of thought. In regard to the &#1500;&#1509;, with whom denunciation and threatening bear no fruit (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#001">Pro 13:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#012">Pro 15:12</A>), and perhaps even produce the contrary effect to that intended (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#007">Pro 9:7</A>), there remains nothing else than to vindicate the injured truths by means of the private justice of corporal punishment. Such words, if spoken to the right man, in the right spirit, at the right time, may affect him with wholesome terrors; but even though he is not made better thereby, yet the simple, who listens to the mockeries of such not without injury, will thereby become prudent (gain &#1492;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; = &#1506;&#1512;&#1502;&#1492;, prudence, as at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#005">Pro 15:5</A>), i.e., either arrive at the knowledge that the mockery of religion is wicked, or guard himself against incurring the same repressive measures. In 25b &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1499;&#1495; is neither inf. (Umbreit), which after <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#011">Pro 21:11</A> must be &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492;&#1493;&#1499;&#1495;, nor impr. (Targ., Ewald), which according to rule is &#1492;&#1493;&#1499;&#1495;, but the hypothetic perf. (Syr.) with the most general subject (Merc., Hitzig): if one impart instruction to the (dat. obj. as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#007">Pro 9:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#002">Pro 15:2</A>) man of understanding (vid., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#021">Pro 16:21</A>), then he acquires knowledge, i.e., gains an insight into the nature and value of that which one wishes to bring him to the knowledge of (&#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1503; &#1491;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514;, as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#007">Pro 29:7</A>; cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#005">Pro 8:5</A>). That which the deterring lesson of exemplary punishment approximately effects with the wavering, is, in the case of the man of understanding, perfectly attained by an instructive word.
<p>
<p>We have now reached the close of the third chief section of the older Book of Proverbs. All the three sections begin with &#1489;&#1468;&#1503; &#1495;&#1499;&#1501;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#001">Pro 10:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#001">Pro 13:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#020">Pro 15:20</A>. The Introduction, chap. 1-9, dedicates this collection of Solomonic proverbs to youth, and the three beginnings accordingly relate to the relative duties of a son to his father and mother. We are now no longer far from the end, for <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#017">Pro 22:17</A> resumes the tone of the Introduction. The third principal part would be disproportionately large if it extended from <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#001">Pro 15:1</A> to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#015">Pro 22:15</A>. But there does not again occur a proverb beginning with the words "son of man." We can therefore scarcely go wrong if we take <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#026">Pro 19:26</A> as the commencement of a fourth principal part. The Masora divides the whole Mishle into eight sedarim, which exhibit so little knowledge of the true division, that the parashas (sections) <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#001">Pro 10:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#017">Pro 22:17</A> do not at all find their right place.
<p>(Note: The 915 verses of the Mishle, according to the Masora, fall into eight sedarim, beginning as follows: <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#001">Pro 1:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#018">Pro 5:18</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#012">Pro 9:12</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#004">Pro 14:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#010">Pro 18:10</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#022">Pro 22:22</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#013">Pro 25:13</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#016">Pro 28:16</A>.)
<p>The MSS, however, contain evidences that this Hagiograph was also anciently divided into parashas, which were designated partly by spaces between the lines (sethumoth) and partly by breaks in the lines (phethucoth). In Baer's Cod. Jamanensis,
<p>(Note: Vid., the Prefatio to the Masoretico-Critical Edition of Isaiah by Baer and myself; Leipzig, 1872.)
<p>after <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#019">Pro 6:19</A>, there is the letter &#1508; written on the margin as the mark of such a break. With <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#020">Pro 6:20</A> (vid., l.c.) there indeed commences a new part of the introductory Mashal discourses. But, besides, we only seldom meet with
<p>(Note: There are spaces within the lines after <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#007">Pro 1:7</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#009">Pro 1:9</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#033">Pro 1:33</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#022">Pro 2:22</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#018">Pro 3:18</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#035">Pro 3:35</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#017">Pro 5:17</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#023">Pro 5:23</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#004">Pro 6:4</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#011">Pro 6:11</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#015">Pro 6:15</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#019">Pro 6:19</A> (here a &#1508;), <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#035">Pro 6:35</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#021">Pro 8:21</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#031">Pro 8:31</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#035">Pro 8:35</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#018">Pro 9:18</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#025">Pro 17:25</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#009">Pro 18:9</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#019">Pro 22:19</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#027">Pro 22:27</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#014">Pro 23:14</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#022">Pro 24:22</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#033">Pro 24:33</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#021">Pro 26:21</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#010">Pro 28:10</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#016">Pro 28:16</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#017">Pro 29:17</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#027">Pro 29:27</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#006">Pro 30:6</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#009">Pro 30:9</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#014">Pro 30:14</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#017">Pro 30:17</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#020">Pro 30:20</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#024">Pro 30:24</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#028">Pro 30:28</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#033">Pro 30:33</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#009">Pro 31:9</A>.)
<p>coincidences with the division and grouping which have commended themselves to us. In the MS of the Graecus Venetus, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#011">Pro 19:11</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#016">Pro 19:16</A>, and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#019">Pro 19:19</A> have their initial letters coloured red; but why only these verses, is not manifest. A comparison of the series of proverbs distinguished by such initials with the Cod. Jaman. and Cod. II of the Leipzig City Library, makes it more than probable that it gives a traditional division of the Mishle, which may perhaps yet be discovered by a comparison of MSS.
<p>(Note: Vid., Gebhardt's Prolegomena to his new edition of the Versio Veneta.)
<p>But this much is clear, that a historico-literary reconstruction of the Mishle, and of its several parts, can derive no help from this comparison. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#026">Proverbs 19:26</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_026">pro 19:26</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>With <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#026">Pro 19:26</A> there thus begins the fourth principal part of the Solomonic collection of proverbs introduced by chap. 1-9.
<p>He that doeth violence to his father and chaseth his mother,
<p>Is a son that bringeth shame and disgrace.
<p>The right name is given in the second line to him who acts as is described in the first. &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1468;&#1491; means properly to barricade [obstruere], and then in general to do violence to, here: to ruin one both as to life and property. The part., which has the force of an attributive clause, is continued in the finite: qui matrem fugat; this is the rule of the Heb. style, which is not filome'tochos, Gesen. 134, Anm. 2. Regarding &#1502;&#1489;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, vid., at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#005">Pro 10:5</A>; regarding the placing together of &#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1493;&#1492;&#1495;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;, vid., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#005">Pro 13:5</A>, where for &#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, to make shame, to be scandalous, the word &#1492;&#1489;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, which is radically different, meaning to bring into bad odour, is used. The putting to shame is in &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473; ni si  (kindred with Arab. ba&#770;th) thought of as disturbatio (cf. &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;) (cf. at Ps. 6:11), in &#1495;&#1508;&#1512; (khfr) as opertio (cf. Cicero's Cluent. 20: infamia et dedecore opertus), not, as I formerly thought, with Frst, as reddening, blushing (vid., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#006">Psa 34:6</A>). Putting to shame would in this connection be too weak a meaning for &#1502;&#1495;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;. The paedagogic stamp which <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#026">Pro 19:26</A> impresses on this fourth principal part is made yet further distinct in the verse that now follows. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#027">Proverbs 19:27</A></p>

<p>27 Cease, my son, to hear instruction, 
<p>     To depart from the words of knowledge.
<p>Oetinger correctly: cease from hearing instruction if thou wilt make no other use of it than to depart, etc., i.e., cease to learn wisdom and afterwards to misuse it. The proverb is, as Ewald says, as "bloody irony;" but it is a dissuasive from hypocrisy, a warning against the self-deception of which <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#022">Jam 1:22-24</A> speaks, against heightening one's own condemnation, which is the case of that servant who knows his lord's will and does it not, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#047">Luk 12:47</A>. &#1495;&#1491;&#1500;, in the meaning to leave off doing something further, is more frequently construed with &#1500; seq. infin. than with &#1502;&#1503; (cf. e.g., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#008">Gen 11:8</A> with <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#021">Kg1 15:21</A>); but if we mean the omission of a thing which has not yet been begun, then the construction is with &#1500;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#013">Num 9:13</A>, Instead of &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, there might have been also used &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; (omit rather ... than...), and &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1503; &#1513;&#1473;&#1490;&#1493;&#1514; would be more distinct; but as the proverb is expressed, &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1490;&#1493;&#1514; is not to be mistaken as the subord. infin. of purpose. The lxx, Syr., Targ., and Jerome do violence to the proverb. Luther, after the example of older interpreters: instruction, that which leads away from prudent learning; but musar always means either discipline weaning from evil, or education leading to good.

<p>28 A worthless witness scoffeth at right;
<p>     And the mouth of the godless swalloweth up mischief.
<p>The Mosaic law does not know the oath of witnesses; but the adjuring of witnesses to speak the truth, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#001">Lev 4:1</A>, places a false statement almost in the rank of perjury. The &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;, which legally and morally binds witnesses, is just their duty to state the matter in accordance with truth, and without deceitful and malicious reservation; but a worthless witness (vid., regarding &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#012">Pro 6:12</A>) despiseth what is right (&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1509; with accus.-obj. like <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#009">Pro 14:9</A>), i.e., scornfully disregards this duty. Under 28b Hitzig remarks that &#1489;&#1500;&#1506; only in Kal means to devour, but in Piel, on the contrary, to absorb = annihilate; therefore he reads with the lxx and Syr. &#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503; justice instead of &#1488;&#1493;&#1503; mischief: the mouth of the wicked murders that which is right, properly, swallows down his feeling of right. But &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1506; interchanges with &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1506; in the sense of swallowing only, without the connected idea of annihilation; cf. &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;&#1468;&#1506; for the continuance [duration] of a gulp = for a moment, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#020">Num 4:20</A> with Job 7:29; and one can thus understand 28b without any alteration of the text after <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#016">Job 15:16</A>; cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#012">Pro 20:12-15</A>, as well as with the text altered after <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#012">Isa 3:12</A>, by no means so that one makes &#1488;&#1493;&#1503; the subject: mischief swallows up, i.e., destroys, the mouth of the wicked (Rashi); for when "mouth" and "to swallow" stand connected, the mouth is naturally that which swallows, not that which is swallowed (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#012">Ecc 10:12</A> : the mouth of the fool swallows, i.e., destroys, him). Thus 28b means that wickedness, i.e., that which is morally perverse, is a delicious morsel for the mouth of the godless, which he eagerly devours; to practise evil is for him, as we say, "ein wahrer Genuss" [a true enjoyment].

<p>29 Judgments are prepared for scorners,
<p>     And stripes for the backs of fools.
<p>&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; never means punishment which a court of justice inflicts, but is always used of the judgments of God, even although they are inflicted by human instrumentality (vid., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#024">Ch2 24:24</A>); the singular, which nowhere occurs, is the segolate n. act. &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496; = &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1493;&#1496;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#009">Ch2 20:9</A>, plur. &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1496;&#1497;&#1501;. Hitzig's remark: "the judgment may, after <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#025">Pro 19:25</A>, consist in stripes," is misleading; the stroke, &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, there is such as when, e.g., a stroke on the ear is applied to one who despises that which is holy, which, under the circumstances, may be salutary; but it does not fall under the category of shephuthim, nor properly under that of &#1502;&#1492;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;. The former are providential chastisements with which history itself, or God in history, visits the despiser of religion; the latter are strokes which are laid on the backs of fools by one who is instructing them, in order, if possible, to bring them to thought and understanding. &#1504;&#1499;&#1493;&#1503;, here inflected as Niph., is used, as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#023">Job 15:23</A>, as meaning to be placed in readiness, and thus to be surely imminent. Regarding mahalu&#780;moth, vid., at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#006">Pro 18:6</A>.
