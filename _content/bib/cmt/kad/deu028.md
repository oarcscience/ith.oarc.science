### [Deuteronomy Chapter 28](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#001)

[Deuteronomy 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 28:1</span></span>

For the purpose of impressing upon the hearts of all the people in the
most emphatic manner both the blessing which Israel was to proclaim upon
Gerizim, and the curse which it was to proclaim upon Ebal, Moses now
unfolds the blessing of fidelity to the law and the curse of
transgression in a longer address, in which he once more resumes, sums
up, and expands still further the promises and threats of the law in
[Exo 23:20-33](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#020), and Lev 26.

[Deu 28:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#001)

The Blessing. - [Deu 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#001). If Israel
would hearken to the voice of the Lord its God, the Lord would make it
the highest of all the nations of the earth. This thought, with which
the discourse on the law in [Deu 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#019)
terminated, forms the theme, and in a certain sense the heading, of the
following description of the blessing, through which the Lord, according
to the more distinct declaration in [Deu
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#002), would glorify His people above
all the nations of the earth. The indispensable condition for obtaining
this blessing, was obedience to the word of the Lord, or keeping His
commandments. To impress this condition sine qua non thoroughly upon the
people, Moses not only repeats it at the commencement ([Deu
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#002)), and in the middle ([Deu
28:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#009)), but also at the close ([Deu
28:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#013), [Deu
28:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#014)), in both a positive and a
negative form. In [Deu 28:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#002), "the way
in which Israel was to be exalted is pointed out" (Schultz); and thus
the theme is more precisely indicated, and the elaboration of it is
introduced. "All these blessings (those mentioned singly in what
follows) will come upon thee and reach thee." The blessings are
represented as actual powers, which follow the footsteps of the nation,
and overtake it. In [Deu 28:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#003), the
fulness of the blessing of God in all the relations of life is depicted
in a sixfold repetition of the word "blessed." Israel will be blessed in
the town and in the field, the two spheres in which its life moves ([Deu
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#003)); blessed will be the fruit of
the body, of the earth, and of the cattle, i.e., in all its productions
([Deu 28:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#004); for each one, see [Deu
7:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#013)); blessed will be the basket
([Deu 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#002)) in which the fruits are
kept, and the kneading - trough ([Exo
12:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#034)) in which the daily bread is
prepared ([Deu 28:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#005)); blessed will the
nation be in all its undertakings ("coming in and going out;" vid., [Num
27:17](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#017)).

[Deu 28:7-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#007)

[Deu 28:7-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#007) describe the influence
and effect of the blessing upon all the circumstances and situations in
which the nation might be placed: in [Deu
28:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#007), with reference (a) to the
attitude of Israel towards its enemies ([Deu
28:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#007)); (b) to its trade and handicraft
([Deu 28:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#008)); (c) to its attitude
towards all the nations of the earth ([Deu
28:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#009), [Deu
28:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#010)). The optative forms, יתּן and
יצו (in [Deu 28:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#007) and [Deu
28:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#008)), are worthy of notice. They show
that Moses not only proclaimed the blessing to the people, but desired
it for them, because he knew that Israel would not always or perfectly
fulfil the condition upon which it was to be bestowed. "May the Lord be
pleased to give thine enemies...smitten before thee," i.e., give them up
to thee as smitten (לפני נתן, to give up before a person, to deliver up
to him: cf. [Deu 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#008)), so that they
shall come out against thee by one way, and flee from thee by seven
ways, i.e., in wild dispersion (cf. [Lev
26:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#007)).

[Deu 28:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#008)

"May the Lord command the blessing with thee (put it at thy disposal) in
thy barns (granaries, store-rooms) and in all thy business" ("to set the
hand;" see [Deu 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#007)).

[Deu 28:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#009)

"The Lord will exalt thee for a holy nation to Himself,...so that all
the nations of the earth shall see that the name of Jehovah is named
upon thee, and shall fear before thee." The Lord had called Israel as a
holy nation, when He concluded the covenant with it ([Exo
19:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005)). This promise, to which the
words "as He hath sworn unto thee" point back, and which is called an
oath, because it was founded upon the promises given to the patriarchs
on oath ([Gen 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#016)), and was given
implicite in them, the Lord would fulfil to His people, and cause the
holiness and glory of Israel to be so clearly manifested, that all
nations should perceive or see "that the name of the Lord is named upon
Israel." The name of the Lord is the revelation of His glorious nature.
It is named upon Israel, when Israel is transformed into the glory of
the divine nature (cf. [Isa 63:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#019);
[Jer 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#009)). It was only in feeble
commencements that this blessing was fulfilled upon Israel under the Old
Testament; and it is not till the restoration of Israel, which is to
take place in the future according to [Rom
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#025)., that its complete fulfilment
will be attained. In [Deu 28:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#011) and
[Deu 28:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#012), Moses returns to the
earthly blessing, for the purpose of unfolding this still further.
"Superabundance will the Lord give thee for good (i.e., for happiness
and prosperity; vid., [Deu 30:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#009)), in
fruit of thy body," etc. (cf. [Deu
28:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#004)). He would open His good
treasure-house, the heaven, to give rain to the land in its season (cf.
[Deu 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#014); [Lev
26:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#004)), and bless the work of the
hands, i.e., the cultivation of the soil, so that Israel would be able
to lend to many, according to the prospect already set before it in [Deu
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#006).

[Deu 28:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#013)

By such blessings He would "make Israel the head, and not the tail," - a
figure taken from life (vid., [Isa
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#013)), the meaning of which is
obvious, and is given literally in the next sentence, "thou wilt be
above only, and not beneath," i.e., thou wilt rise more and more, and
increase in wealth, power, and dignity. With this the discourse returns
to its commencement; and the promise of blessing closes with another
emphatic repetition of the condition on which the fulfilment depended
([Deu 28:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#013) and [Deu
28:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#014). On [Deu
28:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#014), see [Deu
5:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#029); [Deu
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#028)).

[Deuteronomy 28:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">deu 28:15</span></span>

The Curse, in case Israel should not hearken to the voice of its God, to
keep His commandments. After the announcement that all these (the
following) curses would come upon the disobedient nation ([Deu
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#015)), the curse is proclaimed in all
its extent, as covering all the relations of life, in a sixfold
repetition of the word "cursed" ([Deu
28:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#016), as above in [Deu
28:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#003)); and the fulfilment of this
threat in plagues and diseases, drought and famine, war, devastation of
the land, and captivity of the people, is so depicted, that the
infliction of these punishments stands out to view in ever increasing
extent and fearfulness. We are not to record this, however, as a gradual
heightening of the judgments of God, in proportion to the increasing
rebellion of Israel, as in [Lev
26:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#014)., although it is obvious that
the punishments threatened did not fall upon the nation all at once.

[Deu 28:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#016)

[Deu 28:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#016) correspond precisely to
[Deu 28:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#003), so as to set forth the
curse as the counterpart of the blessing, except that the basket and
kneading-trough are mentioned before the fruit of the body.

[Deu 28:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#020)

The first view, in which the bursting of the threatened curse upon the
disobedient people is proclaimed in all its forms. First of all, quite
generally in [Deu 28:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#020). "The Lord
will send the curse against thee, consternation and threatening in every
undertaking of thy hand which thou carriest out (see [Deu
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#007)), till thou be destroyed, till
thou perish quickly, because of the wickedness of thy doings, because
thou hast forsaken Me." The three words, מארה, מהוּמה, and מגערת, are
synonymous, and are connected together to strengthen the thought. מארה,
curse or malediction; המּהוּמה, the consternation produced by the curse
of God, namely, the confusion with which God smites His foes (see at
[Deu 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#023)); המּגערה is the threatening
word of the divine wrath. - Then [Deu
28:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#021). in detail. "The Lord will make
the pestilence fasten upon (cleave to) thee, till He hath destroyed thee
out of the land...to smite thee with giddiness and fever (cf. [Lev
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#016)), inflammation, burning, and
sword, blasting of corn, and mildew (of the seed);" seven diseases
therefore (seven as the stamp of the words of God), whilst pestilence in
particular is mentioned first, as the most terrible enemy of life.
דּלּקת, from דּלק to burn, and חרחר, from חרר to glow, signify
inflammatory diseases, burning fevers; the distinction between these and
קדּחת cannot be determined. Instead of חרב, the sword as the instrument
of death, used to designate slaughter and death, the Vulgate, Arabic,
and Samaritan have adopted the reading חרב, aestus, heat ([Gen
31:40](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#040)), or drought, according to which
there would be four evils mentioned by which human life is attacked, and
three which are injurious to the corn. But as the lxx, Jon., Syr., and
others read חרב, this alteration is very questionable, especially as the
reading can be fully defended in this connection; and one objection to
the alteration is, that drought is threatened for the first time in [Deu
28:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#023), [Deu
28:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#024). שׁדּפון, from שׁדף to singe or
blacken, and ירקון, from ירק to be yellowish, refer to two diseases
which attack the corn: the former to the withering or burning of the
ears, caused by the east wind ([Gen
41:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#023)); the other to the effect
produced by a warm wind in Arabia, by which the green ears are turned
yellow, so that they bear no grains of corn.

[Deu 28:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#023)

To this should be added terrible drought, without a drop of rain from
heaven (cf. [Lev 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#019)). Instead of
rain, dust and ashes should fall from heaven. נתן construed with a
double accusative: to make the rain of the land into dust and ashes, to
give it in the form of dust and ashes. When the heat is very great, the
air in Palestine is often full of dust and sand, the wind assuming the
form of a burning sirocco, so that the air resembles the glowing heat at
the mouth of a furnace (Robinson, ii. 504).

[Deu 28:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#025)

Defeat in battle, the very opposite of the blessing promised in [Deu
28:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#007). Israel should become לזעוה, "a
moving to and fro," i.e., so to speak, "a ball for all the kingdoms of
the earth to play with" (Schultz). זעוה, here and at [Eze
23:46](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#046), is not a transposed and later
form of זועה, which has a different meaning in [Isa
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#019), but the original uncontracted
form, which was afterwards condensed into זועה; for this, and not זועה,
is the way in which the Chethib should be read in [Jer
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#004); [Jer
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#009); [Jer
29:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#018); [Jer
34:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#017), and [Ch2
29:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#008), where this threat is repeated
(vid., Ewald, 53, b.). The corpses of those who were slain by the foe
should serve as food for the birds of prey and wild beasts - the
greatest ignominy that could fall upon the dead, and therefore
frequently held out as a threat against the ungodly ([Jer
7:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#033); [Jer
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#004); [Kg1
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#011), etc.).

[Deu 28:27-34](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#027)

The second view depicts still further the visitation of God both by
diseases of body and soul, and also by plunder and oppression on the
part of their enemies. - In [Deu 28:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#027)
four incurable diseases of the body are threatened: the ulcer of Egypt
(see at [Exo 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#009)), i.e., the form of
leprosy peculiar to Egypt, elephantiasis (Aegypti peculiare malum: Plin.
xxvi. c. 1, s. 5), which differed from lepra tuberosa, however, or
tubercular leprosy ([Deu 28:35](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#035); cf.
[Job 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#007)), in degree only, and not in
its essential characteristics (see Tobler, mediz. Topogr. v. Jerus. p.
51). עפלים, from עפל, a swelling, rising, signifies a tumour, and
according to the Rabbins a disease of the anus: in men, tumor in
posticis partibus; in women, durius quoddam οἴδημα in utero. It was with
this disease that the Philistines were smitten ([Sa1
5:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#001)). גּרב (see [Lev
21:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#020)) and חרס, from חרס, to scrape or
scratch, also a kind of itch, of which there are several forms in Syria
and Egypt.

[Deu 28:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#028)

In addition to this, there would come idiocy, blindness, and confusion
of mind, - three psychical maladies; for although עוּרון signifies
primarily bodily blindness, the position of the word between idiocy and
confusion of heart, i.e., of the understanding, points to mental
blindness here.

[Deu 28:29-34](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#029)

[Deu 28:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#029) leads to the same
conclusion, where it is stated that Israel would grope in the bright
noon-day, like a blind man in the dark, and not make his ways prosper,
i.e., not hit upon the right road which led to the goal and to
salvation, would have no good fortune or success in its undertakings
(cf. [Psa 37:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#007)). Being thus smitten in
body and soul, it would be only (אך as in [Deu
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#015)), i.e., utterly, oppressed and
spoiled evermore. These words introduce the picture of the other
calamity, viz., the plundering of the nation and the land by enemies
([Deu 28:30-33](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#030)). Wife, house,
vineyard, ox, ass, and sheep would be taken away by the foe; sons and
daughters would be carried away into captivity before the eyes of the
people, who would see it and pine after the children, i.e., with sorrow
and longing after them; "and thy hand shall not be to thee towards God,"
i.e., all power and help will fail thee. (On this proverbial expression,
see [Gen 31:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#029); and on חלּל, in [Gen
31:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#030), see at [Deu
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#006).) - In [Deu
28:33](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#033), [Deu
28:34](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#034), this threat is summed up in the
following manner: the fruit of the field and all their productions would
be devoured by a strange nation, and Israel would be only oppressed and
crushed to pieces all its days, and become mad on account of what its
eyes would be compelled to see.

[Deu 28:35-46](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#035)

The third view. - With the words, "the Lord will smite thee," Moses
resumes in [Deu 28:35](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#035) the threat of
[Deu 28:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#027), to set forth the
calamities already threatened under a new aspect, namely, as signs of
the rejection of Israel from covenant fellowship with the Lord.

[Deu 28:35](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#035)

The Lord would smite the people with grievous abscesses in the knees and
thighs, that should be incurable, even from the sole of the foot to the
crown of the head. רע שׁחין ר is the so-called joint-leprosy, a form of
the lepra tuberosa (vid., Pruner, p. 167). From the clause, however,
"from the sole of thy foot unto the top of thy head," it is evident that
the threat is not to be restricted to this species of leprosy, since
"the upper parts of the body often remain in a perfectly normal state in
cases of leprosy in the joints; and after the diseased parts have fallen
off, the patients recover their previous health to a certain degree"
(Pruner). Moses mentions this as being a disease of such a nature, that
it would render it utterly impossible for those who were afflicted with
it either to stand or walk, and then heightens the threat by adding the
words, "from the sole of the foot to the top of the head." Leprosy
excluded from fellowship with the Lord, and deprived the nation of the
character of a nation of God.

[Deu 28:36-37](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#036)

The loss of their spiritual character would be followed by the
dissolution of the covenant fellowship. This thought connects [Deu
28:36](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#036) with [Deu
28:35](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#035), and not the thought that Israel
being afflicted with leprosy would be obliged to go into captivity, and
in this state would become an object of abhorrence to the heathen
(Schultz). The Lord would bring the nation and its king to a foreign
nation that it did not know, and thrust them into bondage, so that it
would be obliged to serve other gods - wood and stone (vid., [Deu
4:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#028)), - and would become an object of
disgust, a proverb, and a byword to all nations whither God should drive
it (vid., [Kg1 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#007); [Jer
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#009)).

[Deu 28:38-39](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#038)

Even in their own land the curse would fall upon every kind of labour
and enterprise. Much seed would give little to reap, because the locust
would devour the seed; the planting and dressing of the vineyard would
furnish no wine to drink, because the worm would devour the vine. תּולעת
is probably the ἴψ or ἴξ of the Greeks, the convolvulus of the Romans,
our vine-weevil.

[Deu 28:40](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#040)

They would have many olive-trees in the land, but not anoint themselves
with oil, because the olive-tree would be rooted out or plundered
(ישּׁל, Niphal of שׁלל, as in [Deu
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#005), not the Kal of נשׁל, which
cannot be shown to have the intransitive meaning elabi).

[Deu 28:41](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#041)

Sons and daughters would they beget, but not keep, because they would
have to go into captivity.

[Deu 28:42](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#042)

All the trees and fruits of the land would the buzzer take possession
of. צלצל, from צלל to buzz, a rhetorical epithet applied to locusts, not
the grasshopper, which does not injure the fruits of the tree or ground
sufficiently for the term ירשׁ, "to take possession of," to be
applicable to it.

[Deu 28:43](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#043)

Israel would be utterly impoverished, and would sink lower and lower,
whilst the stranger in the midst of it would, on the contrary, get above
it very high; not indeed "because he had no possession, but was
dependent upon resources of other kinds" (Schultz), but rather because
he would be exempted with all his possessions from the curse of God,
just as the Israelites had been exempted from the plagues which came
upon the Egyptians ([Exo 9:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#006), [Exo
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#026)).

[Deu 28:44-46](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#044)

The opposite of [Deu 28:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#012) and [Deu
28:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#013) would come to pass. - In [Deu
28:46](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#046) the address returns to its
commencement in [Deu 28:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#015), with the
terrible threat, "These curses shall be upon thee for a sign and for a
wonder, and upon thy seed for ever," for the purpose of making a pause,
if not of bringing the whole to a close. The curses were for a sign and
wonder (מופת, that which excites astonishment and terror), inasmuch as
their magnitude and terrible character manifested most clearly the
supernatural interposition of God (vid., [Deu
29:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#023)). "For ever" applies to the
generation smitten by the curse, which would remain for ever rejected,
though without involving the perpetual rejection of the whole nation, or
the impossibility of the conversion and restoration of a remnant, or of
a holy seed ([Isa 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#022); [Isa
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#013); [Rom
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#027); [Rom
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#005)).

[Deu 28:47-57](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#047)

The fourth view. - Although in what precedes every side of the national
life has been brought under the curse, yet love to his people, and the
desire to preserve them from the curse, by holding up before them the
dreadful severity of the wrath of God, impel the faithful servant of the
Lord to go still further, and depict more minutely still the dreadful
horrors consequent upon Israel being given up to the power of the
heathen, and first of all in [Deu
28:47-57](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#047) the horrible calamities which
would burst upon Israel on the conquest of the land and its fortresses
by its foes.

[Deu 28:47-48](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#047)

Because it had not served the Lord its God with joy and gladness of
heart, "for the abundance of all," i.e., for the abundance of all the
blessings bestowed upon it by its God, it would serve its enemies in
hunger, and thirst, and nakedness, and want of everything, and wear an
iron yoke, i.e., be obliged to perform the hardest tributary service
till it was destroyed (השׁמיד for השׁמיד, as in [Deu
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#024)).

[Deu 28:49-50](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#049)

The Lord would bring against it from afar a barbarous, hardhearted
nation, which knew not pity. "From afar" is still further strengthened
by the addition of the words, "from the end of the earth." The greater
the distance off, the more terrible does the foe appear. He flies thence
like an eagle, which plunges with violence upon its prey, and carries it
off with its claws; and Israel does not understand its language, so as
to be able to soften its barbarity, or come to any terms. A people
"firm, hard of face," i.e., upon whom nothing makes an impression (vid.,
[Isa 50:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#007)), - a description of the
audacity and shamelessness of its appearance ([Dan
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#023); cf. [Pro
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#013); [Pro
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#029)), which spares neither old men
nor boys. This description no doubt applies to the Chaldeans, who are
described as flying eagles in [Hab
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#006)., [Jer
48:40](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#040); [Jer
49:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#022); [Eze
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#003), [Eze
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#007), as in the verses before us; but
it applies to other enemies of Israel beside these, namely to the great
imperial powers generally, the Assyrians, Chaldeans, and Romans, whom
the Lord raised up as the executors of His curse upon His rebellious
people. Isaiah therefore depicts the Assyrians in a similar manner,
namely, as a people with an unintelligible language ([Deu
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#026); [Deu
28:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#011); [Deu
33:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#019)), and describes the cruelty of
the Medes in [Deu 13:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#017), with an
unmistakeable allusion to [Deu 28:50](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#050)
of the present threat.

[Deu 28:51-52](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#051)

This foe would consume all the fruit of the cattle and the land, i.e.,
everything which the nation had acquired through agriculture and the
breeding of stock, without leaving it anything, until it was utterly
destroyed (see [Deu 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#013)), and would
oppress, i.e., besiege it in all its gates (towns, vid., [Deu
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#012)), till the lofty and strong
walls upon which they relied should fall (ירד as in [Deu
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#020)).

[Deu 28:53](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#053)

It would so distress Israel, that in their distress and siege they would
be driven to eat the fruit of their body, and the flesh of their own
children (with regard to the fulfilment of this, see the remarks on [Lev
26:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#029)). - This horrible distress is
depicted still more fully in [Deu
28:54-57](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#054), where the words, "in the
siege and in the straitness," etc. ([Deu
28:53](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#053)), are repeated as a refrain,
with their appalling sound, in [Deu
28:55](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#055) and [Deu
28:57](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#057).

[Deu 28:54-55](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#054)

The effeminate and luxurious man would look with ill-favour upon his
brother, the wife of his bosom, and his remaining children, "to give"
(so that he would not give) to one of them of the flesh of his children
which he was consuming, because there was nothing left to him in the
siege. "His eye shall be evil," i.e., look with envy or ill-favour (cf.
[Deu 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#009)). השׁאיר מבּלי, on account
of there not being anything left for himself. כּל with בּלי signifies
literally "all not," i.e., nothing at all. השׁאיר, an infinitive, as in
[Deu 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#003) (see at [Deu
28:48](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#048)).

[Deu 28:56-57](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#056)

The delicate and luxurious woman, who had not attempted to put her feet
to the ground (had always been carried therefore either upon a litter or
an ass: cf. [Jdg 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#010), and Arvieux,
Sitten der Beduinen Ar. p. 143), from tenderness and delicacy - her eye
would look with envy upon the husband of her bosom and her children, and
that (vav expl.) because of (for) her after-birth, which cometh out from
between her feet, and because of her children which she bears (sc.,
during the siege); "for she will eat them secretly in the want of
everything," that is to say, first of all attempt to appease her hunger
with the after-birth, and then, when there was no more left, with her
own children. To such an awful height would the famine rise!

[Deu 28:58-68](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#058)

The fifth and last view. - And yet these horrible calamities would not
be the end of the distress. The full measure of the divine curse would
be poured out upon Israel, when its disobedience had become hardened
into disregard of the glorious and fearful name of the Lord its God. To
point this out, Moses describes the resistance of the people in [Deu
28:58](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#058); not, as in [Deu
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#015) and [Deu
28:45](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#045), as not hearkening to the voice
of the Lord to keep all His commandments, which he (Moses) had commanded
this day, or which Jehovah had commanded ([Deu
28:45](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#045)), but as "not observing to do
all the words which are written in this book, to fear the glorified and
fearful name," (viz.) Jehovah its God. "This book" is not Deuteronomy,
even if we should assume that Moses had not first of all delivered the
discourses in this book to the people and then written them down, but
had first of all written them down and then read them to the people (see
at [Deu 31:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#009)), but the book of the
law, i.e., the Pentateuch, so far as it was already written. This is
evident from [Deu 28:60](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#060), [Deu
28:61](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#061), according to which the grievous
diseases of Egypt were written in this book of the law, which points to
the book of Exodus, where grievous diseases occur among the Egyptian
plagues. In fact, Moses could not have thought of merely laying the
people under the obligation to keep the laws of the book of Deuteronomy,
since this book does not contain all the essential laws of the covenant,
and was never intended to form an independent book of the law. The
infinitive clause, "to fear," etc., serves to explain the previous
clause, "to do," etc., whether we regard the two clauses as co-ordinate,
or the second as subordinate to the first. Doing all the commandments of
the law must show and prove itself in fearing the revealed name of the
Lord. Where this fear is wanting, the outward observance of the
commandments can only be a pharisaic work-righteousness, which is
equivalent to a transgress of the law. But the object of this fear was
not to be a God, according to human ideas of the nature and working of
God; it was to be "this glorified and fearful name," i.e., Jehovah the
absolute God, as He glories Himself and shows Himself to be fearful in
His doings upon earth. "The name," as in [Lev
24:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#011). נכבּד in a reflective sense, as
in [Exo 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#004), [Exo
14:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#017); [Lev
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#003).

[Deu 28:59-60](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#059)

If Israel should not do this, the Lord would make its strokes and the
strokes of its seed wonderful, i.e., would visit the people and their
descendants with extraordinary strokes, with great and lasting strokes,
and with evil and lasting diseases ([Deu
28:60](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#060)), and would bring all the
pestilences of Egypt upon it. השׁיב, to turn back, inasmuch as Israel
was set free from them by the deliverance out of Egypt. מדוה is
construed with the plural as a collective noun.

[Deu 28:61](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#061)

Also every disease and every stroke that was not written in this book of
the law, - not only those that were written in the book of the law, but
those also that did not stand therein. The diseases of Egypt that were
written in the book of the law include the murrain of cattle, the boils
and blains, and the death of the first-born ([Exo
9:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#001); [Exo
12:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#029)); and the strokes (מכּה) the
rest of the plagues, viz., the frogs, gnats, dog-flies, hail, locusts,
and darkness (Ex 8-10). יעלּם, an uncommon and harder form of יעלם ([Jdg
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#003); cf. Ewald, 138, a.).

[Deu 28:62](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#062)

Israel would be almost annihilated thereby. "Ye will be left in few
people (a small number; cf. [Deu
26:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#005)), whereas ye were as numerous as
the stars of heaven."

[Deu 28:63](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#063)

Yea, the Lord would find His pleasure in the destruction and
annihilation of Israel, as He had previously rejoiced in blessing and
multiplying it. With this bold anthropomorphic expression Moses seeks to
remove from the nation the last prop of false confidence in the mercy of
God. Greatly as the sin of man troubles God, and little as the pleasure
may be which He has in the death of the wicked, yet the holiness of His
love demands the punishment and destruction of those who despise the
riches of His goodness and long-suffering; so that He displays His glory
in the judgment and destruction of the wicked no less than in blessing
and prospering the righteous.

[Deu 28:63-64](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#063)

Those who had not succumbed to the plagues and strokes of God, would be
torn from the land of their inheritance, and scattered among all nations
to the end of the earth, and there be compelled to serve other gods,
which are wood and stone, which have no life and no sensation, and
therefore can hear no prayer, and cannot deliver out of any distress
(cf. [Deu 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#027).).

[Deu 28:65-66](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#065)

When banished thus among all nations, Israel would find no ease or rest,
not even rest for the sole of its foot, i.e., no place where it could
quietly set its foot, and remain and have peace in its heart. To this
extreme distress of homeless banishment there would be added "a
trembling heart, failing of the eyes (the light of life), and despair of
soul" (vid., [Lev 26:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#036).).

[Deu 28:66](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#066)

"Thy life will be hung up before thee," i.e., will be like some valued
object, hanging by a thin thread before thine eyes, which any moment
might tear down (Knobel), that is to say, will be ever hanging in the
greatest danger. "Thou wilt not believe in thy life," i.e., thou wilt
despair of its preservation (cf. Job. [Deu
24:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#022)).

(Note: "I have never seen a passage which describes more clearly the
misery of a guilty conscience, in words and thoughts so fitting and
appropriate. For this is just the way in which a man is affected, who
knows that God is offended, i.e., who is harassed with the consciousness
of sin"' (Luther).)

[Deu 28:67](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#067)

In the morning they would wish it were evening, and in the evening would
wish it were morning, from perpetual dread of what each day or night
would bring.

[Deu 28:68](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#068)

Last of all, Moses mentions the worst, namely, their being taken back to
Egypt into ignominious slavery. "If the exodus was the birth of the
nation of God as such, return would be its death" (Schultz). "In ships:"
i.e., in a way which would cut off every possibility of escape. The
clause, "by the way whereof I spake unto thee, thou shalt see it no more
again," is not a more precise explanation of the expression "in ships,"
for it was not in ships that Israel came out of Egypt, but by land,
through the desert; on the contrary, it simply serves to strengthen the
announcement, "The Lord shall bring thee into Egypt again," namely, in
the sense that God would cause them to take a road which they would
never have been again if they had continued in faithful dependence upon
the Lord. This was the way to Egypt, in reality such a return to this
land as Israel ought never to have experienced, namely, a return to
slavery. "There shall ye be sold to your enemies as servants and maids,
and there shall be no buyer," i.e., no one will buy you as slaves. This
clause, which indicates the utmost contempt, is quite sufficient to
overthrow the opinion of Ewald, Riehm, and others, already referred to
at pp. 928, 929, namely, that this verse refers to Psammetichus, who
procured some Israelitish infantry from Manasseh. Egypt is simply
mentioned as a land where Israel had lived in ignominious bondage. "As a
fulfilment of a certain kind, we might no doubt adduce the fact that
Titus sent 17,000 adult Jews to Egypt to perform hard labour there, and
had those who were under 17 years of age publicly sold (Josephus, de
bell. Jud. vi. 9, 2), and also that under Hadrian Jews without number
were sold at Rachel's grave (Jerome, ad Jer 31). But the word of God is
not so contracted, that it can be limited to one single fact. The curses
were fulfilled in the time of the Romans in Egypt (vid., Philo in
Flacc., and leg. ad Caium), but they were also fulfilled in a horrible
manner during the middle ages (vid., Depping, die Juden im Mittelalter);
and they are still in course of fulfilment, even though they are
frequently less sensibly felt" (Schultz).
