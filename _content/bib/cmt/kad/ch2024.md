### [2 Chronicles Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 24:1</span></span>

The reign of Joash; cf. 2 Kings 12. - In both accounts only two main
events in Joash's reign of forty years are narrated at any length, - the
repair of the temple, and the campaign of the Syrian king Hazael against
Jerusalem. Besides this, at the beginning, we have a statement as to the
duration and spirit of his reign; and in conclusion, the murder of Joash
in consequence of a conspiracy is mentioned. Both accounts agree in all
essential points, but are shown to be extracts containing the most
important part of a more complete history of Joash, by the fact that, on
the one hand, in 2 Kings 12 single circumstances are communicated in a
more detailed and more exact form than that in which the Chronicle
states them; while, on the other hand, the account of the Chronicle
supplements the account in 2 Kings 12 in many respects. To these latter
belong the account of the marriage of Joash, and his many children, the
account of the death of Jehoiada at the age of 130 years, and his
honourable burial with the kings, etc.; see on [Ch2
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#015).

[2 Chronicles 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch2 24:4</span></span>

As to the repair of the temple, see the commentary on [Kg2
12:5-17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#005), where both the formal
divergences and the essential agreement of the two narratives are
pointed out.

[2 Chronicles 24:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 24:11</span></span>

וגו יביא בּעת ויהי, translate: It came to pass at the time when they
brought the chest to the guard of the king by the Levites, i.e., to the
board of oversight appointed by the king from among the Levites. עת
stat. constr. before a sentence following. בּכום ליום does not denote
every day, but every time when there was much money in the chest.

[2 Chronicles 24:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch2 24:13</span></span>

ארוּכה ותּעל, and there was a band laid upon the work, i.e., the
restoration of the house of God was furthered; cf. for this symbolical
expression, [Neh 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#001); [Jer
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#007).

[2 Chronicles 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 24:14</span></span>

כּלים ויּעשׂהוּ, therefrom (the king) caused to be made (prepared)
vessels for the house of Jahve, (namely) vessels of the service, i.e.,
according to [Num 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#012), in the holy
place, and for the offering of burnt-offering, i.e., altar vessels, and
(besides) bowls, and (other) vessels of gold and silver. The last clause
of [Ch2 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#014) leads on to the
following: "They (king and people) offered burnt-offering continually so
long as Jehoiada lived."

[2 Chronicles 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch2 24:15</span></span>

Jehoiada's death: the fall of the people into idolatry: the protest of
the prophet Zechariah against it, and the stoning of him. - This section
is not found in 2 Kings 12, but is important for the understanding of
the later history of Joash ([Ch2
24:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#023).). With the death of the
grey-haired high priest came a turning-point in the reign of Joash.
Jehoiada had saved the life and throne of Joash, preserved to the
kingdom the royal house of David, to which the promises belonged, and
had put an end to the idolatry which had been transplanted into Judah by
Joram's marriage into the royal house of Ahab, restoring the
Jahve-worship. For this he was honoured at his death, his body being
laid in the city of David among the kings: "For he had done good in
Israel, and towards God and His house" (the temple). According to [Kg2
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#007), he still took an active part in
the repair of the temple in the twenty-third year of Joash, and
according to [Ch2 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#014) he lived for
some time after the completion of that work. But after his death the
people soon forgot the benefits they owed him.

[2 Chronicles 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch2 24:17</span></span>

The princes of Judah besought the king to allow them to worship the
Astartes and idols, and the king hearkened to them, did not venture to
deny their request. למּלך ישׁתּחווּ, they bowed themselves before the
king, i.e., they besought him. What they thus beseechingly requested is
not stated, but may be gathered from what they did, according to [Ch2
24:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#018). They forsook Jahve the God of
their fathers, etc. There came wrath upon Judah because of this their
trespass. קצף, a wrathful judgment of the Lord, cf. [Ch2
29:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#008), viz., the invasion of the land
by Hazael, [Ch2 24:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#023). On the
construction זאת אשׁמתם, cf. Ew. 293, c, S. 740. Against this defection
prophets whom the Lord sent did indeed lift up their testimony, but they
would not hearken to them. Of these prophets, one, Zechariah the son of
the high priest Jehoiada, is mentioned by name in [Ch2
24:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#020)., who, seized by the Spirit of
the Lord, announced to the people divine punishment for their defection,
and was thereupon, at the king's command, stoned in the court of the
temple. With לבשׁה רוּח cf. [Ch1
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#018), and the commentary on [Jdg
6:34](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#034). לעם מעל, above the people, viz.,
as we learn from [Ch2 24:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#021), in the
inner, higher-lying court, so that he was above the people who were in
the outer court. "Why transgress ye the commandments of the Lord, and
(why) will ye not prosper?" Fidelity to the Lord is the condition of
prosperity. If Israel forsake the Lord, the Lord will also forsake it;
cf. [Ch2 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#005); [Ch2
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#002).

[2 Chronicles 24:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch2 24:21</span></span>

And they (the princes and the people) conspired against him, and stoned
him, at the command of the king, in the court of the temple. This זכריה
is the Ζαχαρίας whose slaughter is mentioned by Christ in [Mat
23:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#036) and [Luk
11:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#051) as the last prophet-murder
narrated in the Old Testament, whose blood would come upon the people,
although Matthew calls him υἱὸς Βαραχίου. According to these passages,
he was slain between the temple and the altar of burnt-offering,
consequently in the most sacred part of the court of the priests. That
the king, Joash, could give the command for this murder, shows how his
compliance with the princes' demands ([Ch2
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#017)) had made him the slave of sin.
Probably the idolatrous princes accused the witness for God of being a
seditious person and a rebel against the majesty of the crown, and
thereby extorted from the weak king the command for his death. For it is
not said that Joash himself worshipped the idols; and even in [Ch2
24:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#022) it is only the base ingratitude
of which Joash had been guilty, in the slaughter of the son of his
benefactor, which is adduced against him. But Zechariah at his death
said, "May the Lord look upon it, and take vengeance" (דּרשׁ, to seek or
require a crime, i.e., punish it). This word became a prophecy, which
soon began to be fulfilled, [Ch2
24:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#023).

[2 Chronicles 24:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ch2 24:23</span></span>

The punishment comes upon them. Joash afflicted by the invasion of Judah
by Hazael the Syrian; and his death in consequence of a conspiracy
against him. - These two events are narrated in [Kg2
12:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#018) also, the progress of
Hazael's invasion being more exactly traced; see the commentary on [Kg2
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#018). The author of the Chronicle
brings forward only those parts of it which show how God punished Joash
for his defection from Him.

"At the revolution of a year," i.e., scarcely a year after the murder of
the prophet Zechariah, a Syrian army invaded Judah and advanced upon
Jerusalem; "and they destroyed all the princes of the people from among
the people," i.e., they smote the army of Joash in a battle, in which
the princes (the chief and leaders) were destroyed, i.e., partly slain,
partly wounded. This punishment came upon the princes as the originators
of the defection from the Lord, [Ch2
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#017). "And they sent all their booty
to the king (Hazael) to Damascus." In this booty the treasures which
Joash gave to the Syrians ([Kg2 12:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#019))
to buy their withdrawal are also included. In order to show that this
invasion of the Syrians was a divine judgment, it is remarked in [Ch2
24:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#024) that the Syrians, with a small
army, gained a victory over the very large army of Judah, and executed
judgment upon Joash. שׁפטים עשׂה, as in [Exo
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#012); [Num
33:4](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#004), frequently in Ezekiel, usually
construed with בּ, here with את, analogous to the את טּוב עשׂה, e.g.,
[Sa1 24:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#019). These words refer to the
wounding of Joash, and its results, [Ch2
24:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#025). In the war Joash was badly
wounded; the Syrians on their withdrawal had left him behind in many
wounds (מחליים only met with here, synonymous with תּחלאים, [Ch2
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#019)). Then his own servants, the
court officials named in [Ch2 24:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#026),
conspired against him, and smote him upon his bed. In [Kg2
12:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#021), the place where the king, lying
sick upon his bed, was slain is stated. He met with his end thus,
"because of the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest" which had been
shed. The plural בּני is perhaps only an orthographical error for בּן,
occasioned by the preceding דּמי (Berth.); but more probably it is, like
בּנין, [Ch2 28:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#003) and [Ch2
33:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#006), a rhetorical plural, which says
nothing as to the number, but only brings out that Joash had brought
blood-guiltiness upon himself in respect of the children of his
benefactor Jehoiada; see on [Ch2 28:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#003).
Upon the murdered king, moreover, the honour of being buried in the
graves of the kings was not bestowed; cf. [Ch2
21:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#020). On the names of the two
conspirators, [Ch2 24:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#026), see on [Kg2
12:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#021). In [Ch2
24:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#027) it is doubtful how ורב is to be
read. The Keri demands ירב, which Berth. understands thus: And as
regards his sons, may the utterance concerning him increase; which might
signify, "May the wish of the dying Zechariah, [Ch2
24:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#022), be fulfilled on them in a still
greater degree than on their father." But that is hardly the meaning of
the Keri. The older theologians took ירב relatively: et quam creverit s.
multiplicatum fuerit. Without doubt, the Keth. ורב or ורב is the correct
reading. המּשּׂא, too, is variously interpreted. Vulg., Luther, and
others take it to be synonymous with משׂאת, [Ch2
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#006), [Ch2
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#009), and understand it of the money
derived from Moses' tax; but to that עליו is by no means suitable.
Others (as Then.) think of the tribute laid upon him, [Kg2
12:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#019), but very arbitrarily. On the
other hand, Clericus and others rightly understand it of prophetic
threatenings against him, corresponding to the statement in [Ch2
24:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#019), that God sent prophets against
him. As to the Midrash of the book of Kings, see the Introduction.
