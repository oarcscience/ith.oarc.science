[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

Cry Sent Forth from the Prison to the Best of Friends

This the last of the eight Davidic Psalms, which are derived by their
inscriptions from the time of the persecution by Saul (vid., on Ps 34),
is inscribed: A Meditation by David, when he was in the cave, a Prayer.
Of these eight Psalms, [Psa 52:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#001) and
[Psa 54:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#001) also bear the name of
Maskı̂l (vid., on [Psa 32:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001)); and in
this instance תּפּלּה (which occurs besides as an inscription only in
[Psa 90:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#001); [Psa
102:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#001); [Psa
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#001)) is further added, which looks
like an explanation of the word maskı̂l (not in use out of the range of
Psalm-poetry). The article of במערה, as in [Psa
57:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001), points to the cave of Adullam (1
Sam. 22) or the cave of Engedi (1 Sam. 24), which latter, starting from
a narrow concealed entrance, forms such a labyrinthine maze of passages
and vaults that the torches and lines of explorers have not to the
present time been able to reach the extremities of it.

The Psalm does not contain any sure signs of a post-Davidic age; still
it appears throughout to be an imitation of older models, and
pre-eminently by means of [Psa 142:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#002).
(cf. [Psa 77:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#002).) and [Psa
142:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#004) (cf. [Psa
77:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#004)) it comes into a relation of
dependence to Ps 77, which is also noticeable in [Psa
143:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#001) (cf. [Psa
142:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#005) with [Psa
77:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#012).). The referring back of the two
Psalms to David comes under one and the same judgment.

[Psalms 142:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 142:1</span></span>

The emphasis of the first two lines rests upon אל־ה. Forsaken by all
created beings, he confides in Jahve. He turns to Him in pathetic and
importunate prayer (זעק, the parallel word being התחנּן, as in [Psa
30:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#009)), and that not merely inwardly
([Exo 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#015)), but with his voice
(vid., on [Psa 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#005)) - for audible
prayer reacts soothingly, strengtheningly, and sanctifyingly upon the
praying one - he pours out before Him his trouble which distracts his
thoughts (שׁפך שׂיח as in [Psa 102:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#001),
cf. [Psa 62:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#009); [Psa
64:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#002); [Sa1
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#016)), he lays open before Him
everything that burdens and distresses him. Not as though He did not
also know it without all this; on the contrary, when his spirit (רוּחי
as in [Psa 143:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#004); [Psa
77:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#004), cf. נפשׁי [Jon
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/jon002.htm#007), [Psa
107:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#005), לבּי [Psa
61:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#003)) within him (עלי, see [Psa
42:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#005)) is enshrouded and languishes,
just this is his consolation, that Jahve is intimately acquainted with
his way together with the dangers that threaten him at every step, and
therefore also understands how to estimate the title (right) and meaning
of his complaints. The Waw of ואתּה is the same as in [Kg1
8:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#036), cf. Ps 35. Instead of saying:
then I comfort myself with the fact that, etc., he at once declares the
fact with which he comforts himself. Supposing this to be the case,
there is no need for any alteration of the text in order to get over
that which is apparently incongruous in the relation of [Psa
142:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#004) to [Psa
142:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#004).

[Psalms 142:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 142:3</span></span>

The prayer of the poet now becomes deep-breathed and excited, inasmuch
as he goes more minutely into the details of his straitened situation.
Everywhere, whithersoever he has to go (cf. on [Psa
143:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#008)), the snares of craftily
calculating foes threaten him. Even God's all-seeing eye will not
discover any one who would right faithfully and carefully interest
himself in him. הבּיט, look! is a graphic hybrid form of הבּט and הבּיט,
the usual and the rare imperative form; cf. הביא [Sa1
20:40](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#040) (cf. [Jer
17:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#018)), and the same modes of writing
the inf. absol. in [Jdg 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#028); [Amo
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#008), and the fut. conv. in [Eze
40:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#003). מכּיר is, as in [Rut
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#019), cf. Ps 10, one who looks kindly
upon any one, a considerate (cf. the phrase הכּיר פּנים) well-wisher and
friend. Such an one, if he had one, would be עמד על־ימינו or מימינו
([Psa 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#008)), for an open attack is
directed to the arms-bearing right side ([Psa
109:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#006)), and there too the helper in
battle ([Psa 110:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#005)) and the defender
or advocate ([Psa 109:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#031)) takes his
place in order to cover him who is imperilled ([Psa
121:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#005)). But then if God looks in that
direction, He will find him, who is praying to Him, unprotected. Instead
of ואין one would certainly have sooner expected אשׁר or כי as the form
of introducing the condition in which he is found; but Hitzig's
conjecture, הבּיט ימין וראה, "looking for days and seeing," gives us in
the place of this difficulty a confusing half-Aramaism in ימין = יומין
in the sense of ימים in [Dan 8:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#027);
[Neh 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#004). Ewald's rendering is better:
"though I look to the right hand and see (וראה), yet no friend appears
for me;" but this use of the inf. absol. with an adversative apodosis is
without example. Thus therefore the pointing appears to have lighted
upon the correct idea, inasmuch as it recognises here the current
formula הבּט וּראה, e.g., [Job 35:5](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#005);
[Lam 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#001). The fact that David,
although surrounded by a band of loyal subjects, confesses to having no
true fiend, is to be understood similarly to the language of Paul when
he says in [Phi 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#020) : "I have no man
like-minded." All human love, since sin has taken possession of
humanity, is more or less selfish, and all fellowship of faith and of
love imperfect; and there are circumstances in life in which these dark
sides make themselves felt overpoweringly, so that a man seems to
himself to be perfectly isolated and turns all the more urgently to God,
who alone is able to supply the soul's want of some object to love,
whose love is absolutely unselfish, and unchangeable, and unbeclouded,
to whom the soul can confide without reserve whatever burdens it, and
who not only honestly desires its good, but is able also to compass it
in spite of every obstacle. Surrounded by bloodthirsty enemies, and
misunderstood, or at least not thoroughly understood, by his friends,
David feels himself broken off from all created beings. On this earth
every kind of refuge is for him lost (the expression is like [Job
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#020)). There is no one there who
should ask after or care for his soul, and should right earnestly exert
himself for its deliverance. Thus, then, despairing of all visible
things, he cries to the Invisible One. He is his "refuge" ([Psa
91:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#009)) and his "portion" ([Psa
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#005); [Psa
73:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#026)), i.e., the share in a
possession that satisfies him. To be allowed to call Him his God - this
it is which suffices him and outweighs everything. For Jahve is the
Living One, and he who possesses Him as his own finds himself thereby
"in the land of the living" ([Psa
27:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#013); [Psa
52:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#007)). He cannot die, he cannot
perish.

[Psalms 142:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 142:6</span></span>

His request now ascends all the more confident of being answered, and
becomes calm, being well-grounded in his feebleness and the superiority
of his enemies, and aiming at the glorifying of the divine Name. In [Psa
142:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#007) רנּתי calls to mind [Psa
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#001); the first confirmation, [Psa
79:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#008), and the second, [Psa
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#018). But this is the only passage in
the whole Psalter where the poet designates the "distress" in which he
finds himself as a prison (מסגּר). V. 8b brings the whole congregation
of the righteous in in the praising of the divine Name. The poet
therefore does not after all find himself so absolutely alone, as it
might seem according to [Psa 142:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#005). He
is far from regarding himself as the only righteous person. He is only a
member of a community or church whose destiny is interwoven with his
own, and which will glory in his deliverance as its own; for "if one
member is honoured, all the members rejoice with it" ([Co1
12:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#026)). We understand the differently
interpreted יכתּירוּ after this "rejoicing with" (συγχαίρει). The lxx,
Syriac, and Aquilaz render: the righteous wait for me; but to wait is
כּתּר and not הכתּיר. The modern versions, on the other hand, almost
universally, like Luther after Felix Pratensis, render: the righteous
shall surround me (flock about me), in connection with which, as
Hengstenberg observes, בּי denotes the tender sympathy they fell with
him: crowding closely upon me. But there is no instance of a verb of
surrounding (אפף, סבב, סבב, עוּד, עטר, הקּיף) taking בּ; the accusative
stands with הכתּיר in [Hab 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#004), and
כּתּר in [Psa 22:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#013), in the
signification cingere. Symmachus (although erroneously rendering: τὸ
ὄνομά σου στεφανώσονται δίκαιοι), Jerome (in me coronabuntur justi),
Parchon, Aben-Ezra, Coccejus, and others, rightly take יכתּירוּ as a
denominative from כּתר, to put on a crown or to crown (cf. [Pro
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#018)): on account of me the righteous
shall adorn themselves as with crowns, i.e., shall triumph, that Thou
dealest bountifully with me (an echo of [Psa
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#006)). According to passages like Ps
64:11; [Psa 40:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#017), one might have
expected בּו instead of בּי. But the close of Ps 22 ([Psa
22:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#023).), cf. [Psa
140:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#012)., shows that בי is also
admissible. The very fact that David contemplates his own destiny and
the destiny of his foes in a not merely ideal but foreordainedly causal
connection with the general end of the two powers that stand opposed to
one another in the world, belongs to the characteristic impress of the
Psalms of David that come from the time of Saul's persecution.
