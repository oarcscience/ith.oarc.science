Supplicatory Prayer in a Time of Devastation, of Bloodshed, and of
Derision

This Psalm is in every respect the pendant of Ps 74. The points of
contact are not merely matters of style (cf. [Psa
79:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#005), how long for ever? with [Psa
74:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#001), [Psa
74:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#010); [Psa
79:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#010), יוּדע, with [Psa
74:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#005); [Psa
79:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#002), the giving over to the wild
beasts, with [Psa 74:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#019), [Psa
74:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#014); [Psa
79:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#013), the conception of Israel as of
a flock, in which respect [Psa 79:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#001)
is judiciously appended to [Psa
78:70-72](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#070), with [Psa
74:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#001), and also with [Psa
74:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#019)). But the mutual relationships
lie still deeper. Both Psalms have the same Asaphic stamp, both stand in
the same relation to Jeremiah, and both send forth their complaint out
of the same circumstances of the time, concerning a destruction of the
Temple and of Jerusalem, such as only the age of the Seleucidae (1 Macc.
1:31; 3:45, 2 Macc. 8:3) together with the Chaldaean period

(Note: According to Sofrim xviii. 3, [Psa
79:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#001) and [Psa
137:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#001) are the Psalms for the
Knoth-day, i.e., the 9th day of Ab, the day commemorative of the
Chaldaean and Roman destruction of Jerusalem.)

can exhibit, and in conjunction with a defiling of the Temple and a
massacre of the servants of God, of the Chasdm (1 Macc. 7:13, 2 Macc.
14:6), such as the age of the Seleucidae exclusively can exhibit. The
work of the destruction of the Temple which was in progress in Ps 74,
appears in [Psa 79:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#001) as completed,
and here, as in the former Psalm, one receives the impression of the
outrages, not of some war, but of some persecution: it is straightway
the religion of Israel for the sake of which the sanctuaries are
destroyed and the faithful are massacred.

Apart from other striking accords, [Psa
79:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#006) are repeated verbatim in [Jer
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#025). It is in itself far more
probable that Jeremiah here takes up the earlier language of the Psalm
than that the reverse is the true relation; and, as Hengstenberg has
correctly observed, this is also favoured by the fact that the words
immediately before viz., [Jer 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#024),
originate out of [Psa 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#002), and that
the connection in the Psalm is a far closer one. But since there is no
era of pre-Maccabaean history corresponding to the complaints of the
Psalm,

(Note: Cassiodorus and Bruno observe: deplorat Antiochi persecutionem
tempore Machabeorum factam, tunc futuram. And Notker adds: To those who
have read the First Book of the Maccabees it (viz., the destruction
bewailed in the Psalm) is familiar.)

Jeremiah is to be regarded in this instance as the example of the
psalmist; and in point of fact the borrower is betrayed in [Psa
79:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#006) of the Psalm by the fact that
the correct על of Jeremiah is changed into אל, the more elegant משׁפחות
into ממלכות, and the plural אכלוּ into אכל, and the soaring exuberance
of Jeremiah's expression is impaired by the omission of some of the
words.

[Psalms 79:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 79:1</span></span>

The Psalm begins with a plaintive description, and in fact one that
makes complaint to God. Its opening sounds like [Lam
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#010). The defiling does not exclude
the reducing to ashes, it is rather spontaneously suggested in [Psa
74:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#007) in company with wilful
incendiarism. The complaint in [Psa
79:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#001) reminds one of the prophecy of
Micah, [Mic 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#012), which in its time
excited so much vexation ([Jer 26:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#018));
and [Psa 79:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#002), [Deu
28:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#026). עבדיך confers upon those who
were massacred the honour of martyrdom. The lxx renders לעיים by εἰς
ὀπωροφυλάκιον, a flourish taken from [Isa
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#008). Concerning the quotation from
memory in 1 Macc. 7:16f., vid., the introduction to Ps 74. The
translator of the originally Hebrew First Book of the Maccabees even in
other instances betrays an acquaintance with the Greek Psalter (cf. 1
Macc. 1:37, καὶ ἐξέχεαν αἷμα ἀθῷον κύκλῳ τοῦ ἁγιάσματος). "As water,"
i.e., (cf. [Deu 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#023)) without setting
any value upon it and without any scruple about it. [Psa
44:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#014) is repeated in [Psa
79:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#004). At the time of the Chaldaean
catastrophe this applied more particularly to the Edomites.

[Psalms 79:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 79:5</span></span>

Out of the plaintive question how long? and whether endlessly God would
be angry and cause His jealousy to continue to burn like a fire ([Deu
32:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#022)), grows up the prayer ([Psa
79:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#006)) that He would turn His anger
against the heathen who are estranged from the hostile towards Him, and
of whom He is now making use as a rod of anger against His people. The
taking over of [Psa 79:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#006) from [Jer
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#025) is not betrayed by the looseness
of the connection of thought; but in themselves these four lines sound
much more original in Jeremiah, and the style is exactly that of this
prophet, cf. [Jer 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#011); [Jer
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#003), and frequently, [Psa
49:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#020). The אל, instead of על, which
follows שׁפך is incorrect; the singular אכל gathers all up as in one
mass, as in [Isa 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#026); [Isa
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#013). The fact that such power over
Israel is given to the heathen world has its ground in the sins of
Israel. From [Psa 79:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#008) it may be
inferred that the apostasy which raged earlier is now checked. ראשׁנים
is not an adjective ([Job 31:28](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#028); [Isa
59:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#002)), which would have been expressed
by עונותינו חראשׁנים, but a genitive: the iniquities of the forefathers
([Lev 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#014), cf. [Psa
39:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#001)). On [Psa
79:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#008) of [Jdg
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#006). As is evident from [Psa
79:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#009), the poet does not mean that the
present generation, itself guiltless, has to expiate the guilt of the
fathers (on the contrary, [Deu 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#016);
[Kg2 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#006); [Eze
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#020)); he prays as one of those who
have turned away from the sins of the fathers, and who can now no longer
consider themselves as placed under wrath, but under sin-pardoning and
redeeming grace.

[Psalms 79:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 79:9</span></span>

The victory of the world is indeed not God's aim; therefore His own
honour does not suffer that the world of which He has made use in order
to chasten His people should for ever haughtily triumph. שׁמך is
repeated with emphasis at the end of the petition in [Psa
79:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#009), according to the figure
epanaphora. על־דּבר = למען, as in [Psa
45:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#005), cf. [Psa
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#001), is a usage even of the language
of the Pentateuch. Also the motive, "wherefore shall they say?" occurs
even in the Tפra ([Exo 32:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#012), cf. [Num
14:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#013); [Deu
9:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#028)). Here (cf. [Psa
115:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#002)) it originates out of [Joe
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#017). The wish expressed in [Psa
79:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#010) is based upon [Deu
32:43](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#043). The poet wishes in company with
his contemporaries, as eye-witnesses, to experience what God has
promised in the early times, viz., that He will avenge the blood of His
servants. The petition in [Deu 32:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#011)
runs like [Psa 102:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#021), cf. [Psa
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#007). אסיר individualizingly is those
who are carried away captive and incarcerated; בּני תמוּתה are those
who, if God does not preserve them by virtue of the greatness (גדל, cf.
גּדל [Exo 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#016)) of His arm, i.e., of
His far-reaching omnipotence, succumb to the power of death as to a
patria potestas.

(Note: The Arabic has just this notion in an active application, viz.,
benı̂ el-môt = the heroes (destroyers) in the battle.)

That the petition in [Psa 79:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#012) recurs
to the neighbouring peoples is explained by the fact, that these, who
might most readily come to the knowledge of the God of Israel as the one
living and true God, have the greatest degree of guilt on account of
their reviling of God. The bosom is mentioned as that in which one takes
up and holds that which is handed to him ([Luk
6:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#038)); חיק- (על) אל (שׁלּם) השׁיב, as
in [Isa 65:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#007), [Isa
65:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#006); [Jer
32:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#018). A sevenfold requital (cf. [Gen
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#015), [Gen
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#024)) is a requital that is fully
carried out as a criminal sentence, for seven is the number of a
completed process.

[Psalms 79:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 79:13</span></span>

If we have thus far correctly hit upon the parts of which the Psalm is
composed (9. 9. 9), then the lamentation closes with this tristichic vow
of thanksgiving.
