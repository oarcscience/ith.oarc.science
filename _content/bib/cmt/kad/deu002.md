### [Deuteronomy Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#001)

[Deuteronomy 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 2:1</span></span>

March from Kadesh to the Frontier of the Amorites. - [Deu
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#001). After a long stay in Kadesh, they
commenced their return into the desert. The words, "We departed...by the
way to the Red Sea," point back to [Num
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#025). This departure is expressly
designated as an act of obedience to the divine command recorded there,
by the expression "as Jehovah spake to me." Consequently Moses is not
speaking here of the second departure of the congregation from Kadesh to
go to Mount Hor ([Num 20:22](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#022)), but of
the first departure after the condemnation of the generation that came
out of Egypt. "And we went round Mount Seir many days." This going round
Mount Seir includes the thirty-eight years' wanderings, though we are
not therefore to picture it as "going backwards and forwards, and then
entering the Arabah again" (Schultz). Just as Moses passed over the
reassembling of the congregation at Kadesh ([Num
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#001)), so he also overlooked the going
to and fro in the desert, and fixed his eye more closely upon the last
journey from Kadesh to Mount Hor, that he might recall to the memory of
the congregation how the Lord had led them to the end of all their
wandering.

[Deu 2:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#002)

When they had gone through the Arabah to the southern extremity, the
Lord commanded them to turn northwards, i.e., to go round the southern
end of Mount Seir, and proceed northwards on the eastern side of it (see
at [Num 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#010)), without going to war
with the Edomites (התגּרה, to stir oneself up against a person to
conflict, מלחמה), as He would not give them a foot-breadth of their
land; for He had given Esau (the Edomites) Mount Seir for a possession.
For this reason they were to buy victuals and water of them for money
(כּרה, to dig, to dig water, i.e., procure water, as it was often
necessary to dig wells, and not merely to draw it, [Gen
26:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#025). The verb כּרה does not signify
to buy).

[Deu 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#007)

And this they were able to do, because the Lord had blessed them in all
the work of their hand, i.e., not merely in the rearing of flocks and
herds, which they had carried on in the desert ([Exo
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#013); [Exo
34:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#003); [Num
20:19](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#019); [Num
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#001).), but in all that they did for a
living; whether, for example, when stopping for a long time in the same
place of encampment, they sowed in suitable spots and reaped, or whether
they sold the produce of their toil and skill to the Arabs of the
desert. "He hath observed thy going through this great desert" (ידע, to
know, then to trouble oneself, [Gen
39:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#006); to observe carefully, [Pro
27:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#023); [Psa
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#006)); and He has not suffered thee to
want anything for forty years, but as often as want has occurred, He has
miraculously provided for every necessity.

[Deu 2:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#008)

In accordance with this divine command, they went past the Edomites by
the side of their mountains, "from the way of the Arabah, from Elath
(see at [Gen 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#006)) and Eziongeber"
(see at [Num 33:35](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#035)), sc., into the
steppes of Moab, where they were encamped at that time.

God commanded them to behave in the same manner towards the Moabites,
when they approached their frontier ([Deu
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#009)). They were not to touch their
land, because the Lord had given Ar to the descendants of Lot for a
possession. In [Deu 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#009) the Moabites
are mentioned, and in [Deu 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#019) the
Amorites also. The Moabites are designated as "sons of Lot," for the
same reason for which the Edomites are called "brethren of Israel" in
[Deu 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#004). The Israelites were to
uphold the bond of blood-relationship with these tribes in the most
sacred manner. Ar, the capital of Moabitis (see at [Num
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#015)), is used here for the land
itself, which was named after the capital, and governed by it.

[Deu 2:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#011)

To confirm the fact that the Moabites and also the Edomites had received
from God the land which they inhabited as a possession, Moses
interpolates into the words of Jehovah certain ethnographical notices
concerning the earlier inhabitants of these lands, from which it is
obvious that Edom and Moab had not destroyed them by their own power,
but that Jehovah had destroyed them before them, as is expressly stated
in [Deu 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#021), [Deu
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#022). "The Emim dwelt formerly
therein," sc., in Ar and its territory, in Moabitis, "a high (i.e.,
strong) and numerous people, of gigantic stature, which were also
reckoned among the Rephaites, like the Enakites (Anakim)." Emim, i.e.,
frightful, terrible, was the name given to them by the Moabites. Whether
this earlier or original population of Moabitis was of Hamitic or
Semitic descent cannot be determined, any more than the connection
between the Emim and the Rephaim can be ascertained. On the Rephaim; and
on the Anakites, at [Num 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#022).

[Deu 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#012)

The origin of the Horites (i.e., the dwellers in caves) of Mount Seir,
who were driven out of their possessions by the descendants of Esau, and
completely exterminated (see at [Gen
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#006), and [Gen
36:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#020)), is altogether involved in
obscurity. The words, "as Israel has done to the land of his possession,
which Jehovah has given them," do not presuppose the conquest of the
land of Canaan or a post-Mosaic authorship; but "the land of his
possession" is the land to the east of the Jordan (Gilead and Bashan),
which was conquered by the Israelites under Moses, and divided among the
two tribes and a half, and which is also described in [Deu
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#020) as the "possession" which Jehovah
had given to these tribes.

[Deu 2:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#013)

For this reason Israel was to remove from the desert of Moab (i.e., the
desert which bounded Moabitis on the east), and to cross over the brook
Zered, to advance against the country of the Amorites (see at [Num
21:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#012)). This occurred thirty-eight
years after the condemnation of the people at Kadesh ([Num
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#023), [Num
14:29](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#029)), when the generation rejected
by God had entirely died out (תּמם, to be all gone, to disappear), so
that not one of them saw the promised land. They did not all die a
natural death, however, but "the hand of the Lord was against them to
destroy them" (המם, lit., to throw into confusion, then used with
special reference to the terrors with which Jehovah destroyed His
enemies; [Exo 14:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#024); [Exo
23:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#027), etc.), sc., by extraordinary
judgments (as in [Num 16:35](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#035); [Num
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#001); [Num
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#006); [Num
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#009)).

[Deu 2:16-22](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#016)

When this generation had quite died out, the Lord made known to Moses,
and through him to the people, that they were to cross over the boundary
of Moab (i.e., the Arnon, [Deu 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#024);
see at [Num 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#013)), the land of Ar
(see at [Deu 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#009)), "to come nigh over
against the children of Ammon," i.e., to advance into the neighbourhood
of the Ammonites, who lived to the east of Moab; but they were not to
meddle with these descendants of Lot, because He would give them nothing
of the land that was given them for a possession ([Deu
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#019), as at [Deu
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#005) and [Deu
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#009)). - To confirm this,
ethnographical notices are introduced again in [Deu
2:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#020) into the words of God (as in
[Deu 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#010), [Deu
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#011)), concerning the earlier
population of the country of the Ammonites. Ammonitis was also regarded
as a land of the Rephaites, because Rephaites dwelt therein, whom the
Ammonites called Zamzummim. "Zamzummim," from זמם, to hum, then to muse,
equivalent to the humming or roaring people, probably the same people as
the Zuzim mentioned in [Gen 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#005). This
giant tribe Jehovah had destroyed before the Ammonites ([Deu
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#022)), just as He had done for the
sons of Esau dwelling upon Mount Seir, namely, destroyed the Horites
before them, so that the Edomites "dwelt in their stead, even unto this
day."

[Deu 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#023)

As the Horites had been exterminated by the Edomites, so were the
Avvaeans (Avvim), who dwelt in farms (villages) at the south-west corner
of Canaan, as far as Gaza, driven out of their possessions and
exterminated by the Caphtorites, who sprang from Caphtor (see at [Gen
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#014)), although, according to [Jos
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#003), some remnants of them were to be
found among the Philistines even at that time. This notice appears to be
attached to the foregoing remarks simply on account of the substantial
analogy between them, without there being any intention to imply that
the Israelites were to assume the same attitude towards the Caphtorites,
who afterwards rose up in the persons of the Philistines, as towards the
descendants of Esau and Lot.

[Deuteronomy 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">deu 2:24</span></span>

The Help of God in the Conquest of the Kingdom of Sihon. - [Deu
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#024). Whereas the Israelites were not
to make war upon the kindred tribes of Edomites, Moabites, and
Ammonites, or drive them out of the possessions given to them by God;
the Lord had given the Amorites, who had forced as way into Gilead and
Bashan, into their hands.

[Deu 2:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#024)

While they were encamped on the Arnon, the border of the Amoritish king
of Sihon, He directed them to cross this frontier and take possession of
the land of Sihon, and promised that He would give this king with all
his territory into their hands, and that henceforward ("this day," the
day on which Israel crossed the Arnon) He would put fear and terror of
Israel upon all nations under the whole heaven, so that as soon as they
heard the report of Israel they would tremble and writhe before them.
רשׁ החל, "begin, take," an oratorical expression for "begin to take"
(רשׁ in pause for רשׁ, [Deu 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#021)). The
expression, "all nations under the whole heaven," is hyperbolical; it is
not to be restricted, however, to the Canaanites and other neighbouring
tribes, but, according to what follows, to be understood as referring to
all nations to whom the report of the great deeds of the Lord upon and
on behalf of Israel should reach (cf. [Deu
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#025) and [Exo
23:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#027)). אשׁר, so that (as in [Gen
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#007); [Gen
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#016); [Gen
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#014)). וחלוּ, with the accent upon
the last syllable, on account of the ו consec. (Ewald, 234, a.), from
חוּל, to twist, or writhe with pain, here with anxiety.

[Deu 2:26-30](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#026)

If Moses, notwithstanding this, sent messengers to king Sihon with words
of peace ([Deu 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#026).; cf. [Num
21:21](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#021).), this was done to show the
king of the Amorites, that it was through his own fault that his kingdom
and lands and life were lost. The wish to pass through his land in a
peaceable manner was quite seriously expressed; although Moses foresaw,
in consequence of the divine communication, that he would reject his
proposal, and meet Israel with hostilities. For Sihon's kingdom did not
form part of the land of Canaan, which God had promised to the
patriarchs for their descendants; and the divine foreknowledge of the
hardness of Sihon no more destroyed the freedom of his will to resolve,
or the freedom of his actions, than the circumstance that in [Deu
2:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#030) the unwillingness of Sihon is
described as the effect of his being hardened by God Himself. The
hardening was quite as much the production of human freedom and guilt,
as the consequence of the divine decree; just as in the case of Pharaoh.
On Kedemoth, see [Num 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#013). בּדּרך
בּדּרך, equivalent to "upon the way, and always upon the way," i.e.,
upon the high road alone, as in [Num
20:19](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#019). On the behaviour of the
Edomites towards Israel, mentioned in [Deu
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#029), see [Num
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#010). In the same way the Moabites
also supplied Israel with provisions for money. This statement is not at
variance with the unbrotherly conduct for which the Moabites are blamed
in [Deu 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#004), viz., that they did not
meet the Israelites with bread and water. For קדּם, to meet and
anticipate, signifies a hospitable reception, and the offering of food
and drink without reward, which is essentially different from selling
for money. "In Ar" ([Deu 2:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#029)), as in
[Deu 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#018). The suffix in בּו ([Deu
2:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#030)) refers to the king, who is
mentioned as the lord of the land, in the place of the land itself, just
as in [Num 20:18](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#018).

[Deu 2:31](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#031)

The refusal of Sihon was suspended over him by God as a judgment of
hardening, which led to his destruction. "As this day," an abbreviation
of "as it has happened this day," i.e., as experience has now shown (cf.
[Deu 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#020), etc.).

[Deu 2:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#032)

Defeat of Sihon, as already described in the main in [Num
21:23-26](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#023). The war was a war of
extermination, in which all the towns were laid under the ban (see [Lev
27:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#029)), i.e., the whole of the
population of men, women, and children were put to death, and only the
flocks and herds and material possessions were taken by the conquerors
as prey.

[Deu 2:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#034)

מתם עיר (city of men) is the town population of men.

[Deu 2:36](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#036)

They proceeded this way with the whole of the kingdom of Sihon. "From
Aror on the edge of the Arnon valley (see at [Num
32:34](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#034)), and, in fact, from the city
which is in the valley," i.e., Ar, or Areopolis (see at [Num
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#015)), - Aror being mentioned as the
inclusive terminus a quo of the land that was taken, and the Moabitish
capital Ar as the exclusive terminus, as in [Jos
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#009) and [Jos
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#016); "and as far as Gilead," which
rises on the north, near the Jabbok (or Zerka, see at [Deu
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#004)), "there was no town too high for
us," i.e., so strong that we could not take it.

[Deu 2:37](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#037)

Only along the land of the Ammonites the Israelites did not come,
namely, along the whole of the side of the brook Jabbok, or the country
of the Ammonites, which was situated upon the eastern side of the upper
Jabbok, and the towns of the mountain, i.e., of the Ammonitish
highlands, and "to all that the Lord had commanded," sc., commanded them
not to remove. The statement, in [Jos
13:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#025), that the half of the country of
the Ammonites was given to the tribe of Gad, is not at variance with
this; for the allusion there is to that portion of the land of the
Ammonites which was between the Arnon and the Jabbok, and which had
already been taken from the Ammonites by the Amorites under Sihon (cf.
[Jdg 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#013).).
