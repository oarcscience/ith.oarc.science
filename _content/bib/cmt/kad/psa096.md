[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

A Greeting of the Coming Kingdom of God

What [Psa 95:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#003) says: "A great God is
Jahve, and a great King above all gods," is repeated in [Psa
96:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001). The lxx inscribes it (1) ᾠδὴ
τῷ Δαυίδ, and the chronicler has really taken it up almost entire in the
song which was sung on the day when the Ark was brought in ([Ch1
16:23-33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#023)); but, as the coarse seams
between vv. 22-23, vv. 33-34 show, he there strings together familiar
reminiscences of the Psalms (vid., on Ps 105) as a sort of mosaic, in
order approximately to express the festive mood and festive strains of
that day. And (2) ὅτε ὁ οἶκος ᾠκοδομεῖτο (Cod. Vat. ᾠκοδόμηται) μετὰ τὴν
αἰχμαλωσίαν. By this the lxx correctly interprets the Psalm as a
post-exilic song: and the Psalm corresponds throughout to the advance
which the mind of Israel has experienced in the Exile concerning its
mission in the world. The fact that the religion of Jahve is destined
for mankind at large, here receives the most triumphantly joyous,
lyrical expression. And so far as this is concerned, the key-note of the
Psalm is even deutero-Isaianic. For it is one chief aim of [Isa
40:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#001) to declare the pinnacle of glory
of the Messianic apostolic mission on to which Israel is being raised
through the depth of affliction of the Exile. All these post-exilic
songs come much nearer to the spirit of the New Testament than the
pre-exilic; for the New Testament, which is the intrinsic character of
the Old Testament freed from its barriers and limitations, is in process
of coming into being (im Werden begriffen) throughout the Old Testament,
and the Exile was one of the most important crises in this progressive
process.

[Psa 96:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001) are more Messianic than many
in the strict sense of the word Messianic; for the central (gravitating)
point of the Old Testament gospel (Heilsverk@fcndigung) lies not in the
Messiah, but in the appearing (parusia) of Jahve - a fact which is
explained by the circumstance that the mystery of the incarnation still
lies beyond the Old Testament knowledge or perception of salvation. All
human intervention in the matter of salvation accordingly appears as
purely human, and still more, it preserves a national and therefore
outward and natural impress by virtue of the national limit within which
the revelation of salvation has entered. If the ideal Davidic king who
is expected even does anything superhuman, he is nevertheless only a man
- a man of God, it is true, without his equal, but not the God-man. The
mystery of the incarnation does, it is true, the nearer it comes to
actual revelation, cast rays of its dawning upon prophecy, but the sun
itself remains below the horizon: redemption is looked for as Jahve's
own act, and "Jahve cometh" is also still the watchword of the last
prophet ([Mal 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001)).

The five six-line strophes of the Psalm before us are not to be
mistaken. The chronicler has done away with five lines, and thereby
disorganized the strophic structure; and one line ([Psa
96:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#010)) he has removed from its
position. The originality of the Psalm in the Psalter, too, is revealed
thereby, and the non-independence of the chronicler, who treats the
Psalm as an historian.

[Psalms 96:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 96:1</span></span>

Call to the nation of Jahve to sing praise to its God and to evangelize
the heathen. שׁירוּ is repeated three times. The new song assumes a new
form of things, and the call thereto, a present which appeared to be a
beginning that furnished a guarantee of this new state of things, a
beginning viz., of the recognition of Jahve throughout the whole world
of nations, and of His accession to the lordship over the whole earth.
The new song is an echo of the approaching revelation of salvation and
of glory, and this is also the inexhaustible material of the joyful
tidings that go forth from day to day (מיּום ליום as in [Est
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#007), whereas in the Chronicles it is
מיום אל־יום as in [Num 30:15](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#015)). We read
[Psa 96:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001) verbally the same in [Isa
42:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#010); [Psa
96:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#002) calls to mind [Isa
52:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#007); [Isa
60:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#006); and [Psa
96:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#003), [Isa
66:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#019).

[Psalms 96:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 96:4</span></span>

Confirmation of the call from the glory of Jahve that is now become
manifest. The clause [Psa 96:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#004), as
also [Psa 145:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#003), is taken out of [Psa
48:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#002). כל־אלהים is the plural of
כּל־אלוהּ, every god, [Ch2 32:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#015); the
article may stand here or be omitted ([Psa
95:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#003), cf. [Psa
113:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#004)). All the elohim, i.e., gods, of
the peoples are אלילים (from the negative אל), nothings and
good-for-nothings, unreal and useless. The lxx renders δαιμόνια, as
though the expression were שׁדים (cf. [Co1
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#020)), more correctly εἴδωλα in [Rev
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#020). What [Psa
96:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#005) says is wrought out in Isa 40,
Isa 44, and elsewhere; אלילים is a name of idols that occurs nowhere
more frequently than in Isaiah. The sanctuary ([Psa
96:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#006)) is here the earthly sanctuary.
From Jerusalem, over which the light arises first of all (Isa. 60),
Jahve's superterrestrial doxa now reveals itself in the world. הוד־והדר
is the usual pair of words for royal glory. The chronicler reads [Psa
96:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#006) עז וחדוה בּמקמו, might and joy
are in His place (הדוה( ecalp siH ni era yoj d a late word, like אחוה,
brotherhood, brotherly affection, from an old root, [Exo
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#009)). With the place of God one might
associate the thought of the celestial place of God transcending space;
the chronicler may, however, have altered במקדשׁו into במקמו because
when the Ark was brought in, the Temple (בית המקדשׁ) was not yet built.

[Psalms 96:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 96:7</span></span>

Call to the families of the peoples to worship God, the One, living, and
glorious God. הבוּ is repeated three times here as [Psa
29:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#001), of which the whole strophe is
an echo. Isaiah (ch. 60) sees them coming in with the gifts which they
are admonished to bring with them into the courts of Jahve (in Chr.
only: לפניו). Instead of בּהדרת קדשׁ here and in the chronicler, the lxx
brings the courts (חצרת) in once more; but the dependence of the strophe
upon [Psa 29:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#001) furnishes a
guarantee for the "holy attire," similar to the wedding garment in the
New Testament parable. Instead of מפּניו, [Psa
96:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#009), the chronicler has מלּפניו, just
as he also alternates with both forms, [Ch2
32:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#007), cf. [Ch1
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#018).

[Psalms 96:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 96:10</span></span>

That which is to be said among the peoples is the joyous evangel of the
kingdom of heaven which is now come and realized. The watchword is
"Jahve is King," as in [Isa 52:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#007). The
lxx correctly renders: ὁ κύριος ἐβασίλευσε

(Note: In the Psalterium Veronense with the addition apo xylu, Cod. 156,
Latinizing ἀπὸ τῷ ξύλῳ; in the Latin Psalters (the Vulgate excepted) a
ligno, undoubtedly an addition by an early Christian hand, upon which,
however, great value is set by Justin and all the early Latin Fathers.)

for מלך is intended historically ([Rev
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#017)). אף, as in [Psa
93:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#001), introduces that which results
from this fact, and therefore to a certain extent goes beyond it. The
world below, hitherto shaken by war and anarchy, now stands upon
foundations that cannot be shaken in time to come, under Jahve's
righteous and gentle sway. This is the joyful tidings of the new era
which the poet predicts from out of his own times, when he depicts the
joy that will then pervade the whole creation; in connection with which
it is hardly intentional that [Psa
96:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#011) and [Psa
96:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#011) acrostically contain the divine
names יהוה and יהו. This joining of all creatures in the joy at Jahve's
appearing is a characteristic feature of [Isa
40:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#001). These cords are already struck
in [Isa 35:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#001). "The sea and its
fulness" as in [Isa 42:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#010). In the
chronicler [Psa 96:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#010) (ויאמרו instead
of אמרו) stands between [Psa 96:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#011) and
[Psa 96:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#011) - according to Hitzig, who
uses all his ingenuity here in favour of that other recension of the
text, by an oversight of the copyist.

[Psalms 96:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 96:12</span></span>

The chronicler changes שׂדי into the prosaic השּׂדה, and כל־עצי־יעל with
the omission of the כל into עצי היּער. The psalmist on his part follows
the model of Isaiah, who makes the trees of the wood exult and clap
their hands, [Psa 55:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#012); [Psa
44:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#023). The אז, which points into this
festive time of all creatures which begins with Jahve's coming, is as in
[Isa 35:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#005). Instead of לפני, "before,"
the chronicler has the מלּפני so familiar to him, by which the joy is
denoted as being occasioned by Jahve's appearing. The lines [Psa
96:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#013) sound very much like [Psa
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#009). The chronicler has abridged [Psa
96:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#013), by hurrying on to the
mosaic-work portion taken from Ps 105. The poet at the close glances
from the ideal past into the future. The twofold בּא is a participle,
Ew. 200. Being come to judgment, after He has judged and sifted,
executing punishment, Jahve will govern in the righteousness of mercy
and in faithfulness to the promises.
