<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#001">Ch2 4:1-6</A>. The copper furniture of the court. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#001">Ch2 4:1</A>. The altar of burnt-offering. Its preparation is passed over in 1 Kings 6 and 7, so that there it is only mentioned incidentally in connection with the consecration of the temple, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#022">Kg1 8:22</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#054">Kg1 8:54</A>, and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#025">Kg1 9:25</A>. It was twenty cubits square (long and broad) and ten cubits high, and constructed on the model of the Mosaic altar of burnt-offering, and probably of brass plates, which enclosed the inner core, consisting of earth and unhewn stones; and if we may judge from Ezekiel's description, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#013">Eze 43:13-17</A>, it rose in steps, as it were, so that at each step its extent was smaller; and the measurement of twenty cubits refers only to the lowest scale, while the space at the top, with the hearth, was only twelve cubits square; cf. my Bibl. Archaeol. i. S. 127, with the figure, plate iii. fig. 2.

<p>The brazen sea described as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#023">Kg1 7:23-26</A>. See the commentary on that passage, and the sketch in my Archaeol. i. plate iii. fig. 1. The differences in substance, such as the occurrence of &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#003">Ch2 4:3</A>, instead of &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501;, and 3000 baths instead of 2000, are probably the result of orthographical errors in the Chronicle. &#1497;&#1499;&#1497;&#1500; in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#005">Ch2 4:5</A> appears superfluous after the preceding &#1502;&#1495;&#1494;&#1497;&#1511;, and Berth. considers it a gloss which has come from 1 Kings into our text by mistake. But the expression is only pleonastic: "receiving baths, 3000 it held;" and there is no sufficient reason to strike out the words. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#006">2 Chronicles 4:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">ch2 4:6</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The ten lavers which, according to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#038">Kg1 7:38</A>, stood upon ten brazen stands, i.e., chests provided with carriage wheels. These stands, the artistic work on which is circumstantially described in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#027">Kg1 7:27-37</A>, are omitted in the Chronicle, because they are merely subordinate parts of the lavers. The size or capacity of the lavers is not stated, only their position on both sides of the temple porch, and the purpose for which they were designed, "to wash therein, viz., the work of the burnt-offering (the flesh of the burnt-offering which was to be burnt upon the altar) they rinsed therein," being mentioned. For details, see in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#038">Kg1 7:38</A>. and the figure in my Archaol. i. plate iii. fig. 4. Occasion is here taken to mention in a supplementary way the use of the brazen sea. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#007">2 Chronicles 4:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">ch2 4:7</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The golden furniture of the holy place and the courts. These three verses are not found in the parallel narrative 1 Kings 7, where in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#039">Kg1 7:39</A> the statement as to the position of the brazen sea (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#010">Ch2 4:10</A>) follows immediately the statement of the position of the stands with the lavers. The candlesticks and the table of the shew-bread are indeed mentioned in the summary enumeration of the temple furniture, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#048">Kg1 7:48</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#049">Kg1 7:49</A>, as in the corresponding passage of the Chronicle (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#019">Ch2 4:19</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#020">Ch2 4:20</A>) they again occur; and in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#036">Kg1 6:36</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#012">Kg1 7:12</A>, in the description of the temple building, the inner court is spoken of, but the outer court is not expressly mentioned. No reason can be given for the omission of these verses in 1 Kings 7; but that they have been omitted or have dropped out, may be concluded from the fact that not only do the whole contents of our fourth chapter correspond to the section 1 Kings 7:23-50, but both passages are rounded off by the same concluding verse (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#001">Ch2 5:1</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#051">Kg1 7:51</A>).
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#007">Ch2 4:7</A>
<p>He made ten golden candlesticks &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1501;, according to their right, i.e., as they should be according to the prescript, or corresponding to the prescript as to the golden candlesticks in the Mosaic sanctuary (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#031">Exo 25:31</A>.). &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; is the law established by the Mosaic legislation.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#008">Ch2 4:8</A>
<p>Ten golden tables, corresponding to the ten candlesticks, and, like these, placed five on the right and five on the left side of the holy place. The tables were not intended to bear the candlesticks (Berth.), but for the shew-bread; cf. on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#019">Ch2 4:19</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#016">Ch1 28:16</A>. And a hundred golden basins, not for the catching and sprinkling of the blood (Berth.), but, as their connection with the tables for the shew-bread shows, wine flagons, or sacrificial vessels for wine libations, probably corresponding to the &#1502;&#1504;&#1511;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; on the table of shew-bread in the tabernacle (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#029">Exo 25:29</A>). The signification, wine flagons, for &#1502;&#1494;&#1512;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501;, is placed beyond a doubt by <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#006">Amo 6:6</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#009">2 Chronicles 4:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">ch2 4:9</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The two courts are not further described. For the court of the priests, see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#036">Kg1 6:36</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#012">Kg1 7:12</A>. As to the great or outer court, the only remark made is that it had doors, and its doors, i.e., the folds or leaves of the doors, were overlaid with copper. In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#010">Ch2 4:10</A> we have a supplementary statement as to the position of the brazen sea, which coincides with <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#039">Kg1 7:39</A>; see on the passage. In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#011">Ch2 4:11</A> the heavier brazen (copper) utensils, belonging to the altar of burnt-offering, are mentioned: &#1505;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514;, pots for the removal of the ashes; &#1497;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;, shovels, to take the ashes out from the altar; and &#1502;&#1494;&#1512;&#1511;&#1493;&#1514;, basins to catch and sprinkle the sacrificial blood. This half verse belongs to the preceding, notwithstanding that Huram is mentioned as the maker. This is clear beyond doubt, from the fact that the same utensils are again introduced in the summary catalogue which follows (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#016">Ch2 4:16</A>). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#011">2 Chronicles 4:11</A></p>

<p>Summary catalogue of the temple utensils and furniture. - <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#011">Ch2 4:11-18</A>. The brass work wrought by Huram.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">ch2 4:19</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The golden furniture of the holy place and the gilded doors of the temple. This section is found also in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#040">Kg1 7:40-50</A>. The enumeration of the things wrought in brass coincides to a word, with the exception of trifling linguistic differences and some defects in the text, with <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#040">Kg1 7:40-47</A>. In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#012">Ch2 4:12</A> &#1493;&#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; is the true reading, and we should so read in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#041">Kg1 7:41</A> also, since the &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, circumvolutions, are to be distinguished from the &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, crowns; see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#016">Ch2 3:16</A>. In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#014">Ch2 4:14</A> the first &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; is a mistake for &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;, the second for &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1492;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#043">Kg1 7:43</A>; for the verb &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; is not required nor expected, as the accusative depends upon &#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#011">Ch2 4:11</A>, while the number cannot be omitted, since it is always given with the other things. In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#016">Ch2 4:16</A> &#1502;&#1494;&#1500;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; is an orthographic error for &#1502;&#1494;&#1512;&#1511;&#1493;&#1514;; cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#011">Ch2 4:11</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#044">Kg1 7:44</A>. &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1495;&#1501; is surprising, for there is no meaning in speaking of the utensils of the utensils enumerated in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#012">Ch2 4:12-16</A>. According to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#045">Kg1 7:45</A>, we should read &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1514;. As to &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1493;, see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#012">Ch2 2:12</A>. &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511; &#1504;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; is accusative of the material, of polished brass; and so also &#1502;&#1502;&#1512;&#1496; &#1504;&#1495;,   <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#045">Kg1 7:45</A>, with a similar signification. In reference to the rest, see the commentary on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#040">Kg1 7:40</A>.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#019">Ch2 4:19-21</A>
<p>In the enumeration of the golden furniture of the holy place, our text diverges somewhat more from <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#048">Kg1 7:48-50</A>. On the difference in respect to the tables of the shew-bread, see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#048">Kg1 7:48</A>. In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#020">Ch2 4:20</A> the number and position of the candlesticks in the holy place are not stated as they are in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#049">Kg1 7:49</A>, both having been already given in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#007">Ch2 4:7</A>. Instead of that, their use is emphasized: to light them, according to the right, before the most holy place (&#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#007">Ch2 4:7</A>). As to the decorations and subordinate utensils of the candlesticks, see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#049">Kg1 7:49</A>. To &#1494;&#1492;&#1489;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#021">Ch2 4:21</A> (accus. of the material), is added &#1494;&#1492;&#1489; &#1502;&#1499;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, "that is perfect gold." &#1502;&#1499;&#1500;&#1492;, which occurs only here, is synonymous with &#1502;&#1499;&#1500;&#1500;, perfection. This addition seems superfluous, because before and afterwards it is remarked of these vessels that they were of precious gold (&#1505;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; &#1494;&#1492;&#1489;), and it is consequently omitted by the lxx, perhaps also because &#1502;&#1499;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; was not intelligible to them. The words, probably, are meant to indicate that even the decorations and the subordinate utensils of the candlesticks (lamps, snuffers, etc.) were of solid gold, and not merely gilded.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#022">Ch2 4:22</A>
<p>&#1502;&#1494;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, knives, probably used along with the snuffers for the cleansing and trimming of the candlesticks and lamps, are not met with among the utensils of the tabernacle, but are here mentioned (Chr. and Kings), and in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#014">Kg2 12:14</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#018">Jer 52:18</A>, among the temple utensils. Along with the &#1502;&#1494;&#1512;&#1511;&#1493;&#1514;, sacrificial vessels (see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#008">Ch2 4:8</A>), in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#017">Ch1 28:17</A> &#1502;&#1494;&#1500;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;, forks of gold, are also mentioned, which are not elsewhere spoken of. Among the utensils of the tabernacle we find only &#1502;&#1494;&#1500;&#1490;&#1493;&#1514; of brass, flesh-forks, as an appurtenance of the altar of burnt-offering (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#003">Exo 27:3</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#003">Exo 38:3</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#014">Num 4:14</A>; cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#013">Sa1 2:13</A>.), which, however, cannot be intended here, because all the utensils here enumerated belonged to the holy place. What purpose the golden forks served cannot be determined, but the mention of golden knives might lead us to presuppose that there would be golden forks as well. That the forks are not mentioned in our verse does not render their existence doubtful, for the enumeration is not complete: e.g., the &#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;,   <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#050">Kg1 7:50</A>, are also omitted. &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, vessels for the incense, and &#1502;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, extinguishers, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#050">Kg1 7:50</A>. Instead of &#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493; &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495; &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; , "and as regards the opening (door) of the house, its door-leaves," in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#050">Kg1 7:50</A> we have &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1500;&#1491;&#1500;&#1514;&#1493;&#1514; &#1493;&#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1514;, "and the hinges of the door-leaves of the house." This suggests that &#1508;&#1514;&#1495; is only an orthographical error for &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1514;; but then if we take it to be so, we must alter &#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493; into &#1500;&#1491;&#1500;&#1514;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493;. And, moreover, the expression &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1514;, door-hinges of the house, is strange, as &#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; properly denotes a recess or space between, and which renders the above-mentioned conjecture improbable. The author of the Chronicle seems rather himself to have generalized the expression, and emphasizes merely the fact that even the leaves of the doors in the most holy place and on the holy place were of gold; - of course not of solid gold; but they were, as we learn from <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#007">Ch2 3:7</A>, overlaid with gold. This interpretation is favoured by the simple &#1494;&#1492;&#1489; being used without the predicate &#1505;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;. To the sing. &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495; no objection can be made, for the word in its fundamental signification, "opening," may easily be taken collectively.
