<p>Moses then summoned the master-builders named, and all who were skilled in art, "every one whom his heart lifted up to come near to the work to do it" (i.e., who felt himself stirred up in heart to take part in the work), and handed over to them the heaven-offering presented by the people for that purpose, whilst the children of Israel still continued bringing freewill-offerings every morning. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#004">Exodus 36:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">exo 36:4</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Then the wise workmen came, every one from his work that they were making, and said to Moses, "Much make the people to bring, more than suffices for the labour (the finishing, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#019">Exo 27:19</A>) of the work," i.e., they are bringing more than will be wanted for carrying out the work (the &#1502;&#1503; in &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497; is comparative); whereupon Moses let the cry go through the camp, i.e., had proclamation made, "No one is to make any more property (&#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1499;&#1492; as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#007">Exo 22:7</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#010">Exo 22:10</A>, cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#014">Gen 33:14</A>) for a holy heave-offering," i.e., to prepare anything more from his own property to offer for the building of the sanctuary; and with this he put a stop to any further offerings. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#007">Exodus 36:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">exo 36:7</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>"And there was enough (&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501; their sufficiency, i.e., the requisite supply for the different things to be made) of the property for every work to make it, and over" (lit., and to leave some over). By this liberal contribution of freewill gifts, for the work commanded by the Lord, the people proved their willingness to uphold their covenant relationship with Jehovah their God. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#008">Exodus 36:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">exo 36:8</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Ex 36:8-38:20. Execution of the Work. - Preparation of the dwelling-place: viz., the hangings and covering (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#008">Exo 36:8-19</A>, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#001">Exo 26:1-14</A>); the wooden boards and bolts (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#020">Exo 36:20-34</A>, as in Ex 26:15-30); the two curtains, with the pillars, hooks, and rods that supported them (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#035">Exo 36:35-38</A>, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#031">Exo 26:31-37</A>). As these have all been already explained, the only thing remaining to be noticed here is, that the verbs &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#008">Exo 36:8</A>, &#1493;&#1497;&#1495;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#010">Exo 36:10</A>, etc., are in the third person singular with an indefinite subject, corresponding to the German man (the French on).
