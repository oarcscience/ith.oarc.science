a pomegranate: The word rimmon, in Arabic romman, whence the Portuguese
romaa, denotes the pomegranate, both tree and fruit; called by
naturalists malus punica or malo-granatum. It is, according to the
Linnean system, a genus of the icosandria monogynia class of plants; and
is a low tree, growing very common in Palestine, and other parts of the
East. It has several small angular boughs, very thick and bushy, covered
with a reddish bark, and some of them armed with sharp thorns. They are
garnished with small, narrow, spear-shaped leaves, like those of the
myrtle, but not so sharp, of a green colour, inclining to red. Its
blossoms are large, beautiful, of an elegant red colour, inclining to
purple, composed of several stalks resembling a rose, in the hollow of
the cup. this cup is oblong, hard, purple, having a figure somewhat like
that of a bell. It is chiefly valued for its fruit, which is exceedingly
beautiful, of the form and size of a large apple, with a reddish rind,
and red within; being full of small kernels, with red grains,
replenished with a generous liquor, of which, Sir John Chardin informs
us, they still make considerable quantities of wine in the East,
particularly in Persia. But as the pomegranate tree, from its low
growth, is but little adapted for pitching a tent under, it is probable
that Rimmon here is the name of the rock mentioned in [Jdg
20:45](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#045).

Come: This action of Jonathan's was totally contrary to the laws of war;
no military operation should be undertaken without the knowledge and
command of the general. But it is highly probable, that this gallant man
was led to undertake the hazardous enterprise by an immediate divine
impulse; and by the same influence was kept from informing the soldiers,
and even from consulting his father, who might have opposed his design.

an half acre of land: or, half a furrow of an acre of land, The original
is obscure and variously understood; but it is probably a proverbial
expression for a small space. [Sa1

direct the steps of those who acknowledge him in all their ways, and
seek unto him for direction with full purpose of heart. Sometimes we
find most comfort in that which is least our own doing, and into which
we have been led by the unexpected, but well observed, turns of
Providence.

Bring hither: The Septuagint reads Προσαγαγε το εφουδ, οτι αυτος ηρε το
εφουδ εν τη ημερα εκεινη ενωπιον Ισραηλ. "Bring hither the ephod; for he
bore the ephod on that day before Israel," which Houbigant and others
think is the true reading. Finding that his son Jonathan and his
armour-bearer were absent, Saul wished to consult the high-priest; but
the tumult increasing, he says to him, "Withdraw thine hand:" i.e.,
desist form consulting the ephod on the present occasion, and
immediately hastened to make the best use he could of this astonishing
victory. [Sa1 4:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#003), [Sa1

the Hebrews: Probably such as they held in bondage, or who were their
servants. Instead of (haivrim) "the Hebrews," the LXX evidently read
haavdim, for they have οι δουλοι, "the slaves;" but this reading is not
countenanced by any other version, nor by any manuscript [Sa1

"And (all the people who were, LXX) there were with Saul about ten
thousand men;" but this is supported by no other authority.

the sight; and on taking a little food, this affection is immediately
removed.

the people: The people having abstained from food the whole of the day,
and being now faint through hunger and fatigue, they flew upon the
cattle, and not taking time to bleed them properly, they eagerly
devoured the flesh with the blood, directly contrary to the law -
another bad effect of Saul's rash adjuration.

built: It is probable that Saul converted the great stone, on which the
cattle had been slaughtered, into an altar, on which sacrifices were
offered, before the people attempted to proceed any further. This we are
told was the first he had built. Samuel, as a prophet and priest, had
hitherto erected the altars, but Saul seems to have thought he had
sufficient authority to erect one himself, without the prophet, as he
had once offered sacrifice without him. [Sa1

Therefore: Both the Septuagint and Vulgate add much to this verse:

Και ειπε Σαουλ, Κυριε ο Θεος Ισραηλ, τι οτι ουκ απεκριθης τω δουλω σου
σημερον; ει εν εμοι η εν Ιωναθαν τω υιω μου η αδικια, Κυριε ο Θεος
Ισραηλ δος δηλους και εαν ταδε ειπη, δος δη τω λαω σου Ισραηλ, δος δη
οσιοτητα, κ.τ.λ.

Et dixit Saul ad Dominum Deum Israel; Domine Deus Israel da indicium:
quid est quod non responderis servo tuo hodie? Si in me, aut in Jonatha
filio meo est iniquitas hec, da ostensionem. aut si hec iniquitas est in
populo tuo, da sanctitatem, etc.

"And Saul said (to the Lord God of Israel, Vulg.) Lord God of Israel
(give a sign, Vulg.). Why is it that thou has not answered thy servant
today? If the iniquity be in me, or in my son Jonathan, (O Lord God of
Israel, LXX) make it manifest; and if thou say thus, give to thy people
Israel, give mercy," etc., (but Vulg. Or, if this iniquity be in thy
people, give sanctification," etc.)
