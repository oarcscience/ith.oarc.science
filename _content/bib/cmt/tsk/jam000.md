James, the son of Alphaeus, the brother of Jacob, and the near relation
of our Lord, called also James the Less, probably because he was of
lower stature, or younger, than the other James, the son of Zebedee, is
generally allowed to be the writer of this Epistle; and the few that
have doubted this have assigned very slight reasons for their dissent,
and advanced very weak arguments on the other side. It is recorded in
ecclesiastical history, and the book of the Acts of the Apostles
confirms the fact, that he generally resided at Jerusalem,
superintending the churches in that city, and in the neighbouring
places, to the end of his life, which was terminated by martyrdom about
ad 62. This epistle appears to have been written but a short time before
his death; and it is probable that the sharp rebukes and awful warnings
given in it to his countrymen excited that persecuting rage which
terminated his life. It is styled Catholic, or General, because it was
not addressed to any particular church, but to the Jewish nation
throughout their dispersions. Though its genuineness was doubted for a
considerable time, yet its insertion in the ancient Syriac version,
which was executed at the close of the first, or the beginning of the
second century, and the citation of, or allusion to it, by Clement of
Rome, Hermas, and Ignatious, and its being quoted by Origen, Jerome,
Athanasius, and most of the subsequent ecclesiastical writers, as well
as its internal evidence, are amply sufficient to prove the point.
