[4 Kings (2 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">kg2 0:0</span></span>

The events detailed in these books (Kings) are highly interesting and
important. The account of the wisdom, magnificence, and extended
commerce of Solomon; the rash and impolitic conduct of Rehoboam; the
disobedient prophet; the widow of Zarephath; Elijah and the prophets of
Baal; Ben-hadad's pride and defeat; Elijah's assumption into heaven;
Elisha's succession to his ministry, and the series of illustrious
miracles he performed; the panic flight of the Syrians; the history of
Ben-hadad and Hazael; and the predicted death of Ahab and Jezebel, and
their children, are all pregnant with instruction, and have furnished
themes for frequent dissertation. We perceive in these impressive
histories the characters and qualities of men painted with the utmost
fidelity, and the attributes of God displayed with great effect. we
contemplate the exact accomplishment of God's promises and threatenings,
the wisdom of his dispensations, and the mingled justice and mercy of
his government. The particulars and circumstances are sketched out with
a brief and lively description, and the imagination lingers with
pleasure in filling up the striking outlines presented to our view. The
authenticity of these books is attested by the prophecies they contain,
which were subsequently fulfilled; by the citation of our Saviour and
his Apostles; by their universal reception by the Jewish and Christian
churches; and by the corresponding testimonies of profane authors and
ancient sculptures.
