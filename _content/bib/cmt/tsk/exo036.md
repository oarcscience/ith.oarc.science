made: Exod. 26:1-37; [Ch1 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#001)

cherubims: Keroovim, cherubim, not cherubims. What these were we cannot
determine. Some, observing that the verb kerav in Syriac, sometimes
means to resemble, make like, conceive the noun keroov signifies no more
than an image, figure, or representation of anything. Josephus says they
were flying animals, like none of those which are seen by man, but such
as Moses saw about the throne of God. In another place he says, "As for
the cherubim, nobody can tell or conceive what they were like." These
symbolical figures, according to the description of them by Ezekiel
([Eze 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#010); [Eze
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#014)), were creatures with four heads
and one body; and the animals of which these forms consisted were the
noblest of their kind; the lion among the wild beasts; the bull among
the tame ones; the eagle among the birds, and man at the head of all.
Hence some have conceived them to be somewhat of the shape of flying
oxen; and it is alleged in favour of this opinion, that the far more
common meaning of the verb kerav, in Chaldee, Syriac, and Arabic, being
to plough, the natural meaning of keroov, is a creature used in
ploughing. This seems to have been the ancient opinion which tradition
had handed down, concerning the shape of the cherubim with the flaming
sword, that guarded the tree of life ([Gen
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#024)). [Exo

covering: [Exo 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#014)

rams' skins dyed red: This was the third covering of the tabernacle. The
first and lowermost was made of fine linen, richly embroidered with
figures of cherubim, in shades of blue, purple, and scarlet ([Exo
36:8-13](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#008)). It is reasonable to suppose,
that the right side of this curtain was undermost, and so it formed a
beautiful ceiling in the inside of the tabernacle. The second covering,
which lay over the embroidered one, was made of a sort of mohair ([Exo
36:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#014)), and the fourth, or
uppermost one, which was to keep the others from the weather, was made
of tachash, or badgers' skins.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">exo 36:21</span></span>

The length: Each of these boards, taking the cubit at nearly twenty-two
inches, was about eighteen feet long, and two feet nine inches broad. As
these boards are said to be standing up ([Exo
36:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#020)), their length was consequently
the height of the tabernacle; and as the two sides were composed of
twenty of these, standing up ([Exo
36:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#023) and [Exo
36:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#025)), and the west end of six, with
two boards to project at the corners ([Exo
36:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#027) and [Exo
36:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#028)), the tabernacle must therefore,
have been thirty cubits, or fifty-five feet long, and about ten cubits,
or eighteen feet broad. These boards were fastened at the bottom by two
tenons in each board, which fitted into two mortices in the foundation,
at the top by links or hasps, and on the sides by five wooden bars,
which ran through rings or staples in each of the boards. The boards and
bars were all overlaid with gold; and their rings for the staves, and
their hasps at top, were of the same metal. The foundation on which they
stood consisted of about ninety-six solid blocks of silver, two under
each board, about eighteen inches long, and of a suitable thickness; and
each weighing a talent, or about a hundred weight. Four blocks of silver
formed the bases of the columns which supported the curtain that divided
the inside of the tabernacle into two rooms.

veil of blue: Parachoth, from parach, to separate, divide, make a
distinction between somewhat, the inner vail, which divided the
tabernacle into two, and separated, and made a distinction between the
Holy place and the Holy of Holies. This vail was made of the same rich
materials as the inner covering of the tabernacle, and curiously
embroidered with cherubim and other ornaments. Though it does not appear
from Scripture at what distance from either end of the tabernacle this
vail was hung, yet is reasonably conjectured, that it divided it in the
same proportion in which the temple, built after this model, was
divided; that is, two-thirds of the whole length were allotted to the
first room, and one-third to the second; so that the room beyond the
vail, the Holy of Holies, was exactly square, being ten cubits each way,
and the first room, the sanctuary, was twice as long as it was broad.

an hanging: This vail was a fine embroidered curtain, of the same
materials and of the same workmanship as the inner vail and inner
covering of the tabernacle. The text does not say how low it hung. Philo
makes it touch the ground; but Josephus will have it to come down but
half way, so that the people might have a view of the inside of the
tabernacle; but then he says there was another curtain over that, which
came to the ground, to keep it from the weather, and was drawn aside on
the sabbath and other festivals. [Exo
