The Epistle to the Romans is "a writing," says Dr. Macknight, "which,
for sublimity and truth of sentiment, for brevity and strength of
expression, for regularity in its structure, but above all, for the
unspeakable importance of the discoveries which it contains, stands
unrivalled by any mere human composition, and as far exceeds the most
celebrated productions of the learned Greeks and Romans, as the shining
of the sun exceeds the twinkling of the stars." "The plan of it is very
extensive; and it is surprising to see what a spacious field of
knowledge is comprised, and how many various designs, arguments,
explications, instructions, and exhortations, are executed in so small a
compass....The whole Epistle is to be taken in connection, or considered
as one continued discourse; and the sense of every part must be taken
from the drift of the whole. Every sentence, or verse, is not to be
regarded as a distinct mathematical proposition, or theorem, or as a
sentence in the book of Proverbs, whose sense is absolute, and
independent of what goes before, or comes after, but we must remember,
that every sentence, especially in the argumentative part, bears
relation to, and is dependent upon, the whole discourse, and cannot be
rightly understood unless we understand the scope and drift of the
whole; and therefore, the whole Epistle, or at least the eleven first
chapters of it, ought to be read over at once, without stopping. As to
the use and excellency of this Epistle, I shall leave it to speak for
itself, when the reader has studied and well digested its
contents....This Epistle will not be difficult to understand, if our
minds are unprejudiced, and at liberty to attend to the subject, and to
the current scriptural sense of the words used. Great care is taken to
guard and explain every part of the subject; no part of it is left
unexplained or unguarded. Sometimes notes are written upon a sentence,
liable to exception and wanting explanation, as [Rom
2:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#012). Here [Rom
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#013) and [Rom
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#015) are a comment upon the former
part of it. Sometimes are found comments upon a single word; as [Rom
10:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#011). [Rom
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#012) and [Rom
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#013) are a comment upon πας
