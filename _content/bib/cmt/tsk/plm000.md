### [Philemon Introduction](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#001)

[Philemon](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">plm 0:0</span></span>

Philemon appears to have been a person of some consideration at Colosse,
and in the church at that place ([Plm
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#001), [Plm
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#002), [Col
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#009), [Col
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#017)) who had been converted by the
ministry of St. Paul ([Plm 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#019)),
probably during his abode at Ephesus ([Act
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#010)). Onesimus, a slave of Philemon,
having, as it is generally thought, been guilty of some dishonesty, fled
from his master, and came to Rome, where the apostle was at that time
under confinement the first time, as appears by his expectation of being
shortly released ([Plm 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#022)), about ad
62. Having by some means attended the preaching of the apostle, "in his
own hired house," ([Act 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#016), [Act
28:23](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#023)) it pleased God to bless it to
his conversion. After he had given satisfactory evidence of a real
change, and manifested an excellent and amiable disposition, which
greatly endeared him to St. Paul, he was sent back to his master by the
apostle, who wrote this epistle to reconcile Philemon to his once
unfaithful servant.
