The trees: This is the most ancient fable or apologue extant; and is
extremely beautiful, apposite, and intelligible. [Kg2
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#009); [Eze

4:10-18](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#010)

olive tree: The zayith, or olive tree, in the Linnean system, is a genus
of the diandra monogynia class of plants. It is of a moderate height,
and grows best in sunny places. Its trunk is knotty; bark smooth, of an
ash colour. wood solid and yellowish; leaves oblong, almost like those
of the willow, of a dark green colour on the upper side, and whitish
below. In June it puts forth white flowers, growing in bunches, each of
one piece, widening towards the top, and dividing into four parts. After
this succeeds the fruit, which is oblong and plump; first green, then
pale, and when quite ripe, black. Within it is enclosed a hard stone,
filled with oblong seeds. It was the most useful of all trees in the
forest; as the bramble was the meanest and most worthless.

Beer: Probably the Beer mentioned by Mr. Maundrell, three hours and a
half, or about ten miles, north of Jerusalem, towards Shechem. It is
situated toward the south, on an easy declivity; and has a fountain of
excellent water at the bottom of the hill, from which it has taken its
name. Close to the well are the mouldering walls of a ruined khan; and
on the summit of the hill two large arches still remain of a ruined
convent. Dr. Richardson says, that it seems to have been once a place of
considerable consequence. [Num 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#016);

or later, God will make inquisition for blood, and will return it on the
heads of those that shed it. Accessories will be reckoned with, as well
as principals, in that and other sins. The Shechemites, who countenanced
Abimelech's pretensions, aided and abetted him in his bloody project,
and avowed the fact by making him king after he had done it, must fall
with him, fall by him, and fall first. Those that combine together to do
wickedly, are justly dashed in pieces one against another. Blood cannot
be a lasting cement to any interest.

And he said: Rather, "and I would say to Abimelech," as the LXX renders;
for as Dr. Wall observes, this was probably not said in the presence of
Abimelech; but at an intemperate feast, in his absence, when he boasted
he would challenge him.

Gaal: Of this person we know no more than is here recorded. He was
probably one of the descendants of the Canaanites, who hoped, from the
state of the public mind and their disaffection to Abimelech, to cause a
revolution, and thus to restore the ancient government as it was under
Hamor, the father of Shechem. Josephus says he was a man of authority,
who sojourned with them, with his armed men and kinsmen; and that the
Shechemites desired that he would allow them a guard during the vintage.

seest the shadow: Doubdan states, that in some parts of the Holy Land
there are many detached rocks scattered up and down, some growing out of
the ground, and others fragments broken off from rocky precipices, the
shadow of which, it appears, Josephus thought might be most naturally
imagined to look like troops of men at a distance, rather than that of
the mountains; for he represents Zebul as saying to Gaal, that he
mistook the shadow of the rocks for men. [Eze

sowed: Salt in small quantities renders land extremely fertile; but too
much of it destroys vegetation. Every place, says Pliny, in which salt
is found is barren, and produces nothing. Hence the sowing of a place
with salt was a custom in different nations to express permanent
desolation. Sigonius observes, that when Milan was taken, ad 1162, the
walls were razed, and it was sown with salt. And Brantome informs us,
that it was an ancient custom in France, to sow the house of a man with
salt, who had been declared a traitor to his king. Charles IX., king of
France, the most base and perfidious of human beings, caused the house
of Admiral Coligni (whom he and the Duke of Guise caused to be murdered,
with thousands more of Protestants, on the eve of St. Bartholomew,
1572), to be sown with salt!

skull." Plutarch relates, that Pyrrhus was killed at the siege of
Thebes, by a piece of a tile, which a woman threw upon his head.

Shechem had the iniquity visited upon them of which they had been
guilty. Man's judgment may be avoided; but there is no escape from that
of God. How many houses have been sown with salt in France, by the just
judgment of God, for the massacre of the Protestants on the eve of St.
Bartholomew! See note on [Jdg 9:45](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#045).
