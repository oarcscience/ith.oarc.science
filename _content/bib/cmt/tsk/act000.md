The Acts of the Apostles is a most valuable portion of Divine
revelation; and, independently of its universal reception in the
Christian church, as an authentic and inspired production, it bears the
most satisfactory internal evidence of its authenticity and truth. St.
Luke's long attendance upon St. Paul, and his having been an eyewitness
of many of the facts which he has recorded, independently of his Divine
inspiration, render him a most suitable and credible historian; and his
medical knowledge, for he is allowed to have been a physician, enabled
him both to form a proper judgment of the miraculous cures which were
performed by St. Paul, and to give an authentic and circumstantial
detail of them. The plainness and simplicity of the narrative are also
strong circumstances in its favour. The history of the Acts is one of
the most important parts of the Sacred History, for without it neither
the Gospels nor Epistles could have been so clearly understood; but by
the aid of it the whole scheme of the Christian revelation is set before
us in a clear and easy view.
