### [1 Chronicles Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#001)

[1 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch1 12:0</span></span>

Overview

[Ch1 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#001), The companies that came to
David at Ziklag; [Ch1 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#023), The
armies that came to him at Hebron.

[1 Chronicles 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 12:1</span></span>

these are: [Sa1 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#002), [Sa1
27:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#006); [Sa2
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#001), [Sa2
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#010)

while he yet: etc. Heb. being yet shut up, Sometimes, in the East, when
a successful prince endeavoured to extirpate the preceding royal family,
some of them escaped the slaughter, and secured themselves in an
impregnable fortress, or in a place of great secrecy; while others have
been known to seek an asylum in a foreign county, from when they have
occasioned, from time to time, great anxiety and great difficulties to
the usurper of the crown. The expression shut up, so often applied to
the extermination of eastern royal families ([Deu
32:32](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#032). [Kg1
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#010); [Kg1
21:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#021). [Kg2
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#008); [Kg2
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#026)), strictly speaking, refers to
the two first of these cases; but the term may be used in a more
extensive sense, for those who, by retiring into deserts, or foreign
countries, preserve themselves from being slain by the men who usurp the
dominions of their ancestors. Thus the term is here applied to David,
though he did not shut himself up, strictly speaking, in Ziklag. It is
described as a town in the country, and was probably an unwalled town;
and it is certain that he did not confine himself to it, but, on the
contrary, was continually making excursions from thence.

As he went: These captains of Manasseh seem to have met David as he was
returning from the army of the Philistines to Ziklag. It is probable
that they did not bring their companies with them; yet they both assured
him of future assistance, and very seasonably helped him against the
Amalekites who had spoiled Ziklag. [Sa1

came to David: Some learned men understand this as relating to the time
when David was make king over Judah, on his first coming to Hebron, but
it seems wholly to refer to his being made king over all Israel, after
the death of Ishbosheth; for there was no such union or assembly of the
several tribes on the former occasion, as is here described.

brought: The Septuagint reads εφερον αυτιος, "brought (to) them" which
is probably correct; the Hebrew lahem, "to them" might be easily
mistaken for lechem, "bread." The passage will then read, "bought them
on asses, on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, meat, meal, cakes of
figs," etc., which renders the introduction of and unnecessary. From the
mention of oil, figs, and raisins, Mr. Harmer thinks that this assembly
was held in autumn. [Sa2 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#001), [Sa2
