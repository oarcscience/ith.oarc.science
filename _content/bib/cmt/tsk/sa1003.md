<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa1 3:0</span></span>

Overview

[Sa1 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#001), How the word of the Lord was
first revealed to Samuel; [Sa1 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#011),
God tells Samuel the destruction of Eli's house; [Sa1
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#015), Samuel, though loath, tells Eli
the vision; [Sa1 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#019), Samuel grows in
credit.

Now Samuel: Or, Thus did Samuel before he knew the Lord, and before the
word of the Lord was revealed unto him.

did not yet: Samuel was not destitute of the knowledge of God, in that
sense which implies the total absence of true piety, as Eli's sons were;
for he knew and worshipped the God of Israel, but he did not know him as
communicating special revelations of his will to him, in the manner in
which he made it known to the prophets. [Jer
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#024); [Act
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#002)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa1 3:8</span></span>

the third: [Job 33:14](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#014), [Job
33:15](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#015); Although Samuel did not
apprehend the way in which God reveals himself to his servants the
prophets - by the "still small voice" - yet when this direct
communication from the Almighty was made the third time, in a way
altogether new and strange to him, it seems astonishing that he did not
immediately apprehend. Perhaps he would have been sooner aware of a
divine revelation, had it come in a dream or a vision. Those who have
the greatest knowledge of divine things, should remember the time when
they were as babes, unskilful in the word of righteousness. [Co1
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#011), [Co1
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#012)

audible voice.

as at other: [Sa1 3:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#004), [Sa1
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#008); Samuel did not now rise and run
as before, when thought he Eli called, but lay still and listened. All
must be silent, when God speaks. Observe, however, Samuel in his reply
left out one word. he did not say, Speak, Lord, but only Speak, for thy
servant heareth; perhaps, as Bp. Patrick suggests, out of uncertainty,
whether it was God that spake to him or not. However, by this answer way
was made for the message he was now to receive, and Samuel was brought
acquainted with the words of God and visions of the Almighty.

Samuel: Samuel reverenced Eli as a father, and feared to distress him by
shewing what God had purposed to do. It does not appear that God
commanded Samuel to deliver this message; he therefore did not attempt
it till adjured by Eli. It might be supposed that Samuel would have been
so full of ecstasy as to have forgotten his ordinary service, and run
amongst his friends to tell them of the converse he had with God in the
night, but he modestly keeps it to himself. Our secret communion with
God is not to be proclaimed on the house-top.
