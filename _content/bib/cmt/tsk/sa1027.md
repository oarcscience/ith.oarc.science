king of Israel, and promised his accession to the throne, and had so
often interposed in his behalf, that he was authorised to believe the
very reverse.

David: This measure of David's, in uniting himself to the enemies of his
God and people, was highly blameable; was calculated to alienate the
affections of the Israelites; and led to equivocation, if not downright
falsehood.

Ziklag: Ziklag was at first given to the tribe of Judah, but was
afterwards ceded to that of Simeon; but as it bordered on the
Philistines, if they had ever been expelled, they had retaken it.
Eusebius simply says it was situated in the south of Canaan. [Sa1

Against: David here meant the Geshurites, and Gezrites, and Amalekites,
which people occupied that part of the country which lies to the south
of Judah. But Achish, as was intended, understood him in a different
sense, and believed that he had attacked his own countrymen. David's
answer, therefore, though not an absolute falsehood, was certainly an
equivocation intended to deceive, and therefore incompatible with that
sense of truth and honour which became him as a prince, and a professor
of true religion. From these, and similar passages, we may observe the
strict impartiality of the Sacred Scriptures. They present us with the
most faithful delineation of human nature; they exhibit the frailties of
kings, priests, and prophets, with equal truth; and examples of vice and
frailty, as well as of piety and virtue, are held up, that we may guard
against the errors to which the best men are exposed.
