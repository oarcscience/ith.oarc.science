As the design of this Epistle is excellent, remarks Dr. Macknight, so is
its execution, in the judgment of the best critics, does not fall short
of its design. Ostervald says of the first Epistle of Peter, "it is one
of the finest books in the New Testament." Erasmus pronounces it to be
"worthy of the prince of the Apostles, and full of apostolical dignity
and authority;" and adds, "it is sparing in words, but full of sense -
verbis pauca, sententiis differta." "As the true church of Christ," says
Dr. Clarke, "has generally been in a state of suffering, the Epistles of
St. Peter have ever been most highly prized by all believers. That which
we have just finished is an admirable letter, containing some of the
most important maxims and consolations for the Church in the wilderness.
No Christian can read it without deriving from it both light and life.
Ministers especially should study it well, that they may know how to
comfort their flocks when in persecution and adversity. He never speaks
to good in any spiritual case who is not furnished out of the Divine
treasury. God's words invite, solicit, and command assent. on them a man
may confidently rely. The words of man may be true, but they are not
infallible; this is the character of God's word alone." To these
valuable remarks on the varied excellences and uses of this inimitable
Epistle, it may be only necessary to add, that it is not only important
in these respects, but is a rich treasury of Christian doctrines and
duties from which the mind may be enriched and the heart improved, with
the most ennobling sentiments.
