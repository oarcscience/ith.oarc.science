[1 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch1 8:0</span></span>

Overview

[Ch1 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#001), The sons and chief men of

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch1 8:3</span></span>

Addar: The variation in this name is occasioned simply by the
transposition of a ד, daleth and ר, raish; being in the parallel passage
ארד \[Strong's H714\], Ard, and here אדר \[Strong's H146\], Addar. [Gen
46:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#021); [Num
26:40](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#040), Ard

Gera: [Jdg 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#015)

Shephuphan: שׁפם \[Strong's H8206\], Shuppim, seems to be merely a
contracted form of שׁפופם \[Strong's H8197\], Shupham, or rather,
Shephupham, which, by the mutation of מ, mem, into נ, noon, is here
changed into שׁפופן \[Strong's H8197\], Shephuphan. [Ch1
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#012), Shuppim, [Num
26:39](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#039), Shupham

Huram: Huram appears to be an error for Hupham in the parallel passage
of Numbers, which, by contraction, is written Huppim.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch1 8:9</span></span>

Hodesh: In the preceding verse it is said that "Hushim and Baara were
his wives;" and here it said, "he begat of Hodesh his wife," etc; and
then in the [Ch1 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#011), his children by
Hushim are mentioned, but not a word of Baara. It is probable,
therefore, that Hodesh was another name for Baara; and this is asserted
by the Targumist: "And he begat of Baara, that is, of Chodesh, his wife,
so called because he espoused her anew.

Ono: Ono is stated by Reland to have been three miles from Lydda. [Ezr
2:33](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#033); [Neh
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#002), [Neh
7:37](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#037), [Neh
11:35](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#035)

Lod: Lod, or Lydda, was situated about four leagues from Joppa, and a
day's journey, or about thirty-two miles nw from Jerusalem; and,
according to the Antonine Itinerary, twelve miles from Jamnia, eighteen
from Eleutheropolis, and twenty two from Bethar. Josephus says it was a
village, not yielding to a city in greatness; and that it was one of
three toparchies dismembered from Samaria, and given to the Jews. It was
destroyed by Cesitus in the Jewish war, and, when rebuilt, was called
Diospolis. It is now called Loudd, and is a poor village, situated in a
fine plain about a league to the e-ne of Ramia.

Jerusalem: Jerusalem, the ancient capital of Judea, is situated in long.
35 degrees 20 minutes e, lat. 31 degrees 47 minutes 47 seconds n; and,
according to the best authorities, 136 miles sw of Damascus, 34 miles s
of Shechem or Nablous, 45 miles e of Jaffa, 27 miles n of Hebron, and
about 20 miles w of Jericho. The city of Jerusalem was built on hills,
and encompassed with mountains ([Psa
125:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#002)), in a stony and barren soil,
and was about sixteen furlongs in length, say Strabo. The ancient city
of Jebus, taken by David from the Jebusites, was not large, and stood on
a mountain south of that on which the temple was erected. Here David
built a new city, called the city of David, wherein was the royal
palace. Between these two mountains lay the valley of Millo, filled up
by David and Solomon; and after the reign of Manasseh, another city is
mentioned, called the second. The Maccabees considerably enlarged
Jerusalem on the north, enclosing a third hill; and Josephus mentions a
fourth hill, called Bezetha, which Agrippa joined to the former. this
new city lay north of the temple, along the brook Kidron. See note on
[Ch1 9:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#034).
