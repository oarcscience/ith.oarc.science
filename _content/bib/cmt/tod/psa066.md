### [Psalms Chapter 66](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 66:0</span></span>

Title. - To the Chief Musician. - He had need be a man of great skill,
worthily to sing such a Psalm as this: the best music in the world would
be honoured by marriage with such expressions. A Song or Psalm, or a
Song and Psalm. It may be either said or sung; it is a marvellous poem
if it be but read; but set to suitable music, it must have been one of
the noblest strains ever heard by the Jewish people. We do not know who
is its author, but we see no reason to doubt that David wrote it. It is
in the Davidic style, and has nothing in it unsuited to his times. It is
true the "house" of God is mentioned, but the tabernacle was entitled to
that designation as well as the temple.

Subject and Division. - Praise is the topic, and the subjects for song
are the Lord's great works, his gracious benefits, his faithful
deliverances, and all his dealings with his people, brought to a close
by a personal testimony to special kindness received by the prophet-bard
himself. [Psa 66:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#001) are a kind of
introductory hymn, calling upon all nations to praise God, and dictating
to them the words of a suitable song. Verses [Psa
66:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#005) invite the beholder to "Come
and see" the works of the Lord, pointing attention to the Red Sea, and
perhaps the passage of Jordan. This suggests the similar position of the
afflicted people which is described, and its joyful issue predicted,
from [Psa 66:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#008). The singer then
becomes personal, and confesses his own obligations to the Lord ([Psa
66:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#013)); and, bursting forth with a
vehement "Come and hear," declares with thanksgiving the special favour
of the Lord to himself, [Psa 66:16-20](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#016).

Explanatory Notes and Quaint Sayings

Whole Psalm

This Psalm is said to be recited on Easter day, by the Greek church: it
is described in the Greek Bible as A Psalm of the Resurrection, and may
be understood to refer, in a prophetic sense, to the regeneration of the
world, through the conversion of the Gentiles. - Daniel Cresswell.

[Psa 66:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#001)

"Make a joyful noise unto God, all lie lands'" Heb., all the earth.;
shout aloud for joy, as the people did at the return of the ark, so that
the earth rang again. God shall show himself to be the God not of Jews
only, but of Gentiles also; these shall as well cry Christ, as those
Jesus; these say, Father, as those Abba. And, as there was great joy in
Samaria when the gospel was there received ([Act
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#008)), so shall there be the like in
all other parts of the earth. - John Trapp.

[Psa 66:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#001)

"All ye lands." Where, consider, that he does not sing praises veil, who
desires to sing alone. - Thomas Le Blanc.

[Psa 66:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#002)

"Make his praise glorious." Another meaning is, give or place glory,
that is, your glory to his praise, be fully persuaded when you praise
him that it will redound to your own glory, regard this as your own
glory; praise him in such a way that all your praises may be given to
glorify God; or, let your glory tend in this direction that he may be
praised. Desire not the glory of eternal blessedness, unless for the
praise of God, as the blessed spirits in that temple do nothing but say
glory to God, and sing the hymn of his glory without end, "Holy, holy,
holy."

[Psa 66:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#003)

"Say." Dicite, say, says David, delight to speak of God; Dicite, say
something. There was more required than to think of God. Consideration,
meditation, speculation, contemplation upon God and divine objects, have
their place and their season; but this is more than that, and more than
admiration too; for all these may come to an end in ecstacies, and in
stupidities, and in useless and frivolous imaginations. - John Donne.

[Psa 66:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#003)

"Unto God." To God, not concerning God, as some interpret, but to God
himself; to his praises, and with minds raised to God, as it is in [Psa
66:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#004), sing to himself; Gejerus also
correctly remarks, that the following discourse is addressed to God.
Besides, it is to our God, as in [Psa
66:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#008), "O bless our God, lie people" he
is called God absolutely, because he alone is the true God. - Hermann
Venema.

[Psa 66:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#003)

"How terrible." Take from the Bible its awful doctrines and from
providence its terrible acts, and the whole system, under which God has
placed us, would be emasculated. - William S. Plumer.

[Psa 66:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#003)

"Thine enemies shall submit themselves unto thee." In this, our first
consideration is, that God himself hath enemies; and then, how should we
hope to be, nay, why should we wish to be, without them. God had good,
that is, glory from his enemies; and we may have good, that is,
advantage in the way to glory, by the exercise of our patience, from
enemies too. Those for whom God had done most, the angels, turned
enemies first; vex not thou thyself, if those whom thou hast loved best
hate thee deadliest.... God himself hath enemies. "Thine enemies shall
submit," says the text, to God; there thou hast one comfort, though thou
have enemies too; but the greater comfort is, that God calls thine
enemies his. Holite tangere Christos meos ([Psa
105:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#015)), says God of all holy people;
you were as good touch me, as touch any of them, for, "they are the
apple of mine eye" ([Psa 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#008)). Our
Saviour Christ never expostulated for himself; never said, Why scourge
you me? why spit you upon me? why crucify you me? As long as their rage
determined in his person, he opened not his mouth; when Saul extended
the violence to the church, to his servants, then Christ came to that,
"Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?"... Here is a holy league,
defensive and offensive; God shall not only protect us from others, but
he shall fight for us against them; our enemies are his enemies. -
Condensed from John Donne.

[Psa 66:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#003)

"Thine enemies submit themselves." Literally, lie unto thee. This was
remarkably the case with Pharaoh and the Egyptians. They promised again
and again to let the people go, when the hand of the Lord was upon them;
and they as frequently falsified their word. - Adam Clarke.

[Psa 66:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#003) (second clause)

In times of affliction every hypocrite - all tag and rag - will be ready
to come in to God in an outward profession; but usually this submission
to God at this time is not out of truth. Hence it is said, "Through the
greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee'"
in the original it is, "they shall lie unto thee," and so it is
translated by Arias Montanus, and some others, noting hereby that a
forced submission to God is seldom in truth. - Jeremiah Burroughs.

[Psa 66:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#003)

The earthquakes in New England occasioned a kind of religious panic. A
writer, who was then one of the ministers of Boston, informs us, that
immediately after the great earthquake, as it was called, a great number
of his flock came and expressed a wish to unite themselves with the
church. But, on conversing with them, he could find no evidence of
improvement in their religious views or feelings, no convictions of
their own sinfulness; nothing, in short, but a kind of superstitious
fear, occasioned by a belief that the end of the world was at hand. All
their replies proved that they had not found God, though they had seen
'"the greatness of his power" in the earthquake. - Edward Payson, D. D.

[Psa 66:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#005)

"Come and see the works of God." An indirect censure is here passed upon
that almost universal thoughtlessness which leads men to neglect the
praises of God. - John Calvin.

[Psa 66:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#005)

"Come and see." The church at all times appeals to the world. "Come and
see," as Jesus said to the two disciples of John the Baptist, and Philip
to Nathanael. [Joh 1:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#039), [Joh
1:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#046). God's marvels are to be seen by
all, and seeing them is the first step towards believing in their divine
author. - A. R. Fausset.

[Psa 66:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#006)

"He turned the sea into dry land." The Psalmist refers to the passage
through the Red Sea and the Jordan, not as to transactions which took
place and were concluded at a given period of time, but as happening
really in every age. God's guidance of his people is a constant drying
up of the sea and of the Jordan, and the joy over his mighty deeds is
always receiving new materials. - E. W. Hengstenberg.

[Psa 66:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#006)

"There did we rejoice in him;" where those things have been done, there
have we rejoiced in him, not taking any credit to ourselves as if they
were our acts, but rejoicing and glorying in God, and have praised him,
as may be seen in Exod. 15 and Joshua 3. The prophet uses the future for
the past, unless, perhaps, he meant to insinuate that these miracles
would be succeeded by much greater ones, of which they were only the
types and figures. A much greater miracle is that men should pass over
the bitter sea of this life, and cross the river of mortality, that
never ceases to run, and which swallows up and drowns so many, and still
come safe and alive to the land of eternal promise, and there rejoice in
God himself, beholding him face to face; and yet this greater miracle is
so accomplished by God, that many pass through this sea as if it were
dry land, and cross this river with dry feet; that is to say, having no
difficulty in despising all things temporal, be they good or be they
bad; that is to say, being neither attached to the good things, nor
fearing the evil things, of this world, that they may arrive in security
at the heavenly Jerusalem, where we will rejoice in him, not in hope,
but in complete possession for eternity. - Robert Bellarmine.

[Psa 66:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#007)

"His eyes behold the nations." The radical meaning of the word צפה is
αὐγάζειν, to shine, and metonymically to examine with a bright eye; to
inspect with a piercing glance, and thence to behold, for either good or
evil, as Prop. [Psa 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#003) : "The eyes
of the Lord are in every place, beholding the evil and the good." Here
it is taken in an adverse sense, and means, to watch from a watch-tower,
to threaten from a lofty place. [Psa
37:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#032) : "The wicked watcheth the
righteous;" and [Job 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#022) : He is
waited for "from the watch-tower for the sword;" that is to say, the
sword is drawn above the head of the wicked, as if it threatened him
from the watchtower of God. But, at the same time, there is also a
reference to God's looking from the pillar of fire, and of cloud, upon
the host of Pharaoh in the Red Sea. [Exo
14:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#024). - Hermann Venema.

[Psa 66:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#007)

"His eyes behold the nations." This should give check to much iniquity.
Can a man's conscience easily and delightfully swallow that which he is
sensible falls under the cognizance of God, when it is hateful to the
eye of his holiness, and renders the action odious to him? "Doth not he
see my ways, and count all my steps?" saith Job ([Job
31:4](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#004)).... The consideration of this
attribute should make us humble. How dejected would a person be if he
were sure all the angels in heaven, and men upon earth, did perfectly
know his crimes, with all their aggravations! But what is created
knowledge to an infinite and just censuring understanding? When we
consider that he knows our actions, where of there are multitudes, and
our thoughts, whereof there are millions; that he views all the
blessings bestowed upon us; all the injuries we have returned to him;
that he exactly knows his own bounty, and our ingratitude; all the
idolatry, blasphemy, and secret enmity in every man's heart against him;
all tyrannical oppressions, hidden lusts, omissions of necessary duties,
violations of plain precepts, every foolish imagination, with all the
circumstances of them, and that perfectly in all their full anatomy,
every mite of unworthiness and wickedness in every circumstance....
should not the consideration of this melt our hearts into humiliation
before him, and make us earnest in begging pardon and forgiveness of
him. - Stephen Charnock.

[Psa 66:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#009)

"Which holdeth our soul in life." As the works of creation at first, and
upholding all by his power and providence, are yoked together as works
of a like wonder, vouchsafed the creation in common, [Heb
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002), [Heb
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003); so just in the like manner we
find regeneration and perseverance joined, as the sum of all other works
in this life. Thus "begotten again," and "kept by the power of God to
salvation," are joined by the Apostle, [Pe1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#003) and [Pe1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#005), "Called and preserved in Christ
Jesus;" so in Jude, [Jde
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#001)..."Blessed be God," says Peter,
"who, according to his abundant mercy, hath begotten us again." And, "O
bless our God, ye people, which holdeth our souls in life," says the
Psalmist. Yea, if we do narrowly eye the words in either, both Peter and
the Psalmist do bless God for both at once. Blessed be God for
"begetting us," who are also "kept by the power of God;" so it follows
in Peter. In the Psalmist both are comprehended in this one word: 1.
"which putteth our souls in life" (so the margin, out of the Hebrew),
that is, who puts life into your soul at the first, as he did into Adam
when he made him a living soul; 2. and then which "holdeth," that is,
continueth our souls in that life. So the translators render it also,
according to the Psalmist's scope, and "O bless the Lord," saith the
Psalmist, for these and both these. - Thomas Goodwin.

[Psa 66:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#009)

"Which holdest our soul in life." It is truth, that all we have is in
the hand of God; but God keeps our life in his hand last of all, and he
hath that in his hand in a special manner. Though the soul continue,
life may not continue; there is the soul when there is not life: life is
that which is the union of soul and body. "Thou holdest our soul in
life;" that is, thou holdest soul and body together. So Daniel describes
God to Belshazzar, [Dan 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#023), "The God
in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are all thy ways, hast thou not
glorified." The breath of princes is in the hand of God, and the same
hand bolds the breath of the meanest subject. This may be matter of
comfort to us in times of danger, and times of death: when the hand of
man is lifted up to take thy life remember thy life is held in the hand
of God; and, as God said to Satan ([Job
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#006)): Afflict the body of Job, but
save his life; so God saith still to bloody wretches, who are as the
limbs of Satan: The bodies of such and such are in your hands, the
estates of such and such are in your hands, but save their lives. -
Joseph Carrel.

[Psa 66:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#009)

"Putteth our soul in life." An elegant and emphatic expression, only to
be understood by observing the exact force of the words. The soul is the
life, as is well known, the word שׂים is to place, to place upon, to
press in, the word חיּים signifies properly joinings, fastenings
together, and hence those faculties and powers by which nature is held
together and made firm. - Hermann Venema.

[Psa 66:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#009)

"Which holdeth our soul in life." He holdeth our soul in life, that it
may not drop away of itself; for being continually in our hands, it is
apt to slip through our fingers. - Matthew Henry.

[Psa 66:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#009)

"And suffereth not our feet to be moved." It is a great mercy to be kept
from desperate courses in the time of sad calamities, to be supported
under burdens, that we sink not; and to be prevented from denying God,
or his truth, in time of persecution. - David Dickson.

[Psa 66:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#010)

"Thou, O God, hast proved us." It is not known what corn will yield,
till it come to the flail; nor what grapes, till they come to the press.
Grace is hid in nature, as sweet water in rose-leaves; the fire of
affliction fetcheth it out. "Thou hast tried us as silver." The wicked
also are tried ([Rev 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#010)), but they
prove reprobate silver ([Jer 6:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#028)), or
at best, as alchymy gold, that will not bear the seventh fire, as Job
did ([Job 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#010)). - John Trapp.

[Psa 66:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#010)

"As silver is tried." Convinced from the frequent use of this
illustration, that there was something more than usually instructive in
the processes of assaying and purifying silver, I have collected some
few facts upon the subject. The hackneyed story of the refiner seeing
his image in the molten silver while in the fire, has so charmed most of
us, that we have not looked further; yet, with more careful study, much
could be brought out.

To assay silver requires great personal care in the operator. "The
principle of assaying gold and silver is very simple theoretically, but
in practice great experience is necessary to insure accuracy; and there
is no branch of business which demands more personal and undivided
attention. The result is liable to the influence of so many
contingencies, that no assayer who regards his reputation will delegate
the principal processes to one not equally skilled with himself. Besides
the result ascertainable by weight, there are allowances and
compensations to be made, which are known only to an experienced
assayer, and if these were disregarded, as might be the case with the
mere novice, the report would be wide from the truth." Pagnini's version
reads: "Thou hast melted us by blowing upon us," and in the monuments of
Egypt, artificers are seen with the blowpipe operating with small
fire-places, with cheeks to confine and reflect the heat; the worker
evidently paying personal attention, which is evident also in [Mal
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#003), "He shall sit as a refiner and
purifier of silver."

To assay silver requires a skilfully-constructed furnace. The
description of this furnace would only weary the reader, but it is
evidently a work of art in itself. Even the trial of our faith is much
more precious than that of gold which perisheth. He has refined us, but
not with silver, he would not trust us there, the furnace of affliction
is far more skilfully arranged than that.

To assay silver the heat must be nicely regulated. "During the
operation, the assayer's attention should be directed to the heat of the
furnace, which must be neither too hot nor too cold: if too hot, minute
portions of silver will be carried off with the lead, and so vitiate the
assay; moreover, the pores of the cupel being more open, greater
absorption will ensue, and there is liability to loss from that cause.
One indication of an excess of heat in the furnace, is the rapid and
perpendicular rising of the fumes to the ceiling of the muffle, the mode
of checking and controlling which has been pointed out in the
description of the improved furnace. When the fumes are observed to fall
to the bottom of the muffle, the furnace is then too cold; and, if left
unaltered, it will be found that the cupellation has been imperfectly
performed, and the silver will not have entirely freed itself from the
base metals."

The assayer repeats his trying processes. Usually two or more trials of
the same piece are made, so that great accuracy may be secured. Seven
times silver is said to be purified, and the saints through varied
trials reach the promised rest. - C. H. S.

"Thou broughtest us into the net," etc. Our enemies have pursued us
(like the wild beasts taken by the hunter) into most grievous straits
([Sa1 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#006)). They have used us like
beasts of burden, and laid sore loads upon us, which they have fast
bound upon our backs. "Thou laidst affliction upon our loins."
Coarctationem in lumbis; we are not only hampered, as in a net, but
lettered, as with chains; as if we had been in the jailor's or hangman's
hands. - John Trapp.

[Psa 66:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#012)

"Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads." The agents are men. Man
is a sociable diving creature, and should converse with man in love and
tranquility. Man should be a supporter of man; is he become an
overthrower? He should help and keep him up; doth he ride over him and
tread him under foot? O apostasy, not only from religion, but even from
humanity! Quid homini inimicissimum? Homo. - The greatest danger that
befalls man comes whence it should least come, from man himself.
anitaantis, says Pliny, in suo genere, probe degunt, etc. Lions fight
not with lions; serpents spend not their venom on serpents; but man is
the main suborner of mischief to his own kind.

1\. They ride. What need they mount themselves upon beasts, that have
feet malicious enough to trample on us? They have a "foot of pride,"
[Psa 36:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#011), from which David prayed to
be delivered; a presumptuous heel, which they dare lift up against God;
and, therefore, a tyrannous toe, to spurn dejected man. They need not
horses and mules, that can kick with the foot of a revengeful malice,
[Psa 32:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#009).

2\. Over us. The way is broad enough wherein they travel, for it is the
devil's road, They might well miss the poor, there is room enough
besides; they need not ride over us. It were more brave for them to
justle with champions that will not give them the way. We never contend
for their path; they have it without our envy, not without our pity. Why
should they ride over us?

3\. Over our heads. Is it not contentment enough to their pride to ride,
to their malice to ride over us, but must they delight in bloodiness to
ride over our heads.? Will not the breaking of our arms and legs, and
such inferior limbs, satisfy their indignation? Is it not enough to rack
our strength, to mock our innocence, to prey on our estates, but must
they thirst after our bloods and lives? Quo tendit seva libido? -
Whither will their madness run? But we must not tie ourselves to the
letter. Here is a mystical or metaphorical gradation of their cruelty.
Their riding is proud; their riding over us is malicious; and their
riding over our heads is bloody oppression. - Thomas Adams.

[Psa 66:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#012) (first clause)

The time was when the Bonners and butchers rode over the faces of God's
saints, and madefied the earth with their bloods, every drop whereof
begot a new believer. - Thomas Adams.

[Psa 66:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#012)

"Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads." This verse is like that
sea ([Mat 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#024)), so tempestuous at
first, that the vessel was covered with waves; but Christ's rebuke
quieted all, and there followed a great calm. Here are cruel Nimrods
riding over innocent heads, as they would over fallow lands; and
dangerous passages through fire and water; but the storm is soon ended,
or rather the passengers are landed. "Thou broughtest us out into a
wealthy place." So that this strain of David's music, or Psalmody,
consists of two notes - one mournful, the other mirthful; the one a
touch of distress, the other of redress: which directs our course to an
observation of misery and of mercy; of grievous misery, of gracious
mercy. There is desolation and consolation in one verse: a deep
dejection, as laid under the feet of beasts; a happy deliverance,
"broughtest us out into a wealthy place." In both these strains God hath
his stroke; he is a principal in this concert. He is brought in for an
actor, and for an author; an actor in the persecution, an author in the
deliverance. "Thou causest," etc.; "Thou broughtest," etc. In the one he
is a causing worker; in the other a sole working cause. In the one he is
joined with company; in the other he works alone. He hath a finger in
the former; his whole hand in the latter. We must begin with misery
before we come to mercy. If there were no trouble, we should not know
the worth of a deliverance. The passion of the saints is given, by the
hearty and ponderous description, for very grievous; yet it is written
in the forehead of the text, "The Lord caused it." "Thou causedst men to
ride," etc. Hereupon, some wicked libertine may offer to rub his
filthiness upon God's purity, and to plead an authentical derivation of
all his villany against the saints from the Lord's warrant: "He caused
it." We answer, to the justification of truth itself, that God doth
ordain and order every persecution that striketh his children, without
any allowance to the instrument that gives the blow. God works in the
same action with others, not after the same manner. In the affliction of
Job were three agents - God, Satan, and the Sabeans. The devil works on
his body, the Sabeans on his goods; yet Job confesseth a third party:
"The Lord gives, and the Lord takes away." Here oppressors trample on
the godly, and God is said to cause it. He causeth affliction for trial
(so [Psa 66:10, 19 66:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#010) : "Thou hast
tried us," etc.); they work it for malice; neither can God be accused
nor they excused. - Thomas Adams.

[Psa 66:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#012)

"Thou hast placed men over our heads." Thus Jerome renders, although the
Hebrew noun, אגוש, is in the singular, the word itself denotes an
obscure, mean man, who is mentioned with indignity, but ought to be
buried in oblivion. The singular noun is taken collectively, and so also
is דאשׁגו, with the affix. Such were the Egyptian and Babylonish
idolaters, whom the Hebrew served. To place any one over the head of
another, or, as the Hebrew word הדכּבתּ means, to ride, to be superior
to, to subdue to oneself and subject, and to sit upon and insult, just
as the horseman rules with the rein, and spur, and whip the beast which
he rides. - Lorinus.

[Psa 66:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#012)

"To ride over our heads." This is an allusion to beasts of burden, and
particularly to camels, whose heads the rider almost sits over, and so
domineers over them as he pleases. - Thomas Fonton, in "Annotations on
the Book of Job, and the Psalms." 1732.

[Psa 66:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#012)

"We went through fire and through water." The children of Israel when
they had escaped the Red Sea, and seen their enemies the Egyptians dead,
they thought all was cocksure, and therefore sang Epicinia, songs of
rejoicing for the victory. But what followed within a while? The Lord
stirred up another enemy against them, from out their bowels, as it
were, which was hunger, and this pinched them sorer, they thought, than
the Egyptian. But was this the last? No; after the hunger came thirst,
and this made them to murmur as much as the former; and after the thirst
came fiery serpents, and fire and pestilence, and Amalekites, and
Midianites, and what not? Thus hath it been with the church not only
under the law, but also under Christ, as it might be easily declared
unto you. Neither hath it been better with the several members thereof;
they likewise have been made conformable to the body and to the Head.
What a sight of temptations did Abraham endure? So Jacob, so Joseph, so
the patriarchs, so the prophets? Yea, and all they that would live godly
in Christ Jesus, though their sorrow in the end were turned to joy, yet
they wept and lamented first. Though they were brought at the length to
a wealthy place, yet they passed through fire and water first. - Miles
Smith. - 1624.

[Psa 66:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#012)

"We went through fire and through water." There was a great variety of
such perils; and not only of several, but of contrary sorts: "We went
through fire and through water," either of which singly and alone
denotes an extremity of evils. Thus, through water ([Psa
69:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#001), [Psa
69:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#002)): "Save me, O God; for the waters
are come in unto my soul. I sink in deep mire, where there is no
standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me." Or,
through fire ([Eze 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#007)): "And I will
set my face against them; they shall So out from one fire, and another
fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I set
my face against them." But when through both successively, one after the
other, this denotes an accumulation of miseries, or trials, indeed: as
we read Isa. 43: 2, with God's promise to his people in such conditions:
"When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through
the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the
fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon
thee." Which promise is here, you see, acknowledged by the Psalmist to
have been performed God was with the three children when they walked
through the fire, in the very letter of Isaiah's speech; and with the
children of Israel when they went through the water of the Red Sea. -
Thomas Goodwin.

[Psa 66:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#012)

"We went through fire and through water." In allusion, probably, to the
ordeal by fire and water, which is of great antiquity.

On the question who had interred the body of Polynices: -

"All denied:

Offering, in proof of innocence, to grasp

The burning steel, to walk through fire, and take

Their solemn oath they knew not of the deed." - Sophocles.

From T. S. Millington's "Testimony of the heathen to the Truths of Holy
Writ," 1863.

[Psa 66:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#012)

"Fire and water." The Jewish law required both these for purification of
spoil in war, where they could be borne. [Num
31:23](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#023) : "Everything that may abide the
fire, ye shall make it go through the fire, and it shall be clean:
nevertheless it shall be purified through the water of separation."
God's saints are, therefore, subject to both ordeals. - C. H. S.

[Psa 66:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#012)

"But thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place." Every word is sweetly
significant, and amplifies God's mercy to us. Four especially are
remarkable: - 1. The deliverer; 2. The deliverance; 3. The delivered;
and, 4. Their felicity or blessed advancement. So there is in the
deliverer, aliquid celsitudinis, "Thou;" in the delivery, certitudinis,
"broughtest out," in the delivered, solitudinis, "us;" in the happiness,
plenitudinis, "into a wealthy place." There is highness and lowness,
sureness and fulness. The deliverer is great, the deliverance is
certain, the distress grievous, the exaltation glorious. There is yet a
first word, that like a key unlocks this golden gate of mercy, a
veruntamen: - But. This is vox respirationis, a gasp that fetcheth back
again the very life of comfort. "But thou broughtest," etc. We were
fearfully endangered into the hands of our enemies; they rode and trode
upon us, and drove us through hard perplexities, "But thou," etc. If
there had been a full-point or period at our misery, if those gulfs of
persecution had quite swallowed us, and all our light of comfort had
been thus smothered and extinguished, we might have cried, Periit spes
nostra, yea, periit salus nostra. - Our hope, our help is quite gone. He
had mocked us that would have spoken, Be of good cheer. This same but is
like a happy oar, that turns our vessel from the rocks of despair, and
lands it at the haven of comfort. - Thomas Adams.

[Psa 66:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#012) (second and third clause)

1\. The outlet of the trouble is happy. They are in fire and water, yet
they get through them; we went through fire and water, and did not
perish in the flames or floods. Whatever the troubles of the saints are,
blessed be God there is away through them. 2. The inlet to a better
state is much more happy. "Thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place,"
into a well-watered place; for the word is, like the gardens of the
Lord, and therefore fruitful. - Matthew Henry.

[Psa 66:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#012) (last clause)

Thou, O God, with the temptation hast given the issue. "Thou broughtest
us out into a wealthy place." 1. Thou hast proved, and thou hast
brought. 2. Thou laidst the trouble, and thou tookest it off; yea, and
hast made us an ample recompense, for thou hast brought us to a moist,
pleasant, lovely, fertile, rich place, a happy condition, a flourishing
condition of things, so that thou hast made us to forget all our
trouble" - William Nicholson, in "David's Harp strung and tuned." 1662.

[Psa 66:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#012)

"A wealthy place." The hand of God led them in that fire and water of
affliction through which they went; but who led them out? The Psalmist
tells us in the next words: "Thou broughtest us out into a wealthy
place;" the margin saith, "into a moist place." They were in fire and
water before. Fire is the extremity of heat and dryness; water is the
extremity of moistness and coldness. A moist place notes a due
temperament of heat and cold, of dryness and moistness, and therefore
elegantly shadows that comfortable and contentful condition into which
the good hand of God had brought them, which is significantly expressed
in our translation by "a wealthy place;" those places flourishing most
in fruitfulness, and so in wealth, which are neither over hot nor over
cold, neither over dry nor over moist. - Joseph Caryl.

[Psa 66:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#013)

You see all the parts of this song; the whole concert or harmony of all
is praising God. You see quo loco, in his house; quo modo, with
burnt-offering; quo animo, paying our vows. - Thomas Adams.

[Psa 66:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#013)

"Burnt-offerings." For ourselves, be we sure that the best sacrifice we
can give to God is obedience; not a dead beast, but a living soul. The
Lord takes not delight in the blood of brutish creatures. It is the
mind, the life, the soul, the obedience, that he requires: [Sa1
15:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#022), "To obey is better than
sacrifice." Let this be our burnt offering, our holocaust, a sanctified
body and mind given up to the Lord, [Rom
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#001), [Rom
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#002). First, the heart: "My son, give
me thy heart." Is not the heart enough? No, the hand also: [Isa
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#016), Wash the hands from blood and
pollution. Is not the hand enough? No, the foot also: "Remove thy foot
from evil." Is not the foot enough? No, the lips also: "Guard the doors
of thy mouth;" [Psa 34:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#013), "Refrain
thy tongue from evil." Is not thy tongue enough? No, the ear also: "Let
him that hath ears to hear, hear." Is not the ear enough? No, the eye
also: "Let thine eyes be towards the Lord." Is not all this sufficient?
No, give body and spirit: [Co1 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#020),
"Ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in
your spirit, which are God's." When the eyes abhor lustful objects, the
ear slanders, the foot erring paths, the hands wrong and violence, the
tongue flattery and blasphemy, the heart pride and hypocrisy; this is
thy holocaust, thy whole burnt-offering. - Thomas Adams.

[Psa 66:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#013), [Psa
66:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#015)

In the "burnt-offerings," we see his approach to the altar with the
common and general sacrifice; and next, in his "paying rows," we see he
has brought his peace-offerings with him. Again, therefore, he says at
the altar: "I will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fallings" (ver
15). This is the general offering, brought from the best of his flock
and herd. Then follow the peace-offerings: "With the incense (קמדת,
fuming smoke) of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah." Having
brought his offerings, he is in no haste to depart, notwithstanding; for
his heart is full. Ere, therefore, he leaves the sanctuary, he utters
the language of a soul at peace with God: [Psa
66:16-20](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#016). This, truly, is one whom
"the very God of peace" has sanctified, and whose whole spirit, and
body, and soul he will preserve blameless unto the coming of the Lord
Jesus Christ. [Th1 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#023). - Andrew A.
Bonar.

[Psa 66:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#013)

He tells what were the vows he promised in his trouble, and says he
promised the richest sacrifices of cattle that could be made according
to the law. These were three: rams, cows, and goats. Rams included
lambs; cows included heifers; and goats, kids. - Robert Bellarmine.

[Psa 66:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#014)

"Which my lips have uttered." Hebrew, have opened: that is which I have
uttered, diductis labiis, with lips wide open. Videmus qualiter vota
nuncupari soleant, saith Vatablus. Here we see after what sort vows used
to be made, when we are under any pressing affliction; but when once
delivered, how heavily many come off in point of payment. - John Trapp.

[Psa 66:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#014)

Express mention is made of opened lips to indicate that the vows were
made with great vehemence of mind, and in a state of need and pressure;
so that his lips were broken through and widely opened. For the root,
פּצה contains the idea of opening anything with violence; to break open,
as the Latin expression is, rumpere labia. - Hermann Venema.

[Psa 66:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#015)

"I will offer," etc. Thou shalt have the best of the herd and of the
fold. - Adam Clarke.

[Psa 66:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#015)

"Fatlings." For as I will not come empty into thy house, so I will not
bring thee a niggardly present; but offer sacrifices of all sorts, and
the best and choicest in every kind. - Symon Patrick.

[Psa 66:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#015)

"Bullocks with goats." That is, I will liberally provide for every part
of the service at the tabernacle. - Thomas Scott.

[Psa 66:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#016)

"Come and hear, all ye that fear God." One reason why the saints are so
often inviting all that fear God to come unto them is, because the
saints see and know the great good that they shall get by those that
fear God. The children of darkness are so wise in their generation as to
desire most familiarity and acquaintance with those persons whom they
conceive may prove most profitable and advantageous to them, and to
pretend much friendship there where is hope of most benefit. And shall
not the saints, the children of light, upon the same account wish and
long for the society of those that fear God, because they see what great
good they shall gain by them? It is no wonder that the company of those
that fear God is so much in request, since it is altogether gainful and
commodious; it's no wonder they have many invitations, since they are
guests by which something is still gotten; and, indeed, among all
persons living, those that fear God are the most useful and enriching. -
Samuel Heskins, in "Soul Mercies Precious in the Eyes of Saints.... set
forth in a little Treatise on [Psa
66:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#016)." 1654.

[Psa 66:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#016)

"All ye that fear God." For such only will hear to good purpose; others
either cannot, or care not. "And I will declare," etc. Communicate unto
you my soul-secrets and experiments. There is no small good to be gotten
by such declarations. Bilney, perceiving Latimer to be zealous without
knowledge, came to him in his study and desired him for God's sake to
hear his confession. "I did so," saith Latimer, "and, to say the truth,
by his confession I learned more than afore in many years. So from that
time forward I began to smell the word of God, and forsake the
school-doctors, and such fooleries." - John Trapp.

[Psa 66:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#016)

"Ye that fear God." Observe the invitation given to those only "who fear
God," because "the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom;" he
loosens the feet to "come," opens the ears to "hear;" and therefore, he
who has no fear of God will be called to no purpose, either to come or
to hear. - Robert Bellarmine.

[Psa 66:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#016)

"I will declare." Consider the ends which a believer should propose in
the discharge of this duty \["of communicating Christian experience"\].
The principal end he should have in view when he declares his experience
is the glory of that God, who hath dealt so bountifully with him. He
would surely have the Lord exalted for his faithfulness and goodness to
him; he would have it published, that the name of the Lord might be
great; that sinners might know that his God is faithful to his word;
that he hath not only engaged to be "a present help in time of need,"
but that he hath found him in reality to be so. As he knows the enemies
of God are ready enough to charge him with neglect of his people,
because of the trials and afflictions they are exercised with; so he
would, in contradiction to them, declare what he hath found in his own
experience, that in very faithfulness he afflicts those that are dearest
to him. And with what lustre doth the glory of God shine, when his
children are ready to acknowledge that he never called them out to any
duty but his grace was sufficient for them; that he never laid his hand
upon them in any afflictive exercise, but he, at the same time, supplied
them with all those supports which they stood in need of? I say, for
Christians thus to stand up, on proper occasions, and bear their
experimental testimony to the faithfulness and goodness of God, what a
tendency hath it to make the name of the Lord, who hath been their
strong tower, glorious in the midst of the earth ... How may we blush
and be ashamed, that we have so much conversation in the world and so
little about what God hath done for our souls? It is a very bad sign
upon us, in our day, that the things of God are generally postponed;
while either the affairs of state, or the circumstances of outward life,
or other things, perhaps, of a more trifling nature, are the general
subjects of our conversation. What! are we ashamed Of the noblest, the
most interesting subject? It is but a poor sign that we have felt
anything of it, if we think it unnecessary to declare it to our fellow
Christians. What think you? Suppose any two of us were cast upon a
barbarous shore, where we neither understood the language nor the
customs of the inhabitants, and were treated by them with reproach and
cruelty; do you think we should not esteem it a happiness that we could
unburden ourselves to each other, and communicate our griefs and
troubles? And shall we think it less so, while we are in such a world as
this, in a strange land, and at a distance from our Father's house?
Shall we neglect conversing with each other? No; let our conversation
not only be in heaven, but about spiritual and heavenly things. - Samuel
Wilson (1703-1750), in "Sermons on Various Subjects."

[Psa 66:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#016)

"I will declare." After we are delivered from the dreadful apprehensions
of the wrath of God, it is our duty to be publicly thankful. It is for
the glory of our Healer to speak of the miserable wounds that once
pained us; and of that kind hand that saved us when we were brought very
low. It is for the glory of our Pilot to tell of the rocks and of the
sands; the many dangers and threatening calamities that he, by his wise
conduct, made us to escape: and to see us safe on the shore, may cause
others that are yet afflicted, and tost with tempests, to look to him
for help; for he is able and ready to save them as well as us. We must,
like soldiers, when a tedious war is over, relate our combats, our
fears, our dangers, with delight; and make known our experiences to
doubting, troubled Christians, and to those that have not yet been under
such long and severe trials as we have been. - Timothy Rogers
(1660-1729), in "A Discourse on Trouble of Mind."

[Psa 66:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#017)

This verse may be rendered thus: "I cried unto him with my mouth, and
his exaltation was under my tongue;" that is, I was considering and
meditating how I might lift up and exalt the name of God, and make his
praise glorious. Holy thoughts are said to be under the tongue when we
are in a preparation to bring them forth. - Joseph Caryl.

[Psa 66:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#017)

"He was extolled with my tongue." It is a proof that prayer has
proceeded from unworthy motives, when the blessings which succeed it are
not acknowledged with as much fervency as when they were originally
implored. The ten lepers all cried for mercy, and all obtained it, but
only one returned to render thanks. - John Morison.

[Psa 66:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#017)

"He was extolled with my tongue'" lit. "an extolling (of Him was) under
my tongue," implying fulness of praise ([Psa
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#007)). A store of praise being
conceived as under the tongue, whence a portion might be taken on all
occasions. The sense is, "scarcely had I cried unto him when, by
delivering me, he gave me abundant reason to extol him." ([Psa
34:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#006).) - A. R. Fausset.

[Psa 66:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#017)

"With my tongue." Let the praise of God be in thy tongue, under thy
tongue, and upon thy tongue, that it may shine before all men, and that
they may see that thy heart is good. The fish lucerna has a shining
tongue, from which it takes its name; and in the depths of the sea the
light of its tongue reveals it: if thy heart has a tongue, shining with
the praises of God, it will sufficiently show itself of what sort it is.
Hence the old saying, "Speak, that I may see thee." - Thomas Le Blanc.

[Psa 66:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#018)

"If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me." The very
supposition that "if he regarded iniquity in his heart, the Lord would
not hear him," implies the possibility that such may be the state even
of believers; and there is abundant reason to fear that it is in this
way their prayers are so often hindered, and their supplications so
frequently remain unanswered. Nor is it difficult to conceive how
believers may be chargeable with regarding iniquity in their heart, even
amidst all the solemnity of coming into the immediate presence of God,
and directly addressing him in the language of prayer and supplication.

It is possible that they may put themselves into such a situation, in a
state of mind but little fitted for engaging in that holy exercise; the
world, in one form or another, may for the time have the ascendancy in
their hearts; and there may have been so much formality in their
confessions, and so much indifference in their supplications, that when
the exercise is over, they could not honestly declare that they really
meant what they acknowledged, or seriously desired what they prayed for.
A Christian, it is true, could not be contented to remain in a state
like this; and, when he is awakened from it, as he sooner or later will
be, he cannot fail to look back upon it with humiliation and shame. But
we fear there are seasons in which believers themselves may make a very
near approach to such a state: and what then is the true interpretation
of prayers offered up at such a moment? It is in fact just saying, that
there is something which, for the time, they prefer to what they are
formally asking of God; that, though the blessings which they do ask may
be for a time withheld, yet they would find a compensation in the
enjoyment of the worldly things which do at the moment engross their
affections; and that, in reality, they would not choose to have at that
instant such an abundant communication of spiritual influence imparted
to them, as would render these worldly objects less valuable in their
estimation, and would turn the whole tide of their affections towards
spiritual things....

The Christian may sometimes betake himself to prayer, to ask counsel of
God in some perplexity regarding divine truth, or to seek direction in
some doubtful point of duty; but, instead of being prepared fairly to
exercise his judgment, in the hope that, while doing so, the
considerations that lie on the side of truth will be made to his mind
clear and convincing; he may have allowed his inclinations so to
influence and bias his judgment towards the side of error, or in favour
of the line of conduct which he wishes to pursue, that when he asks
counsel it may only be in the hope that his previous opinion will be
confirmed, and when he seeks direction it is in reality on a point about
which he was previously determined....

Another case is, I fear, but too common, and in which the believer may
be still more directly chargeable with regarding iniquity in his heart.
It is possible that there may be in his heart or life something which he
is conscious is not altogether as it should be - some earthly attachment
which he cannot easily justify - or some point of conformity to the
maxims and practices of the world, which he finds it difficult to
reconcile with christian principle; and yet all the struggle which these
have from time to time cost him, may only have been an effort of
ingenuity on his part to retain them without doing direct violence to
conscience - a laborious getting up of arguments whereby to show how
they may be defended, or in what way they may lawfully be gone into;
while the true and simple reason of his going into them, namely, the
love of the world, is all the while kept out of view. And, as an
experimental proof how weak and inconclusive all these arguments are,
and at the same time how unwilling he still is to relinquish his
favourite objects, he may be conscious that in confessing his sins he
leaves them out of the enumeration, rather because he would willingly
pass them over, than because he is convinced that they need not be
there; he may feel that he cannot and dare not make them the immediate
subject of solemn and deliberate communing with God; and, after all his
multiplied and ingenious defences, he may be reconciled to them at last,
only by ceasing to agitate the question whether they are lawful or not.
- Robert Gordon, D. D. 1825.

[Psa 66:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#018)

Whence is it that a man's regarding or loving sin in his heart hinders
his prayers from acceptance with God?

I. The first reason is, because in this case he cannot pray by the
Spirit. All prayers that are acceptable with God are the breathings of
his own Spirit within us. [Rom 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#026).
As without the intercession of Christ we cannot have our prayers
accepted, so without the intercession of the Spirit we cannot pray...

II\. The second reason is, because as long as a man regards iniquity in
his heart he cannot pray in faith; that is, he cannot build a rational
confidence upon any promise that God will accept him. Now, faith always
respects the promise, and promise of acceptance is made only to the
upright: so long, therefore, as men cherish a love of sin in their
heart, they either understand not the promises, and so they pray without
understanding, or they understand them, and yet misapply them to
themselves, and so they pray in presumption: in either case, they have
little cause to hope for acceptance....

III\. The third reason is, because while we regard iniquity in our
hearts we cannot pray with fervency; which, next to sincerity, is the
great qualification of prayer, to which God has annexed a promise of
acceptance ([Mat 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#012)): "The kingdom
of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force." [Mat
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#007) : Those only that seek are like to
find, and those that knock to have admittance; all which expressions
denote vehemence and importunity. Now, the cause of vehemence, in our
prosecution of any good, is our love of it; for proportionable to the
affection we bear to anything is the earnestness of our desires and the
diligence of our pursuit after it. So long, therefore, as the love of
sin possesses our hearts, our love to spiritual things is dull, heavy,
inactive, and our prayers for them must needs be answerable. O the
wretched fallacy that the soul will here put upon itself! At the same
time it will love its sin and pray against it; at the same time it will
entreat for grace, with a desire not to prevail: as a father confesses
of himself, that before his conversion he would pray for chastity, with
a secret reserve in his wishes that God would not grant his prayer. Such
are the mysterious, intricate treacheries by which the love of sin will
make a soul deceive and circumvent itself. How languidly and faintly
will it pray for spiritual mercies; conscience, in the meanwhile, giving
the lie to every such petition! The soul, in this case, cannot pray
against sin in earnest; it fights against it, but neither with hope nor
intent to conquer; as lovers, usually, in a game one against another,
with a desire to lose. So, then, while we regard iniquity, how is it
possible for us to regard spiritual things, the only lawful object of
our prayers? and, if we regard them not, how can we be urgent with God
for the giving of them? And where there is no fervency on our part no
wonder if there is no answer on God's. - Robert South. 1633-1716.

[Psa 66:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#018)

"If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me." Though
the subject-matter of a saint's prayer be founded on the word, yet if
the end he aims at be not levelled right, this is a door at which his
prayer will be stopped: "Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss,
that ye may consume it upon your lusts." [Jam
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#003). Take, I confess, a Christian in
his right temper, and he aims at the glory of God; yet, as a needle that
is touched With a loadstone may be removed from its point to which
nature hath espoused it, though trembling till it again recovers it; so
a gracious soul may in a particular act and request vary from this end,
being jogged by Satan, yea, disturbed by an enemy nearer home - his own
unmortified corruption. Do you not think it possible for a saint, in
distress of body and spirit, to pray for health in the one, and comfort
in the other, with too selfish a respect to his own case and quiet? Yes,
surely; and to pray for gifts and assistance in some eminent service,
with an eye to his own credit and applause; to pray for a child with too
inordinate a desire that the honour of his house may be built up in him.
And this may be understood as the sense, in part, of that expression,
"If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me." For
though to desire our own health, peace, and reputation, be not an
iniquity, when contained within the limits that God hath set; yet, when
they overflow to such a height, as to overtop the glory of God, yea, to
stand but in a level with it, they are a great abomination. That which
in the first or second degree is wholesome food, would be rank poison in
the fourth or fifth: therefore, Christian, catechize thyself, before
thou prayest: O, my soul, what sends thee on this errand? Know but thy
own mind what thou prayest for, and thou mayest soon know God's mind how
thou shalt speed. Secure God his glory, and thou mayest soon know God's
mind how thou shalt speed. - William Gurnall.

[Psa 66:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#018)

"If I regard iniquity in ray heart, the Lord will not hear me."

1\. They regard iniquity in their heart, who practise it secretly, Who
are under restraint from the world, but are not possessed of an habitual
fear of the omniscient God, the searcher of all hearts, and from whose
eyes there is no covering of thick darkness where the workers of
iniquity may hide themselves. [Jer
23:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#024).

2\. They regard iniquity in the heart, who entertain and indulge the
desire of sin, although in the course of providence they may be
restrained from the actual commission of it. I am persuaded the
instances are not rare, of men feeding upon sinful desires, even when
through want of opportunity, through the fear of man, or through some
partial restraint of conscience, they dare not carry them into
execution.

3\. They regard iniquity in their heart, who reflect upon past sins with
delight, or without sincere humiliation of mind. Perhaps our real
disposition, both towards sin and duty, may be as certainly discovered
by the state of our minds after, as in the time of action. The strength
and suddenness of temptation may betray even a good man into the
commission of sin; the backwardness of heart and power of inward
corruption may make duty burdensome and occasion many defects in the
performance; but every real Christian remembers his past sins with
unfeigned contrition of spirit, and a deep sense of unworthiness before
God; and the discharge of his duty, however difficult it may have been
at the time, affords him the utmost pleasure on reflection. It is
otherwise with many; they can remember their sins without sorrow, they
can speak of them without shame, and sometimes even with a mixture of
boasting and vain glory. Did you never hear them recall their past
follies, and speak of them with such relish, that it seems to be more to
renew the pleasure than to regret the sin? Even supposing such persons
to have forsaken the practice of some sins, if they can thus look back
upon them with inward complacency, their seeming reformation must be
owing to a very different cause from renovation of heart.

4\. They regard iniquity in the heart, who look upon the sins of others
with approbation; or, indeed, who can behold them without grief. Sin is
so abominable a thing so dishonouring to God and so destructive to the
souls of men that no real Christian can witness it without concern.
Hence it is so frequently taken notice of in Scripture, as the character
of a servant of God, that he mourns for the sins of others. [Psa
119:136](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#136), [Psa
119:158](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#158).

5\. In the last place, I suspect that they regard sin in the heart, who
are backward to bring themselves to the trial, and who are not truly
willing that God himself would search and try then. If any, therefore,
are unwilling to be tried, if they are backward to self-examination, it
is an evidence of a strong and powerful attach-meat to sin. It can
proceed from nothing but from a secret dread of some disagreeable
discovery, or the detection of some lust which they cannot consent to
forsake.... There are but too many who, though they live in the practice
of sin, and regard iniquity in their hearts, do yet continue their
outward attendance on the ordinances of divine institution, and at
stated times lay hold of the seals of God's covenant. Shall they find
any acceptance with him? No. He counts it a profane mockery; he counts
it a sacrilegious usurpation. [Psa
1:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001), [Psa
16:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#001), [Psa
17:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#001). Shall they have any comfort
in it? No: unless in so far as in righteous judgment he suffers them to
be deceived; and they are deceived, and they are most unhappy, who lie
longest under the delusion. [Psa
1:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001), [Psa
21:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#001). Shall they have any benefit
by it? No: instead of appeasing his wrath, it provokes his vengeance;
instead of enlightening their minds, it blinds their eyes; instead of
sanctifying their nature, it hardens their hearts. See a description of
those who had been long favoured with outward privileges and gloried in
them. [Joh 12:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#039), [Joh
12:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#040). So that nothing is more
essential to an acceptable approach to God in the duties of his worship
in general, and particularly to receiving the seals of his covenant,
than a thorough and universal separation from all known sin. [Job
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#013), [Job
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#014). - John Witherspoon (1722-1749),
in a Sermon entitled "The Petitions of the Insincere Unavailing."

[Psa 66:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#018), [Psa
66:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#019), [Psa
66:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#020)

Lord, I find David making a syllogism, in mood and figure, two
propositions he perfected. "If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord
will not hear me; but verily God hath heard me; he hath attended to the
voice of my prayer." Now I expected that David should have concluded
thus Therefore I regard not wickedness in my heart; but far otherwise he
concludes: "Blessed be God, which hath not turned away my prayer, nor
his mercy from me." Thus David hath deceived, but not wronged me. I
looked that he should have clapped the crown on his own, and he puts it
on God's head. I will learn this excellent logic; for I like David's
better than Aristotle's syllogisms, and whatsoever the premises be, I
make God's glory the conclusion. - Thomas Fuller.

[Psalms 66:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 66:1</span></span>

1 Make a joyful noise unto God, all ye lands:

2 Sing forth the honour of his name: make his praise glorious.

3 Say unto God, How terrible art thou in thy works! through the
greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee.

4 All the earth shall worship thee, and shall sing unto thee; they shall
sing to thy name. Selah.

[Psa 66:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#001)

"Make a joyful noise unto God." "In Zion," where the more instructed
saints were accustomed to profound meditation, the song was silent unto
God, and was accepted of him: but in the great popular assemblies a
joyful noise was more appropriate and natural, and it would be equally
acceptable. If praise is to be wide-spread, it must be vocal; exulting
sounds stir the soul and cause a sacred contagion of thanksgiving.
Composers of tunes for the congregation should see to it that their airs
are cheerful; we need not so much noise, as joyful noise. God is to be
praised with the voice, and the heart should go therewith in holy
exultation. All praise from all nations should be rendered unto the
Lord. Happy the day when no shouts shall be presented to Juggernaut or
Buddha, but all the earth shall adore the Creator thereof. All ye lands.
'Ye heathen nations, ye who have not known Jehovah hitherto, with one
consent let the whole earth rejoice before God. The languages of the
lands are many, but their praises should be one, addressed to one only
God.

[Psa 66:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#002)

"Sing forth the honour of his name." The noise is to be modulated with
tune and time, and fashioned into singing, for we adore the God of order
and harmony. The honour of God should be our subject, and to honour him
our object when we sing. To give glory to God is but to restore to him
his Own. It is our glory to be able to give God glory; and all our true
glory should be ascribed unto God, for it is his glory. "All worship be
to God only," should be the motto of all true believers. The name,
nature, and person of God are worthy of the highest honour. "Make his
praise glorious." Let not his praise be mean and grovelling: let it
arise with grandeur and solemnity before him. The pomp of the ancient
festivals is not to be imitated by us, under this dispensation of the
Spirit, but we are to throw so much of heart and holy reverence into all
our worship that it shall be the best we can render. Heart worship and
spiritual joy render praise more glorious than vestments, incense, and
music could do.

[Psa 66:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#003)

"Say unto God." Turn all your praises to him. Devotion, unless it be
resolutely directed to the Lord, is no better than whistling to the
wind. "How terrible art thou in thy works." The mind is usually first
arrested by those attributes which cause fear and trembling; and, even
when the heart has come to love God, and rest in him, there is an
increase of worship when the soul is awed by an extraordinary display of
the more dreadful of the divine characteristics. Looking upon the
convulsions which have shaken continents, the hurricanes which have
devastated nations, the plagues which have desolated cities, and other
great and amazing displays of divine working, men may well say: "How
terrible art thou in thy works." Till we see God in Christ, the terrible
predominates in all our apprehensions of him. "Through the greatness of
thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee;" but, as the
Hebrew clearly intimates, it will be a forced and false submission.
Power brings a man to his knee, but love alone wins his heart. Pharaoh
said he would let Israel go, but he lied unto God; he submitted in word
but not in deed. Tens of thousands, both in earth and hell, are
rendering this constrained homage to the Almighty; they only submit
because they cannot do otherwise; it is not their loyalty, but his
power, which keeps them subjects of his boundless dominion.

[Psa 66:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#004)

"All the earth shall worship thee, and shall sing unto thee." All men
must even now prostrate themselves before thee, but a time will come
when they shall do this cheerfully: to the worship of fear shall be
added the singing of love. What a change shall have taken place when
singing shall displace sighing, and music shall thrust out misery! "They
shall sing to thy name." The nature and works of God will be the theme
of earth's universal song, and he himself shall be the object of the
joyful adoration of our emancipated race. Acceptable worship not only
praises God as the mysterious Lord, but it is rendered fragrant by some
measure of knowledge of his name or character. God would not be
worshipped as an unknown God, nor have it said of his people, "Ye
worship ye know not what." May the knowledge of the Lord soon cover the
earth, that so the universality of intelligent worship may be possible:
such a consummation was evidently expected by the writer of this Psalm;
and, indeed, throughout all Old Testament writings, there are
intimations of the future general spread of the worship of God. It was
an instance of wilful ignorance and bigotry when the Jews raged against
the preaching of the gospel to the Gentiles. Perverted Judaism may be
exclusive, but the religion of Moses, and David, and Isaiah was not so.

"Selah." A little pause for holy expectation is well inserted after so
great a prophecy, and the uplifting of the heart is also a seasonable
direction. No meditation can be more joyous than that excited by the
prospect of a world reconciled to its Creator.

[Psalms 66:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 66:5</span></span>

5 Come and see the works of God: he is terrible in his doing toward the
children of men.

6 He turned the sea into dry land: they went through the flood on foot:
there did we rejoice in him.

7 He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations: let not
the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah.

[Psa 66:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#005)

"Come and see the works of God." Such glorious events, as the cleaving
of the Bed Sea and the overthrow of Pharaoh, are standing wonders, and
throughout all time a voice sounds forth concerning them - "Come and
see." Even till the close of all things, the marvellous works of God at
the Red Sea will be the subject of meditation and praise; for, standing
on the sea of glass mingled with fire, the triumphal armies of heaven
sing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb. It
has always been the favourite subject of the inspired bards, and their
choice was most natural. "He is terrible in his doing toward the
children of men." For the defence of his church and the overthrow of her
foes he deals terrific blows, and strikes the mighty with fear. O thou
enemy, wherefore dost thou vaunt thyself? Speak no more so exceeding
proudly, but remember the plagues which bowed the will of Pharaoh, the
drowning of Egypt's chariots in the Red Sea, the overthrow of Og and
Sihon, the scattering of the Canaanites before the tribes. This same God
still liveth, and is to be worshipped with trembling reverence.

[Psa 66:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#006)

"He turned the sea into dry land." It was no slight miracle to divide a
pathway through such a sea, and to make it fit for the traffic of a
whole nation. He who did this can do anything, and must be God, the
worthy object of adoration. The Christian's inference is that no
obstacle in his journey heavenward need hinder him, for the sea could
not hinder Israel, and even death itself shall be as life; the sea shall
be dry land when God's presence is felt. "They went through the flood on
foot." Through the river the tribes passed dry-shod, Jordan was afraid
because of them.

"What ail'd thee, O thou mighty sea?

Why roll'd thy waves in dread?

What bade thy tide, O Jordan, flee

And bare its deepest bed?

O earth, before the Lord, the God

Of Jacob, tremble still;

Who makes the waste a water'd sod,

The flint a gushing rill."

"There did we rejoice in him." We participate this day in that ancient
joy. The scene is so vividly before us that it seems as if we were there
personally, singing unto the Lord because he hath triumphed gloriously.
Faith casts herself bodily into the past joys of the saints, and
realises them for herself in much the same fashion in which she projects
herself into the bliss of the future, and becomes the substance of
things hoped for. It is to be remarked that Israel's joy was in her God,
and there let ours be. It is not so much what he has done, as what he
is, that should excite in us a sacred rejoicing. "He is my God, and I
will prepare him an habitation; my father's God, and I will exalt him."

[Psa 66:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#007)

"He ruleth by his power for ever." He has not deceased, nor abdicated,
nor suffered defeat. The prowess displayed at the Heal Sea is
undiminished: the divine dominion endures throughout eternity. "His eyes
behold the nations." Even as he looked out of the cloud upon the
Egyptians and discomfited them, so does he spy out his enemies, and mark
their conspiracies. His hand rules and his eye observes, his hand has
not waxed weak, nor his eye dim. As so many grasshoppers he sees the
people and tribes, at one glance he takes in all their ways. He oversees
all and overlooks none. "Let not the rebellious exalt themselves." The
proudest have no cause to be proud. Could they see themselves as God
sees them they would shrivel into nothing. Where rebellion reaches to a
great head, and hopes most confidently for success, it is a sufficient
reason for abating our fears, that the Omnipotent ruler is also an
Omniscient observer. O proud rebels, remember that the Lord aims his
arrows at the high-soaring eagles, and brings them down from their nests
among the stars. "He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and
exalted them of low degree." After a survey of the Red Sea and Jordan,
rebels, if they were in their senses, would have no more stomach for the
fight, but would humble themselves at the Conqueror's feet. "Selah."
Pause again, and take time to bow low before the throne of the Eternal.

[Psalms 66:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 66:8</span></span>

8 O bless our God, ye people, and make the voice of his praise to be
heard:

9 Which holdeth our soul in life, and suffereth not our feet to be
moved.

10 For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou hast tried us, as silver is
tried.

11 Thou broughtest us into the net; thou laidst affliction upon our
loins.

12 Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and
through water: but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place.

[Psa 66:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#008)

"O bless our God, lie people." Ye chosen seed, peculiarly beloved, it is
yours to bless your covenant God as other nations cannot. Ye should lead
the strain, for he is peculiarly your God. First visited by his love, ye
should be foremost in his praise. "And make the voice of his praise to
be heard." Whoever else may sing with bated breath, do you be sure to
give full tongue and volume to the song. Compel unwilling ears to hear
the praises of your covenant God. Make rocks, and hills, and earth, and
sea, and heaven itself to echo with your joyful shouts.

[Psa 66:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#009)

"Which holdeth our soul in life." At any time the preservation of life,
and especially the soul's life, is a great reason for gratitude, but
much more when we are called to undergo extreme trials, which of
themselves would crush our being. Blessed be God, who, having put our
souls into possession of life, has been pleased to preserve that
heaven-given life from the destroying power of the enemy. "And suffereth
not our feet to be moved." This is another and precious boon. If God has
enabled us not only to keep our life, but our position, we are bound to
give him double praise. Living and standing is the saint's condition
through divine grace. Immortal and immovable are those whom God
preserves. Satan is put to shame, for instead of being able to slay the
saints, as he hoped, he is not even able to trip them up. God is able to
make the weakest to stand fast, and he will do so.

[Psa 66:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#010)

"For thou, O God, hast proved us." He proved his Israel with sore
trials. David had his temptations. All the saints must go to the proving
house; God had one Son without sin, but he never had a son without
trial. Why ought we to complain if we are subjected to the rule which is
common to all the family, and from which so much benefit has flowed to
them? The Lord himself proves us, who then shall raise a question as to
the wisdom and the love which are displayed in the operation? The day
may come when, as in this case, we shall make hymns out of our griefs,
and sing all the more sweetly because our mouths have been purified with
bitter draughts. "Thou hast tried us, as silver is tried." Searching and
repeated, severe and thorough, has been the test; the same result has
followed as in the case of precious metal, for the dross and tin have
been consumed, and the pure ore has been discovered. Since trial is
sanctified to so desirable an end, ought we not to submit to it with
abounding resignation.

[Psa 66:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#011)

"Thou broughtest us into the net." The people of God in the olden time
were often enclosed by the power of their enemies, like fishes or birds
entangled in a net; there seemed no way of escape for them. The only
comfort was that God himself had brought them there, but even this was
not readily available, since they knew that he had led them there in
anger as a punishment for their transgressions; Israel in Egypt was much
like a bird in the fowler's net. "Thou laidst affliction upon our
loins." They were pressed even to anguish by their burdens and pains.
Not on their backs alone was the load, but their loins were pressed and
squeezed with the straits and weights of adversity. God's people and
affliction are intimate companions. As in Egypt every Israelite was a
burden-bearer, so is every believer while he is in this foreign land. As
Israel cried to God by reason of their sore bondage, so also do the
saints. We too often forget that God lays our afflictions upon us; if we
remembered this fact, we should more patiently submit to the pressure
which now pains us. The time will come when, for every ounce of present
burden, we shall receive a far more exceeding and eternal weight of
glory.

[Psa 66:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#012)

"Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads." They stormed, and
hectored, and treated us like the mire of the street. Riding the high
horse, in their arrogance, they, who were in themselves mean men,
treated the Lord's people as if they were the meanest of mankind. They
even turned their captives into beasts of burden, and rode upon their
heads, as some read the Hebrew. Nothing is too bad for the servants of
God when they fall into the hands of proud persecutors. "We went through
fire and through water." Trials many and varied were endured by Israel
in Egypt, and are still the portion of the saints. The fires of the
brick-kilns and the waters of the Nile did their worst to destroy the
chosen race; hard labour and child-murder were both tried by the tyrant,
but Israel went through both ordeals unharmed, and ever thus the church
of God has outlived, and will outlive, all the artifices and cruelties
of man. Fire and water are pitiless and devouring, but a divine fiat
stays their fury, and forbids these or any other agents from utterly
destroying the chosen seed. Many an heir of heaven has had a dire
experience of tribulation; the fire through which he has passed has been
more terrible than that which chars the bones, for it has fed upon the
marrow of his spirit, and burned into the core of his heart; while the
waterfloods of affliction have been even more to be feared than the
remorseless sea, for they have gone in even unto the soul, and carried
the inner nature down into deeps horrible, and not to be imagined
without trembling. Yet each saint has been more than conqueror hitherto,
and, as it has been, so it shall be. The fire is not kindled which can
burn the woman's seed, neither does the dragon know how to vomit a flood
which shall suffice to drown it. "But thou broughtest us out into a
wealthy place." A blessed issue to a mournful story. Canaan was indeed a
broad and royal domain for the once enslaved tribes: God, who took them
into Egypt, also brought them into the land which flowed with milk and
honey, and Egypt was in his purposes en route to Canaan, The way to
heaven is via tribulation.

"The path of sorrow and that path alone,

Leads to the land where sorrow is unknown,"

How wealthy is the place of every believer, and how doubly does he feel
it to be so in contrast with his former slavery, what songs shall
suffice to set forth our joy and gratitude for such a glorious
deliverance and such a bountiful heritage, More awaits us. The depth of
our griefs bears nonproportion to the height of our bliss. For our shame
we shall have double, and more than double. Like Joseph we shall rise
from the prison to the palace, like Mordecai we shall escape the gallows
prepared by malignity, and ride the white horse and wear the royal robe
appointed by; benignity. Instead of the net, liberty; instead of a
burden on the loins, a crown on our heads; instead of men riding 'over
us, we shall rule over the nations' fire shall no more try us, for we
shall stand in glory on the sea of glass mingled with fire; and water
shall not harm us, for there shall be no more sea. O the splendour of
this brilliant conclusion to a gloomy history. Glory be unto him who saw
in the apparent evil the true way to the real good. With patience we
will endure the present gloom, for the morning cometh. Over the hills
faith sees the daybreak, in whose light We shall enter into the wealthy
place.

[Psalms 66:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 66:13</span></span>

13 I will go into thy house with burnt offerings. I will pay thee my
vows,

14 Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I was in
trouble.

15 will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings, with the incense
of rams; will offer bullocks with goats. Selah.

[Psa 66:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#013)

"I will." The child of God is so sensible of his own personal
indebtedness to grace, that he feels he must utter a song of his own. He
joins in the common thanksgiving, but since the best public form must
fail to meet each individual case, he makes sure that the special
mercies received by him shall not be forgotten, for he records them with
his own pen, and sings of them with his own lips. "I will go into thy
house with burnt offerings;" the usual sacrifices of godly men. Even the
thankful heart dares not come to God without a victim of grateful
praise; of this as well as of every other form of worship, we may Say,
"the blood is the life thereof." Reader, never attempt to come before
God without Jesus, the divinely promised, given, and accepted burnt
offering. "I will pay thee my vows." He would not appear before the Lord
empty, but at the same time he would not boast of what he offered,
seeing it was all due on account of former vows. After all, our largest
gifts are but payments; when we have given all, we must confess, "O
Lord, of thine own have we given unto thee." We should be slow in making
vows, but prompt in discharging them. When we are released from trouble,
and can once more go up to the house of the Lord, we should take
immediate occasion to fulfil our promises. How can we hope for help
another time, if we prove faithless to covenants voluntarily entered
upon in hours of need.

[Psa 66:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#014)

"Which my lips have uttered," or vehemently declared; blurted out, as we
say in common speech. His vows had been wrung from him; extreme distress
burst open the door of his lips, and out rushed the vow like a long
pent-up torrent, which had at last found a vent. What we were so eager
to vow, we should be equally earnest to perform; but, alas! many a vow
runs so fast in words that it lames itself for deeds. "And my mouth hath
spoken." He had made the promise public, and had no desire to go back;
an honest man is always ready to acknowledge a debt. "When I was in
trouble." Distress suggested the vow; God in answer to the vow removed
the distress, and now the votary desires to make good his promise. It is
well for each man to remember that he was in trouble, proud spirits are
apt to speak as if the road had always been smooth for them, as if no
dog dare bark at their nobility, and scarce a drop of rain would venture
to besprinkle their splendour; yet these very upstarts were probably
once so low in spirits and condition that they would have been glad
enough of the help of those they now despise. Even great Caesar, whose
look did awe the world, must have his trouble and become weak as other
men; so that his enemy could say in bitterness, "When the fit was on
him, I did mark how he did shake." Of the strong and vigorous man the
nurse could tell a tale of weakness, and his wife could say of the
boaster, "I did hear him groan; his coward lips did from their colour
fly." All men have trouble, but they act not in the same manner while
under it; the profane take to swearing and the godly to praying. Both
bad and good have been known to resort to vowing, but the one is a liar
unto God, and the other a conscientious respecter of his word.

[Psa 66:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#015)

"I will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of failings." The good man will
give his best things to God. No starveling goat upon the hills will be
present at the altar, but the well-fed bullocks of the luxuriant
pastures shall ascend in smoke item the sacred fire. He who is miserly
with God is a wretch indeed. Few devise liberal things, but those few
find a rich reward in so doing. "With the incense of rams." The smoke of
burning rams should also rise from the altar; he would offer, the
strength and prime of his flocks as well as his herds. Of all we have we
should give the Lord his portion, and that should be the choicest we can
select. It was no waste to burn the fat upon Jehovah's altar, nor to
pour the precious ointment upon Jesus's head; neither are large gifts
and bountiful offerings to the church of God any diminution to a man's
estate: such money is put to good interest and placed where it cannot be
stolen by thieves nor corroded by rust. "I will offer bullets with
goats." A perfect sacrifice, completing the circle of offerings, should
show forth the intense love of his heart. We should magnify the Lord
with the great and the littler. None of his ordinances Should be
disregarded; we must not omit either the bullocks or the goats. In these
three verses we have gratitude in action, not content with words, but
proving its own sincerity by deeds of obedient sacrifice.

"Selah." It is most fit that we should suspend the song while the smoke
of the victims ascends the heavens: let the burnt-offerings stand for
praises while we meditate upon the infinitely greater sacrifice of
Calvary.

[Psalms 66:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 66:16</span></span>

16 Come and hear, all ye that fear God and I will declare what he hath
done for my soul.

17 I cried unto him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my tongue.

18 If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me:

19 But verily God hath heard me; he hath attended to the voice of my
prayer.

20 Blessed be God, which hath not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy
from me.

[Psa 66:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#016)

"Come and hear." Before, they were bidden to come and see. Heating is
faith's seeing. Mercy comes to us by way of ear-gate. "Hear, and your
soul shall live." They saw how terrible God was, but they heard how
gracious he was. "All ye that fear God." These are a fit audience when a
good man is about to relate his experience; and it is well to select our
hearers when inward soul matters are our theme. It is forbidden us to
throw pearls before swine. We do not want to furnish wanton minds with
subjects for their comedies, and therefore it Is wise to speak of
personal spiritual matters where they can be understood, and not where
they will be burlesqued. All God-fearing men may hear us, but far hence
ye profane. "And I will declare what he hath done for my soul." I will
count and recount the mercies of God to me, to my soul, my best part, my
most real self. Testimonies ought to be borne by all experienced
Christians, in order that the younger and feebler sort may be encouraged
by the recital to put their trust in the Lord. To declare man's doings
is needless; they are too trivial, and, besides, there are trumpeters
enough of man's trumpery deeds; but to declare the gracious acts of God
is instructive, consoling, inspiriting, and beneficial in many respects.
Let each man speak for himself, for a personal witness is the surest and
most forcible; second-hand experience is like "cauld kale her again;" it
lacks the flavour of first-hand interest. Let no mock modesty restrain
the grateful believer from speaking of himself, or rather of God's
dealings to himself, for it is justly due to God; neither let him shun
the individual use of the first person, which is most correct in
detailing the Lord's ways of love; We must not be egotists, but we must
be egotists when we bear witness for the Lord.

[Psa 66:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#017)

"I cried unto him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my tongue." It
Is well when prayer and praise go together, like the horses in Pharaoh's
chariot. Some cry who do not sing, and some sing who do not cry: both
together are best. Since the Lord's answers so frequently follow close
at the heels of our petitions, and even overtake them, it becomes us to
let our grateful praises keep pace with our humble prayers. Observe that
the Psalmist did both cry and speak; the Lord hast cast the dumb devil
out of his children, and those of them who are least fluent with their
tongues are often the most eloquent with their hearts.

[Psa 66:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#018)

"If I regard iniquity in my heart." If, having seen it to be there, I
continue to gaze upon it without aversion; if I cherish it, have a side
glance of love towards it, excuse it, and palliate it; "The Lord will
not hear me." How can he? Can I desire him to connive at my sin, and
accept me while I wilfully, cling to any evil way? Nothing hinders
prayer like iniquity harboured in the breast; as with Cain, so with us,
sin lieth at the door, and blocks the passage. If thou listen to the
devil, God will not listen to thee. If thou refusest to hear God's
commands, he will surely refuse to hear thy prayers. An imperfect
petition God will hear for Christ's sake, but not one which is wilfully
mis-written by a traitor's hand. For God to accept our devotions, while
we are delighting in sin, would be to make himself the God of
hypocrites, which is a fitter name for Satan than for the Holy One of
Israel.

[Psa 66:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#019)

"But verily God hath heard me." Sure sign this that the petitioner was
no secret lover of sin, The answer to his prayer was a fresh assurance
that his heart was sincere before the Lord. See how sure the Psalmist is
that he has been heard; it is with him no hope, surmise, or fancy, but
he seals it with a "verily." Facts are blessed things when they reveal
both God's heart as loving and our own heart as sincere. "He hath
attended to the voice of my prayer." He gave his mind to consider my
cries, interpreted them, accepted them, and replied to them; and therein
proved his grace and also my uprightness of heart. Love of sin is a
plague spot, a condemning mark, a killing sign, but those Prayers, which
evidently live and prevail with God, most clearly arise from a heart
which is free from dalliance with evil. Let the reader see to it, that
his inmost soul be rid of all alliance with inquiry, all toleration of
secret lust, or hidden wrong.

[Psa 66:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#020)

"Blessed be God." Be his name honoured and loved. "Which hath not turned
away my prayer, nor his mercy from me." He has neither withdrawn his
love nor my liberty to pray. He has neither cast out my prayer nor me.
His mercy and my cries still meet each other. The Psalm ends on its key
note. Praise all through is its spirit and design. Lord enable us to
enter into it. Amen.
