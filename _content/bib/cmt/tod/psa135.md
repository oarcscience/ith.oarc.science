### [Psalms Chapter 135](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 135:0</span></span>

General Remarks. - This Psalm has no title. It is mainly made up of
selections from other Scriptures. It has been called a mosaic, and
compared to a tessellated pavement. At the outset, its [Psa
135:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#001) are taken from [Psa
134:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#001); while the latter part of [Psa
135:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#002) and the commencement of [Psa
135:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#003) put us in mind of [Psa
116:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#019); and [Psa
135:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#004) suggests [Deu
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#006). Does not [Psa
135:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#005) remind us of [Psa
95:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#003)? As for [Psa
135:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#007), it is almost identical with
[Jer 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#013), which may have been taken
from it. The passage contained in [Psa
135:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#013) is to be found in [Exo
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#015), and [Psa
135:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#014) in [Deu
32:36](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#036). The closing verses, [Psa
135:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#008), are in Ps. 136 From [Psa
135:15-21](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#015) the strain is a repetition
of Ps 115. This process of tracing the expressions to other sources
might be pushed further without straining the quotations; the whole
Psalm is a compound of many choice extracts, and yet it has all the
continuity and freshness of an original poem. The Holy Spirit
occasionally repeats himself; not because he has any lack of thoughts or
words, but because it is expedient for us that we hear the same things
in the same form. Yet, when our great Teacher uses repetition, it is
usually with instructive variations, which deserve our careful
attention.

Division. - [Psa 135:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#001) contain an
exhortation to praise Jehovah for his goodness ([Psa
135:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#003)), for his electing love ([Psa
135:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#004)), his greatness ([Psa
135:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#005)), his judgments ([Psa
135:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#008)), his unchanging character
([Psa 135:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#013)), and his love towards
his people. This is followed by a denunciation of idols ([Psa
135:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#015)), and a further exhortation
to bless the name of the Lord. It is a song full of life, vigour,
variety, and devotion.

Hints to Preachers

[Psa 135:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#001). -

I. The Employment. Praise three times commended, and in three respects.

1\. With respect to God: not his works merely, but himself.

2\. With respect to ourselves: it is pleasant and profitable.

3\. With respect to others: it best recommends our religion to all who
hear it. All others are religions of fear, ours of joy and praise.

II\. The Persons' servants in attendance at his house, who stand there
by appointment, ready to hear, ready to obey.

III\. The Motives.

1\. In general. It is due to God, because he is good; and it is pleasant
to us: [Psa 135:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#003).

2\. In particular. Those who are specially privileged by God should
specially praise him: [Psa 135:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#004).
"This people have I formed for myself; they shall show forth my praise."
- G. R.

[Psa 135:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#001). - "Praise ye the Lord."

I. The Lord ought to be praised.

II\. He ought to be praised by you.

III\. He ought to be praised now: let us remember his present favours.

IV\. He ought to be praised in everything for ever.

[Psa 135:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#001). - "Praise him, O ye
servants of the Lord."

I. Praise him for the privilege of serving him.

II\. Praise him for the power to serve him.

III\. Praise him for the acceptance of your service.

IV\. Praise him as the chief part of your service.

V. Praise him that others may be induced to engage in his service. - W.
H. J. P.

[Psa 135:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#002). - What is at this day "the
house of the Lord"? Who may be said to stand in it? What special reasons
have they for praise?

[Psa 135:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#002). - The nearer to God, the
dearer to God; and the better our place, the sweeter our praise. - W. B.
H.

[Psa 135:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#002). - "Our God," "Our Lord."
Sweet subject. See our Exposition.

[Psa 135:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#003). - Praise the Lord,

I. For the excellence of his nature.

II\. For the revelation of his name.

III\. For the pleasantness of his worship.

[Psa 135:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#004). - It is a song of praise,
and therefore election is mentioned because it is a motive for song.

I. The Choice - "The Lord hath chosen." Divine. Sovereign. Gracious.
Immutable.

II\. The Consecration - "Chosen Jacob to himself." To know him. To
preserve his truth. To maintain his worship. To manifest his grace. To
keep alive the hope of the Coming One.

III\. The Separation - implied in the special choice. By being taken
into covenant: Abraham and his seed. By receiving the covenant
inheritance: Canaan. By redemption. By power and by blood out of Egypt.
Wilderness separation. Settled establishment in their own land.

IV\. The Elevation. In name - from Jacob to Israel. In value - from
worthless to precious. In purpose and use - crown jewels. In
preservation - kept as treasures. In delight - God rejoices in his
people as his heritage.

[Psa 135:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#005). - "I know that the Lord is
great."

I. By observing nature and providence.

II\. By reading his word.

III\. By my own conversion, comfort. and regeneration.

IV\. By my after-experience.

V. By my overpowering communion with him.

[Psa 135:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#005). - Delicious dogmatism. "I
know," etc.

I. What I know.

1\. The Lord.

2\. That he is great.

3\. That he is above all.

II\. Why I know it.

1\. Because he is "our Lord."

2\. By his operations in nature, providence, and grace ([Psa
135:6-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#006))

III\. My incorrigible obstinacy in this regard is proof against
worshippers of all other gods: which gods are effeminate; without
sovereignty; no god, or any god. - W. B. H.

[Psa 135:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#006). - "Whatsoever the Lord
pleased, that did he." God's good pleasure in the work of grace. Seen,
not in the death of the wicked, [Eze
33:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#011); but in the election of his
people, [Sa1 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#022); in the infliction
of suffering on the substitute, [Isa
53:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#010); in the provision of all fulness
for his people in Christ, [Col 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#019),
in the arrangement of salvation by faith in Christ, [Joh
6:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#039); in instituting preaching as the
means of salvation, [Co1 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#021); in the
adoption of believers as his children, [Eph
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#005); in their sanctification, [Th1
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#003); in their ultimate triumph and
reign, [Luk 12:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#032). - C. A. D.

[Psa 135:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#006) (last words). - The power
of God in places of trouble, change, and danger - seas; and in
conditions of sin, weakness, despair, perplexity - in all deep places.

[Psa 135:6-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#006). - The Resistless
Pleasure of Jehovah.

I. Behold it as here exemplified:

1\. Ruling all nature.

2\. Overturning a rebellious nation.

3\. Making sport of kings and crowns.

4\. Laying a fertile country at the feet of the chosen.

II\. Be wise in view thereof.

1\. Submit to it, it sweeps the seas, and lays hands on earth and
heaven.

2\. Think not to hide from it, the "ends of the earth" and "all deep
places" are open to it; it is swifter than its own lightnings.

3\. Be awed by its majesty, God's way is strewn with crowns and the
bones of kings.

4\. Seek its protection: its mightiest efforts are in defence of those
it favours.

5\. Let the Lord's people fear not with so great a God, and so
exhaustless an armoury. - W. B. H.

[Psa 135:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#013). - "Thy name, O Lord,
endureth for ever."

I. As the embodiment of perfection, God's attributes and glory.

II\. As the object of veneration, "Holy and reverend is his name."

III\. As the cause of salvation: "For my name's sake," etc.

IV\. As the centre of attraction: "In his name shall the Gentiles
trust." "Our desire is to the remembrance of thy name." "Where two or
three are gathered in my name," etc.

V. As a plea in supplication: "For thy name's sake, pardon," etc.
"Hitherto ye have asked nothing in my name."

VI\. As a warrant for action: "Whatsoever ye do, do all in the name,"
etc.

VII\. As a refuge in tribulation: "The name of the Lord is a strong
tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe." "I have kept them in
thy name."

VIII\. As a mark of glorification: "I will write upon him the name of my
God."

IX\. As a terror to transgressors: "My name is dreadful among the
heathen." - W. J.

[Psa 135:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#014). - "The Lord will judge
his people." Others would like to do it, but must not. The world has
seven judgment-days in every week, but shall not be able to condemn the
saints. He himself will judge. How will he judge them?

I. Their persons, as to whether they are in or out of Christ.

II\. Their principles, as to whether they are genuine or spurious.

III\. Their prayers, as to whether they are availing or useless.

IV\. Their profession, as to whether it is true or false.

V. Their procedure, as to whether it is good or bad. - W. J.

[Psa 135:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#014). -

I. The position of believers - "his people, his servants."

II\. The discipline of God's family.

III\. The tenderness of the Lord to them.

IV\. The safety of believers: they are still the Lord's.

[Psa 135:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#015). - "Silver and gold."
These are idols in our own land, among worldlings, and with some
professors. Show the folly and wickedness of loving riches. and the
evils which come of it.

[Psa 135:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#016), [Psa
135:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#017). - The Portrait of many.

I. "Mouths, but they speak not." No prayer, praise, confession.

II\. "Eyes, but they see not." Discern not, understand not, take no
warning; do not look to Christ.

III\. "Ears, but they hear not." Attend no ministry, or are present but
unaffected; hear not God.

IV\. "Neither is there any breath in their mouths." No life, no tokens
of life, no prayer and praise which are the breath of spiritual life.

[Psa 135:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#018). -

I. Men make idols like themselves.

II\. The idols make their makers like themselves. Describe both
processes.

[Psa 135:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#019). - "House of Israel." The
Lord's great goodness to all his people, perceived and proclaimed, and
the Lord praised for it.

[Psa 135:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#019). - "House of Aaron." God's
blessing on Aaron's house typical of his grace to those who are priests
unto God.

[Psa 135:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#019). -

I. The Exhortation.

1\. To bless the Lord.

2\. To bless him in his own house.

II\. To whom it is addressed.

1\. To the house of Israel, or the whole church.

2\. To the house of Aaron, or ministers of the sanctuary.

3\. To the house of Levi, or the attendants upon ministers, and
assistants in the services.

4\. To all who fear God, wherever they may be. Even they who fear God
are invited to praise him, which is a sure sign that he delighteth in
mercy. - G. R.

[Psa 135:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#020). - The Levites, their
history, duties, rewards, and obligations to bless God.

[Psa 135:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#020) (second clause). -

I. The fear of God includes all religion.

II\. The fear of the Lord suggests praise.

III\. The fear of the Lord renders praise acceptable.

[Psa 135:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#021). -

I. The double fact.

1\. Blessing perpetually ascending from Zion to God.

2\. God perpetually blessing his people by dwelling with them in Zion.

II\. The double reason for praise, which is found in the double fact,
and concerns every member of the church.

Explanatory Notes and Quaint Sayings

Whole Psalm

This glorious Psalm of universal praise, placed at the end of the "Songs
of Up-goings," which flow into it, and find their response in it, may be
likened to a large and beautiful lake, into which rivers discharge their
waters, and lose themselves in its calm expanse. - Chr. Wordsworth.

Whole Psalm

This Psalm differs from that which went before. Its drift is not only to
stir up the priests and Levites, as it was in the former, to this duty
of praising God, but the people also: and that,

I. Because the arguments which here he brings to press this duty, did in
common concern both priests and people; and,

II\. Because that clause, which is here added, "in the courts of the
house of our God," may be extended to the people, as well as to the
priests, seeing there were some courts in the Temple which were for the
people to worship God in. - Arthur Jackson.

Whole Psalm

This is a song of praise to the Lord for his goodness as the Lord of
creation, in seven verses; for his grace as the deliverer of his people,
in seven more, and for his unity as the only true and living God, in
seven more. - James G. Murphy.

Whole Psalm

This seems to have been the morning hymn which the Levites were called
upon to sing at the opening of the gates of the Temple; and, as some
think, the one before was used at shutting them in the evening. - John
Kitto, in "The Pictorial Bible."

[Psa 135:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#001)

This verse and the following are word for word with [Psa
134:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#001), and are now repeated, with the
view of keeping up the praise then and there commenced. - Robert
Bellarmine.

[Psa 135:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#001)

"Praise ye the Lord." Hallelujah is the Hebrew word. It signifies
"Praise ye the Lord." - By this the faithful do provoke one another to
give thanks unto God, and they cheer up their hearts and tune their
spirits to perform this duty in the best manner, by making this preface
as it were thereunto. True joy of the Holy Ghost will not endure to be
kept and cooped up in any one man's breast and bosom, but it striveth to
get companions both for the pouring out and imparting of itself unto
them, that they may be filled and refreshed out of this spring of joy;
as also that itself may be the more increased and inflamed by the united
rejoicing of many good hearts together, that are all baptized in one
spirit, and are thereby made able to inflame and to edify one another. -
Thomas Brightman (1557-1607), in "The Revelation of St. John
Illustrated."

[Psa 135:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#001)

"Praise ye the name of the Lord. - "That is, the Lord himself, and the
perfections of his nature; his greatness, goodness, grace, and mercy;
his holiness, justice, power, truth, and faithfulness. Also his word, by
which he makes known himself: this is a distinguishing blessing to his
people, for which he is to be praised: see [Psa
48:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#001), and [Psa
147:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#019), [Psa
147:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#020). - John Gill.

[Psa 135:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#001)

"The name of the Lord." - The first discovery of the name I am, which
signifies the Divine eternity, as well as immutability, was for the
comfort of the oppressed Israelites in Egypt: [Exo
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#014), [Exo
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#015). It was then published from the
secret place of the Almighty, as the only strong cordial to refresh
them. It hath not yet, it shall not ever, lose its virtue in any of the
miseries that have or shall successively befall the church. 'Tis as
durable as the God whose name it is: he is still I AM and the same to
the church as he was then to his Israel. His spiritual Israel have a
greater right to the glories of it than the carnal Israel could have. No
oppression can be greater than theirs; what was a comfort suited to that
distress hath the same suitableness to every other oppression. It was
not a temporary name, but a name for ever, his "memorial to all
generations" ([Psa 135:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#015)), and
reacheth to the church of the Gentiles, with whom he treats as the God
of Abraham, ratifying that covenant by the Messiah, which he made with
Abraham the father of the faithful. - Stephen Charnock.

[Psa 135:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#001)

"The name of the Lord." Jehovah is called "the name" as far exceeding
all other names, and as being proper and peculiar only to the true God.
Other things are sometimes called gods, but nothing is or can be called
Jehovah but only the Almighty Creator of the world. "That men may know,"
saith David, "that thou, whose name is Jehovah, art the Most High over
all the earth": [Psa 83:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#018). From his
calling himself JEHOVAH the Lord, we may easily gather what kind of
thoughts he would have us, his creatures, entertain in our minds
concerning him. When we think of him, we must raise our thoughts above
all things else, and think of him as the Universal Being of the world,
that gives essence and existence to all things in it: as Jehovah, the
Being in whom we particularly, as well as other things, live and move,
and have our being, as Jehovah, the Lord paramount over the whole world,
to whom all angels and archangels in heaven, with all the kings and
kingdoms upon earth, are entirely subject - as Jehovah, in whom all
perfections are so perfectly united that they are all but one infinite
perfection: as Jehovah, knowledge itself, always actually knowing all
things that ever were, or are, or will be, or can be known - as Jehovah,
wisdom itself, always contriving, ordering, and disposing of all, and
everything, in the best order, after the best manner, and to the best
possible end: as Jehovah, power, omnipotence itself; continually doing
what he wills, only by willing it should be done, and always working
either with means or without means, as he himself sees good - as
Jehovah, light and glory itself, shining forth in and by and through
everything that is made or done in the whole world as Jehovah, holiness,
purity, simplicity, greatness, majesty, eminency, super-eminency itself,
infinitely exalted above all things else, existing in, and of himself,
and having all things else continually subsisting in him: as Jehovah,
goodness itself, doing and making all things good, and so communicating
his goodness to all his creatures as to be the only fountain of all the
goodness that is in any of them - as Jehovah, justice and righteousness
itself, giving to all their due, and exacting no more of any man than
what is absolutely due to him: as Jehovah, mercy itself, pardoning and
forgiving all the sins that mankind commit against him, as soon as they
repent and turn to him: as Jehovah, patience and longsuffering itself,
bearing a long time, even with those who continue in their rebellions
against him, waiting for their coming to a due sense of their folly and
madness, that he may be gracious and merciful to them; as Jehovah, love
and kindness, and bounty itself, freely distributing his blessings among
all his creatures, both good and bad, just and unjust, those that love
him, and those that love him not: as Jehovah, truth and faithfulness
itself, always performing what he promiseth to his people: as Jehovah,
infinitude, immensity itself, in all things, to all things, beyond all
things, everywhere, wholly, essentially, continually present, as
Jehovah, constancy, immutability, eternity itself, without any
variableness, or shadow of change; yesterday, to-day, and for ever the
same. In a word, when we think of the Most High God, Father, Son, and
Holy Ghost, we should think of him as Jehovah, Unity in Trinity, Trinity
in Unity, Three Persons, One Being, One Essence, One Lord, One Jehovah,
blessed for ever. This is that glorious, that Almighty being, which the
Psalmist here means when he saith, "Praise ye the name of the Lord." -
William Beveridge, 1636-1708.

[Psa 135:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#001)

"Praise him, O ye servants of the Lord." For ye will do nothing out of
place by praising your Lord as servants. And if ye were to be for ever
only servants, ye ought to praise the Lord; how much more ought those
servants to praise the Lord who have obtained the privilege of sons? -
Augustine.

[Psa 135:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#001)

"Praise," "praise, praise." When duties are thus inculcated, it noteth
the necessity and excellency thereof; together with our dulness and
backwardness thereunto. - John Trapp.

[Psa 135:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#001), [Psa
135:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#002), [Psa
135:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#021)

"Praise." To prevent any feeling of weariness which might arise from the
very frequent repetition of this exhortation to praise God, it is only
necessary to remember that there is no sacrifice in which he takes
greater delight than in the expression of praise. Thus ([Psa
1:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001) :14), "Sacrifice unto the Lord
thanksgiving, and pay thy vows unto the Most High;" and ([Psa
116:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#012), [Psa
116:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#013)), "What shall I render unto the
Lord for all his benefits toward me? I will take the cup of salvation,
and call upon the name of the LOAD." Particular attention is to be paid
to those passages of Scripture which speak in such high terms of that
worship of God which is spiritual; otherwise we may be led, in the
exercise of a misguided zeal, to spend our labour upon trifles, and in
this respect imitate the example of too many who have wearied themselves
with ridiculous attempts to invent additions to the service of God,
while they have neglected what is of all other things most important.
That is the reason why the Holy Spirit so repeatedly inculcates the duty
of praise. It is that we may not undervalue, or grow careless in this
devotional exercise. It implies, too, an indirect censure of our
tardiness in proceeding to the duty; for he would not reiterate the
admonition were we ready and active in the discharge of it. - John
Calvin.

[Psa 135:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#001), [Psa
135:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#002), [Psa
135:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#003)

As Gotthold was one day passing a tradesman's house, he heard the notes
of a Psalm, with which the family were concluding their morning meal. He
was deeply affected, and, with a full heart, said to himself, O my God,
how pleasing to my ears is the sound of thy praise, and how comforting
to my soul the thought that there are still a few who bless thee for thy
goodness. Alas, the great bulk of mankind have become brutalized, and
resemble the swine, which in harvest gather and fatten upon the acorns
beneath the oak, but show to the tree, which bore them, no other thanks
than rubbing off its bark, and tearing up the sod around it. In former
times, it was the law in certain monasteries, that the chanting of the
praise of God should know no interruption, and that one choir of monks
should, at stated intervals, relieve another in the holy employment. To
the superstition and trust in human works, of which there may have been
here a mixture, we justly assign a place among the wood, hay, and
stubble ([Co1 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#012)). At the same time
it is undeniably right that thy praise should never cease; and were men
to be silent, the very stones would cry out. We must begin eternal life
here below, not only in our conscience, but also with our praise. Our
soul ought to be like a flower, not merely receiving the gentle
influence of heaven, but, in its turn, and as if in gratitude, exhaling
also a sweet and pleasant perfume. It should be our desire, as it once
was that of a pious man, that our hearts should melt and dissolve like
incense in the fire of love, and yield the sweet fragrance of praise; or
we should be like the holy martyr who professed himself willing to be
consumed, if from his ashes a little flower might spring and blossom to
the glory of God. We should be ready to give our very blood to fertilize
the garden of the church, and render it more productive of the fruit of
praise.

Well, then, my God, I will praise and extol thee with heart and mouth to
the utmost of my power. Oh, that without the interruptions which eating,
and drinking, and sleep require, I could apply myself to this heavenly
calling! Every mouthful of air which I inhale is mixed with the goodness
which preserves my life; let every breath which I exhale be mingled at
least with a hearty desire for thy honour and praise.

Hallelujah! Ye holy angels, ye children of men, and all ye creatures,
praise the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name together. - Christian
Scriver \[Gotthold\], 1629-1693.

[Psa 135:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#003)

"Praise the Lord." Hallelujah (praise to Jah!) for good (is) Jehovah,
Make music to his name, for it is lovely. The last words may also be
translated, he is lovely, i.e. an object worthy of supreme attachment. -
Joseph Addison Alexander.

[Psa 135:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#003)

"Praise the Lord; for the Lord is good." That is, originally,
transcendently, effectively; he is good, and doeth good ([Psa
119:68](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#068)), and is therefore to be
praised with mind, mouth, and practice. - John Trapp.

[Psa 135:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#003)

"Sing praises unto his name; for it is pleasant." The work of praising
God hath a sort of reward joined with it. When we praise God most we get
much benefit by so doing: it is so comely in itself, so pleasant unto
God, and profitable to the person that offereth praises, so fit to cheer
up his spirit, and strengthen his faith in God, whose praises are the
pillars of the believer's confidence and comfort, that a man should be
allured thereunto, "Sing praises unto his name; for it is pleasant;" and
this is the second motive or reason to praise God \[the first being that
"the Lord is good"\]. - David Dickson.

[Psa 135:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#004)

"For the Lord hath chosen," etc. God's distinguishing grace should make
his elect lift up many a humble, joyful, and thankful heart to him. -
John Trapp.

[Psa 135:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#004)

"Jacob, Israel." Praise the Lord for enrolling you in this company. To
quicken you in this work of praise, consider what you were; you were not
a people, God raised you up from the very dunghill to this preferment;
remember your past estate. Look, as old Jacob considered what he had
been when God preferred him ([Gen
32:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#010)); "With my staff I passed over
this Jordan, and now I am become two bands;" so do you say, I am a
worthless creature, it is God that hath taken me into his grace, praised
be the Lord that hath chosen me. Then consider how many are left to
perish in the wide world. Some live out of the church's pale that never
heard of Christ, and many others have only a loose general form of
Christianity. Oh! blessed be God that hath chosen me to be of the number
of his peculiar people. It is said ([Zac
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#008)), "And it shall come to pass in
all the land, saith the Lord, that two parts shall be cut off and die,
but the third shall be left therein." We pass through many bolters
before we come to be God's peculiar people, as the corn is ground,
bolted, searched before it comes to be fine flour. Many have not the
knowledge of God, and others live in the church but are carnal; and for
me to be one of his peculiar people, a member of Christ's mystical body,
oh! what a privilege is this! And then what moved him to all this?
Nothing but his own free grace. Therefore praise the Lord. - Thomas
Manton.

[Psa 135:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#004)

"His peculiar treasure." The Hebrew word segullah signifieth God's
special jewels, God's proper ones, or God's secret ones, that he keeps
in store for himself, and for his own special service and use. Princes
lock up with their own hands in secret their most precious and costly
jewels; and so doth God his, "For the Lord hath chosen Jacob unto
himself, and Israel for his peculiar treasure," or for his secret gain.
- Thomas Brooks.

[Psa 135:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#004)

"His peculiar treasure." Will not a man that is not defective in his
prudentials secure his jewels? "They shall be mine in that day when I
make up my jewels, and I will spare them as a father his son that
serveth him'" [Mal 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#017). If a house be
on fire, the owner of it will first take care of his wife and children,
then of his jewels, and last of all, of his lumber and rubbish. Christ
secures first his people, for they are his jewels; the world is but
lumber and rubbish. - Richard Mayhew.

[Psa 135:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#005)

"For I know." The word "I" is made emphatic in the original. Whatever
may be the case with others, I have had personal and precious experience
of the greatness of Jehovah's power, and of his infinite supremacy above
all other gods. The author of the Psalm may either speak for all Israel
as a unit, or he may have framed his song so that every worshipper might
say this for himself as his own testimony. - Henry Cowles.

[Psa 135:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#005)

"For I know that the Lord is great," etc. On what a firm foundation does
the Psalmist plant his foot - "I know!" One loves to hear men of God
speaking in this calm, undoubting, and assured confidence, whether it be
of the Lord's goodness or of the Lord's greatness. You may perhaps say,
that it required no great stretch of faith or knowledge, or any amount
of bravery, to declare that God was great; but I think that not many
wise nor mighty had in the Psalmist's days attained unto his knowledge
or made his confession, that Jehovah, the God of Israel, was "above all
gods." Baal and Chemosh, and Milcom and Dagon, claimed the fealty of the
nations round about; and David, in the Court of Achish, would have found
his declaration as unwelcome, as it would have been rejected as untrue.
Moses once carried a message from Jehovah to the king of Egypt, and his
reply was, "Who is the Lord, that I should obey his voice? I know not
the Lord;" and even of Jehovah's peculiar treasure, all were not Israel
that were of Israel.

There is a knowledge that plays round the head, like lightning on a
mountain's summit, that leaves no trace behind; and there is a knowledge
that, like the fertilizing stream, penetrates into the very recesses of
the heart, and issues forth in all the fruits of holiness, of love, and
peace, and joy for evermore. - Barton Bouchier.

[Psa 135:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#006)

"Whatsoever the Lord pleased, that did he," etc. He was not forced to
make all that he made, but all that he willed he made. His will was the
cause of all things which he made. Thou makest a house, because if thou
didst not make it thou wouldest be left without a habitation, necessity
compels thee to make a home, not free-will. Thou makest a garment,
because thou wouldest go about naked if thou didst not make it; thou art
therefore led to making a garment by necessity, not by free-will. Thou
plantest a mountain with vines, thou sowest seed, because if thou didst
not do so, thou wouldest not have food; all such things thou doest of
necessity. God has made all things of his goodness. He needed nothing
that he made; and therefore he hath made all things that he willed.

He did whatsoever he willed in the heaven and earth, dost thou do all
that thou wiliest even in thy field? Thou wiliest many things, but canst
not do all thou wishest in thy own house. Thy wife, perchance, gainsays
thee, thy children gainsay thee, sometimes even thy servant
contumaciously gainsays thee, and thou doest not what thou wiliest. But
thou sayest, I do what I will, because I punish the disobedient and
gainsayer. Even this thou doest not when thou wiliest. - Augustine.

[Psa 135:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#006)

"Whatsoever the Lord pleased, that did he," etc. God's will obtains and
hath the upper hand everywhere. Down man, down pope, down devil; you
must yield; things shall not be as you will, but as God will! We may
well say, "Who hath resisted his will?" [Rom
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#019). Many, indeed, disobey, and sin
against the will of his precept; but none ever did, none ever shall,
frustrate or obstruct the will of his purpose; for he will do all his
pleasure, and in his way mountains shall become a plain. - William
Slater ( - 1704), in "The Morning Exercises."

[Psa 135:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#006)

Upon the Arminian's plan (if absurdity can deserve the name of a plan),
the glorious work of God's salvation, and the eternal redemption of
Jesus Christ, are not complete, unless a dying mortal lends his arm;
that is, unless he, who of himself can do nothing, vouchsafe to begin
and accomplish that which all the angels in heaven cannot do; namely, to
convert the soul from Satan to God. How contrary is all this to the
language of Scripture - how repugnant to the oracles of truth I
"Whatsoever the Lord pleased, that did he in heaven and in earth." -
Ambrose Serle ( - 1815), in "Horae Solitariae."

[Psa 135:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#006)

"In heaven and in the earth," etc. His power is infinite. He can do what
he will do everywhere; all places are there named but purgatory; perhaps
he can do nothing there, but leaves all that work for the Pope. - Thomas
Adams.

[Psa 135:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#006)

"In the seas, and all deep places." He did wonders in the mighty waters:
more than once he made the boisterous sea a calm, and walked upon the
surface of it; and as of old he broke up the fountains of the great
deep, and drowned the world; and at another time dried up the sea, and
led his people through the depths, as through a wilderness; so he will
hereafter bind the old serpent, the devil, and cast him into the abyss,
into the great deep, the bottomless pit, where he will continue during
the thousand years' reign of Christ with his saints. - John Gill.

[Psa 135:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#006)

The word "pleaseth" limits the general note or particle "all" unto all
works which in themselves are good, or else serve for good use, and so
are pleasing to the Lord for the use sake. He doth not say that the Lord
doth all things which are done, but all things which he pleaseth, that
is, he doth not make men sinful and wicked, neither doth he work
rebellion in men, which is displeasing unto him; but he doth whatsoever
is pleasing, that is, all things which are agreeable to his nature. And
whatsoever is according to his will and good pleasure, that he doth, for
none can hinder it. This is the true sense and meaning of the words. -
George Walker, in "God made visible in his Works," 1641.

[Psa 135:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#006)

"Whatsoever the Lord pleased, that did he," etc. With reference to the
government of Providence, it is said of God, that "he doeth according to
his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth."
Even insensible matter is under his control. Fire and hail, snow and
vapour, and stormy wind, fulfil his word: and with reference to
intelligent agents, we are told that he maketh the most refractory, even
the wrath of man, to praise him, and the remainder of wrath he
restrains. The whole Bible exhibits Jehovah as so ordering the affairs
of individuals, and of nations, as to secure the grand purpose he had in
view in creating the world, - viz., the promotion of his own glory, in
the salvation of a multitude which no man can number, of all nations,
and kindreds, and tribes, and peoples, and tongues. One of the most
prominent distinctions between divine revelation and ordinary history
is, that when the same general events are narrated, the latter exhibits
- (it is its province so to do - it is not able indeed to do more,) the
agency of man, the former, the agency of God. Profane history exhibits
the instruments by which Jehovah works; the finger of divine revelation
points to the unseen but almighty hand which wields and guides the
instrument, and causes even Herod and Pontius Pilate, together with the
Jews and the people of Israel, to do what the hand and the counsel of
God determined before to be done. - George Payne, in "Lectures on
Christian Theology," 1850.

[Psa 135:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#007)

"He causeth the vapours to ascend," etc. Dr. Halley made a number of
experiments at St. Helena as to the quantity of water that is daily
evaporated from the sea, and he found that ten square inches of the
ocean's surface yielded one cubic inch of water in twelve hours - a
square mile therefore yields 401,448,960 cubic inches, or 6,914 tons of
water. From the surface of the Mediterranean Sea during a summer's day
there would pass off in invisible vapour five thousand millions of tons
of water. This being only for one day, the quantity evaporated in a year
would be 365 times greater, and in two thousand years it would amount to
four thousand billions of tons, which evaporation would in time empty
the Mediterranean Sea; but we have good reason for believing that there
is as much water there now as in the time of the Romans, therefore the
balance is kept up by the downpour of rain, the influx of the rivers,
and the currents from the Atlantic.

Now let us consider the amount of power required for all this
evaporation. Mr. Joule, whose experiments have given to the world so
much valuable information, says that if we had a pool of water one
square mile and six inches in depth to be evaporated by artificial heat,
it would require the combustion of 30,000 tons of coal to effect it;
therefore to evaporate all the water that ascends from the earth it
would take 6,000,000,000,000 (six billion) tons, or more than all the
coal that could be stowed away in half-a-dozen such worlds as this; and
yet silently and surely has the process of evaporation been going on for
millions of years. - Samuel Kinns, in "Moses and Geology," 1882.

[Psa 135:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#007)

"He causeth the vapours to ascend," etc. There is no physical necessity
that the boiling-point of water should occur at two hundred and twelve
degrees of the Fahrenheit scale. As far as we know, it might have been
the same with the boiling-points of oil of turpentine, alcohol or ether.
We shall see the benevolence of the present adjustment by noticing some
of the consequences which would follow if any change were made.

The amount of vapour given off at ordinary temperatures by any liquid
depends on the temperature at which it boils. If the boiling-point of
water were the same as that of alcohol, the vapour given off by the
ocean would be two and a half times as much as at present. Such an
excess of aqueous vapour would produce continual rains and inundations,
and would make the air too damp for animal, and too cloudy for vegetable
life. If water boiled at the same temperature as ether, the vapour
rising from the ocean would be more than twenty-five times as much as at
present. In such a state of things no man could see the sun on account
of the clouds; the rain would be so excessive as to tear up the soil and
wash away plants; inundations would be constant, and navigation would be
impossible in the inland torrents which would take the place of our
rivers. In winter the snow of one day might bury the houses. If, on the
other hand, water boiled at the same temperature with oil of turpentine,
the vapour given off by the ocean would be less than one-fourth of its
present amount. In this case rain would be a rarity, like an eclipse of
the sun, the dryness of the desert of Sahara would be equalled in a
large part of the globe, which would, therefore, be bare of vegetation,
and incapable of sustaining animal life. Plants would be scorched by
unclouded sunshine, springs and rivulets would be dry, and inland
navigation would cease; for nearly all the rain would be absorbed by the
porous earth.

We see, then, that the boiling-point of water has been adjusted to
various relations. It is adjusted to the capacity of space to contain
aqueous vapour in a transparent state; if it were higher than two
hundred and twelve degrees, the earth would be scorched by an unclouded
sun; if it were lower, it would droop under continual shade. It is
suited to the demand of plants for water; if it were higher, they would
suffer from drought; if it were lower, they would be torn up by floods.
It is in harmony with the texture of the soil; if it were higher, the
earth would absorb all the rain which falls; if it were lower, the soil
would often be washed away by the surface torrents after a shower. It is
adapted to the elevation of the continents above the sea; if it were
higher, rivers with their present inclination would be so shallow as to
be often dry; if it were lower, most rivers would be so deep as to be
torrents, while the land would be covered with floods. - Professor
Hemholtz.

[Psa 135:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#007)

"To ascend from the ends of the earth." Rains in England are often
introduced by a south-east wind. "Vapour brought to us by such a wind
must have been generated in countries to the south and east of our
island. It is therefore, probably, in the extensive valleys watered by
the Meuse, the Moselle, and the Rhine, if not from the more distant
Elbe, with the Oder and the Weser, that the water rises, in the midst of
sunshine, which is soon afterwards to form our clouds, and pour down our
thunder-showers." "Drought and sunshine in one part of Europe may be
necessary to the production of a wet season in another." - William
Whewell (1795-1866), in "The Bridgwater Treatise" \[Astronomy and
General Physics\], 1839.

[Psa 135:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#007)

"From the surface of the earth raising the vapours." The whole
description is beautifully exact and picturesque. Not "the ends," or
even "the summits" or "extreme mountains," for the original is in the
singular number (קצה), but from the whole of the extreme layer, the
superficies or surface of the earth; from every point of which the great
process of exhalation is perpetually going on to supply the firmament
with refreshing and fruitful clouds. - John Mason Good.

[Psa 135:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#007)

"He maketh lightnings for the rain." When the electrical clouds are much
agitated, the rain generally falls heavily, and if the agitation is
excessive, it hails. As the electricity is dissipated by the frequent
discharges the cloud condenses and there comes a sudden and heavy rain;
but the greater the accumulation of electricity, the longer is the rain
delayed. Thus connected as the electrical phenomena of the atmosphere
are with clouds, vapour, and rain, how forcibly are we struck with these
appropriate words in the Scriptures. - Edwin Sidney, in "Conversations
on the Bible and Science," 1866.

[Psa 135:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#007)

"He maketh lightnings for the rain." Dr. Russell, in his description of
the weather at Aleppo, in September, tells us, that seldom a night
passes without much lightning in the north-west quarter, but not
attended with thunder; and that when this lightning appears in the west
or south-west points, it is a sure sign of the approaching rain, which
is often followed with thunder. This last clause, which is not perfectly
clear, is afterwards explained in his more enlarged account of the
weather of the year 1746, when he tells us that though it began to be
cloudy on the 4th of September, and continued so for a few days, and
even thundered, yet no rain fell till the 11th, which shows that his
meaning was, that the lightning in the west or south-west points, which
is often followed with thunder, is a sure sign of the approach of rain.
I have before mentioned that a squall of wind and clouds of dust are the
usual forerunners of these first rains. Most of these things are taken
notice of in [Psa 135:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#007); [Jer
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#013); [Jer
51:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#016); and serve to illustrate them.
Russell's account determines, I think, that the Nesiim, which our
translators render vapours, must mean, as they elsewhere translate the
word, clouds. It shows that God "maketh lightnings for the rain," they,
in the west and south-west points, being at Aleppo the sure prognostics
of rain. The squalls of wind bring on these refreshing showers, and are
therefore "precious things" of the "treasuries" of God. - Thomas Harmer.

[Psa 135:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#007)

"He maketh lightnings for the rain." The Psalmist mentions it as another
circumstance calling for our wonder, that lightnings are mixed with
rain, things quite opposite in their nature one from another. Did not
custom make us familiar with the spectacle, we would pronounce this
mixture of fire and water to be a phenomenon altogether incredible. The
same may be said of the phenomena of the winds. Natural causes can be
assigned for them, and philosophers have pointed them out; but the
winds, with their various currents, are a wonderful work of God, he does
not merely assert the power of God, be it observed, in the sense in
which philosophers themselves grant it, but he maintains that not a drop
of rain falls from heaven without a divine commission or dispensation to
that effect. All readily allow that God is the author of rain, thunder,
and wind, in so far as he originally established the order of things in
nature; but the Psalmist goes farther than this, holding that when it
rains, this is not effected by a blind instinct of nature, but is the
consequence of the decree of God, who is pleased at one time to darken
the sky with clouds, and at another to brighten it again with sunshine.
- John Calvin.

[Psa 135:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#007)

"He maketh lightnings for the rain." It is a great instance of the
divine wisdom and goodness, that lightning should be accompanied by
rain, to soften its rage, and prevent its mischievous effects. Thus, in
the midst of judgment, does God remember mercy. The threatenings in his
word against sinners are like lightning; they would blast and scorch us
up, were it not for his promises made in the same word to penitents,
which, as a gracious rain, turn aside their fury, refreshing and
comforting our affrighted spirits. - George Horne.

[Psa 135:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#007)

"He bringeth the wind out of his treasuries." That is, say some, out of
the caves and hollow places of the earth; but I rather conceive that
because the wind riseth many times on a sudden, and as our Saviour saith
([Joh 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#008)), "we cannot tell whence it
cometh," therefore God is said here to bring it forth, as if he had it
locked up in readiness in some secret and hidden treasuries or
storehouses. - Arthur Jackson.

[Psa 135:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#007)

"He bringeth the wind." The winds are with great beauty, represented as
laid up by him as jewels in a treasure house. Indeed, few verses better
express creative control, than those in which the winds, which make
sport of man's efforts and defy his power, are represented as thus ready
to spring forth at God's bidding from the quarters where they quietly
sleep. The occasion comes, the thoughts of Jehovah find expression in
his providence, and his ready servants leap suddenly forth: "He bringeth
the winds out of his treasuries." But this bringing forth is not for
physical purposes only; it is for great moral and spiritual ends also.
Take one illustration out of many. His people were on the edge of
deepest and most brutish idolatry. They were ready to fall into a most
degraded form of idol worship, when he offered to them that ever
yearning heart of Fatherly love: "Thus saith the Lord, Learn not the way
of the heathen." Their God is only "the tree cut out of the forest,"
silvered over, or decked with gold; "upright as the palm tree, but
speaks not; the stock is a doctrine of vanities; but the Lord is the
true God; he maketh lightnings with rain; he bringeth the wind out of
his treasures." [Jer 10:2-16](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#002). Thus,
too, the words of Agur to Ithiel and Ucal, "He hath gathered the wind in
his fists." [Pro 30:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#004). - John Duns, in
"Science and Christian Thought," 1868.

[Psa 135:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#008)

"Who smote the firstborn of Egypt." The firstborn only were smitten;
these were singled out in every family with unerring precision, the
houses of the Israelites, wherever the blood of the lamb was sprinkled
on the door-posts, being passed over. The death of all those thousands,
both of man and beast, took place at the same instant - "at midnight."

Is God unrighteous, then, that taketh vengeance? No; this is an act of
retribution. The Egyptians had slain the children of the Israelites,
casting their infants into the river. Now the affliction is turned upon
themselves; the delight of their eyes is taken from them; all their
firstborn are dead, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat upon his
throne, unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon. -
Thomas Millington, in "Signs and Wonders in the Land of Ham," 1873.

[Psa 135:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#008)

"And beast." The Egyptians worshipped many animals, and when the
firstborn of the sacred animals died the circumstance greatly increased
the impressiveness of the plague as an assault upon the gods of Egypt. -

"Who sent tokens and wonders." - "Tokens," that is, signs or evidences
of the Divine power. "Wonders," things fitted to impress the mind with
awe; things outside of the ordinary course of events; things not
produced by natural laws, but by the direct power of God. The allusion
here is, of course, to the plagues of Egypt, as recorded in Exodus. -
Albert Barnes.

[Psa 135:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#010)

"Who smote great nations," etc. It is better that the wicked should be
destroyed a hundred times over than that they should tempt those who are
as yet innocent to join their company. Let us but think what might have
been our fate, and the fate of every other nation under heaven at this
hour, had the sword of the Israelites done its work more sparingly. Even
as it was, the small portions of the Canaanites who were left, and the
nations around them, so tempted the Israelites by their idolatrous
practices that we read continually of the whole people of God turning
away from his service. But, had the heathen lived in the land in equal
numbers, and, still more, had they intermarried largely with the
Israelites, how was it possible humanly speaking, that any sparks of the
light of God's truth should have survived to the coming of Christ? Would
not the Israelites have lost all their peculiar character; and if they
had retained the name of Jehovah as of their God, would they not have
formed as unworthy notions of his attributes, and worship him with a
worship as abominable as that which the Moabites paid to Chemosh or the
Philistines to Dagon?

But this was not to be, and therefore the nations of Canaan were to be
cut off utterly. The Israelites, sword, in its bloodiest executions,
wrought a work of mercy for all the countries of the earth to the very
end of the world. They seem of very small importance to us now, these
perpetual contests with the Canaanites, and the Midianites, and the
Ammonites, and the Philistines, with which the Books of Joshua and
Judges and Samuel are almost filled. We may half wonder that God should
have interferred in such quarrels, or have changed the course of nature,
in order to give one of the nations of Palestine the victory over
another. But in these contests, on the fate of one of these nations of
Palestine the happiness of the human race depended. The Israelites
fought not for themselves only, but for us. It might follow that they
should thus be accounted the enemies of all mankind, - it might be that
they were tempted by their very distinctness to despise other nations;
still they did God's work, instill they preserved unhurt the seed of
eternal life, and were the ministers of blessing to all other nations,
even though they themselves failed to enjoy it. - Thomas Arnold,
1795-1842.

[Psa 135:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#010)

"Who smote great nations," etc. Let us not stand in fear of any enemies
that rise up against us, and conspire to hinder the peace of the church,
and stop the passage of the gospel; when God beginneth to take the cause
of his people into his own hand, and smitteth any of his enemies on the
jaw-bone, the rest are reserved to the like destruction. For wherefore
doth God punish his adversaries, and enter into judgment with them?
Wherefore doth he visit them, and strike them down with his right hand!
Is it only to take vengeance, and to show his justice in their
confusion? No, it serveth for the comfort and consolation of his
servants, that howsoever God be patient, yet in the end they shall not
escape. - William Attersoll, 1618.

[Psa 135:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#011)

"Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og." Notice is taken of two kings,
Sihon and Og, not as being more powerful than the rest, but because
shutting up the entrance to the land in front they were the most
formidable enemies met with, and the people, besides, were not as yet
habituated to war. - John Calvin.

[Psa 135:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#011)

"Sihon king of the Amorites." When Israel arrived on the borders of the
promised Land they encountered Sihon. ([Num
21:21](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#021).) He was evidently a man of very
great courage and audacity. Shortly before the time of Israel's arrival
he had dispossessed the Moabites of a splendid territory, driving them
south of the natural bulwark of the Arnon with great slaughter and the
loss of a great number of captives ([Num
21:26-29](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#026)). When the Israelite host
appears, he does not hesitate or temporize like Balak, but at once
gathers his people together and attacks them. But the battle was his
last. He and all his host were destroyed, and their district from Arnon
to Jabbok became at once the possession of the conqueror.

Josephus (Ant, [Psa 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#005), 2) has
preserved some singular details of the battle, which have not survived
in the text either of the Hebrew or lxx. He represents the Amorite army
as containing every man in the nation fit to bear arms lie states that
they were unable to fight when away from the shelter of their cities,
and that being especially galled by the slings and arrows of the
Hebrews, and at last suffering severely from thirst, they rushed to the
stream and to the recesses of the ravine of the Arnon. Into these
recesses they were pursued by their active enemy and slaughtered in vast
numbers.

Whether we accept these details or not, it is plain, from the manner in
which the name of Sihon fixed itself in the national mind, and the space
which his image occupies in the official records, and in the later
poetry of Israel, that he was a truly formidable chieftain. - George
Grove, in Smith's Dictionary of the Bible, 1863.

[Psa 135:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#011)

Sihon, although conqueror of Moab, and much more formidable than the
Canaanites whom Israel had feared at Kadesh, fell easily because Israel
fought in faith. There is no adversary that can really offer any
effectual opposition to our onward march if assailed in the strength of
Christ with a cheerful courage.

Og the king of Bashan was much more formidable even than Sihon, but he
seems to have fallen yet more easily, judging from the brief notice of
the conquest. Even so, when once we have overcome a difficulty or
conquered an evil habit in the strength of faith, other conquests open
out before us readily and naturally which we should not have dared to
contemplate before. It is most true in religion that "nothing succeeds
like success." - R. Winterbotham, in "The Pulpit Commentary," 1881.

[Psa 135:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#011)

"Og king of Bashan." The task was not an easy one, for Edrei - "the
strong" - Og's capital, was in ordinary circumstances almost
unassailable, since it was, strange to say, built in a hollow
artificially scooped out of the top of a hill, which the deep gorge of
the Hieromax isolates from the country round. Its streets may be still
seen running in all directions beneath the present town of Adraha. But
Kenath, in the district called Argob - "the stony" - was still stronger,
for it was built in the crevices of a great island of lava which has
split, in cooling, into innumerable fissures, through whose labyrinth no
enemy could safely penetrate. In these were its streets and houses, some
of which, of a later date, with stone doors, turning on hinges of stone,
remain till this day.... Nor were these the only fastnesses. No fewer
than sixty cities "fenced with high walls, gates, and bars" ([Deu
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#005)), had to be taken; but they all
fell, sooner or later, before the vigorous assaults of the invaders,
and, long afterwards, there might be seen, in the capital of their
allies, the Ammonites, one of the trophies of the campaign - the
gigantic iron bedstead of King Og, or as some think, the huge
sarcophagus he had prepared for himself, as was the custom with
Canaanite kings. - Cunningham Geikie, in "Hours with the Bible," 1881.

[Psa 135:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#012)

"Their land for an heritage." The land was given to them to be
transmitted from father to son, by hereditary right and succession. -
Joseph Addison Alexander.

[Psa 135:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#013)

"Thy name, O Lord, endureth for ever," etc. Immutability is a glory
belonging to all the attributes of God. It is not a single perfection of
the Divine nature, nor is it limited to particular objects thus and thus
disposed. Mercy and justice have their distinct objects and distinct
acts: mercy is conversant about a penitent, justice about an obstinate
sinner. In our conceptions of the Divine perfections, his perfections
are different. The wisdom of God is not his power, nor his power his
holiness; but immutability is the centre wherein they all unite. There
is not one perfection which may not be said to be, and truly is,
immutable; none of them will appear so glorious about this beam, the sun
of immutability, which renders them highly excellent, without the least
shadow of imperfection. How cloudy would his blessedness be, if it were
changeable; how dim his wisdom, if it might be obscured; how feeble his
power, if it were capable of becoming sickly and languishing; how would
mercy lose much of its lustre, if it could change into wrath, and
justice much of its dread, if it could be turned into mercy; while the
object of justice remains unfit for mercy, and one that hath need of
mercy continues only fit for the Divine fury? But unchangeableness is
the thread that runs through the whole web; it is the enamel of all the
rest; none of them without it could look with a triumphant aspect. -
Stephen Charhock.

[Psa 135:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#013)

"Thy name, O Lord, endureth for ever." God is, and will be always the
same to his church, a gracious, faithful, wonder-working God; and his
church is, and Will be the same to him, a thankful, praising people; and
thus his name endures for ever. - Matthew Henry.

[Psa 135:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#013)

"Thy memorial, O Lord, throughout all generations;" or, the remembrance
of them to generation and generation; to every age. The love of Christ
is remembered by his people in every age, as they enjoy the blessings of
his grace in redemption, justification, pardon, etc. It cannot be
forgotten as long as the gospel is preached, the ordinances of Baptism
and the Lord's Supper administered, and the Lord has a people in the
world; all which will be as long as the sun and moon endure, and there
will therefore always be a memorial of him. - John Gill.

[Psa 135:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#014)

"For the Lord will judge his people," etc. Is it so, that all providence
is for the good of the church? This is comfort in the low estate of the
church at any time. God's eye is upon his people even whilst he seems to
have forsaken them. If he seems to be departed, it is but in some other
part of the earth, to show himself strong for them; wherever his eye is
fixed in any part of the world, his church hath his heart, and his
church's relief is his end. Though the church may sometimes lie among
the pots in a dirty condition, yet there is a time of resurrection, when
God will restore it to its true glory, and make it as white as a dove
with its silver wings: [Psa 68:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#013). The
sun is not always obscured by a thick cloud, but it will be freed from
the darkness of it. "God will judge his people, and he will repent
himself concerning his servants" \[the original is, Comfort himself\].
It is a comfort to God to deliver his people, and he will do it when it
shall be most comfortable to his glory and to their hearts. - Stephen
Charhock.

[Psa 135:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#014)

"He will repent himself." The original word "repent himself" here has a
very extensive signification, which cannot be expressed by any one
English rendering. It implies taking compassion upon them, with the
intention of being comforted in their future, and of taking vengeance on
their oppressors. Such are the several meanings in which the word is
used. Language fails to express the mind of God toward his faithful
people. How dear ought his counsels to be to us, and the consideration
of all his ways! This reflection was continually urged upon the nation
of Israel, so liable as they were to fall away to idolatory. - W.
Wilson.

[Psa 135:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#015)

"The idols of the heathen." The shrines on the hill-tops were very rude
affairs, enclosures formed by rough stone walls, and containing
ragamuffin gods - stocks of weather-beaten wood, blocks of battered
stone, and lumps of rusty old iron. The carved wooden gods were so much
the worse for the weather, that their features, if they ever had any,
were altogether defaced. One, not made of a single piece, like the rest,
but built together by joiner work, had fared worse than its more humble
neighbours. His arms were gone, and his breast, heart, and stomach had
all fallen out; strange to say, his head remained, and it was laughable
to see such a hollow mockery stare at you with a solemn face. The stone
images were sadly battered by tumbling about among the rubbish, and the
cast-metal gods mostly had their heads broken off and set carefully on
again, to stand there till the next storm would send them rolling. Thus
God is not only robbed in the valley, but men climb up as near to heaven
as they can, and insult him to his face. - James Gilmour, in "Among the
Mongols," 1883.

[Psa 135:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#015)

"The idols," etc. Herodotus telleth us that Amasis had a large laver of
gold, wherein both he and his guests used to wash their feet. This
vessel he brake and made a god of it, which the Egyptians devoutly
worshipped. And the like idolomania is at this day found among Papists,
what distinction soever they would fain make betwixt an idol and an
image, which indeed (as they use them) are all one. - John Trapp.

[Psa 135:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#015)

"Silver and gold." By singling out these metals, the most precious
materials of which the idols were framed, and pouring contempt upon even
these costly images, the Psalmist heightens the scorn which he implies
for such as were of inferior price, and which had not the one element of
costliness in their favour. And when we bear in mind the Apostles saying
that covetousness is idolatry we shall be warned that we, too, may need
this lesson against worshipping silver and gold, or the worldly wisdom
and specious eloquence which may be compared to these metals. - Neale
and Littledale.

[Psa 135:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#015)

"The work of men's hands." Therefore they should rather, if it were
possible, worship man, as their creator and lord, than be worshipped by
him. - Matthew Pool, 1624-1679.

[Psa 135:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#015), [Psa
135:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#016), [Psa
135:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#017)

The Rev. John Thomas, a missionary in India, was one day travelling
alone through the country, when he saw a great number of people waiting
near an idol temple. He went up to them, and as soon as the doors were
opened, he walked into the temple. Seeing an idol raised above the
people, he walked boldly up to it, held up his hand, and asked for
silence. He then put his fingers on its eyes, and said, "It has eyes,
but it cannot see! It has ears, but it cannot hear! It has a nose, but
it cannot smell! It has hands, but it cannot handle! It has a mouth, but
it cannot speak! Neither is there any breath in it!" Instead of doing
injury to him for affronting their god and themselves, the natives were
all surprised; and an old Brahmin was so convinced of his folly by what
Mr. Thomas said, that he also cried out, "It has feet, but cannot run
away!" The people raised a shout, and being ashamed of their stupidity,
they left the temple, and went to their homes - From "The New
Cyclopaedia of Illustrative Anecdote," 1875.

"Mouths,.... eyes,.... ears." So many members as the images have,
serving to represent perfections ascribed to them, so many are the lies.
- David Dickson.

[Psa 135:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#016)

They can neither speak in answer to your prayers and enquiries, nor see
what you do or what you want, nor hear your petitions, nor smell your
incenses and sacrifices, nor use their hands either to take anything
from you, or to give anything to you; nor so much as mutter, nor give
the least sign of apprehending your condition or concerns. - Matthew
Pool.

[Psa 135:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#016)

"Mouths, but they speak not:"..."ears, but they hear not."

A heated fancy or imagination

May be mistaken for an inspiration

True; but is this conclusion fair to make

That inspiration must be all mistake?

A pebble-stone is not a diamond: true;

But must a diamond be a pebble too?

To own a God who does not speak to men,

Is first to own, and then disown again;

Of all idolatry the total sum

Is having gods that are both deaf and dumb.

John Byrom, 1691-1763.

[Psa 135:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#018)

"Like them shall be those making them, every one who (is) trusting in
them." If the meaning had been simply, those who make them are like
them, Hebrew usage would have required the verb to be suppressed. Its
insertion, therefore, in the future form (יהיוּ) requires it to be
rendered strictly shall be, i.e., in fate as well as character.
Idolaters shall perish with their perishable idols. See [Isa
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#031). - Joseph Addison Alexander.

[Psa 135:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#018)

People never rise above the level of their gods, which are to them their
better nature. - Andrew Robert Faussett.

[Psa 135:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#018)

"They that make them are like unto them." Idolatry is a benumbing sin,
which bereaveth the idolater of the right use of his senses. - David
Dickson.

[Psa 135:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#018)

"They that make them," etc. Teacheth us, that the idol, the idol-maker,
and all such also as serve idols, are not only beastly and blockish
before men, but shall before God, in good time, come to shame and
confusion. - Thomas Wilcocks, 1549-1608.

[Psa 135:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#018)

"Like unto them." A singular phenomenon, known as the Spectre of the
Brocken, is seen on a certain mountain in Germany. The traveller who at
dawn stands on the topmost ridge beholds a colossal shadowy spectre. But
in fact it is only his own shadow projected upon the morning mists by
the rising sun; and it imitates, of course, every movement of its
creator. So heathen nations have mistaken their own image for Deity.
Their gods display human frailties and passions and scanty virtues,
projected and magnified upon the heavens, just as the small figures on
the slide of a magic-lantern are projected, magnified and illuminated
upon a white sheet. - From Elan Foster's New Cyclopaedia of
Illustrations, 1870.

[Psa 135:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#018)

"Like unto them." How many are like idol-images, when they have eyes,
ears, and mouths as though they had none, that is, when they do not use
them when and how they should! - Christoph Starke.

[Psa 135:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#019)

"Bless the Lord." - Blessing of God is to wish well to, and speak well
of God, out of good-will to God himself, and a sense of his goodness to
ourselves. God loves your good word, that is, to be spoken of well by
you; he rejoiceth in your well-wishes, and to hear from you expressions
of rejoicings in his own independent blessedness. Though God hath an
infinite ocean of all blessedness, to which we can add nothing, and he
is therefore called by way of eminency, "The Blessed One" ([Mar
14:61](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#061)), a title solely proper and
peculiar to him, yet he delights to hear the amen of the saints, his
creatures, resounding thereto; he delights to hear us utter our "so be
it." - Thomas Goodwin.

[Psa 135:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#019)

"Bless the Lord." And not an idol ([Isa
66:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#003)), as the Philistines, did their
Dagon and as Papists still do their he-saints and she-saints. - John
Trapp.

[Psa 135:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#020)

"Bless the Lord, O house of Levi." In Ps. 115 the exhortation given is
to trust or hope in the Lord; here, to bless him. The Levites are
mentioned in addition to the house of Aaron, there being two orders of
priesthood. Everything else in the two Psalms is the same, except that,
in [Psa 135:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#021), the Psalmist here
joins himself, along with the rest of the Lord's people, in blessing
God. - Franz Delitzsch.

[Psa 135:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#020)

"Ye that fear the Lord, bless the Lord." These are distinct from the
Israelites, priests, and Levites, and design the proselytes among them
of other nations that truly feared God, as Jarchi notes; and all such
persons, whoever and wherever they are, have reason to bless the Lord
for the fear of him they have, which is not from nature but from grace;
and for the favours shown them, the blessings bestowed upon them, the
good things laid up for them, and the guard that is about them, which
the Scriptures abundantly declare, and experience confirms. - John Gill.

[Psa 135:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#020)

"Ye that fear the Lord, bless the Lord." In Scripture it is quite common
to find this "fear" put for holiness itself, or the sum of true
religion. It is not, therefore, such a fear as seized the hearts of our
first parents when, hearing the voice of the Lord God, they hid
themselves amongst the trees of the garden; nor such as suddenly
quenched the noise of royal revelry in the night of Babylon's overthrow;
nor such as, on some day yet future, shall drive desparing sinners to
the unavailing shelter of the mountains and rocks. It is not the fear of
guilty distrust, or of hatred, or of bondage - that fear which hath
torment, and which perfect love casteth out; but a fear compatible with
the highest privileges, attainments, and hopes of the Christian life. It
is the fear of deep humility and reverence, and filial subjection, and
adoring gratitude; the fear which "blesseth the Lord," saying, "His
mercy endureth for ever." - John Lillie (1812-1867), in "Lectures on the
Epistles of Peter."

[Psa 135:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#021)

The conclusion, [Psa 135:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#021), alludes
to the conclusion of the preceding Psalm. There, the Lord blesses thee
out of Zion; here, let him be blessed out of Zion. The praise proceeds
from the same place from which the blessing issues for Zion is the place
where the community dwells with God. - E. W. Hengstenberg.

[Psa 135:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#021)

"Praise ye the Lord." When the song of praise is sung unto God, the work
of his praise is not ended, but must be continued, renewed, and followed
still, "Praise ye the Lord." - David Dickson.

[Psa 135:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#021)

"Bless," "Praise." We are not only to bless God, but to praise him, "All
thy works shall praise thee, O Lord; and thy saints shall bless thee."
Blessing relateth to his benefits, praise to his excellencies. We bless
him for what he is to us, we praise him for what he is in himself. Now,
whether we bless him, or praise him; it is still to increase our love to
him, and delight in him; for God is not affected with the flattery of
empty praises; yet this is an especial duty, which is of use to you, as
all other duties are. It doth you good to consider him as an infinite
and eternal Being, and of glorious and incomprehensible majesty. It is
pleasant and profitable to us. - Thomas Manton.

[Psalms 135:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 135:1</span></span>

Lord. Praise ye the name of the Lord; praise him, O ye servants of the
Lord.

2 Ye that stand in the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of
our God,

3 Praise the Lord; for the Lord is good, sing praises unto his name; for
it is pleasant.

4 For the Lord hath chosen Jacob unto himself, and Israel for his
peculiar treasure.

5 For I know that the Lord is great, and that our Lord is above all
gods.

6 Whatsoever the Lord pleased, that did he in heaven, and in earth, in
the seas, and all deep places.

7 He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh
lightnings for the rain; he bringeth the wind out of his treasuries.

8 Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast.

9 Who sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, upon
Pharaoh, and upon all his servants.

10 Who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings;

11 Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the
kingdoms of Canaan;

12 And gave their land for an heritage, an heritage unto Israel his
people.

13 Thy name, O Lord, endureth for ever; and thy memorial, O Lord,
throughout all generations.

14 For the Lord will judge his people, and he will repent himself
concerning his servants.

[Psa 135:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#001)

"Praise ye the Lord," or, Hallelujah. Let those who are themselves full
of holy praise labour to excite the like spirit in others. It is not
enough for us to praise God ourselves, we are quite unequal to such a
work; let us call in all our friends and neighbours, and if they have
been slack in such service, let us stir them up to it with loving
exhortations. "Praise ye the name of the Lord." Let his character be
extolled by you, and let all that he has revealed concerning himself be
the subject of your song; for this is truly his name. Specially let his
holy and incommunicable name of "Jehovah" be the object of your
adoration. By that name he sets forth his self-existence, and his
immutability; let these arouse your praises of his Godhead. Think of him
with love, admire him with heartiness, and then extol him with ardour.
Do not only magnify the Lord because he is God; but study his character
and his doings, and thus render intelligent, appreciative praise.
"Praise him, O ye servants of the Lord." If others are silent, you must
not be; you must be the first to celebrate his praises. You are
"servants," and this is part of your service; his "name" is named upon
you, therefore celebrate his name with praises; you know what a blessed
Master he is, therefore speak well of him. Those who shun his service
are sure to neglect his praise; but as grace has made you his own
personal servants, let your hearts make you his court-musicians. Here we
see the servant of the Lord arousing his fellow-servants by three times
calling upon them to praise. Are we then, so slow in such a sweet
employ? Or is it that when we do our utmost it is all too little for
such a Lord? Both are true. We do not praise enough; we cannot praise
too much. We ought to be always at it; answering to the command here
given - Praise, Praise, Praise. Let the three-in-one have the praises of
our spirit, soul, and body. For the past, the present, and the future,
let us render three-fold hallelujahs.

[Psa 135:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#002)

"Ye that stand in the house of the lord, in the courts of the house of
our God." You are highly favoured; you are the domestics of the palace,
nearest to the Father of the heavenly family, privileged to find your
home in his house; therefore you must, beyond all others, abound in
thanksgiving. You "stand," or abide in the temple; you are constant
occupants of its various courts; and therefore from you we expect
unceasing praise. Should not ministers be celebrated for celebrating the
praises of Jehovah? Should not church-officers and church-members excel
all others in the excellent duty of adoration? Should not all of every
degree who wait even in his outer courts unite in his worship? Ought not
the least and feeblest of his people to proclaim his praises, in company
with those who live nearest to him? Is it not a proper thing to remind
them of their obligations? Is not the Psalmist wise when he does so in
this case and in many others? Those who can call Jehovah "our God" are
highly blessed, and therefore should abound in the work of blessing him.
Perhaps this is the sweetest word in [Psa
135:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#001). "This God is our God for ever
and ever." "Our God" signifies possession, communion in possession,
assurance of possession, delight in possession. Oh the unutterable joy
of calling God our own!

[Psa 135:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#003)

"Praise the Lord." Do it again; continue to do it; do it better and more
heartily; do it in growing numbers; do it at once. There are good
reasons for praising the Lord, and among the first is this - "for the
Lord is good." He is so good that there is none good in the same sense
or degree. He is so good that all good is found in him, flows from him,
and is rewarded by him. The word God is brief for good; and truly God is
the essence of goodness. Should not his goodness be well spoken of? Yea,
with our best thoughts, and words, and hymns let us glorify his name.
"Sing praises unto his name; for it is pleasant." The adjective may
apply to the singing and to the name - they are both pleasant. The vocal
expression of praise by sacred song is one of our greatest delights. We
were created for this purpose, and hence it is a joy to us. It is a
charming duty to praise the lovely name of our God. All pleasure is to
be found in the joyful worship of Jehovah; all joys are in his sacred
name as perfumes lie slumbering in a garden of flowers. The mind
expands, the soul is lifted up, the heart warms, the whole being is
filled with delight when we are engaged in singing the high praises of
our Father, Redeemer, Comforter. When in any occupation goodness and
pleasure unite, we do well to follow it up without stint: yet it is to
be feared that few of us sing to the Lord at all in proportion as we
talk to men.

[Psa 135:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#004)

"For the Lord hath chosen Jacob unto himself." Jehovah hath chosen
Jacob. Should not the sons of Jacob praise him who has so singularly
favoured them? Election is one of the most forcible arguments for
adoring love. Chosen! chosen unto himself! - who can be grateful enough
for being concerned in this privilege? "Jacob have I loved," said
Jehovah, and he gave no reason for his love except that he chose to
love. Jacob had then done neither good nor evil, yet thus the Lord
determined, and thus he spake. If it be said that the choice was made
upon foresight of Jacob's character, it is, perhaps, even more
remarkable; for there was little enough about Jacob that could deserve
special choice. By nature Jacob was by no means the most lovable of men.
No, it was sovereign grace which dictated the choice. But, mark, it was
not a choice whose main result was the personal welfare of Jacob's seed:
the nation was chosen by God unto himself, to answer the divine ends and
purposes in blessing all mankind. Jacob's race was chosen to be the
Lord's own, to be the trustees of his truth, the maintainers of his
worship, the mirrors of his mercy. Chosen they were; but mainly for this
end, that they might be a peculiar people, set apart unto the service of
the true God.

"And Israel for his peculiar treasure." God's choice exalts; for here
the name is changed from Jacob, the supplanter, to Israel, the prince.
The love of God gives a new name and imparts a new value; for the
comparison to a royal treasure is a most honourable one. As kings have a
special regalia, and a selection of the rarest jewels, so the Lord
deigns to reckon his chosen nation as his wealth, his delight, his
glory. What an honour to the spiritual Israel that they are all this to
the Lord their God! We are a people near and dear unto him; precious and
honourable in his sight. How can we refuse our loudest, heartiest,
sweetest music? If we did not extol him, the stones in the street would
cry out against us.

[Psa 135:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#005)

"For I know that the Lord is great, and that our Lord is above all
gods." The greatness of God is as much a reason for adoration as his
goodness, when we are once reconciled to him. God is great positively,
great comparatively, and great superlatively - "above all gods." Of this
the Psalmist had an assured personal persuasion. He says positively, "I
know." It is knowledge worth possessing. He knew by observation,
inspiration, and realization; he was no agnostic, he was certain and
clear upon the matter. He not only knows the greatness of Jehovah, but
that as the Adonai, or Ruler, "our Lord" is infinitely superior to all
the imaginary deities of the heathen, and to all great ones besides.

"Let princes hear, let angels know,

How mean their natures seem;

Those gods on high, and gods below,

When once compared with him."

Many have thought to worship Jehovah, and other gods with him; but this
holy man tolerated no such notion. Others have thought to combine their
religion with obedience to the unrighteous laws of tyrannical princes;
this, also, the sweet singer of Israel denounced; for he regarded the
living God as altogether above all men, who as magistrates and princes
have been called gods. Observe here the fourth of the five "fors." [Psa
135:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#003), [Psa
135:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#004), [Psa
135:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#005), and [Psa
135:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#014) contain reasons for praise,
each set forth with "for." A fruitful meditation might be suggested by
this.

[Psa 135:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#006)

"Whatsoever the Lord pleased, that did he in heaven, and in earth, in
the seas, and all deep places." His will is carried out throughout all
space. The king's warrant runs in every portion of the universe. The
heathen divided the great domain; but Jupiter does not rule in heaven,
nor Neptune on the sea, nor Pluto in the lower regions; Jehovah rules
over all. His decree is not defeated, his purpose is not frustrated' in
no one point is his good pleasure set aside. The word "whatsoever" is of
the widest range and includes all things, and the four words of peace
which are mentioned comprehend all space; therefore the declaration of
the text knows neither limit nor exception. Jehovah works his will- he
pleases to do, and he performs the deed. None can stay his hand. How
different this from the gods whom the heathen fabled to be subject to
all the disappointments, failures, and passions of men! How contrary
even to those so-called Christian conceptions of God which subordinate
him to the will of man, and make his eternal purposes the football of
human caprice. Our theology teaches us no such degrading notions of the
Eternal as that he can be baffled by man. "His purpose shall stand, and
he will do all his pleasure." No region is too high, no abyss too deep,
no land too distant, no sea too wide for his omnipotence' his divine
pleasure travels post over all the realm of nature, and his behests are
obeyed.

[Psa 135:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#007)

"He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth." Here we
are taught the power of God in creation. The process of evaporation is
passed by unnoticed by the many, because they see it going on all around
them; the usual ceases to be wonderful to the thoughtless, but it
remains a marvel to the instructed. When we consider upon what an
immense scale evaporation is continually going on, and how needful it is
for the existence of all life, we may well admire the wisdom and the
power which are displayed therein. All around us from every point of the
horizon the vapour rises, condenses into clouds, and ultimately descends
as rain. Whence the vapours originally ascended from which our showers
are formed, it would be impossible to tell; most probably the main part
of them comes from the tropical regions, and other remote places at "the
ends of the earth." It is the Lord who causes them to rise, and not a
mere law. What is law without a force at the back of it? "He maketh
lightnings for the rain." There is an intimate connection between
lightning and rain, and this would seem to be more apparent in Palestine
than even with ourselves; for we constantly read of thunderstorms in
that country as attending heavy down-pours of rain. Lightning is not to
be regarded as a lawless force, but as a part of that wonderful
machinery by which the earth is kept in a fit condition: a force as much
under the control of God as any other, a force most essential to our
existence. The ever-changing waters, rains, winds, and electric currents
circulate as if they were the life-blood and vital spirits of the
universe. "He bringeth the wind out of his treasuries." This great force
which seems left to its own wild will is really under the supreme and
careful government of the Lord. As a monarch is specially master of the
contents of his own treasure, so is our God the Lord of the tempest and
hurricane; and as princes do not spend their treasure without taking
note and count of it, so the Lord does not permit the wind to be wasted,
or squandered without purpose. Everything in the material world is under
the immediate direction and control of the Lord of all. Observe how the
Psalmist brings before us the personal action of Jehovah: "he
causeth,.... he maketh,.... he bringeth." Everywhere the Lord worketh
all things, and there is no power which escapes his supremacy. It is
well for us that it is so: one bandit force wandering through the Lord's
domains defying his control would cast fear and trembling over all the
provinces of providence. Let us praise Jehovah for the power and wisdom
with which he rules clouds, and lightnings, and winds, and all other
mighty and mysterious agencies.

[Psa 135:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#008)

"Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast." Herein the
Lord is to be praised; for this deadly smiting was an act of justice
against Egypt, and of love to Israel. But what a blow it was! All the
firstborn slain in a moment! How it must have horrified the nation, and
cowed the boldest enemies of Israel! Beasts because of their
relationship to man as domestic animals are in many ways made to suffer
with him. The firstborn of beasts must die as well as the firstborn of
their owners, for the blow was meant to astound and overwhelm, and it
accomplished its purpose. The firstborn of God had been sorely smitten,
and they were set free by the Lord's meting out to their oppressors the
like treatment.

[Psa 135:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#009)

"Who sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, upon
Pharaoh, and upon all his servants." The Lord is still seen by the
Psalmist as sending judgments upon rebellious men; he keeps before us
the personal action of God, "who sent tokens, etc." The more distinctly
God is seen the better. Even in plagues he is to be seen, as truly as in
mercies. The plagues were not only terrible wonders which astounded men,
but forcible tokens or signs by which they were instructed. No doubt the
plagues were aimed at the various deities of the Egyptians, and were a
grand exposure of their impotence: each one had its own special
significance. The judgments of the Lord were no side blows, they struck
the nation at the heart; he sent his bolts "into the midst of thee, O
Egypt!" These marvels happened in the centre of the proud and exclusive
nation of Egypt, which thought itself far superior to other lands; and
many of these plagues touched the nation in points upon which it prided
itself. The Psalmist addresses that haughty nation, saying, "O Egypt,"
as though reminding it of the lessons which it had been taught by the
Lord's right hand. Imperious Pharaoh had been the ringleader in defying
Jehovah, and he was made personally to smart for it; nor did his
flattering courtiers escape, upon each one of them the scourge fell
heavily. God's servants are far better off than Pharaoh's servants:
those who stand in the courts of Jehovah are delivered, but the
courtiers of Pharaoh are smitten all of them, for they were all
partakers in his evil deeds. The Lord is to be praised for thus rescuing
his own people, and causing their cruel adversaries to bite the dust.
Let no true Israelite forget the song of the Red Sea, but anew let us
hear a voice summoning us to exulting praise: "Sing unto the Lord, for
he hath triumphed gloriously."

[Psa 135:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#010)

"Who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings." The nations of Canaan
joined in the desperate resistance offered by their monarchs, and so
they were smitten; while their kings, the ringleaders of the fight, were
slain. Those who resist the divine purpose will find it hard to kick
against the pricks. The greatness of the nations and the might of the
kings availed nothing against the Lord. He is prepared to mete out
vengeance to those who oppose his designs: those who dream of him as too
tender to come to blows have mistaken the God of Israel. He intended to
bless the work through his chosen people, and he would not be turned
from his purpose: cost what it might, he would preserve the candle of
truth which he had lighted, even though the blood of nations should be
spilt in its defence. The wars against the Canaanite races were a price
paid for the setting up of a nation which was to preserve for the whole
world the lively oracles of God.

[Psa 135:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#011)

"Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan." These two kings
were the first to oppose, and they were among the most notable of the
adversaries: their being smitten is therefore a special object of song
for loyal Israelites. The enmity of these two kings was wanton and
unprovoked, and hence their overthrow was the more welcome to Israel.
Sihon had been victorious in his war with Moab, and thought to make
short work with Israel, but he was speedily overthrown: Og was of the
race of the giants, and by his huge size inspired the tribes with dread;
but they were encouraged by the previous overthrow of Sihon, and soon
the giant king fell beneath their sword. "And all the kingdoms of
Canaan." Many were these petty principalities, and some of them were
populous and valiant; but they all fell beneath the conquering hand of
Joshua, for the Lord was with him. Even so shah all the foes of the
Lord's believing people in these days be put to the rout: Satan and the
world shall be overthrown, and all the hosts of sin shall be destroyed,
for our greater Joshua leads forth our armies, conquering and to
conquer.

Note that in this verse we have the details of matters which were
mentioned in the bulk in the previous stanza: it is well when we have
sung of mercies in the gross to consider them one by one, and give to
each individual blessing a share in our song. It is well to preserve
abundant memorials of the Lord's deliverance, so that we not only sing
of mighty kings as a class, but also of "Sihon king of the Amorites, and
Og king of Bashan" as distinct persons.

[Psa 135:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#012)

"And gave their land for an heritage, an heritage unto Israel his
people." Jehovah is Lord Paramount, and permits men to hold their lands
upon lease, terminable at his pleasure. The nations of Canaan had become
loathsome with abominable vices, and they were condemned by the great
Judge of all the earth to be cut off from the face of the country which
they defiled. The twelve tribes were charged to act as their
executioners, and as their fee they were to receive Canaan as a
possession. Of old the Lord had given this land to Abraham and his seed
by a covenant of salt, but he allowed the Amorites and other tribes to
sojourn in it till their iniquity was full, and then he bade his people
come and take their own out of the holders' hands. Canaan was their
heritage because they were the Lord's heritage, and he gave it to them
actually because he had long before given it to them by promise.

The Lord's chosen still have a heritage from which none can keep them
back. Covenant blessings of inestimable value are secured to them; and,
as surely as God has a people, his people shall have a heritage. To them
it comes by gift, though they have to fight for it. Often does it happen
when they slay a sin or conquer a difficulty that they are enriched by
the spoil: to them even evils work for good, and trials ensure triumphs.
No enemy shall prevail so as to really injure them, for they shall find
a heritage where once they were opposed by "all the kingdoms of Canaan."

[Psa 135:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#013)

"Thy name, O Lord, endureth for ever." God's name is eternal, and will
never be changed. His character is immutable; his fame and honour also
shah remain to all eternity. There shall always be life in the name of
Jesus, and sweetness and consolation. Those upon whom the Lord's name is
named in verity and truth shall be preserved by it, and kept from all
evil, world without end. Jehovah is a name which shall outlive the ages,
and retain the fulness of its glory and might for ever, "And thy
memorial, O Lord, throughout all generations." Never shall men forget
thee, O Lord. The ordinances of thine house shall keep thee in men's
memories, and thine everlasting gospel and the grace which goes
therewith shall be abiding remembrancers of thee. Grateful hearts will
for ever beat to thy praise, and enlightened minds shall continue to
marvel at all thy wondrous works. Men's memorials decay, but the
memorial of the Lord abideth evermore. What a comfort to desponding
minds, trembling for the ark of the Lord! No, precious Name, thou shalt
never perish! Fame of the Eternal, thou shalt never grow dim!

This verse must be construed in its connection, and it teaches us that
the honour and glory gained by the Lord in the overthrow of the mighty
kings would never die out. Israel for long ages reaped the benefit of
the prestige which the divine victories had brought to the nation.
Moreover, the Lord in thus keeping his covenant which he made with
Abraham, when he promised to give the land to his seed, was making it
clear that his memorial contained in promises and covenant would never
be out of his sight. His name endures in all its truthfulness, for those
who occupied Israel's land were driven out that the true heirs might
dwell therein in peace.

[Psa 135:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#014)

"For the Lord will judge his people." He will exercise personal
discipline over them, and not leave it to their foes to maltreat them at
pleasure. When the correction is ended he will arise and avenge them of
their oppressors, who for a while were used by him as his rod. He may
seem to forget his people, but it is not so; he will undertake their
cause and deliver them. The judges of Israel were also her deliverers,
and such is the Lord of hosts: in this sense - as ruling, preserving,
and delivering his chosen - Jehovah will judge his people. "And he will
repent himself concerning his servants." When he has smitten them, and
they lie low before him, he will pity them as a father pitieth his
children, for he doth not afflict willingly. The Psalm speaks after the
manner of men: the nearest description that words can give of the Lord's
feeling towards his suffering servants is that he repents the evil which
he inflicted upon them. He acts as if he had changed his mind and
regretted smiting them. It goes to the heart of God to see his beloved
ones oppressed by their enemies: though they deserve all they suffer,
and more than all, yet the Lord cannot see them smart without a pang. It
is remarkable that the nations by which God has afflicted Israel have
all been destroyed as if the tender Father hated the instruments of his
children's correction. The chosen nation is here called, first, "his
people," and then "his servants:" as his people he judges them, as his
servants he finds comfort in them, for so the word may be read. He is
most tender to them when he sees their service; hence the Scripture
saith, "I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth
him." Should not the "servants" of God praise him? He plagued Pharaoh's
servants; but as for his own he has mercy upon them, and returns to them
in love after he has in the truest affection smitten them for their
iniquities. "Praise him, O ye servants of the Lord."

Now we come to the Psalmist's denunciation of idols, which follows most
naturally upon his celebration of the one only living and true God.

[Psalms 135:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 135:15</span></span>

15 The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the work of men's
hands.

16 They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see
not;

17 They have ears, but they hear not; neither is there any breath in
their mouths.

18 They that make them are like unto them, so is every one that trusteth
in them.

[Psa 135:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#015)

"The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the work of men's hands."
Their essential material is dead metal, their attributes are but the
qualities of senseless substances, and what of form and fashion they
exhibit they derive from the skill and labour of those who worship them.
It is the height of insanity to worship metallic manufactures. Though
silver and gold are useful to us when we rightly employ them, there is
nothing about them which can entitle them to reverence and worship. If
we did not know the sorrowful fact to be indisputable, it would seem to
be impossible that intelligent beings could bow down before substances
which they must themselves refine from the ore, and fashion into form.
One would think it less absurd to worship one's own hands than to adore
that which those hands have made. What great works can these mock
deities perform for man when they are themselves the works of man? Idols
are fitter to be played with, like dolls by babes, than to be adored by
grown-up men. Hands are better used in breaking than in making objects
which can be put to such an idiotic use. Yet the heathen love their
abominable deities better than silver and gold: it were well if we could
say that some professed believers in the Lord had as much love for him.

[Psa 135:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#016)

"They have mouths." For their makers fashioned them like themselves. An
opening is made where the mouth should be, and yet it is no mouth, for
they eat not, they speak not. They cannot communicate with their
worshippers; they are dumb as death. If they cannot even speak, they are
not even so worthy of worship as our children at school. Jehovah speaks,
and it is done; but these images utter never a word. Surely, if they
could speak, they would rebuke their rotaries. Is not their silence a
still more powerful rebuke? When our philosophical teachers deny that
God has made any verbal revelation of himself they also confess that
their god is dumb.

"Eyes have they, but they see not." Who would adore a blind man - how
can the heathen be so mad as to bow themselves before a blind image? The
eyes of idols have frequently been very costly; diamonds have been used
for that purpose; but of what avail is the expense, since they see
nothing? If they cannot even see us, how can they know our wants,
appreciate our sacrifices, or spy out for us the means of help? What a
wretched thing, that a man who can see should bow down before an image
which is blind! The worshipper is certainly physically in advance of his
god, and yet mentally he is on a level with it; for assuredly his
foolish heart is darkened, or he would not so absurdly play the fool.

[Psa 135:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#017)

"They have ears," and very large ones too, if we remember certain of the
Hindoo idols. "But they hear not." Useless are their ears; in fact, they
are mere counterfeits and deceits. Ears which men make are always deaf
the secret of hearing is wrapped up with the mystery of life, and both
are in the unsearchable mind of the Lord. It seems that these heathen
gods are dumb, and blind, and deaf - a pretty bundle of infirmities to
be found in a deity! "Neither is there any breath in their mouths;" they
are dead, no sign of life is perceptible; and breathing, which is of the
essence of animal life, they never know. Shall a man waste his breath in
crying to an idol which has no breath? Shall life offer up petitions to
death? Verily, this is a turning of things upside down.

[Psa 135:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#018)

"They that make them are like unto them:" they are as blockish, as
senseless, as stupid as the gods they have made, and, like them they are
the objects of divine abhorrence, and shall be broken in pieces in due
time. "So is every one that trusteth in them." The idol-worshippers are
as bad as the idol-makers; for if there were none to worship, there
would be no market for the degrading manufacture. Idolaters are
spiritually dead, they are the mere images of men, their best being is
gone, they are not what they seem. Their mouths do not really pray,
their eyes see not the truth, their ears hear not the voice of the Lord,
and the life of God is not in them. Those who believe in their own
inventions in religion betray great folly, and an utter absence of the
quickening Spirit. Gracious men can see the absurdity of forsaking the
true God and setting up rivals in his place; but those who perpetrate
this crime think not so, on the contrary, they pride themselves upon
their great wisdom, and boast of "advanced thought" and "modern
culture." Others there are who believe in a baptismal regeneration which
does not renew the nature, and they make members of Christ and children
of God who have none of the spirit of Christ, or the signs of adoption,
May we be saved from such mimicry of divine work lest we also become
like our idols.

[Psalms 135:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 135:19</span></span>

19 Bless the Lord, O house of Israel: bless the Lord, O house of Aaron

20 Bless the Lord, O house of Levi: ye that fear the Lord, bless the
Lord.

21 Blessed be the Lord out of Zion, which dwelleth at Jerusalem. Praise
ye the Lord.

[Psa 135:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#019)

"Bless the Lord, O house of Israel." All of you, in all your tribes,
praise the one Jehovah. Each tribe, from Reuben to Benjamin, has its own
special cause for blessing the Lord, and the nation as a whole has
substantial reasons for pouring out benedictions upon his name. Those
whom God has named "the house of Israel," a family of prevailing
princes, ought to show their loyalty by thankfully bowing before their
sovereign Lord. "Bless the Lord, O house of Aaron." These were elected
to high office and permitted to draw very near to the divine presence;
therefore they beyond all others were bound to bless the Lord. Those who
are favoured to be leaders in the church should be foremost in
adoration. In God's house the house of Aaron should feel bound to speak
well of his name before all the house of Israel.

[Psa 135:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#020)

"Bless the Lord, O house of Levi." These helped the priests in other
things, let them aid them in this also. The house of Israel comprehends
all the chosen seed; then we come down to the smaller but more central
ring of the house of Aaron, and now we widen out to the whole tribe of
Levi. Let reverence and adoration spread from man to man until the whole
lump of humanity shall be leavened. The house of Levi had choice reasons
for blessing God, read the Levite story and see. Remember that the whole
of the Levites were set apart for holy service, and supported by the
tribes allotted to them; therefore they were in honour bound above all
others to worship Jehovah with cheerfulness.

"Ye that fear the Lord, bless the Lord." These are the choicer spirits,
the truly spiritual: they are not the Lord's in name only, but in heart
and spirit. The Father seeketh such to worship him. If Aaron and Levi
both forget and fail, these will not. It may be that this verse is
intended to bring in God-fearing men who were not included under Israel,
Aaron, and Levi. They were Gentile proselytes, and this verse opens the
door and bids them enter. Those who fear God need not wait for any other
qualification for sacred service; godly fear proves us to be in the
covenant with Israel, in the priesthood with Aaron, and in the service
of the Lord with Levi. Filial fear, such as saints feel towards the
Lord, does not hinder their praise; nay, it is the main source and
fountain of their adoration.

[Psa 135:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#021)

"Blessed be the Lord out of Zion, which dwelleth at Jerusalem." Let him
be most praised at home. Where he blesses most, let him be blessed most.
Let the beloved mount of Zion, and the chosen city of Jerusalem echo his
praises. He remains among his people: he is their dwelling-place, and
they are his dwelling-place, let this intimate communion ensure intense
gratitude on the part of his chosen. The temple of holy solemnities
which is Christ, and the city of the Great King, which is the church,
may fitly be regarded as the head-quarters of the praises of Jehovah,
the God of Israel. "Praise ye the Lord." Hallelujah. Amen, and Amen.
