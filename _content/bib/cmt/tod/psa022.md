[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

Title - "To the chief Musician upon Aijeleth Shahar. A Psalm of David."
This ode of singular excellence was committed to the most excellent of
the temple songsters: the chief among ten thousand is worthy to be
extolled by the chief Musician; no meaner singer must have charge of
such a strain; we must see to it that we call up vat best abilities when
Jesus is the theme of praise. The words Aijeleth Shahar are enigmatical,
and their meaning is uncertain; some refer them to a musical instrument
used upon mournful occasions, but the majority adhere to the translation
of our margin, "Concerning the hind of the morning." This last
interpretation is the subject of much inquiry and conjecture. Calmet
believes that the Psalm was addressed to the music master who presided
over the band called the "Morning Hind," and Adam Clarke thinks this to
be the most likely of all the conjectural interpretations, although he
himself inclines to the belief that no interpretation should be
attempted, and believes that it is a merely arbitrary and unmeaning
title, such as Orientals have always been in the habit of appending to
their songs. Our Lord Jesus is so often compared to a hind, and his
cruel huntings are so pathetically described in this most affecting
psalm, that we cannot but believe that the title indicates the Lord
Jesus under a well-known poetical metaphor; at any rate, Jesus is that
Hind of the morning concerning whom David here sings.

Subject - This is beyond all others The Psalm of the Cross. It may have
been actually repeated word by word by our Lord when hanging on the
tree; it would be too bold to say that it was so, but even a casual
reader may see that it might have been. It begins with, "My God, my God,
why hast thou forsaken me?" and ends, according to some, in the original
with "It is finished." For plaintive expressions uprising, from
unutterable depths of woe we may say of this Psalm, "there is none like
it." It is the photograph of our Lord's saddest hours, the record of his
dying words, the lachrymatory of his last tears, the memorial of his
expiring joys. David and his afflictions may be here in a very modified
sense, but, as the star is concealed by the light of the sun, he who
sees Jesus will probably neither see nor care to see David. Before us we
have a description both of the darkness and of the glory of the cross,
the sufferings of Christ and the glory which shall follow. Oh for grace
to draw near and see this great sight! We should read reverently,
pulling off our shoes from off our feet, as Moses did at the burning
bush, for if there be holy ground anywhere in Scripture it is in this
Psalm.

Division - From the commencement to the [Psa
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#021)is a most pitiful cry for help,
and from [Psa 22:21-31](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#021) is a most
precious foretaste of deliverance. The first division may be sub-divided
at the [Psa 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#010), from [Psa
22:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#001) being an appeal based upon
covenant relationship; and from [Psa
22:10-21](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#010) being an equally earnest plea
derived from the imminence of his peril.

Explanatory Notes and Quaint Sayings

Title

Aijeleth Shahar. The title of the twenty-second Psalm is Aijeleth Shahar
- the morning hart. The whole Psalm refers to Christ, containing much
that cannot be applied to another: parting his garments, casting lots
for his vesture, etc. He is described as a kindly, meek and beautiful
hart, started by the huntsmen at the dawn of the day. Herod began
hunting him down as soon as he appeared. Poverty, the hatred of men, and
the temptation of Satan, joined in the pursuit. There always was some
"dog," or "bull," or "unicorn," ready to attack him. After his first
sermon the huntsmen gathered about him, but he was too fleet of foot,
and escaped. The church had long seen the Messiah "like a roe, or a
young hart, upon the mountains," had "heard the voice of her Beloved,"
and had cried out, "Behold, he cometh, leaping upon the mountains,
skipping upon the hills;" sometimes he was even seen with the dawn of
the day, in the neighbourhood of the temple, and beside the enclosures
of the vineyards. The church requested to see him "on the mountains of
Bether," and upon "the mountains of spices." The former probably
signifying the place of his sufferings, and the latter the sublime
acclivities of light, glory, and honour, where the "hart" shall be
hunted no more. But in the afternoon, the huntsmen who had been
following the "young roe" from early day-break, had succeeded in driving
him to the mountains of Bether. Christ found Calvary a craggy, jagged,
and fearful hill - "a mountain of division." Here he was driven by the
huntsmen to the edges of the awful precipices yawning destruction from
below, while he was surrounded and held at bay by all the beasts of prey
and monsters of the infernal forest. The "unicorn," and the "bulls of
Bashan," gored him with their horns; the great "lion" roared at him; and
the "dog" fastened himself upon him. But he foiled them all. In his own
time be bowed his head and gave up the ghost. He was buried in a new
grave; and his assailants reckoned upon complete victory. They had not
considered that he was a "morning hart." Surely enough, at the appointed
time, did he escape from the hunter's net, and stand forth on the
mountains of Israel alive, and never, never to die again. Now he is with
Mary in the garden, giving evidence of his own resurrection; in a moment
he is at Emmaus, encouraging the too timid and bewildered disciples. Nor
does it cost him any trouble to go thence to Galilee to his friends, and
again to the Mount of Olives, "on the mountains of spices," carrying
with him the day-dawn, robed in life and beauty for evermore. -
Christmas Evans, 1766-1838.

Title

It will be very readily admitted that the hind is a very appropriate
emblem of the suffering and persecuted righteous man who meets us in
this Psalm.... That the hind may be a figurative expression significant
of suffering innocence, is put beyond a doubt by the fact, that the
wicked and the persecutors in this Psalm, whose peculiar physiognomy is
marked by emblems drawn from the brute creation, are designed by the
terms dogs, lions, bulls, etc. - E. W. Hengstenberg.

Title

"The hind." Much extraordinary symbolism has by old authors been
conjured up and clustered around the hind. According to their curious
natural history, there exists a deadly enmity between the deer and the
serpent, and the deer by its warm breath draws serpents out of their
holes in order to devour them. The old grammarians derived Elaphas, or
hart, from elaunein tous opheis, that is, of driving away serpents. Even
the burning a portion of the deer's horns was said to drive away all
snakes. If a snake had escaped the hart after being drawn out by the
hart by its breath, it was said to be more vehemently poisonous than
before. The timidity of the deer was ascribed to the great size of its
heart, in which they thought was a bone shaped like a cross. - Condensed
from Wood's "Bible Animals," by C. H. S.

Whole Psalm

This is a kind of gem among the Psalms, and is peculiarly excellent and
remarkable. It contains those deep, sublime, and heavy sufferings of
Christ, when agonizing in the midst of the terrors and pangs of divine
wrath and death which surpass all human thought and comprehension. I
know not whether any Psalm throughout the whole book contains matter
more weighty, or from which the hearts of the godly can so truly
perceive those sighs and groans, inexpressible by man, which their Lord
and Head, Jesus Christ, uttered when conflicting for us in the midst of
death, and in the midst of the pains and terrors of hell. Wherefore this
Psalm ought to be most highly prized by all who have any acquaintance
with temptations of faith and spiritual conflicts. - Martin Luther.

Whole Psalm

This Psalm, as it sets out the sufferings of Christ to the full, so also
his three great offices. His sufferings are copiously described from the
beginning of the Psalm to [Psa 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#022).
The prophetical office of Christ, from [Psa
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#022) to [Psa
22:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#025). That which is foretold about
his vows ([Psa 22:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#025)), hath respect to
his priestly function. In the rest of the Psalm the kingly office of
Christ is set forth. - William Gouge, D.D (1575-1653), in "A Commentary
on the whole Epistle to the Hebrews."

Whole Psalm

This Psalm seems to be less a prophecy than a history. - Cassiodorus.

Whole Psalm

This Psalm must be expounded, word for word, entire and in every
respect, of Christ only; without any allegory, trope, or anagoge. -
Bakius, quoted by F. Delitzsch, D,D., on [Heb
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#012).

Whole Psalm

A prophecy of the passion of Christ, and of the vocation of the
Gentiles. - Eusebius of Csarea.

[Psa 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#001)

"My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" We contrast this with [Joh
16:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#032), "I am not alone, because the
Father is with me." That these words in David were not withstanding the
words of Christ, there is no true believer ignorant; yet how cross our
Lord's words in John 1 Answer: - It is one thing to speak out of present
sense of misery, another thing to be confident of a never-separated
Deity. The condition of Christ in respect of his human state (not the
divine), is in all outward appearances, like ours; we conceive the
saints' condition very lamentable at times, as if God were for ever
gone. And Christ (to teach us to cry after God the Father, like children
after the mother, whose very stepping but at the door, ofttimes makes
the babe believe, and so saith that his father is gone for ever),
presents in his own sufferings how much he is sensible of ours in that
case. As for his divine nature, he and his Father can never sunder in
that, and so at no time is he alone, but the Father is always with him.
- William Streat, in "The Dividing of the Hoof," 1654.

[Psa 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#001)

"My God, my God," etc. There is a tradition that our Lord, hanging on
the cross, began, as we know from the gospel, this Psalm; and repeating
it and those that follow gave up his most blessed spirit when he came to
the [Psa 31:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#005)of the thirty-first
Psalm. However that may be, by taking these first words on his lips he
stamped the Psalm as belonging to himself. - Ludolph, the Carthusian
(circa. 1350), in J. M. Neale's Commentary.

[Psa 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#001)

"My God, my God," etc. It was so sharp, so heavy an affliction to
Christ's soul, that it caused him who was meek under all other
sufferings as a lamb, to roar under this like a lion. For so much those
words of Christ signify, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? why
art thou so far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?" It
comes from a root that signifies to howl or roar as a lion, and rather
signifies the noise made by a wild beast than the voice of a man. And it
is as much as if Christ had said, O my God, no words can express my
anguish, I will not speak, but roar, howl out my complaints. Pour it out
in volleys of groans. I roar as a lion. It's no small matter will make
that majestic creature to roar. And sure so great a spirit as Christ's
would not have roared under a slight burden.

Did God really forsake Jesus Christ upon the cross? then from the
desertion of Christ singular consolation springs up to the people of
God; yea, manifold consolation. Principally it's a support in these two
respects, as it is preventive of your final desertion and a comfortable
pattern to you in your present sad desertions. 1. Christ's desertion is
preventive of your final desertion. Because he was forsaken for a time
you shall not be forsaken for ever. For he was forsaken for you. It is
every way as much for the dear Son of God, the darling delight of his
soul, to be forsaken of God for a time, as if such a poor inconsiderable
thing as thou art shouldst be cast off to eternity. Now, this being
equivalent and borne in thy room, must needs give thee the highest
security in the world that God will never finally withdraw from thee. 2.
Moreover, this sad desertion of Christ becomes a comfortable pattern to
poor deserted souls in divers respects; and the proper business of such
souls, at such times, is to eye it believingly. Though God deserted
Christ, yet at the same time he powerfully supported him. His omnipotent
arms were under him, though his pleased face was hid from him. He had
not indeed his smiles, but he had his supportations. So, Christian, just
so shall it be with thee. Thy God may turn away his face, he will not
pluck away his arm. When one asked of holy Mr. Baines how the case stood
with his soul, he answered, "Supports I have, though suavities I want."
Our Father in this deals with us as we ourselves sometimes do with a
child that is stubborn and rebellious. We turn him out of doors and bid
him begone out of our sight, and there he sighs and weeps; but however
for the humbling of him, we will not presently take him into house and
favour; yet we order, at least permit the servants to carry him meat and
drink: here is fatherly care and support, though no former smiles or
manifested delights.... Though God forsook Christ, yet at that time he
could justify God. So you read, "O my God (saith he), I cry in the day
time; but thou hearest not, and in the night season, and am not silent;
but thou art holy." Is not thy spirit according to thy measure, framed
like Christ's in this; canst thou not, say even when he writes bitter
things against thee, he is a holy, faithful and good God for all this! I
am deserted but not wronged. There is not one drop of injustice in all
the sea of my sorrows. Though he condemned me I must and will justify
him: this also is Christ-like. - John Flavel.

[Psa 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#001)

"My God, my God." The repetition is expressive of fervent desire - "My
God," in an especial sense, as in his words after the resurrection to
Mary Magdalene, "I ascend unto my God, and your God; My God," not as the
Son of God only, but in that nature which he hath assumed, as the
beloved Son in whom the Fattier is well pleased; who is loved of the
Father and who loveth the Father more than the whole universe. It is
observed that this expression, "My God," is three times repeated. -
Dionysius, quoted by Isaac Williams.

[Psa 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#001)

"My God." It was possible for Christ by faith to know that he was
beloved of God, and he did know that he was beloved of God, when yet as
to sense and feeling he tasted of God's wrath. Faith and the want of
sense are not inconsistent; there may be no present sense of God's love,
nay, there may be a present sense of his wrath, and yet there may be
faith at the same time. - John Row's "Emmanuel," 1680.

[Psa 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#001)

This word, "My God," takes in more than all the philosophers in the
world could draw out of it. - Alexander Wedderburn, 1701.

[Psa 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#001)

That there is something of a singular force, meaning, and feeling in
these words is manifest from this - the evangelists have studiously
given us this verse in the very words of the Hebrew, in order to show
their emphatic force. And moreover I do not remember any one other place
in the Scriptures where we have this repetition, Eli, Eli - Martin
Luther.

[Psa 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#001)

"Why?" Not the "why" of impatience or despair, not the sinful
questioning of one whose heart rebels against his chastening, but rather
the cry of a lost child who cannot understand why his father has left
him, and who longs to see his father's face again. - J. J. Stewart
Perowne.

[Psa 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#001)

"My roaring." שׁאג seems primarily to denote the roaring of a lion, but,
as applied to intelligent beings, it is generally expressive of profound
mental anguish poured forth in audible and even vehement strains. [Psa
38:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#009); [Psa
33:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#003); [Job
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#024). Thus did the suffering Messiah
pour forth strong crying and tears, to him that was able to save him
from death. [Heb 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#007). - John Morison.

[Psa 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#001)

When Christ complains of having been forsaken by God, we are not to
understand that he was forsaken by the First Person, or that there was a
dissolution of the hypostatic union, or that he lost the favour and
friendship of the Father; but he signifies to us that God permitted his
human nature to undergo those dreadful torments, and to suffer an
ignominious death, from which he could, if he chose, most easily deliver
him. Nor did such complaints proceed either from impatience or
ignorance, as if Christ were ignorant of the cause of his suffering, or
was not most willing to bear such abandonment in his suffering; such
complaints were only a declaration of his most bitter sufferings. And
whereas, through the whole course of his passion, with such patience did
our Lord suffer, as not to let a single groan or sigh escape from him,
so now, lest the bystanders may readily believe that he was rendered
impassible by some superior power; therefore, when his last moments were
nigh, he protests that he is true man, truly passible: forsaken by his
Father in his sufferings, the bitterness and acuteness of which he then
intimately felt. - Robert Bellarmine (Cardinal), 1542-1621.

[Psa 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#001)

Divines are wont commonly to say, that Christ, from the moment of his
conception, had the sight of God, his human soul being immediately
united to the Deity, Christ from the very moment of his conception had
the sight of God. Now for our Saviour, who had known experimentally how
sweet the comfort of his Father's face had been, and had lived all his
days under the warm beams and influences of the Divinity, and had had
his soul all along refreshed with the sense of the Divine presence, for
him to be left in that horror and darkness, as to have no taste of
comfort, no glimpse of the Divinity breaking in upon his human soul, how
great an affliction must that needs be unto him! - John Row.

[Psa 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#001)

Desertion is in itself no sin; for Christ endured its bitterness, ay, he
was so deep in it, that when he died, he said, "Why hast thou forsaken
me?" A total, a final desertion ours is not; partial the best have had
and have. God turns away his face, David himself is troubled: "The just
shall live by faith," and not by feeling. - Richard Capel.

[Psa 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#001)

Oh! how will our very hearts melt with love, when we remember that as we
have been distressed for our sins against him; so he was in greater
agonies for us? We have had gall and wormwood, but he tasted a more
bitter cup. The anger of God has dried up our spirits, but he was
scorched with a more flaming wrath. He was under violent pain in the
garden, and on the cross; ineffable was the sorrow that he felt, being
forsaken of his Father, deserted by his disciples, affronted and
reproached by his enemies, and under a curse for us. This Sun was under
a doleful eclipse, this living Lord was pleased to die, and in his death
was under the frowns of an angry God. The face was then hid from him
that had always smiled before; and his soul felt that horror and that
darkness which it had never felt before. So that there was no separation
between the divine and human nature, yet he suffered pains equal to
those which we had deserved to suffer in hell for ever. God so suspended
the efficacies of his grace that it displayed in that hour none of its
force and virtue on him. He had no comfort from heaven, none from his
angels, none from his friends, even in that sorrowful hour when he
needed comfort most. Like a lion that is hurt in the forest, so he
roared and cried out, though there was no despair in him; and when he
was forsaken, yet there was trust and hope in these words, "My God, my
God." - Timothy Rogers.

[Psa 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#001)

Here is comfort to deserted souls; Christ himself was deserted;
therefore, if thou be deserted, God dealeth no otherwise with thee than
he did with Christ. Thou mayst be beloved of God and not feel it; Christ
was so, he was beloved of the Father, and yet had no present sense and
feeling of his love. This may be a great comfort to holy souls under the
suspension of those comforts and manifestations which sometimes they
have felt; Christ himself underwent such a suspension, therefore such a
suspension of divine comfort may consist with God's love. Thou mayst
conclude possibly, "I am a hypocrite, and therefore God hath forsaken
me;" this is the complaint of some doubting Christians, "I am a
hypocrite, and therefore God hath forsaken me;" but thou hast no reason
so to conclude: there was no failure in Christ's obedience, and yet
Christ was forsaken in point of comfort; therefore desertion, in point
of comfort, may consist with truth of grace, yea, with the highest
measure of grace; so it did in our Saviour. - John Row.

[Psa 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#001)

Lord, thou knowest what it is for a soul to be forsaken, it was sometime
thine own case when thou complainedst, "My God, why hast thou forsaken
me?" not, O my Lord! but that thou hadst a divine supportment, but thou
hadst not (it seemeth) that inward joy which at other times did fill
thee; now thou art in thy glory, pity a worm in misery, that mourns and
desires more after thee than all things. Lord, thou paidst dear for my
good, let good come unto me. - Joseph Symonds, 1658.

[Psa 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#001)

The first verse expresses a species of suffering that never at any other
time was felt in this world, and never will be again - the vengeance of
the Almighty upon his child - "My God, why hast thou forsaken me?" - R.
H. Ryland.

[Psa 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#002)

"O my God, I cry in the daytime, but thou hearest not," etc. How like is
this expostulation to that of a human child with its earthly parent! It
is based on the ground of relationship - "I am thine; I cry day and
night, yet I am not heard. Thou art my God, yet nothing is done to
silence me. In the daytime of my life I cried; in this night season of
my death I intreat. In the garden of Gethsemane I occupied the night
with prayers; with continual ejaculations have I passed through this
eventful morning. O my God, thou hast not yet heard me, therefore am I
not yet silent; I cannot cease till thou answerest." Here Christ urges
his suit in a manner which none but filial hearts adopt. The child knows
that the parent yearns over him. His importunity is strengthened by
confidence in paternal love. He keeps not silence, he gives him no rest
because he confides in his power and willingness to grant the desired
relief. This is natural. It is the argument of the heart, an appeal to
the inward yearnings of our nature. It is also scriptural, and is thus
stated, "If ye then being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your
children, how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit
to them that ask him?" [Luk 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#013). -
John Stevenson, in "Christ on the Cross," 1842.

[Psa 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#002)

The princely prophet says, "Lord, I cry unto thee in the daytime, but
thou hearest not, also in the night time, and yet this is not to be
thought Jolly to me." Some perhaps would think it a great point of folly
for a man to cry and call unto him who stops his ears, and seems not to
hear. Nevertheless, this folly of the faithful is wiser than all the
wisdom of the world. For we know well enough, that howsoever God seem at
the first not to hear, yet the Lord is a sure refuge in due time - in
affection. [Psa 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#009). - Thomas
Playfere.

[Psa 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#002), [Psa
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#003)

Well, what hears God from him, now he hears nothing from God, as to the
deliverance prayed for? No murmuring at God's proceedings; nay, he hears
quite the contrary, for he justifies and praises God: "But thou art
holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel." Observe whether
thou canst not gather something from the manner of God's denying the
thing prayed for, which may sweeten it to thee! Haply thou shalt find he
denies thee, but it is with a smiling countenance, and ushers it in with
some expressions of grace and favour, that may assure thee his denial
proceeds not from displeasure. As you would do with a dear friend, who,
may be, comes to borrow a sum of money of you; lend it you dare not,
because you see plainly it is not for his good; but in giving him the
denial, lest he should misinterpret it, as proceeding from want of love
and respect, you preface it with some kind of language of your hearty
affection to him, as that you love him, and therefore deny him, and
shall be ready to do for him more than that comes to. Thus God sometimes
wraps up his denials in such sweet intimations of love, as prevents all
jealousies arising in the hearts of his people. - William Gurnall.

[Psa 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#002), [Psa
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#003)

They that have conduit-water come into their houses, if no water come
they do not conclude the spring to be dry, but the pipes to be stopped
or broken. If prayer speed not, we must be sure that the fault is not in
God, but in ourselves; were we but ripe for mercy, he is ready to extend
it to us, and even waits for the purpose. - John Trapp.

[Psa 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#003)

"But thou art holy." Here is the triumph of faith - the Saviour stood
like a rock in the wide ocean of temptation. High as the billows rose,
so did his faith, like the coral rock, wax greater and stronger till it
became an island of salvation to our shipwrecked souls. It is as if he
had said, "It matters not what I endure. Storms may howl upon me; men
despise; devils tempt; circumstances overpower; and God himself forsake
me, still God is holy; there is no unrighteousness in him." - John
Stevenson.

[Psa 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#003)

"But thou art holy." Does it seem strange that the heart in its darkness
and sorrow should find comfort in this attribute of God? No, for God's
holiness is but another aspect of his faithfulness and mercy. And in
that remarkable name, "the Holy One of Israel," we are taught that he
who is the "holy" God is also the God who has made a covenant with his
chosen. It would be impossible for au Israelite to think of God's
holiness without thinking also of that covenant relationship. "Be ye
holy; for I, the Lord your God am holy," were the words in which Israel
was reminded of their relation to God. See especially [Lev
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#001). We see something of this feeling
in such passages as [Psa 89:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#016);
[Psa 99:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#005); [Hos
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#008), [Hos
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#009); [Isa
41:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#014); [Isa
47:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#004). - J. J. Stewart Perowne.

[Psa 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#003)

Were temptations never so black, faith will not hearken to an ill word
spoken against God, but will justify God always. - David Dickson.

[Psa 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#004), [Psa
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#005)

Those who look upon this Psalm as having a primary reference to the King
of Israel, attribute great beauty to these words, from the very pleasing
conjecture that David was, at the time of composing them, sojourning at
Mahanaim, where Jacob, in his distress, wrestled with the angel, and
obtained such signal blessings. That, in a place so greatly hallowed by
associations of the past, he should make his appeal to the God of his
fathers, was alike the dictate of patriarchal feeling and religion. -
John Morison, D.D., in "Morning Meditations."

[Psa 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#005)

"Thou didst deliver them," but thou wilt not deliver me; nay, rather
thou didst deliver them because thou wilt not deliver me. - Gerhohus.

[Psa 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#006)

"But I am a worm, and no man." A fisherman, when he casts his angle into
the river, doth not throw the hook in bare, naked, and uncovered, for
then he knows the fish will never bite, and therefore he hides the hook
within a worm, or some other bait, and so, the fish, biting at the worm,
is catched by the hook. Thus Christ, speaking of himself, saith, "Ego
vermis et non homo." He, coming to perform the great work of our
redemption, did cover and hide his Godhead within the worm of his human
nature. The grand water-serpent, Leviathan, the devil, thinking to
swallow the worm of his humanity, was caught upon the hook of his
divinity. This hook stuck in his jaws, and tore him very sore. By
thinking to destroy Christ, he destroyed his own kingdom, and lost his
own power for ever. - Lancelot Andrews.

[Psa 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#006)

"I am a worm." Christ calls himself "a worm".... on account of the
opinion that men of the world had of him..... The Jews esteemed Christ
as a worm, and treated him as such; he was loathsome to them and hated
by them; every one trampled upon him, and trod him under foot as men do
worms.....The Chaldee paraphrase renders it here a weak worm; and though
Christ is the mighty God, and is also the Son of man, whom God made
strong for himself; yet there was a weakness in his human nature, and he
was crucified through it, [Co2 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#004);
and it has been observed by some, that the word הּולעת there used
signifies the scarlet worm, or the worm that is in the grain or berry
with which scarlet is dyed; and like this scarlet worm did our Lord
look, when by way of mockery he was clothed with a scarlet robe; and
especially when he appeared in his dyed garments, and was red in his
apparel, as one that treadeth in the wine fat; when his body was covered
with blood when he hung upon the cross, which was shed to make crimson
and scarlet sins as white as snow. - John Gill.

[Psa 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#006)

"I am a worm." An humble soul is emptied of all swelling thoughts of
himself. Bernard calls humility a self-annihilation. [Job
22:29](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#029). "Thou wilt save the humble;" in
the Hebrew it is, "Him that is of low eyes." An humble man hath lower
thoughts of himself than others can have of him; David, though a king,
yet looked upon himself as "a worm:" "I am a worm, and no man." Bradford
a martyr, yet subscribes himself "a sinner." [Job
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#015). "If I be righteous, yet will I
not lift up my head'" like the violet, a sweet flower, but hangs down
the head. - Thomas Watson.

[Psa 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#006)

"A worm." So trodden under foot, trampled on, maltreated, buffeted and
spit upon, mocked and tormented, as to seem more like a worm than a man.
Behold what great contempt hath the Lord of Majesty endured, that his
confusion may be our glory; his punishment our heavenly bliss! Without
ceasing impress this spectacle, O Christian, on thy soul! - Dionysius,
quoted by Isaac Williams.

[Psa 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#006)

"I am a worm." Among the Hindoos, when a man complains and abhors
himself, he asks: "What am I? A worm! a worm!" "Ah, the proud man! he
regarded me as a worm, well should I like to say to him, 'We are all
worms.'" "Worm, crawl out of my presence." - Joseph Roberts.

[Psa 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#007)

"All they that see me laugh me to scorn," etc. Imagine this dreadful
scene. Behold this motley multitude of rich and poor, of Jews and
Gentiles! Some stand in groups and gaze. Some recline at ease and stare.
Others move about in restless gratification at the event. There is a
look of satisfaction on every countenance. None are silent. The velocity
of speech seems tardy. The theme is far too great for one member to
utter. Every lip, and head, and finger, is now a tongue. The rough
soldiers, too, are busied in their coarse way. The work of blood is
over. Refreshment has become necessary. Their usual beverage of vinegar
and water is supplied to them. As they severally are satisfied, they
approach the cross, hold some forth to the Saviour, and bid him drink as
they withdraw it. [Luk 23:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#036). They
know he must be suffering an intense thirst, they therefore aggravate it
with the mockery of refreshment. Cruel Romans! and ye, O regicidal Jews!
Was not death enough? Must mockery and scorn be added? On this sad day
Christ made you one indeed! Dreadful unity - which constituted you the
joint mockers and murderers of the Lord of glory! - John Stevenson.

[Psa 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#007)

"All they that see me laugh me to scorn," etc. There have been persons
in our own days, whose crimes have excited such detestation that the
populace would probably have torn them in pieces, before, and even after
their trial, if they could have had them in their power. Yet when these
very obnoxious persons have been executed according to their sentence,
if, perhaps, there was not one spectator who wished them to escape, yet
neither was one found so lost to sensibility as to insult them in their
dying moments. But when Jesus suffers, all that see him laugh him to
scorn; they shoot out the lip, they shake the head; they insult his
character and his hope. - John Newton.

[Psa 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#007)

"They shoot out the lip." To protrude the lower lip is, in the East,
considered a very strong indication of contempt. Its employment is
chiefly confined to the lower orders. - Illustrated Commentary.

[Psa 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#007), [Psa
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#008)

It was after his crucifixion, and during the hours that he hung upon the
cross, that his sufferings in this way - the torment of beholding and
hearing the scorn and mockery which was made of the truth of his person
and doctrine - exceedingly abounded, and in such and so many kinds of
mockery and insult that some consider this to have been the chiefest
pain and sorrow which he endured in his most sacred passion. For as,
generally, those things are considered the most painful to endure of
which we are most sensible, so it seems to these persons, that
sufferings of this kind contain in them more cause for feeling than any
other sufferings. And, therefore, although all the torments of the Lord
were very great, so that each one appears the greatest, and no
comparison can be made between them; yet, nevertheless, this kind of
suffering appears to be the most painful. Because in other troubles, not
only the pain and suffering of them, but the troubles themselves, in
themselves, may be desired by us, and such as we suffer for love's sake,
in order by them to evince that love. Wherefore, the stripes, the crown
of thorns, the buffetings, the cross, the gall, the vinegar, and other
bodily torments, besides that they torment the body, are often a means
for promoting the divine honour, which it holds in esteem above all
else. But to blaspheme God, to give the lie to eternal truths, to deface
the supreme demonstrations of the divinity and majesty of the Son of God
(although God knoweth how to extract from these things the good which he
intends), nevertheless are, in their nature, things, which, from their
so greatly affecting the divine honour, although they may be, for just
considerations, endured, can never be desired by any one, but must be
abhorrent to all. Our Lord then, being, of all, the most zealous for the
divine honour, for which he also died, found in this kind of suffering,
more than in all other, much to abhor and nothing to desire. Therefore
with good reason it may be held to be the greatest of all, and that in
which, more than in all other, he exhibited the greatest suffering and
patience. - Fra Thome de Jesu, in "The Sufferings of Jesus," 1869.

[Psa 22:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#007)

All that see me made but a laughynge stocke on me, they mocked me wyth
their lyppes, and wagged theyr heades at me. Sayenge, thys vyllayne
referred all thynges to the Lord, let him now delyver hym yf he wyll,
for he loveth hym well. But yet thou arte he whyche leddest me oute of
my mother's wombe myne one refuge, even from my mother's teates. As sone
as I came into this worlde, I was layde in thy lappe, thou art my God
even from my mother's wombe. - From "The Psalter of David in English,
truly translated out of Latyn," in "Devout Psalms," etc., by E.
Whitchurche, 1547.

[Psa 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#008)

Here are recorded some of those very words, by which the persecutors of
our Lord expressed their mockery and scorn. How remarkable to find them
in a Psalm written so many hundred years before! - John Stevenson.

[Psa 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#009), [Psa
22:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#010)

Faith is much strengthened by constant evidences of God's favour.
Herewith did he support his faith that said to God, "Thou art he that
took me out of the womb: thou didst make me hope when I was upon my
mother's breasts. I was cast upon thee from the womb: thou art my God
from my mother's belly." "Thou art my trust from my youth. By thee have
I been holden up from the womb: thou art he that took me out of my
mother's bowels." [Psa 71:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#005), [Psa
71:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#006). It was not only the disposition
of Obadiah towards God, but also the evidence that thereby he had of
God's affection towards him, that made him with confidence say to
Elijah, "I fear the Lord from my youth." [Kg1
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#012). By long continuance of ancient
favour, many demonstrations are given of a fast, fixed and unremovable
affection. So as if, by reason of temptations, one or more evidences
should be questioned, yet others would remain to uphold faith, and to
keep it from an utter languishing, and a total falling away. As when a
house is supported by many pillars, though some be taken away, yet by
the support of them which remain, the house will stand. - William Gouge.

[Psa 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#009), [Psa
22:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#010)

David acknowledges ancient mercies, those mercies which had been east
upon him long ago, these were still fresh and new in his memory, and
this is one affection and disposition of a thankful heart - to remember
those mercies which another would have quite forgotten, or never thought
of. Thus does David here; the mercies of his infancy, and his childhood,
and his younger years, which one would have imagined, that now in his
age had been quite out of his mind; yet these does he here stir up
himself to remember and bring to his thoughts. "Took me out of the
womb:" when was that? It may have been threescore years ago when David
penned the Psalms. He thinks of those mercies which God vouchsafed him
when he was not capable of thinking, nor considering what was bestowed
upon him; and so are we taught hence to do, in an imitation of his holy
example which is here set before us: those mercies which God hath
bestowed in our minority we are to call to mind and acknowledge in our
riper years. - Thomas Horton.

[Psa 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#009), [Psa
22:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#010)

Here the tribulation begins to grow lighter, and hope inclines towards
victory; a support, though small, and sought out with deep anxiety, is
now found. For after he had felt that he had suffered without any
parallel or example, so that the wonderful works of God as displayed
toward the fathers afforded him no help, he comes to the wonderful works
of God toward himself, and in these he finds the goodwill of God turned
towards him, and which was displayed towards him alone in so singular a
way. - Martin Luther.

[Psa 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#009), [Psa
22:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#010)

The bitter severity of the several taunts with which his enemies
assailed our Lord, had no other effect than to lead the Saviour to make
a direct appeal to his Father.... That appeal is set before us in these
two verses. It is of an unusual and remarkable nature. The argument on
which it is founded is most forcible and conclusive. At the same time,
it is the most seasonable and appropriate that can be urged. We may thus
paraphrase it, "I am now brought as a man to my extremity. It is said
that God disowns me; but it cannot be so. My first moment of existence
he tenderly cared for. When I could not even ask for, or think of his
kindness, he bestowed it upon me. If, of his mere good pleasure he
brought me into life at first, he will surely not forsake me when I am
departing out of it. In opposition, therefore, to all their taunts, I
can and I will appeal to himself. Mine enemies declare, O God, that thou
hast cast me off - but thou art he that look me out of the womb. They
affirm that I do not, and need not trust in thee; but thou didst make me
hope (or, keptest me in safety, margin) when I was upon my mother's
breasts. They insinuate that thou wilt not acknowledge me as thy Son;
but I was cast upon thee from the womb; thou art my God from my mother's
belly." - John Stevenson.

[Psa 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#010)

"I was cast upon thee from the womb: thou art my God from my mother's
belly." There is a noble passage in Eusebius, in which he shows the
connection between our Lord's incarnation and his passion: that he might
well comfort himself while hanging on the cross by the remembrance that
the very same body then "marred more than any man, and his form more
than the sons of men" ([Isa 52:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#014)),
was that which had been glorified by the Father with such singular
honour, when the Holy Ghost came upon Mary, and the power of the Highest
overshadowed her. That this body, therefore, though now so torn and so
mangled, as it had once been the wonder, so it would for ever be the
joy, of the angels; and having put on immortality, would be the support
of his faithful people to the end of time. - J. M. Neale, in loc.

[Psa 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#010)

I was like one forsaken by his parent, and wholly cast upon Providence.
I had no father upon earth, and my mother was poor and helpless. -
Matthew Poole.

[Psa 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#011)

"Be not far from me; for trouble is near;" and so it is high time for
thee to put forth a helping hand. Hominibus profanis mirabilis videtur
haec ratio, to profane persons, this seemeth to be a strange reason,
saith an interpreter; but it is a very good one, as this prophet knew,
who therefore makes it his plea. - John Trapp.

[Psa 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#012)

"Strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round." These animals are
remarkable for the proud, fierce, and sullen manner in which they
exercise their great strength. Such were the persecutors who now beset
our Lord. These were first, human, and secondly, spiritual foes; and
both were alike distinguished by the proud, fierce, and sullen manner in
which they assaulted him. - John Stevenson.

[Psa 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#012), [Psa
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#013)

"Bashan" was a fertile country ([Num
32:4](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#004)), and the cattle there fed were
fat and "strong." [Deu 32:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#014). Like
them, the Jews in that good land "waxed fat and kicked," grew proud and
rebelled; forsook God "that made them, and lightly esteemed the rock of
their salvation." - George Horne.

[Psa 22:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#013)

A helpless infant, or a harmless lamb, surrounded by furious bulls and
hungry lions, aptly represented the Saviour encompassed by his insulting
and bloody persecutors. - Thomas Scott, 1747-1881.

[Psa 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#014)

"I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart
is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels." He was faint. Such
a feeling of languor and faintness supervened that language fails to
express it, and the emblem of "water poured out" is employed to
represent it. As the water falls from the vessel to the earth, see how
its particles separate farther and farther from each other. Its velocity
increases as it falls. It has no power to stay itself midway, much less
to return to its place. It is the very picture of utter weakness. So did
our Lord feel himself to be when hanging on the cross. He was faint with
weakness. The sensations experienced when about to faint away are very
overpowering. We appear to our own consciousness to be nothing but
weakness, as water poured out. All our bones feel relaxed and out of
joint; we seem as though we had none. The strength of bone is gone, the
knitting of the joints is loosened, and the muscular vigour fled. A
sickly giddiness overcomes us. We have no power to bear up. All heart is
lost. Our strength disappears like that of wax, of melting wax, which
drops upon surrounding objects, and is lost. Daniel thus describes his
sensations on beholding the great vision, "There remained no strength in
me: for my rigour was turned into corruption, and I retained no
strength." [Dan 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#008). In regard,
however, to the faintness which our Lord experienced, we ought to notice
this additional and remarkable circumstance, that he did not altogether
faint away. The relief of insensibility he refused to take. When
consciousness ceases, all perception of pain is necessarily and
instantly terminated. But our Lord retained his full consciousness
throughout this awful scene; and patiently endured for a considerable
period, those, to us, insupportable sensations which precede the actual
swoon. - John Stevenson.

[Psa 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#014)

"I am poured out like water:" that is, in the thought of my enemies I am
utterly destroyed. "For we must needs die, and are as water spill on the
ground, which cannot be gathered up again." [Sa2
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#014). "What marvel," asks St.
Bernard, "that the name of the Bridegroom should be as ointment poured
forth, when he himself, for the greatness of his love, was poured forth
like water!" - J. M. Neale.

[Psa 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#014)

"I am poured out like water," i.e., I am almost past all recovery, as
water spill upon the ground. - John Trapp.

[Psa 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#014)

"All my bones are out of joint." The rack is devised as a most exquisite
pain, even for terror. And the cross is a rack, whereon he was stretched
till, saith the Psalm, "all his bones were out of joint." But even to
stand, as he hung, three long hours together, holding up but the arms at
length, I have heard it avowed of some that have felt it, to be a pain
scarce credible. But the hands and the feet being so cruelly nailed
(part, of all other, most sensible, by reason of the texture of sinews
there in them most) it could not but make his pain out of measure
painful. It was not for nothing, that dolores acerrimi dicuntur
cruciatus (saith the heathen man), that the most sharp and bitter pains
of all other have their name from hence, and are called cruciatus -
pains like those of the cross. It had a meaning, that they gave him,
that he had (for his welcome to the cross) a cup mixed with gall or
myrrh; and (for his farewell) a sponge of vinegar; to show by the one
the bitterness, and by the other the sharpness of the pains of this
painful death. - Lancelot Andrewes.

[Psa 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#014)

"All my bones are out of joint." We know that the greatest and most
intolerable pain that the body can endure, is that arising from a bone
out of its place, or dislocated joint. Now when the Lord was raised up
upon the cross, and his sacred body hung in the air from the nails, all
the joints began to give, so that the bones were parted the one from the
other so visibly that, in very truth (as David had prophesied) they
might tell all his bones, and thus, throughout his whole body, he
endured acute torture. Whilst our Lord suffered these torments, his
enemies, who had so earnestly desired to see him crucified, far from
pitying him, were filled with delight, as though celebrating a victory.
- Fra Thom de Jesu.

[Psa 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#015)

"My strength is dried up," etc. Inflammation must have commenced early
and violently in the wounded parts - then been quickly imparted to those
that were strained, and have terminated in a high degree of feverish
burning over the whole body. The animal juices would be thus dried up,
and the watery particles of the blood absorbed. The skin parched by the
scorching sun till midday would be unable to supply or to imbibe any
moisture. The loss of blood at the hands and feet would hasten the
desiccation. Hence our Lord says, "My strength is dried up like a
potsherd, and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws." The fever would devour his
small remaining strength. And thirst, that most intolerable of all
bodily privations, must have been overpowering. His body appeared to his
feeling like a potsherd that had been charred in the potter's kiln. It
seemed to have neither strength nor substance left in it. So feeble had
he become, so parched and dried up that clamminess of the mouth, one of
the forerunners of immediate dissolution, had already seized him; "My
tongue cleaveth to my jaws, and thou hast brought me into the dust of
death." - John Stevenson.

[Psa 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#015)

"My strength is dried up;" not as in the trial of gold and silver, but
"like a potsherd," as the earthen vessel dried up by the heat, spoken in
humiliation. - Isaac Williams, in loc.

[Psa 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#015)

"A potsherd." תדשׂ, rendered potsherd, is a word which denotes a piece
of earthenware, frequently in a broken state. As employed in the verse
under consideration, it seems to derive considerable illustration from
the corresponding word in Arabic, which expresses roughness of skin, and
might well convey to the mind an idea of the bodily appearance of one in
whom the moisture of the fluids had been dried up by the excess of
grief. - John Morison.

[Psa 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#015)

That hour what his feelings were ill is dangerous to define: we know
them not; we may be too bold to determine of them. To very good purpose
it was that the ancient Fathers of the Greek church in their liturgy,
after they had recounted all the particular pains, as they are set down
in his passion, and by all and by everyone of them called for mercy, do,
after all, shut up with this Δι αγνωστων λυπῶν κὶ βασάνων ελέησον κὶ
σῶσον ἡμας. By thine unknown sorrows and sufferings, felt by thee, but
not distinctly known by us, have mercy upon us and save us. - Lancelot
Andrewes.

[Psa 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#016)

"Dogs have compassed me." So great and varied was the malignity
exhibited by the enemies of our Lord, that the combined characteristics
of two species of ferocious animals were not adequate to its
representation. Another emblematical figure is therefore introduced. The
assembly of the wicked is compared to that of "dogs" who haunt about the
cities, prowl in every corner snarl over the carrion, and devour it all
with greediness - like "dogs," with their wild cry in full pursuit, with
unfailing scent tracking their victim, with vigilant eye on all its
movements, and with a determination which nothing can falter, they run
it on to death. The Oriental mode of hunting, both in ancient and modern
times, is murderous and merciless in the extreme. A circle of several
miles in circumference is beat round; and the men, driving all before
them, and narrowing as they advance, inclose the prey on every side.
Having thus made them prisoners, the cruel hunters proceed to slaughter
at their own convenience. So did the enemies of our Lord: long before
his crucifixion it is recorded that they used the most treacherous plans
to get him into their power. - John Stevenson.

[Psa 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#016)

"Dogs have compassed me." At the hunting of the lion, a whole district
is summoned to appear, who, forming themselves first into a circle,
enclose a space of four or five miles in compass, according to the
number of the people and the quality of the ground which is pitched upon
for the scene of action. The footmen advance first, rushing into the
thickets with their dogs and spears, to put up the game; while the
horsemen, keeping a little behind, are always ready to charge upon the
first sally of the wild beast. In this manner they proceed, still
contracting their circle, till they all at last close in together, or
meet with some other game to divert them. - Dr. Shaw's Travels, quoted
in Paxton's "Illustrations of Scripture."

[Psa 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#016)

"They pierced my hands and my feet;" namely, when they nailed Christ to
the cross. [Mat 27:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#035); [Joh
20:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#025). Where let me simulate, saith a
learned man, the orator's gradation, Facinus vincire civem Romanum, etc.
It was much for the Son of God to be bound, more to be beaten, most of
all to be slain; Quid dicam in crucem tolle? but what shall I say to
this, that he was crucified? That was the most vile and ignominious; it
was also a cruel and cursed kind of death, which yet he refused not; and
here we have a clear testimony for his cross. - John Trapp.

[Psa 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#016)

"They pierced my hands and my feet." Of all sanguinary punishments, that
of crucifixion is one of the most dreadful - no vital part is
immediately affected by it. The hands and feet which are furnished with
the most numerous and sensitive organs, are perforated with nails, which
must necessarily be of some size to suit their intended purpose. The
tearing asunder of the tender fibres of the hands and feet, the
lacerating of so many nerves, and bursting so many blood-vessels, must
be productive of intense agony. The nerves of the hand and foot are
intimately connected, through the arm and leg, with the nerves of the
whole body; their laceration therefore must be felt over the entire
frame. Witness the melancholy result of even a needle's puncture in even
one of the remotest nerves. A spasm is not unfrequently produced by it
in the muscles of the face, which locks the jaws inseparably. When,
therefore the hands and feet of our blessed Lord were transfixed with
nails, he must have felt the sharpest pangs shoot through every part of
his body. Supported only by his lacerated limbs, and suspended from his
pierced hands, our Lord had nearly six hours' torment to endure. - John
Stevenson.

[Psa 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#016)

"They pierced my hands and my feet." That evangelical prophet testifies
it, "Behold I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands." [Isa
49:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#016). Were we not engraven there when
his hands were pierced for us? "They digged my hands and my feet." And
they digged them so deep, that the very prints remained after his
resurrection, and their fingers were thrust into them for evidence sake.
Some have thought that those scars remain still in his glorious body, to
be showed at his second appearing: "They shall see him whom they have
pierced." That is improbable, but this is certain; there remains still
an impression upon Christ's hands and his heart, the sealing and wearing
of the elect there, as precious jewels. - Thomas Adams.

[Psa 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#017)

"I may tell all my bones: they look and stare upon me." The skin and
flesh were distended by the posture of the body on the cross, that the
bones, as through a thin veil, became visible, and might be counted. -
George Horne.

[Psa 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#017)

"I may tell all my bones." For, as the first Adam by his fall, lost the
robe of innocence, and thence forth needed other garments, so the second
Adam vouchsafed to be stripped of his earthly vestments, to the end it
might hereafter be said to us, "Bring forth the first robe, and put it
on him." [Luk 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#022). - Gerhohus,
quoted by J. M. Neale.

[Psa 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#017)

"They look and stare upon me." Sensitively conscious of his condition
upon the cross, the delicate feelings of the holy Saviour were sorely
pained by the gaze of the multitude. With impudent face they looked upon
him. To view him better they halted as they walked. With deliberate
insolence they collected in groups, and made their remarks to each other
on his conduct and appearance. Mocking his naked, emaciated, and
quivering body, they "looked and stared upon him." - John Stevenson.

[Psa 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#017)

"They look and stare upon me." Oh, how different is that look which the
awakened sinner directs to Calvary, when faith lifts up her eye to him
who agonised, and bled, and died, for the guilty! And what gratitude
should perishing men feel, that from him that hangs upon the accursed
tree there is heard proceeding the-inviting sound, "Look unto me, and be
ye saved, all ye ends of the earth, for I am God, and besides me there
is none else." - John Morison.

[Psa 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#018)

"They part my garments," etc. Perfectly naked did the cruciarii hang
upon the cross, and the executioners received their clothes. There is
nothing to show that there was a cloth even round the loins. The clothes
became the property of the soldiers, after Roman usage. The outer
garment was divided probably into four, by ripping up the seams. Four
soldiers were counted off as a guard, by the Roman code. The under
garment could not be divided, being woven; and this led the soldiers to
the dice-throwing. - J. P. Lange, D.D., on [Mat
27:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#035).

[Psa 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#018)

"They part my garments," etc. Instruments will not be wanting to crucify
Christ, if it were but for his old clothes, and those but little worth;
for these soldiers crucify him, though they got but his garments for
their reward. Christ did submit to suffer naked, hereby to teach us: -
1. That all flesh are really naked before God by reason of sin ([Exo
32:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#025); [Ch2
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#019)), and therefore our Surety
behoved to suffer naked. 2. That he offered himself a real captive in
his sufferings, that so he might fully satisfy justice by being under
the power of his enemies, till he redeemed himself by the strong hand,
having fully paid the price; for therefore did he submit to be stripped
naked, as conquerors use to do with prisoners. 3. That by thus suffering
naked he would expiate our abuse of apparel, and purchase to us a
liberty to make use of suitable raiment, and such as becometh us in our
station. 4. That by this suffering naked he would purchase unto them who
flee to him to be covered with righteousness and glory, and to walk with
him in white for ever, and would point out the nakedness of those who,
not being found clothed with his righteousness, shall not be clothed
upon with immortality and glory. [Co2
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#002), [Co2
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#003). 5. He would also by this, teach
all his followers to resolve on nakedness in their following of him, as
a part of their conformity with their Head ([Jo1
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#017); [Rom
8:35](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#035); [Heb
11:37](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#037)), and that therefore they should
not dote much on their apparel when they have it. - George Hutcheson,
1657.

[Psa 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#018)

"And cast lots upon my vesture." Trifling as this act of casting the lot
for our Lord's vesture may appear, it is most significant. It contains a
double lesson. It teaches us how greatly that seamless shirt was valued;
how little he had to whom it belonged. It seemed to say, this garment is
more valuable than its owner. As it was said of the thirty pieces of
silver, "A goodly price at which I was prized at of them;" so may we say
regarding the casting of the lot, "How cheaply Christ was held!" - John
Stevenson.

[Psa 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#020)

"My darling" had better be rendered "my lonely, or solitary one." For he
wishes to say that his soul was lonely and forsaken by all, and that
there was no one who sought after him as a friend, or cared for him, or
comforted him: as we have it, [Psa
142:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#004), "Refuge failed me; no one cared
for my soul; I looked on my right hand, but there was no one who would
know me;" that is, solitude is of itself a certain cross, and especially
so in such great torments, in which it is most grievous to be immersed
without an example and without a companion. And yet, in such a state,
everyone of us must be, in some suffering or other, and especially in
that of death; and we must be brought to cry out with [Psa
25:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#016), "Turn thee unto me, and have
mercy upon me, for I am desolate and afflicted." - Martin Luther.

[Psa 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#020)

"The dog, "It is scarcely possible for a European to form an idea of the
intolerable nuisance occasioned in the villages and cities of the East,
by the multitude of dogs that infest the streets. The natives,
accustomed from their earliest years to the annoyance, come to be
regardless of it; but to a stranger, these creatures are the greatest
plague to which he is subjected; for as they are never allowed to enter
a house, and do not consititute the property of any particular owner,
they display none of those habits of which the domesticated species
among us are found susceptible, and are destitute of all those social
qualities which often render the dog the trusty and attached friend of
man.... The race seems wholly to degenerate in the warm regions of the
East, and to approximate to the character of beasts of prey, as in
disposition they are ferocious, cunning, bloodthirsty, and possessed of
the most insatiable voracity: and even in their very form there is
something repulsive; their sharp and savage features; their wolf-like
eyes; their long hanging ears; their straight and pointed tails; their
lank and emaciated forms, almost entirely without a belly, give them an
appearance of wretchedness and degradation, that stands in sad contrast
with the general condition and qualities of the breed in
Europe.....These hideous creatures, dreaded by the people for their
ferocity, or avoided by them as useless and unclean, are obliged to
prowl about everywhere in search of a precarious existence.... They
generally run in bands, and their natural ferocity, inflamed by hunger,
and the consciousness of strength, makes them the most troublesome and
dangerous visitors to the stranger who unexpectedly finds himself in
their neighbourhood, as they will not scruple to seize whatever he may
have about him, and even, in the event of his falling, and being
otherwise defenceless, to attack and devour him.... These animals,
driven by hunger, greedily devour everything that comes in their way;
they glut themselves with the most putrid and loathsome substances that
are thrown about the cities, and of nothing are they so fond as of human
flesh, a repast, with which the barbarity of the despotic countries of
Asia frequently supplies them, as the bodies of criminals slain for
murder, treason, or violence, are seldom buried, and lie exposed till
the mangled fragments are carried off by the dogs. - From "Illustrations
of Scripture, by the late Professor George Paxton, D.D., revised and
enlarged by Robert Jamieson," 1843.

[Psa 22:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#021)

"Save me from the lion's mouth." Satan is called a lion, and that fitly;
for he hath all the properties of the lion: as bold as a lion, as strong
as a lion, as furious as a lion, as terrible as the roaring of a lion.
Yea, worse: the lion wants subtlety and suspicion; herein the devil is
beyond the lion. The lion will spare the prostrate, the devil spares
none. The lion is full and forbears, the devil is full and devours. He
seeks all; let not the simple say, He will take no notice of me; nor the
subtle, He cannot overreach me; nor the noble say, He will not presume
to meddle with me; nor the rich, He dares not contest with me; for he
seeks to devour all. He is our common adversary, therefore let us cease
all quarrels amongst ourselves, and fight with him. - Thomas Adams.

[Psa 22:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#021)

"Save me... from the horns of the unicorns." Those who are in great
trouble from the power or cruelty of others, often cry out to their
gods, "Ah! save me from the tusk of the elephant from the mouth of the
tiger and the tusks of the boar, deliver me, deliver me!.... Who will
save me from the horn of the Kāndam?" This animal is now extinct in
these regions, and it is not easy to determine what it was; the word in
the Sathur - Agarāthe - is rendered "jungle cow." - Joseph Roberts.

[Psa 22:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#021)

"The horns of the unicorns." On turning to the Jewish Bible we find that
the word דאם is translated as buffalo, and there is no doubt that this
rendering is nearly the correct one, and at the present day naturalists
are nearly agreed that the reêm of the Old Testament must have been now
the extinct urus.... The presence of these horns affords a remarkable
confirmation to a well-known passage in Julius Csar's familiar
"Commentaries." "The uri are little inferior to elephants in size"
("magnitudine paulo infra elephantos;") "but are bulls in their nature,
colour, and figure. Great is their strength, and great their swiftness;
nor do they spare man or beast when they have caught sight of them." -
J, G. Wood, M.A., F.L.S., in "Bible Animals," 1869.

[Psa 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#022)

"I will declare thy name unto my brethren." Having thus obtained relief
from the oppressive darkness, and regained conscious possession of the
joy and light of his Father's countenance, the thoughts and desires of
the Redeemer flow into their accustomed channel. The glory of God in the
salvation of his church. - John Stevenson.

[Psa 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#022)

"My brethren." This gives evidence of the low condescension of the Son
of God, and also of the high exaltation of sons of men; for the Son of
God to be a brother to sons of men is a great degree of humiliation, and
for sons of men to be made brethren with the Son of God is a high degree
of exaltation; for Christ's brethren are in that respect sons of God,
heirs of heaven, or kings, not earthly, but heavenly; not temporary, but
everlasting kings.... This respect of Christ to his brethren is a great
encouragement and comfort to such as are despised and scorned by men of
this world for Christ's professing of them. - William Gouge.

[Psa 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#024)

"For he hath not despised nor abhorred the prayer of the poor, neither
hath he hid his face from me; but when I cried unto him, he heard me."
Let him, therefore, that desires to be of the seed of Israel, and to
rejoice in the grace of the gospel, become poor, for this is a fixed
truth, our God is one that has respect unto the poor! And observe the
fulness and diligence of the prophet. He was not content with having
said "will not despise," but adds, "and will not abhor;" and again,
"will not turn away his face;" and again, "will hear." And then he adds
himself as an example, saying "When I cried," as our translation has it.
As if he had said, "Behold ye, and learn by my example, who have been
made the most vile of all men, and numbered among the wicked; when I was
despised, cast out, rejected, behold! I was held in the highest esteem,
and taken up, and heard. Let not this state of things, therefore, after
this, my encouraging example, frighten you; the gospel requires a man to
be such a character before it will save him." These things, I say,
because our weakness requires so much exhortation, that it might not
dread being humbled, nor despair when humbled, and thus might, after the
bearing of the cross, receive the salvation. - Martin Luther.

[Psa 22:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#025)

"My praise shall be of thee in the great congregation," etc. The joy and
gratitude of our adorable Lord rise to such a height at this great
deliverance, his heart so overflows with fresh and blessed consciousness
of his heavenly Father's nearness, that he again pours forth the
expression of his praise. By its repetition, he teaches us that this is
not a temporary burst of gratitude, but an abiding determination, a full
and settled resolution. - John Stevenson.

[Psa 22:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#025)

"In the great congregation." Saints are fittest witnesses of sacred
duties. That which, in [Psa 116:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#014), is
implied under this particle of restraint, "his," in "the presence of all
his people," is in [Psa 22:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#025), more
expressly noted by a more apparent description, thus: "I will pay my
vows before them that fear him." None but true saints do truly fear God.
1. This property of God's people, that they fear the Lord, showeth that
they will make the best use of such sacred, solemn duties performed in
their presence. They will glorify God for this your zeal; they will join
their spirits with your spirit in this open performance of duty; they
will become followers of you, and learn of you to vow and pay unto the
Lord, and that openly, publicly. 2. As for others, they are no better
than such hogs and dogs as are not meet to have such precious pearls and
holy things cast before them, lest they trample them under their feet. -
William Gouge.

[Psa 22:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#026)

"The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the Lord that
seek him; your heart shall live for ever." A spiritual banquet is
prepared in the church for the "meek" and lowly in heart. The death of
Christ was the sacrifice for sin; his flesh is meat indeed, and his
blood is drink indeed. The poor in spirit feed on this provision, in
their hearts by faith, and are satisfied, and thus, whilst they "seek"
the Lord, they "praise" him also, and their "hearts" (or souls), are
preserved unto eternal life. - "Practical Illustrations of the Book of
Psalms," 1836.

[Psa 22:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#026)

"The meek." Bonaventure engraved this sweet saying of our Lord, "Learn
of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart," in his study. O that this
saying was engraved upon all your foreheads, and upon all your hearts! -
Charles Bradbury.

[Psa 22:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#026)

"They shall praise the Lord that seek him; your heart shall live for
ever." Now, I would fain know the man that ever went about to form such
laws as should bind the hearts of men, or prepare such rewards as should
reach the souls and consciences of men! Truly, if any mortal man should
make a law that his subjects should love him with all their hearts and
souls, and not dare, upon peril of his greatest indignation, to
entertain a traitorous thought against his royal person, but presently
confess it to him, or else he would be avenged on him, he would deserve
to be more laughed at for his pride and folly, than Xerxes for casting
his fetters into the Hellespont, to chain the waves into his obedience;
or Caligula, that threatened the air, if it durst rain when he was at
his pastimes, who durst not himself so much as look into the air when it
thundered. Certainly a madhouse would be more fit for such a person than
a throne, who should so far forfeit his reason, as to think that the
thoughts and hearts of men were within his jurisdiction. - William
Gurnall.

[Psa 22:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#026)

"Your heart," that is, not your outward man, but the hidden man of the
heart ([Eze 36:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#026)); the new man which
is created after the image of God in righteousness and true holiness,
"shall live for ever." The life which animates it is the life of the
Spirit of God. - John Stevenson.

[Psa 22:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#027)

"All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the Lord; and
all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before him." This passage
is a prediction of the conversion of the Gentiles. It furnishes us with
two interesting ideas; the nature of true conversion - and the extent of
it under the reign of the Messiah. 1. The nature of true conversion: -
It is to "remember" - to "turn to the Lord" - and to "worship before
him." This is a plain and simple process. Perhaps the first religious
exercise of mind of which we are conscious is reflection. A state of
unregeneracy is a state of forgetfulness. God is forgotten. Sinners have
lost all just sense of his glory, authority, mercy, and judgment; living
as if there were no God, or as if they thought there was none. But if
ever we are brought to be the subjects of true conversion, we shall be
brought to remember these things. This divine change is fitly expressed
by the case of the prodigal, who is said to have come to himself, or to
his right mind. But further, true conversion consists not only in
remembering but in" turning to the Lord." This part of the passage is
expressive of a cordial relinquishment of our idols, whatever they have
been, and an acquiescence in the gospel way of salvation by Christ
alone. Once more, true conversion to Christ will be accompanied with the
"worship" of him. Worship, as a religious exercise, is the homage of the
heart, presented to God according to his revealed will....2. The extent
of conversion under the kingdom or reign of the Messiah: "All the ends
of the world shall remember and turn unto the Lord; and all the kindreds
of the nations shall worship before him." It was fit that the accession
of the Gentiles should be reserved for the gospel day, that it might
grace the triumph of Christ over his enemies, and appear to be what it
is, "the travail of his soul." This great and good work, begun in the
apostles' days, must go on, and "must increase," till "All the ends of
the world shall remember and turn," and "all the kindreds of the nations
shall worship before him." Conversion work has been individual; God has
gathered sinners one by one. Thus it is at present with us; but it will
not be thus always. People will flock to Zion as doves to their windows.
Further, conversion work has hitherto been circumscribed within certain
parts of the world. But the time will come when "all the kindreds of the
earth" shall worship These hopes are not the flight of an ardent
imagination; they are founded on the true sayings of God. Finally, while
we are concerned for the world, let us not forget our own souls. So the
whole world be saved and we lost, what will it avail us? - Condensed
from Andrew Fuller.

[Psa 22:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#027)

"All the ends of the world shall remember" - this is a remarkable
expression. It implies that man has forgotten God. It represents all the
successive generations of the world as but one, and then it exhibits
that one generation, as if it had been once in paradise, suddenly
remembering the Lord whom it had known there, but had long forgotten....
The converted nations, we learn by this verse, will not only obtain
remembrance of their past loss, but will also be filled with the
knowledge of present duty. - John Stevenson.

[Psa 22:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#027)

"All the nations of the world" (יוכּדוּ jizkeru, the same Hebrew root
with אוכּיד azkir) "shall remember;" why? what is that? or what shall
they remember? Even this: they shall turn to the Lord, and worship him,
in his name, in his ordinances; as is explained in the words following
of the verse: "And all the families of the nations" (וישׁתּחזוּ
jishtachavu, "shall bow" down themselves, or) "worship before thee,"
etc. And so in [Psa 86:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#009), "All nations
whom thou hast made shall come" (וישׁתּחווּ vejishtachavu) "and they
shall worship before thee;" and now shall they do so? Even by recording,
remembering, and making mention of the glory of thy name; as in the
words following (ויבבּדוּ לשׁמך vicabbedu lishmecha,) "and shall glorify
thy name." - William Strong's "Saints' Communion with God," 1656.

[Psa 22:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#027), [Psa
22:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#028)

The one undeviating object of the Son all through was, the glory of the
Father: he came to do his will, and he fulfilled it with all the
unvarying intensity of the most heavenly affection. What, then, will not
be the exuberant joy of his heart, when in his glorious kingdom, he
shall see the Father beyond all measure glorified?... The praise and
honour and blessing which will be yielded to the Father in that day
through him, so that God shall be all in all, will make him feel he
underwent not a sorrow too much for such a precious consummation....
Every note of thanksgiving which ascends to the Father, whether from the
fowls of the air, or the beasts of the field, or the fishes of the sea,
or the hills, or the mountains, or the trees of the forest, or the
rivers of the valleys - all shall gladden his heart, as sweet in the
ears of God, for the sake of him who redeemed even them from the curse,
and restored to them a harmony more musical than burst from them on the
birthday of their creation. And man! renewed and regenerated man! for
whose soul the blood was spilt, and for the redemption of whose body
death was overcome, how shall the chorus of his thanksgiving, in its
intelligent and articulate hallelujahs, be the incense which that
Saviour shall still love to present unto the Father, a sweet-smelling
savour through himself, who, that he might sanctify his people by his
own blood, suffered without the camp. How are the channels choked up or
impaired in this evil world, wherein the praises and glory of our God
should flow as a river! How will Christ then witness, to the delight of
his soul, all cleared and restored! No chill upon the heart, no
stammering in the tongue, in his Father's praises! No understanding
dull, or eye feeble, in the apprehension of his glory! No hand unready,
or foot stumbling, in the fulfilling of his commandments. God, the glory
of his creatures: his glory their service and their love; and all this
the reward to Jesus of once suffering himself. - C. J. Goodhart, M.A.,
in "Bloomsbury Lent Lectures," 1848.

[Psa 22:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#029)

"And they shall bow that go down into the dust; their soul liveth not:"
that is, whose soul liveth not, by an Hebraism; it being meant, that he
who is of most desperate condition, being without hope of life and
salvation, his sins are so notorious, shall "eat" also of this feast,
and be turned to God to "worship" and serve him; being thus plucked out
of the jaws of death and everlasting destruction, as it were, being
before this very hour ready to seize upon him. The new translation,
"None can keep alive his own soul," as it agreeth not with the Hebrew,
so it makes the sense more perplexed. By "him that goeth down to the
dust, whose soul liveth not," some understand the most miserably poor,
who have nothing to feed upon, whereby their life may be preserved, yet
shall feed also of this feast as well as the rich, and praise God.
Ainsworth is for either spiritually poor and miserable, because most
wicked, or worldly poor; and there is an exposition of Basil's,
understanding by the rich, the rich in faith and grace, touching which,
or the rich properly so called, he is indifferent. But because it is
said, "The fat of the earth," I prefer the former, and that the close of
the verse may best answer to the first part; the latter by "those that
are going to the dust," understand the miserably poor. So that there is
a commonplace of comfort for all, both richest, and poorest, if they be
subjects of God's kingdom of grace: their souls shall be alike fed by
him and saved. - John Mayer.

[Psa 22:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#029)

"All they that go down to the dust;" either those who stand quivering on
the brink of the grave, or those who occupy the humble, sequestered
walks of life. As the great and opulent of the earth are intended in the
first clause, it is not by any means unnatural to suppose that the image
of going "down to the dust," is designed to represent the poor and mean
of mankind, who are unable to support themselves, and to provide for
their multiplied necessities. If the grave be alluded to, as is thought
by many eminent divines, the beautiful sentiment of the verse will be,
that multitudes of dying sinners shall be brought to worship Jehovah,
and that those who cannot save or deliver themselves shall seek that
shelter which none can find but those who approach the mercy-seat. "Rich
and poor," as Bishop Horne, observes, "are invited" - that is, to
"worship God;" "and the hour is coming when all the race of Adam, as
many as sleep in the 'dust' of the earth, unable to raise themselves
from thence, quickened and called forth by the voice of the Son of Man,
must bow the knee to King Messiah." - John Morison.

[Psa 22:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#029)

To be brought to the dust, is, first, a circumlocution or description of
death: "Shall the dust praise thee, shall it declare thy truth?" [Psa
30:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#009). That is shall I praise thee when
I am among the dead? "What profit is there in my blood, when I go down
to the pit?" Not that profit, sure, I cannot bring thee in the tribute
of praise when my life's gone out. Secondly, to be brought to the dust
is a description of any low and poor condition. "All they that be fat
upon earth (that is, the great and mighty), "shall eat and worship" "all
they that go down to the dust" (that is, the mean and base), "shall bow
before him." As if he had said, rich and poor, high and low, the king
and the beggar, have alike need of salvation by Jesus Christ, and must
submit unto him, that they may be saved, for, as it there follows, "none
can keep alive his own soul." The capitivity of the Jews in Babylon is
expressed under those notions of death, and of dwelling in the dust
([Isa 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#019)); to show how low, that no
power but his who can raise the dead, could work their deliverance. -
Joseph Caryl.

[Psa 22:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#029)

"None can keep alive his own soul." And yet we look back to our
conversion, and its agonies of earnestness, its feelings of deep,
helpless dependence - of Christ's being absolutely our daily, hourly
need - supplier - as a past something - a stage of spiritual life which
is over. And we are satisfied to have it so. The Spirit of God moved
over our deadness, and breathed into us the breath of life. My soul
became a living soul. But was this enough? God's word says, No. "None
can keep alive his own soul." My heart says, No. Truth must ever answer
to truth. I cannot (ah! have I not tried, and failed?) I cannot keep
alive my own soul. We cannot live upon ourselves. Our physical life is
kept up by supply from without - air, food, warmth. So must the
spiritual life. Jesus gives, Jesus feeds us day by day, else must the
life fade out and die. "None can keep alive his own soul." It is not
enough to be made alive. I must be fed, and guided, and taught, and kept
in life. Mother, who hast brought a living babe into the world, is your
work done? Will you not nurse it, and feed it, and care for it, that it
may be kept alive? Lord, I am this babe. I live indeed, for I can crave
and cry. Leave me not, O my Saviour. Forsake not the work of thine own
hands. In thee I live. Hold me, carry me, feed me, let me abide in thee.
"For the kingdom is the Lord's: and he is the governor among the
nations. All they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship: all they
that go down to the dust shall bow before him: and none can keep alive
his own soul." In our work for God, we need to remember this. Is not the
conversion, the arousing of sinners, the great, and with many, the sole
aim in working for God? Should it be so? Let us think of this other
work. Let us help to keep alive. Perhaps it is less distinguished, as it
may be less distinguished to feed a starving child than to rescue a
drowning man. But let us walk less by sight, more by faith. Let us not
indeed neglect to call to life those who are spiritually dead. But oh!
let us watch for the more hidden needs of the living - the fading,
starving, fainting souls, which yet can walk and speak, and cover their
want and sorrow. Let us be fellow-workers with God in all his work. And
with a deep heart-feeling of the need of constant life supplies from
above, let us try how often, how freely, we may be made the channels of
those streams of the "water of life," - for "none can keep alive his own
soul." - Mary B. M. Duncan, in "Bible Hours," 1866.

[Psa 22:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#029)

Having considered the vastness and glory of the prospect, our Lord next
contemplates the reality and minuteness of its accomplishment. He sets
before his mind individual cases and particular facts. He appears to
look upon this picture of the future as we do upon a grand historical
painting of the past. It seems natural to gaze with silent admiration on
the picture as a whole, then to fix the attention on particular groups,
and testify our sense of the general excellence, by expatiating on the
truth and beauty of the several parts. - John Stevenson.

[Psa 22:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#030)

"A seed shall serve him." This figurative expression signifies Christ
and his people, who yield true obedience to God - they are called by
this name in a spiritual and figurative, but most appropriate sense. The
idea is taken from the operations of the husbandman who carefully
reserves every year a portion of his grain for seed. Though it be small,
compared with all the produce of his harvest, yet he prizes it very
highly and estimates it by the value of that crop which it may yield in
the succeeding autumn. Nor does he look only to the quantity, he pays
particular regard to the quality of the seed. He reserves only the best,
nay, he will put away his own if spoiled, that he may procure better.
The very smallest quantity of really good seed, is, to him, an object of
great desire, and if by grievous failure of crops, he should not be able
to procure more than a single grain, yet would he accept it thankfully,
preserve it carefully, and plant it in the most favourable soil. Such is
the source from which the metaphor is taken. - John Stevenson.

[Psa 22:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#031)

"And shall declare his righteousness." The occupation of the seed is to
"declare," to testify from their own experience, from their own
knowledge.... They will declare the righteousness of God the Holy Ghost
in his convictions of sin, in his reproofs of conscience, in his
forsaking of the impenitent, and in his abiding with the believer. And
in a special manner, they will declare the righteousness of God the Son,
during his human life, in his sufferings, and death, as man's surety, by
which he "magnified the law, and made it honourable" ([Isa
42:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#021)), and on account of which they
are able to address him by this name, "The Lord our Righteousness."
([Jer 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#006).) - John Stevenson.

[Psa 22:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#031)

"A people that shall be born." What is this? What people is there that
is not born? According to my apprehensions I think this is said for this
reason - because the people of other kings are formed by laws, by
customs, and by manners; by which, however, you can never move a man to
true righteousness: it is only a fable of righteousness, and a mere
theatrical scene or representation. For even the law of Moses could form
the people of the Jews unto nothing but unto hypocrisy. But the people
of this King are not formed by laws to make up an external appearance,
but they are begotten by water and by the Spirit unto a new creature of
truth. - Martin Luther.

[Psalms 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 22:1</span></span>

1 My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? why art thou so far from
helping me, and from the words of my roaring?

2 O my God, I cry in the daytime, but thou hearest not; and in the night
season, and am not silent.

3 But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel.

4 Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst deliver
them.

5 They cried unto thee, and were delivered: they trusted in thee, and
were not confounded.

6 But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the
people.

7 All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they
shake the head, saying.

8 He trusted on the Lord that he would deliver him: let him deliver him,
seeing he delighted in him.

9 But thou art he that took me out of the womb: thou didst make me hope
when I was upon my mother's breasts.

10 I was cast upon thee from the womb: thou art my God from my mother's
belly.

[Psa 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#001)

"My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? This was the startling cry
of Golgotha: Eloî Eloî lama sabacthani. The Jews mocked, but the angels
adored when Jesus cried this exceeding bitter cry. Nailed to the tree we
behold our great Redeemer in extremities, and what see we? Having ears
to hear let us hear, and having eyes to see let us see! Let us gaze with
holy wonder, and mark the flashes of light amid the awful darkness of
that midday-midnight. First, our Lord's faith beams forth and deserves
our reverent imitation; he keeps his hold upon his God with both hands
and cries twice, "My God, my God!" The spirit of adoption was strong
within the suffering Son of Man, and he felt no doubt about his interest
in his God. Oh that we could imitate this cleaving to an afflicting God!
Nor does the sufferer distrust the power of God to sustain him, for the
title used - "El" - signifies strength, and is the name of the Mighty
God. He knows the Lord to be the all-sufficient support and succour of
his spirit, and therefore appeals to him in the agony of grief, but not
in the misery of doubt. He would fain know why he is left, he raises
that question and repeats it, but neither the power nor the faithfulness
of God does he mistrust. What an enquiry is this before us! "Why hast
thou forsaken me?" We must lay the emphasis on every word of this
saddest of all utterances. "Why?" what is the great cause of such a
strange fact as for God to leave his own Son at such a time and in such
a plight? There was no cause in him, why then was he deserted? "Hast:"
it is done, and the Saviour is feeling its dread effect as he asks the
question; it is surely true, but how mysterious! It was no threatening
of forsaking which made the great Surety cry aloud, he endured that
forsaking in very deed. "Thou:" I can understand why traitorous Judas
and timid Peter should be gone, but thou, my God, my faithful friend,
how canst thou leave me? This is worst of all, yea worse than all put
together. Hell itself has for its fiercest flame the separation of the
soul from God. "Forsaken:" if thou hadst chastened I might bear it, for
they face would shine; but to forsake me utterly, ah! why is this? "Me:"
thine innocent, obedient, suffering Son, why leavest thou me to perish?
A sight of self seen by penitence, and of Jesus on the cross seen by
faith will best expound this question. Jesus is forsaken because our
sins had separated between us and our God.

"Why art thou so far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?"
The Man of Sorrows had prayed until his speech failed him, and he could
only utter moanings and groanings as men do in severe sicknesses, like
the roarings of a wounded animal. To what extremity of grief was our
Master driven! What strong crying and tears were those which made him
too hoarse for speech! What must have been his anguish to find his own
beloved and trusted Father standing afar off, and neither granting help
nor apparently hearing prayer. This was good cause to make him "roar."
Yet there was a reason for all this which those who rest in Jesus as
their Substitute well know.

[Psa 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#002)

"O my God, I cry in the daytime, but thou hearest not." For our prayers
to appear to be unheard is no new trial, Jesus felt it before us, and it
is observable that he still held fast his believing hold on God, and
cried still, "My God." On the other hand his faith did not render him
less importunate, for amid the hurry and horror of that dismal day he
ceased not his cry, even as in Gethsemane he had agonized all through
the gloomy night. Our Lord continued to pray even though no comfortable
answer came, and in this he set us an example of obedience to his own
words, "men ought always to pray, and not to faint." No daylight is too
glaring, and no midnight too dark to pray in; and no delay or apparent
denial, however grievous, should tempt us to forbear from importunate
pleading.

[Psa 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#003)

"But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel."
However ill things may look, there is no ill in thee, O God! We are very
apt to think and speak hardly of God when we are under his afflicting
hand, but not so the obedient Son. He knows too well his Father's
goodness to let outward circumstances libel his character. There is not
unrighteousness with the God of Jacob, he deserves no censures; let him
do what he will, he is to be praised, and to reign enthroned amid the
songs of his chosen people. If prayer be unanswered it is not because
God is unfaithful, but for some other good and weighty reason. If we
cannot perceive any ground for the delay, we must leave the riddle
unsolved, but we must not fly in God's face in order to invent an
answer. While the holiness of God is in the highest degree acknowledged
and adored, the afflicted speaker in this verse seems to marvel how the
holy God could forsake him, and be silent to his cries. The argument is,
thou art holy, oh! why is it that thou dost disregard thy holy One in
his hour of sharpest anguish? We may not question the holiness of God,
but we may argue from it, and use it as a plea in our petitions.

[Psa 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#004)

"Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst deliver
them." This is the rule of life with all the chosen family. Three times
over is it mentioned, they trusted, and trusted, and trusted, and never
left off trusting, for it was their very life; and they fared well too,
for thou didst deliver them. Out of all their straits, difficulties, and
miseries faith brought them by calling their God to the rescue; but in
the case of our Lord it appeared as if faith would bring no assistance
from heaven, he alone of all the trusting ones was to remain without
deliverance. The experience of other saints may be a great consolation
to us when in deep waters if faith can be sure that their deliverance
will be ours; but when we feel ourselves sinking, it is poor comfort to
know that others are swimming. Our Lord here pleads the past dealings of
God with his people as a reason why he should not be left alone; here
again he is an example to us in the skilful use of the weapon of all
prayer. The use of the plural pronoun "our" shows how one with his
people Jesus was even on the cross. We say, "Our Father which art in
heaven," and he calls those "our fathers" through whom we came into the
world, although he was without father as to the flesh.

[Psa 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#005)

"They cried unto thee, and were delivered: they trusted in thee, and
were not confounded." As if he had said, "How is it that I am now left
without, succour in my overwhelming griefs, while all others have been
helped?" We may remind the Lord of his former loving-kindnesses to his
people, and beseech him to be still the same. This is true wrestling;
let us learn the art. Observe, that ancient saints cried and trusted,
and that in trouble we must do the same; and the invariable result was
that they were not ashamed of their hope, for deliverance came in due
time; this same happy portion shall be ours. The prayer of faith can do
the deed when nothing else can. Let us wonder when we see Jesus using
the same pleas as ourselves, and immersed in griefs far deeper than our
own.

[Psa 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#006)

"But I am a worm, and no man." This verse is a miracle in language. How
could the Lord of glory be brought to such abasement as to be not only
lower than the angels, but even lower than men. What a contrast between
"I am" and "I am a worm"! yet such a double nature was found in the
person of our Lord Jesus when bleeding on the tree. He felt himself to
be comparable to a helpless, powerless, down-trodden worm, passive while
crushed, and unnoticed and despised by those who trod upon him. He
selects the weakest of creatures, which is all flesh; and becomes, when
trodden upon, writhing, quivering flesh, utterly devoid of any might
except strength to suffer. This was a true likeness of himself when his
body and soul had become a mass of misery - the very essence of agony -
in the dying pangs of crucifixion. Man by nature is but a worm; but our
Lord puts himself even beneath man, on account of the scorn which was
heaped upon him and the weakness which he felt, and therefore he adds,
"and no man." The privileges and blessings which belonged to the fathers
he could not obtain while deserted by God, and common acts of humanity
were not allowed him, for he was rejected of men; he was outlawed from
the society of earth, and shut out from the smile of heaven. How utterly
did the Saviour empty himself of all glory, and become of no reputation
for our sakes! "A reproach of men" - their common butt and jest; a
byword and a proverb unto them: the sport of the rabble, and the scorn
of the rulers. Oh the caustic power of reproach, to those who endure it
with patience, yet smart under it most painfully! "And despised of the
people." The vox populi was against him. The very people who would once
have crowned him then contemned him, and they who were benefited by his
cures sneered at him in his woes. Sin is worthy of all reproach and
contempt, and for this reason Jesus, the Sinbearer, was given up to be
thus unworthily and shamefully entreated.

[Psa 22:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#007)

"All they that see me laugh me to scorn." Read the evangelistic
narrative of the ridicule endured by the Crucified One, and then
consider, in the light of this expression, how it grieved him. The iron
entered into his soul. Mockery has for its distinctive description
"cruel mockings;" those endured by our Lord were of the most cruel kind.
The scornful ridicule of our Lord was universal; all sorts of men were
unanimous in the derisive laughter, and vied with each other in
insulting him. Priest and people, Jews and Gentiles, soldiers and
civilians, all united in the general scoff, and that at the time when he
was prostrate in weakness and ready to die. Which shall we wonder at the
most, the cruelty of man or the love of the bleeding Saviour? How can we
ever complain of ridicule after this?

"They shoot out the lip, they shake the head." These were gestures of
contempt. Panting, grinning, shaking of the head, thrusting out of the
tongue, and other modes of derision were endured by our patient Lord;
men made faces at him before whom angels vail their faces and adore. The
basest signs of disgrace which disdain could devise were maliciously
cast at him. They punned upon his prayers, they made matter for laughter
of his sufferings, and set him utterly at nought. Herbert sings of our
Lord as saying, -

"Shame tears my soul, my body many a wound;

Sharp nails pierce this, but sharper that confound:

Reproaches which are free, while I am bound.

Was ever grief like mine?"

"Saying, He trusted on the Lord that he would deliver him: let him
deliver him, seeing he delighted in him." Here the taunt is cruelly
aimed at the sufferer's faith in God, which is the tenderest point in a
good man's soul, the very apple of his eye. They must have learned the
diabolical art from Satan himself, for they made rare proficiency in it.
According to [Mat 27:39-44](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#039), there were
five forms of taunt hurled at the Lord Jesus; this special piece of
mockery is probably mentioned in this psalm because it is the most
bitter of the whole; it has a biting, sarcastic irony in it, which gives
it a peculiar venom; it must have stung the Man of Sorrows to the quick.
When we are tormented in the same manner, let us remember him who
endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, and we shall be
comforted. On reading these verses one is ready, with Trapp, to ask, Is
this a prophecy or a history? for the description is so accurate. We
must not lose sight of the truth which was unwittingly uttered by the
Jewish scoffers. They themselves are witnesses that Jesus of Nazareth
trusted in God: why then was he permitted to perish? Jehovah had
aforetime delivered those who rolled their burdens upon him: why was
this man deserted? Oh that they had understood the answer! Note further,
that their ironical jest, "Seeing he delighted in him," was true. The
Lord did delight in his dear Son, and when he was found in fashion as a
man, and became obedient unto death, he still was well pleased in him.
Strange mixture! Jehovah delights in him, and yet bruises him; is well
pleased, and yet slays him.

[Psa 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#009)

"But thou art he that took me out of the womb." Kindly providence
attends with the surgery of tenderness at every human birth; but the Son
of Man, who was marvellously begotten of the Holy Ghost, was in an
especial manner watched over by the Lord when brought forth by Mary. The
destitute state of Joseph and Mary, far away from friends and home, led
them to see the cherishing hand of God in the safe delivery of the
mother, and the happy birth of the child; that Child now fighting the
great battle of his life, uses the mercy of his nativity as an argument
with God. Faith finds weapons everywhere. He who wills to believe shall
never lack reasons for believing. "Thou didst make me hope when I was
upon my mother's breasts." Was our Lord so early a believer? Was he one
of those babes and sucklings out of whose mouths strength is ordained?
So it would seem; and if so, what a plea for help! Early piety gives
peculiar comfort in our after trials, for surely he who loved us when we
were children is too faithful to cast us off in our riper years. Some
give the text the sense of "gave me cause to trust, by keeping me
safely," and assuredly there was a special providence which preserved
our Lord's infant days from the fury of Herod, the dangers of
travelling, and the ills of poverty.

[Psa 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#010)

"I was cast upon thee from the womb." Into the Almighty arms he was
first received, as into those of a loving parent. This is a sweet
thought. God begins his care over us from the earliest hour. We are
dandled upon the knee of mercy, and cherished in the lap of goodness;
our cradle is canopied by divine love, and our first totterings are
guided by his care. "Thou art my God from my mother's belly." The psalm
begins with "My God, my God," and here, not only is the claim repeated,
but its early date is urged. Oh noble perseverance of faith thus to
continue pleading with holy ingenuity of argument! Our birth was out
weakest and most perilous period of existence; if we were then secured
by Omnipotent tenderness surely we have no cause to suspect that divine
goodness will fail us now. He who was our God when we left our mother
will be with us till we return to mother earth, and will keep us from
perishing in the belly of hell.

[Psalms 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 22:11</span></span>

11 Be not far from me; for trouble is near; for there is none to help

12 Many bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of Bashan have beset me
round.

13 They gaped upon me with their mouths, as a ravening and a roaring
lion.

14 I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint, my
heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels.

15 My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to my
jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death.

16 For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have inclosed
me: they pierced my hands and my feet.

17 I may tell all my bones: they look and stare upon me.

18 They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture.

19 But be not thou far from me, O Lord: O my strength, haste thee to
help me.

20 Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog.

21 Save me from the lion's mouth: for thou hast heard me from the horns
of the unicorns.

The crucified Son of David continues to pour out his complaint and
prayer. We need much grace that while reading we may have fellowship
with his sufferings. May the blessed Spirit conduct us into a most clear
and affecting sight of our Redeemer's woes.

[Psa 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#011)

"Be not far from me." This is the petition for which he has been using
such varied and powerful pleas. His great woe was that God had forsaken
him, his great prayer is that he would be near him. A lively sense of
the divine presence is a mighty stay to the heart in times of distress.
"For trouble is near; for there is none to help." There are two "fors,"
as though faith gave a double knock at mercy's gate; that is a powerful
prayer which is full of holy reasons and thoughtful arguments. The
nearness of trouble is a weighty motive for divine help; this moves our
heavenly Father's heart, and brings down his helping hand. It is his
glory to be our very present help in trouble. Our Substitute had trouble
in his inmost heart, for he said, "the waters have come in, even unto my
soul;" well might he cry, "be not far from me." The absence of all other
helpers is another telling plea. In our Lord's case none either could or
would help him, it was needful that he should tread the winepress alone;
yet was it a sore aggravation to find that all his disciples had
forsaken him, and lover and friend were put far from him. There is an
awfulness about absolute friendlessness which is crushing to the human
mind, for man was not made to be alone, and is like a dismembered limb
when he has to endure heart-loneliness.

[Psa 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#012)

"Many bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of Basham have beset me
round." The mighty ones in the crowd are here marked by the tearful eye
of their victim. The priests, elders, scribes, Pharisees, rulers, and
captains bellowed round the cross like wild cattle, fed in the fat and
solitary pastures of Bashan, full of strength and fury; they stamped and
foamed around the innocent One, and longed to gore him to death with
their cruelties. Conceive of the Lord Jesus as a helpless, unarmed,
naked man, cast into the midst of a herd of infuriated wild bulls. They
were brutal as bulls, many, and strong, and the Rejected One was all
alone, and bound naked to the tree. His position throws great force into
the earnest entreaty, "Be not far from me."

[Psa 22:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#013)

"They gaped upon me with their mouths, as a ravening and a roaring
lion." Like hungry cannibals they opened their blasphemous mouths as if
they were about to swallow the man whom they abhorred. They could not
vomit forth their anger fast enough through the ordinary aperture of
their mouths, and therefore set the doors of their lips wide open like
those who gape. Like roaring lions they howled out their fury, and
longed to tear the Saviour in pieces, as wild beasts raven over their
prey. Our Lord's faith must have passed through a most severe conflict
while he found himself abandoned to the tender mercies of the wicked,
but he came off victorious by prayer; the very dangers to which he was
exposed being used to add prevalence to his entreaties.

[Psa 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#014)

Turning from his enemies, our Lord describes his own personal condition
in language which should bring the tears into every loving eye. "I am
poured out like water." He was utterly spent, like water poured upon the
earth; his heart failed him, and had no more firmness in it than running
water, and his whole being was made a sacrifice, like a libation poured
out before the Lord. He had long been a fountain of tears; in Gethsemane
his heart welled over in sweat, and on the cross he gushed forth with
blood; he poured out his strength and spirit, so that he was reduced to
the most feeble and exhausted state. "All my bones are out of joint," as
if distended upon a rack. Is it not most probable that the fastening of
the hands and feet, and the jar occasioned by fixing the cross in the
earth, may have dislocated the bones of the Crucified One? If this is
not intended, we must refer the expression to that extreme weakness
which would occasion relaxation of the muscles and a general sense of
parting asunder throughout the whole system. "My heart is like wax; it
is melted in the midst of my bowels." Excessive debility and intense
pain made his inmost life to feel like wax melted in the heat. The Greek
liturgy uses the expression, "thine unknown sufferings," and well it
may. The fire of Almighty wrath would have consumed our souls for ever
in hell; it was no light work to bear as a substitute the heat of an
anger so justly terrible. Dr. Gill wisely observes, "if the heart of
Christ, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, melted at it, what heart can
endure or hands be strong, when God deals with them in his wrath?"

[Psa 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#015)

"My strength is dried up like a potsherd." Most complete debility is
here portrayed; Jesus likens himself to a broken piece of earthenware,
or an earthen pot, baked in the fire till the last particle of moisture
is driven out of the clay. No doubt a high degree of feverish burning
afflicted the body of our Lord. All his strength was dried up in the
tremendous flames of avenging justice, even as the paschal lamb was
roasted in the fire. "My tongue cleaveth to my jaws;" thirst and fever
fastened his tongue to his jaws. Dryness and a horrible clamminess
tormented his mouth, so that he could scarcely speak. "Thou hast brought
me into the dust of death;" so tormented in every single part as to feel
dissolved into separate atoms, and each atom full of misery; the full
price of our redemption was paid, and no part of the Surety's body or
soul escaped its share of agony. The words may set forth Jesus as having
wrestled with Death until he rolled into the dust with his antagonist.
Behold the humiliation of the Son of God! The Lord of Glory stoops to
the dust of death. Amid the mouldering relics of mortality Jesus
condescends to lodge!

Bishop Mant's version of the two preceding verses is forcible and
accurate: -

"Pour'd forth like water is my frame;

My bones asunder start;

As wax that feels the searching flame,

Within me melts my heart.

My wither'd sinews shrink unstrung

Like potsherd dried and dead:

Cleaves to my jaws my burning tongue

The dust of death my bed."

[Psa 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#016)

We are to understand every item of this sad description as being urged
by the Lord Jesus as a plea for divine help; and this will give us a
high idea of his perseverance in prayer. "For dogs have compassed me."
Here he marks the more ignoble crowd, who, while less strong than their
brutal leaders, were not less ferocious, for there they were howling and
barking like unclean and hungry dogs. Hunters frequently surround their
game with a circle, and gradually encompass them within an
ever-narrowing ring of dogs and men. Such a picture is before us. In the
centre stands, not a panting stag, but a bleeding, fainting man, and
around him are the enraged and unpitying wretches who have hounded him
to his doom. Here we have the "hind of the morning" of whom the psalm so
plaintively sings, hunted by bloodhounds, all thirsting to devour him.
The assembly of the wicked have inclosed me: thus the Jewish people were
unchurched, and that which called itself an assembly of the righteous is
justly for its sins marked upon the forehead as an assembly of the
wicked. This is not the only occasion when professed churches of God
have become synagogues of Satan, and have persecuted the Holy One and
the Just. They pierced my hands and my feet. This can by no means refer
to David, or to any one but Jesus of Nazareth, the once crucified but
now exalted Son of God. Pause, dear reader, and view the wounds of thy
Redeemer.

[Psa 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#017)

So emaciated was Jesus by his fastings and sufferings that he says, "I
may tell all my bones." He could count and re-count them. The posture of
the body on the cross, Bishop Horne thinks, would so distend the flesh
and skin as to make the bones visible, so that they might be numbered.
The zeal of his Father's house had eaten him up; like a good soldier he
had endured hardness. Oh that we cared less for the body's enjoyment and
ease and more for our Father's business! It were better to count the
bones of an emaciated body than to bring leanness into our souls.

"They look and stare upon me." Unholy eyes gazed insultingly upon the
Saviour's nakedness, and shocked the sacred delicacy of his holy soul.
The sight of the agonizing body ought to have ensured sympathy from the
throng, but it only increased their savage mirth, as they gloated their
cruel eyes upon his miseries. Let us blush for human nature and mourn in
sympathy with our Redeemer's shame. The first Adam made us all naked,
and therefore the second Adam became naked that he might clothe our
naked souls.

[Psa 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#018)

"They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture." The
garments of the executed were the perquisites of the executioners in
most cases, but it was not often that they cast lots at the division of
the spoil; this incident shows how clearly David in vision saw the day
of Christ, and how surely the Man of Nazareth is he of whom the prophets
spake: "these things, therefore, the soldiers did." He who gave his
blood to cleanse us gave his garments to clothe us. As Ness says, "this
precious Lamb of God gave up his golden fleece for us." How every
incident of Jesus' griefs is here stored up in the treasury of
inspiration, and embalmed in the amber of sacred song; we must learn
hence to be very mindful of all that concerns our Beloved, and to think
much of everything which has a connection with him. It may be noted that
the habit of gambling is of all others the most hardening, for men could
practise it even at the cross-foot while besprinkled with the blood of
the Crucified. No Christian will endure the rattle of the dice when he
thinks of this.

[Psa 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#019)

"But be not thou far from me, O Lord." Invincible faith returns to the
charge, and uses the same means, viz., importunate prayer. He repeats
the petition so piteously offered before. He wants nothing but his God,
even in his lowest state. He does not ask for the most comfortable or
nearest presence of God, he will be content if he is not far from him;
humble requests speed at the throne. "O my strength, haste thee to help
me." Hard cases need timely aid: when necessity justifies it we may be
urgent with God as to time and cry, "make haste;" but we must not do
this out of wilfulness. Mark how in the last degree of personal weakness
he calls the Lord "my strength;" after this fashion the believer can
sing, "when I am weak, then am I strong."

[Psa 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#020)

"Deliver my soul from the sword." By the sword is probably meant entire
destruction, which as a man he dreaded; or perhaps he sought deliverance
from the enemies around him, who were like a sharp and deadly sword to
him. The Lord had said, "Awake, O sword," and now from the terror of
that sword the Shepherd would fain be delivered as soon as justice
should see fit. "My darling from the power of the dog." Meaning his
soul, his life, which is most dear to every man. The original is, "my
only one," and therefore is our soul dear, because it is our only soul.
Would that all men made their souls their darlings, but many treat them
as if they were not worth so much as the mire of the streets. The dog
may mean Satan that infernal Cerberus, that cursed and cursing cur; or
else the whole company of Christ's foes, who though many in number were
as unanimous as if there were but one, and with one consent sought to
rend him in pieces. If Jesus cried for help against the dog of hell,
much more may we. Cave canem, beware of the dog, for his power is great,
and only God can deliver us from him. When he fawns upon us, we must not
put ourselves in his power; and when he howls at us, we may remember
that God holds him with a chain.

[Psa 22:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#021)

"Save me from the lion's mouth: for thou hast heard me from the horns of
the unicorns." Having experienced deliverance in the past from great
enemies, who were strong as the unicorns, the Redeemer utters his last
cry for rescue from death, which is fierce and mighty as the lion. This
prayer was heard, and the gloom of the cross departed. Thus faith,
though sorely beaten, and even cast beneath the feet of her enemy,
ultimately wins the victory. Is was so in our Head, it shall be so in
all the members. We have overcome the unicorn, we shall conquer the
lion, and from both lion and unicorn we shall take the crown.

[Psalms 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">psa 22:22</span></span>

22 I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the
congregation will I praise thee.

23 Ye that fear the Lord, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify
him; and fear him, all ye the seed of Israel.

24 For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the
afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he cried unto
him, he heard.

25 My praise shall be of thee in the great congregation: I will pay my
vows before them that fear him.

26 The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the Lord that
seek him: your heart shall live for ever.

27 All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the Lord: and
all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee.

28 For the kingdom is the Lord's: and he is the governor among the
nations.

29 All they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship: all they that
go down to the dust shall bow before him: and none can keep alive his
own soul

30 A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a
generation.

31 They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a people
that shall be born, that he hath done this.

The transition is very marked; from a horrible tempest all is changed
into calm. The darkness of Calvary at length passed away from the face
of nature, and from the soul of the Redeemer, and beholding the light of
his triumph and its future results the Saviour smiled. We have followed
him through the gloom, let us attend him in the returning light. It will
be well still to regard the words as a part of our Lord's soliloquy upon
the cross, uttered in his mind during the last few moments before his
death.

[Psa 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#022)

"I will declare thy name unto my brethren." The delights of Jesus are
always with his church, and hence his thoughts, after much distraction,
return at the first moment of relief to their usual channel; he forms
fresh designs for the benefit of his beloved ones. He is not ashamed to
call them brethren, "Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren,
in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee." Among his
first resurrection words were these, "Go to my brethren." In the verse
before us, Jesus anticipates happiness in having communication with his
people; he purposes to be their teacher and minister, and fixes his mind
upon the subject of his discourse. The name, i.e., the character and
conduct of God are by Jesus Christ's gospel proclaimed to all the holy
brotherhood; they behold the fulness of the Godhead dwelling bodily in
him, and rejoice greatly to see all the infinite perfections manifested
in one who is bone of their bone and flesh of their flesh. What a
precious subject is the name of our God! It is the only one worthy of
the only Begotten, whose meat and drink it was to do the Father's will.
We may learn from this resolution of our Lord, that one of the most
excellent methods of showing our thankfulness for deliverances is to
tell to our brethren what the Lord has done for us. We mention our
sorrows readily enough; why are we so slow in declaring our
deliverances? "In the midst of the congregation will I praise thee." Not
in a little household gathering merely does our Lord resolve to proclaim
his Father's love, but in the great assemblies of his saints, and in the
general assembly and church of the first-born. This the Lord Jesus is
always doing by his representatives, who are the heralds of salvation,
and labour to praise God. In the great universal church Jesus is the One
authorative teacher, and all others, so far as they are worthy to be
called teachers, are nothing but echoes of his voice. Jesus, in this
second sentence, reveals his object in declaring the divine name, it is
that God may be praised; the church continually magnifies Jehovah for
manifesting himself in the person of Jesus, and Jesus himself leads the
song, and is both precentor and preacher in his church. Delightful are
the seasons when Jesus communes with our hearts concerning divine truth;
joyful praise is the sure result.

[Psa 22:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#023)

"Ye that fear the Lord praise him." The reader must imagine the Saviour
as addressing the congregation of the saints. He exhorts the faithful to
unite with him in thanksgiving. The description of "fearing the Lord" is
very frequent and very instructive; it is the beginning of wisdom, and
is an essential sign of grace. "I am a Hebrew and I fear God" was
Jonah's confession of faith. Humble awe of God is so necessary a
preparation for praising him that none are fit to sing to his honour,
but such as reverence his word; but this fear is consistent with the
highest joy, and is not to be confounded with legal bondage, which is a
fear which perfect love casteth out. Holy fear should always keep the
key of the singing pew. Where Jesus leads the tune none but holy lips
may dare to sing. "All ye the seed of Jacob glorify him." The genius of
the gospel is praise. Jew and Gentile saved by sovereign grace should be
eager in the blessed work of magnifying the God of our salvation. All
saints should unite in the song; no tongue may be silent, no heart may
be cold. Christ calls us to glorify God, and can we refuse? "And fear
him all ye the seed of Israel." The spiritual Israel all do this, and we
hope the day will come when Israel after the flesh will be brought to
the same mind. The more we praise God the more reverently shall we fear
him, and the deeper our reverence the sweeter our songs. So much does
Jesus value praise that we have it here under his dying hand and seal
that all the saints must glorify the Lord.

[Psa 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#024)

"For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted."
Here is good matter and motive for praise. The experience of our
covenant Head and Representative should encourage all of us to bless the
God of grace. Never was man so afflicted as our Saviour in body and soul
from friends and foes, by heaven and hell, ill life and death; he was
the foremost in the ranks of the afflicted, but all those afflictions
were sent in love, and not because his Father despised and abhorred him.
'Tis true that justice demanded that Christ should bear the burden which
as a substitute he undertook to carry, but Jehovah always loved him, and
in love laid that load upon him with a view to his ultimate glory and to
the accomplishment of the dearest wish of his heart. Under all his woes
our Lord was honourable in the Father's sight, the matchless jewel of
Jehovah's heart. "Neither hath he hid his face from him." That is to
say, the hiding was but temporary, and was soon removed; it was not
final and eternal. "But when he cried unto him, he heard." Jesus was
heard in that he feared. He cried in extremis and de profundis, and was
speedily answered; he therefore bids his people join him in singing a
Gloria in excelsis.

Every child of God should seek refreshment for his faith in this
testimony of the Man of Sorrows. What Jesus here witnesses is as true
today as when it was first written. It shall never be said that any
man's affliction or poverty prevented his being an accepted suppliant at
Jehovah's throne of grace. The meanest applicant is welcome at mercy's
door: -

"None that approach his throne shall find

A God unfaithful or unkind."

[Psa 22:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#025)

"My praise shall be of thee in the great congregation." The one subject
of our Master's song is the Lord alone. The Lord and the Lord only is
the theme which the believer handleth when he gives himself to imitate
Jesus in praise. The word in the original is "from thee," - true praise
is of celestial origin. The rarest harmonies of music are nothing unless
they are sincerely consecrated to God by hearts sanctified by the
Spirit. The clerk says, "Let us sing to the praise and glory of God;"
but the choir often sing to the praise and glory of themselves. Oh when
shall our service of song be a pure offering? Observe in this verse how
Jesus loves the public praises of the saints, and thinks with pleasure
of the great congregation. It would be wicked on our part to despise the
twos and threes; but, on the other hand, let not the little companies
snarl at the greater assemblies as though they were necessarily less
pure and less approved, for Jesus loves the praise of the great
congregation. "I will pay my vows before them that fear him." Jesus
dedicates himself anew to the carrying out of the divine purpose in
fulfillment of his vows made in anguish. Did our Lord when he ascended
to the skies proclaim amid the redeemed in glory the goodness of
Jehovah? And was that the vow here meant? Undoubtedly the publication of
the gospel is the constant fulfilment of covenant engagements made by
our Surety in the councils of eternity. Messiah vowed to build up a
spiritual temple for the Lord, and he will surely keep his word.

[Psa 22:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#026)

"The meek shall eat and be satisfied." Mark how the dying Lover of our
souls solaces himself with the result of his death. The spiritually poor
find a feast in Jesus, they feed upon him to the satisfaction of their
hearts; they were famished until he gave himself for them, but now they
are filled with royal dainties. The thought of the joy of his people
gave comfort to our expiring Lord. Note the characters who partake of
the benefit of his passion; "the meek," the humble, and lowly. Lord make
us so. Note also the certainty that gospel provisions shall not be
wasted, "they shall eat;" and the sure result of such eating, "and be
satisfied." "They shall praise the Lord that seek him." For a while they
may keep a fast, but their thanksgiving days must and shall come. "Your
heart shall live for ever." Your spirits shall not fail through trial,
you shall not die of grief, immortal joys shall be your portion. Thus
Jesus speaks even from the cross to the troubled seeker. If his dying
words are so assuring, what consolation may we not find in the truth
that he ever liveth to make intercession for us! They who eat at Jesus'
table receive the fulfilment of the promise, "Whosoever eateth of this
bread shall live for ever."

[Psa 22:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#027)

In reading this verse one is struck with the Messiah's missionary
spirit. It is evidently his grand consolation that Jehovah will be known
throughout all places of his dominion. "All the ends of the world shall
remember and turn unto the Lord. Out from the inner circle of the
present church the blessing is to spread in growing power until the
remotest parts of the earth shall be ashamed of their idols, mindful of
the true God, penitent for their offences, and unanimously earnest for
reconcilation with Jehovah. Then shall false worship cease, "and all the
kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee, "O thou only living
and true God. This hope which was the reward of Jesus is a stimulus to
those who fight his battles. It is well to mark the order of conversion
as here set forth; they shall "remember" - this is reflection, like the
prodigal who came unto himself; "and turn unto Jehovah" - this is
repentance, like Manasseh who left his idols and "worship" - this is
holy service, as Paul adored the Christ whom once he abhorred.

[Psa 22:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#028)

"For the kingdom is the Lord's." As an obedient Son the dying Redeemer
rejoiced to know that his Father's interests would prosper through his
pains. "The Lord reigneth" was his song as it is ours. He who by his own
power reigns supreme in the domains of creation and providence, has set
up a kingdom of grace, and by the conquering power of the cross that
kingdom will grow until all people shall own its sway and proclaim that
"he is the governor among the nations." Amid the tumults and disasters
of the present the Lord reigneth; but in the halcyon days of peace the
rich fruit of his dominion will be apparent to every eye. Great
Shepherd, let thy glorious kingdom come.

[Psa 22:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#029)

"All they that be fat upon earth," the rich and great are not shut out,
Grace now finds the most of its jewels among the poor, but in the latter
days the mighty of the earth "shall eat," shall taste of redeeming grace
and dying love, and shall "worship" with all their hearts the God who
deals so bountifully with us in Christ Jesus. Those who are spiritually
fat with inward prosperity shall be filled with the marrow of communion,
and shall worship the Lord with peculiar fervour. In the covenant of
grace Jesus has provided good cheer for our high estate, and he has
taken equal care to console us in our humiliation, for the next sentence
is, "all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him." There is
relief and comfort in bowing before God when our case is at its worst;
even amid the dust of death prayer kindles the lamp of hope.

While all who come to God by Jesus Christ are thus blessed, whether they
be rich or poor, none of those who despise him may hope for a blessing.
"None can keep alive his own soul." This is the stern counterpart of the
gospel message of "look and live." There is no salvation out of Christ.
We must hold life, and have life as Christ's gift, or we shall die
eternally. This is very solid evangelical doctrine, and should be
proclaimed in every corner of the earth, that like a great hammer it may
break in pieces all self-confidence.

[Psa 22:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#030)

"A seed shall serve him." Posterity shall perpetuate the worship of the
Most High. The kingdom of truth on earth shall never fail. As one
generation is called to its rest, another will arise in its stead. We
need have no fear for the true apostolic succession; that is safe
enough. "It shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation." He will
reckon the ages by the succession of the saints, and set his accounts
according to the families of the faithful. Generations of sinners come
not into the genealogy of the skies. God's family register is not for
strangers, but for the children only.

[Psa 22:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#031)

"They shall come." Sovereign grace shall bring out from among men the
bloodbought ones. Nothing shall thwart the divine purpose. The chosen
shall come to life, to faith, to pardon, to heaven. In this the dying
Saviour finds a sacred satisfaction. Toiling servant of God, be glad at
the thought that the eternal purpose of God shall suffer neither let nor
hindrance. "And shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall
be born." None of the people who shall be brought to God by the
irresistible attractions of the cross shall be dumb, they shall be able
to tell forth the righteousness of the Lord, so that future generations
shall know the truth. Fathers shall teach their sons, who shall hand it
down to their children; the burden of the story always being "that he
hath done this," or, that "It is finished." Salvation's glorious work is
done, there is peace on earth, and glory in the highest. "It is
finished," these were the expiring words of the Lord Jesus, as they are
the last words of this Psalm. May we by living faith be enabled to see
our salvation finished by the death of Jesus!
