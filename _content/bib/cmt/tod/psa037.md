### [Psalms Chapter 37](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 37:0</span></span>

Title - Of David - There is but this word to denote the authorship;
whether it was a song or a meditation we are not told. It was written by
David in his old age ([Psa 37:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#025)), and
is the more valuable as the record of so varied an experience.

Subject - The great riddle of the prosperity of the wicked and the
affliction of the righteous, which has perplexed so many, is here dealt
with in the light of the future; and fretfulhess and repining are most
impressively forbidden. It is a Psalm in which the Lord hushes most
sweetly the too common repinings of his people, and calms their minds as
to his present dealings with his own chosen flock, and the wolves by
whom they are surrounded. It contains eight great precepts, is twice
illustrated by autobiographical statements, and abounds in remarkable
contrasts.

Division - The Psalm can scarcely be divided into considerable sections.
It resembles a chapter of the book of Proverbs, most of the verses being
complete in themselves. It is an alphabetical Psalm: in somewhat broken
order, the first letters of the verses follow the Hebrew alphabet. This
may have been not only a poetical invention, but a help to memory. The
reader is requested to read the Psalm through without comment before he
turns to our exposition.

Explanatory Notes and Quaint Sayings

Whole Psalm

The righteous are preserved in Christ with a special preservation and in
a peculiar safety. In the thirty-seventh Psalm this point is excellently
and at large handled, both by direct proof, and by answer to all the
usual objections against their safety. That they shall be preserved is
affirmed, [Psa 37:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#003), [Psa
37:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#017), [Psa
37:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#023), [Psa
37:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#025), [Psa
37:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#032). The objections answered are
many.

Objection 1 - Wicked men flourish.

Solution. - A righteous man should never grieve at that, for "they shall
soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb." [Psa
37:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#002).

Object. 2. - Righteous men are in distress.

Sol. - [Psa 37:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#006) - The night of their
adversity will be turned into the light of prosperity; and as surely as
they call believe when it is night that it shall be day, so surely may
they be persuaded when crosses are upon them, that comfort and
deliverance shall come.

Object. 3 - But there are great plots laid against the righteous, and
they are pursued with great malice, and their intended ruin is come
almost to the very issue.

Sol. - [Psa 37:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#012) - The Lord sees
all the plots of wicked men, and laughs at their spiteful and foolish
malice; while they are busy to destroy the righteous, and hope to have a
day against them, "The Lord seeth that their own day is coming upon
them, even a day of destruction, a day of great judgment and eternal
misery;" their bow shall be broken, and the sword that they have drawn
shall enter into their own heart.

Object. 4 - But the just have but small means.

Sol. - [Psa 37:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#016), [Psa
37:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#017) - "A little that a righteous man
hath is better than the riches of many wicked. For the arms of the
wicked shall be broken but the Lord upholdeth the righteous."

Object. 5 - Heavy times are like to befall them.

Sol. - [Psa 37:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#019) - "They shall not be
ashamed in the evil time, and in the days of famine they shall have
enough."

Object. 6 - But the wicked wax fatter and fatter, and they prevail in
vexing the righteous.

Sol. - [Psa 37:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#020) - Indeed the wicked
are fat, but it is but "the fat of lambs," their prosperity shall soon
melt; and as they be like smoke in vexing the godly, so shall they be
like smoke in vanishing away.

Object. 7 - But the righteous do fall.

Sol. - [Psa 37:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#024) - Though he do fall,
yet he falls not finally, nor totally, for he "is not utterly cast
down;" and besides, there is an upholding providence of God in all the
falls of the righteous.

Object. 8 - We see some wicked men that do not so fall into adversity,
but rather are in prosperity to their dying days.

Sol. - [Psa 37:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#028) - Though they do,
yet "their seed shall be cut off."

Object. 9 - But some wicked men are strong yet, and in their seed spread
also.

Sol. - [Psa 37:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#035), [Psa
37:36](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#036) - Note also that these
"spreading bay-trees" many times "soon pass away;" and they and their
houses are sometimes "utterly cut off."

Object. 10 - But upright men are under many and long crosses.

Sol. - [Psa 37:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#037) - Yet, his end is
peace."

Object. 11 - But nobody stands for the godly when they come into
question.

Sol. - [Psa 37:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#039), [Psa
37:40](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#040) - "Their salvation is of the
Lord;" he is their strength, he will help them and deliver them, etc.

But if we would be thus delivered, observe. 1. That we must not
unthankfully fret at God's providence ([Psa
37:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#001)). 2. We must "trust in the Lord
and do good" ([Psa 37:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#003)). 3. We must
"delight ourselves in the Lord," and not place our contentment on
earthly things ([Psa 37:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#004)). 4. We must
"commit our ways to God" ([Psa 37:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#005)).
5. We must get patience and humble affections ([Psa
37:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#007)). 6. We must be of upright
conversation ([Psa 37:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#014)). 7. We must
be merciful ([Psa 37:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#025), [Psa
37:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#026)). 8. We must "speak righteous
thing," and get "the law into our hearts" ([Psa
37:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#030), [Psa
37:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#031)). 9. We must, "keep our way,"
and" wait on God," and not use ill means. - Nicholas Byfield.

Whole Psalm

This Psalm may well be styled, The good man's cordial in bad times a
sovereign plaister for the plague of discontent or, a choice antidote
against the poison of impatience - Nathanael Hardy, in a Funeral Sermon,
1649.

Whole Psalm

This Psalm very much reminds one in its construction of the sententious
and pithy conciseness of the Book of Proverbs. It does not contain any
prayer, nor any direct allusion to David's own circumstances of
persecution or distress. It is rather the utterance of sound practical
wisdom and godliness from the lips of experience and age, such as we
might suppose an elder of the church, or a father of a family, to let
fall as he sat with his household gathered around him, and listening to
his earnest and affectionate admonition. - Barton Bouchier.

Whole Psalm

The present Psalm is one of the alphabetical Psalms, it is called
"Providentiae speculum," by Tertullian; "Potio contra murmur," by
Isidore; "Vestis piorum," by Luther. - Christopher Wordsworth.

[Psa 37:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#001)

"Fret," or, inflame not, burn not thyself with anger or grief. - John
Diodati.

[Psa 37:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#001)

"Neither be thou envious," etc. Queen Elizabeth envied the milkmaid when
she was in prison; but if she had known what a glorious reign she should
have had afterwards for fourty-four years, she would not have envied
her. And as little needeth a godly man, though in misery, to envy a
wicked man in the ruff of all his prosperity and jollity, considering
what he hath in hand, much more what he hath in hope. - John Trapp.

[Psa 37:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#001)

Would it not be accounted folly in a man that is heir to many thousands
per annum that he should envy a stage-player, clothed in the habit of a
king, and yet not heir to one foot of land? who, though he have the
form, respect, and apparel of a king or nobleman, yet he is, at the same
time, a very beggar, and worth nothing? Thus, wicked men, though they
are arrayed gorgeously, and fare deliciously, wanting nothing, and
having more than heart can wish, yet they are but only possessors: the
godly Christian is the heir. What good doth all their prosperity do
them? It does but hasten their ruin, not their reward. The ox that is
the labouring ox is the longer lived than the ox that is put into the
pasture; the very putting of him there doth but hasten his slaughter;
and when God puts the wicked men into fat pastures, into places of
honour and power, it is but to hasten their ruin. Let no man, therefore,
fret himself because of evil doers, nor be envious at the prosperity of
the wicked; for the candle of the wicked shall be put into everlasting
darkness; they shall soon be cut off, and wither as a green herb. -
Ludovic de Carbone, quoted by John Spencer.

[Psa 37:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#002)

"Cut down like the grass," with a scythe, and even at one blow. - Thomas
Wilcocks.

[Psa 37:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#002)

"Wither." O bitter word, which will make the ears of them that hear it
to tingle! O sentence intolerable, which depriveth sinners of all good
things, and bringeth them to all woe! The Lord sometime accursed the fig
tree, and immediately, not only the leaves, but also the body and root
were wholly withered: even so, that fearful curse of the last day shall
be no less effectual; for on whomsoever it falleth it shall so scorch
them, and shall so make them destitute of God's grace, that they shall
never more be able to do, to speak, think, or to hope for any good
thing. - Thomas Tymme.

[Psa 37:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#002)

"Green herb." We cannot gather riper fruit of patience from any tree
than is found upon the low shrubs of man's short life; for if that
fretting canker of envy at the prosperity of the wicked have overrun thy
mind, a malady from which the saints have no shelter to be freed, out of
this apothecary's shop take antidote; either thy time is short to behold
it, or theirs shorter to enjoy it: "they are set in slippery places, and
are suddenly destroyed," [Psa 73:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#018);
"They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave,"
[Job 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#013); "They shall soon be cut
down like the grass, and wither as the green herb." - Edmund Layfield's
Sermon, entitled "The Mappe of Man's Mortality and Vanity," 1630.

[Psa 37:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#002)

Sometimes the wicked, like the green herb, wither in their spring, they
fall in their rise, they perish in the beginnings of their mischievous
designs; but if they do come to a full growth, they grow but to harvest,
the fit season of their cutting off. - Robert Mossom.

[Psa 37:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#003)

Note well the double precept "trust" and "do." This is the true order,
the two must go together, the one produces, the other proves; the
promise is to both. - C. H. S.

[Psa 37:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#003)

"So shall thou dwell in the land," etc. Thou shalt have a settlement, a
quiet settlement, and a maintenance, a comfortable maintenance: "Verily
thou shalt be fed;" some read it, Thou shalt be fed by faith, as the
just are said to live by faith, and it is good living, good feeding upon
the promises. "Verily thou shaft be fed," as Elijah in the famine, with
what is needful for thee. God himself is a shepherd, a feeder to all
those that trust in him, [Psa 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#001). -
Matthew Henry.

[Psa 37:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#003)

"So shalt thou dwell in the land," etc. The land of Canaan was
considered as the sum of earthly, and the type of heavenly felicity: to
be provided for in the Lord's land, and there to dwell under his
protection, near his ordinances, and among his people, was all that the
genuine Israelite could desire. - Thomas Scott (1747-1821) in loc.

[Psa 37:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#003)

"Thou shalt be fed." A manner of speech taken from cattle feeding
securely, under the conduct and keeping of a good shepherd. - Henry
Ainsworth.

[Psa 37:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#003)

"Thou shalt be fed." Fed in plenty. - Thomas Secker(Archbishop), 1768.

[Psa 37:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#003)

Fed in security. - John Parkhurst.

[Psa 37:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#004)

Note thy part and God's part. Do thou "delight," and he will "give." -
C.H.S.

[Psa 37:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#004)

How much grace and love breathes in these words, "Delight thyself also
in the Lord!" Trust in him was recommended before, and now, this being
added also, how plain is it that your ease and rest is the thing
designed! Is it fit to receive so much kindness with neglect? Again, he
delights in you; I speak to such of whom this may be supposed. And it is
indefinitely said, "His delights were with the sons of men," [Pro
8:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#031). Think what he is, and what you
are; and at once, both wonder and yield. And what else have you to
delight in? what thing will you name that shall supply the place of GOD,
or be to you in the stead of him? Moreover, who should delight in him
but you - his friends, his sons, those of his own house? Think what life
and vigour it will infuse into you, and that "the joy of the Lord will
be your strength," [Neh 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#010). How
pleasantly will you hold on your course, and discharge all other duties
of this your present state! You must serve him. Dare you think of
throwing off his yoke? How desirable is it then to take delight in him
whom I must serve; which only makes that service acceptable to him, and
easy to myself! Further, this is a pleasure none can rob you of; a joy
that cannot be taken from you. Other objects of your delight are
vanishing daily. Neither men nor devils can ever hinder you delighting
in God, if your hearts be so inclined. And were you never brought to
take pleasure in any person or thing to which you had a former aversion?
One that had wronged you might yet possibly win you by after kindness.
Give a reason why you should be more difficult towards the blessed God
that never wronged you, and whose way towards you hath constantly
imported so much good will!

And consider that your condition on earth is such as exposes you to many
sufferings and hardships, which, by your not delighting in him, you can
never be sure to avoid (for they are things common to men), but which,
by your delighting in him, you may be easily able to endure. Besides all
this, seriously consider that you must die. You can make no shift to
avoid that. How easily tolerable and pleasant will it be to think, then,
of going to him with whom you have lived in a delightful communion
before! And how dreadful to appear before him to whom your own heart
shall accuse you to have been (against all his importunities and
allurements) a disaffected stranger! - John Howe's "Treatise of Delight
in God."

[Psa 37:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#004)

We have in the former part extended the meaning of the words "Delight
thyself in the Lord," beyond what they seem at first sight literally to
signify; so as not to understand them merely as requiring that very
single act of delight to be immediately and directly terminated on God
himself; but to take them as comprehending all the sum of all holy and
religious converse with God, i.e., as it is delightful or as it is
seasoned (intermingled, and as it were besprinkled) with delight; and
upon the same account, of all our other converse, so far as it is
influenced by religion. And I doubt not, to such as shall attentively
have considered what hath been said, it will be thought very reasonable
to take them in that latitude; whereof the very letter of the text (as
may be alleged for further justification hereof) is most fitly capable.
For the particle which we read in the Lord, hath not that signification
alone, but signifies also with or by, or besides, or before, or in
presence of, as if it had been said, "Come and sit down with God, retire
thyself to him, and solace thyself in the delights which are to be found
in his presence and converse, in walking with him, and transacting thy
course as before him, and in his sight." As a man may be said to delight
himself with a friend that puts himself under his roof, and, besides
personal converse with himself, freely enjoys the pleasure of all the
entertainments, accommodations, and provisions which he is freely
willing to communicate with him, and hath the satisfaction which a sober
person would take in observing the rules and order of a well-governed
house. - John Howe.

"He shall give thee the desires of thine heart." It shall be unto thee
even as thou wilt. It is said of Luther that he could have what he would
of Almighty God. What may not a favourite, who hath the royalty of his
prince's care, obtain of him? - John Trapp.

[Psa 37:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#004)

"The desires of thine heart." All the desires of this spiritual seed are
of the nature of this seed, namely, substantial, and shall meet with
substance. All the desires of natural man, even after God, after Christ,
after righteousness, shall burn and perish with him (for they are not
the truth, nor do they come from the truth, nor can they reach to the
truth;) but all the desires of this spirit shall live with the Spirit of
God, in rest and satisfaction for ever. - John Pennington, 1656.

[Psa 37:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#004)

The desires of God and the desires of the righteous, agree in one; they
are of one mind in their desires. - John Bunyan.

"Commit thy way unto the Lord," etc. When we bear the burden of our own
affairs ourselves, and are chastised with anxiety and want of success,
and with envying the ungodly who prosper better than we do, the best
remedy is first to do our duty, as we are enabled in the use of the
means, then cast the care of the success over on God, as the ploughman
doth when he hath harrowed his land; and let the burden of it rest on
God, and let us not take it off him again, but put our mind to rest,
resolved to take the harvest in good part, as he shall send it. - David
Dickson.

[Psa 37:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#005)

"Commit thy way unto the Lord," is rendered by the Vulgate, Revela viam
Domino, reveal thy way; and by St. Ambrose, understood of revealing our
sins to God. Indeed, since is it impossible to cover, why should we not
discover, our sins? Conceal not that which God knoweth already, and
would have thee to make known. It is a very ill office to be the devil's
secretary. Oh, break thy league with Satan by revealing his secrets, thy
sins, to God. - Nathaniel Hardy.

[Psa 37:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#005)

"Commit thy way unto." Marg and Heb., Roll thy way upon - as one who
lays upon the shoulder of one stronger than himself a burden which he is
not able to bear. - William De Burgh, D.D., in "A Commentary on the Book
of Psalms. Dublin: 1860."

Note the double again, "Commit" and "trust." - C. H. S.

"He shall bring it to pass." When a hard piece of work is put into the
hand of an apprentice for the first assay of his skill, the beholders
are justly afraid of a miscarriage in his young and unexperienced hand;
but when the worker is an old master of craft, none are afraid but his
cunning hand can act again what so oft it hath wrought to the
contentment of all the beholders. Were our God a novice in the great art
of governing the world, and of the church in the bosom thereof; had he
to this day never given any proof of his infinite wisdom, power, and
goodness, in turning about the most terrible accidents to the welfare
and joy of his saints; we might indeed be amazed whenever we feel
ourselves sinking in the dangers wherein the practices of our enemies
oft do plunge us over head and ears; but the Lord having given in times
past so many documents of his uncontroverted skill and most certain will
to bring about all human affairs, as to his own glory, so to the real
good of all that love him, it would be in us an impious and unexcusable
uncharitableness to suspect the end of any work which he hath begun. -
Robert Baglie's Sermon before the House of Commons, 1643.

To God thy way commending,

Trust him whose arm of might,

The heavenly circles bending,

Guides every star aright:

The winds, and clouds, and lightning,

By his sure hand are led;

And he will, dark shades brightening,

Show thee what path to tread.

\* \* \* \* \*

Although to make God falter,

The powers of hell combine,

One jot they cannot alter

Of his all-wise design:

All projects and volition

Of his eternal mind,

Despite all opposition,

Their due fulfilment find.

No more, then, droop and languish,

Thou sorrow-stricken soul;

E'en from the depths of anguish,

Whose billows o'er thee roll,

Thy Father's hand shall draw thee;

In hope and patience stay,

And joy will soon shed o'er thee

An ever brightening ray.

All faithless murmurs leaving,

Bid them a last good night,

No more thy vexed soul grieving,

Because things seem not right:

Wisely his sceptre wielding,

God sits in regal state,

No power to mortals yielding,

Events to regulate.

Trust with a faith untiring

In thine Omniscient King,

And thou shalt see admiring

What he to light will bring.

Of all thy griefs, the reason

Shall at the last appear;

Why now denied a season,

Will shine in letters clear.

\* \* \* \* \*

Then raise thine eyes to heaven,

Thou who canst trust his frown;

Thence shall thy meed be given,

The chaplet and the crown:

Thy God the palm victorious

In thy right hand shall plant.

Whilst thou, in accents glorious,

Melodious hymns shall chant.

\* \* \* \* \*

Paul Gerhard (1613-1676), translated by Frances Elizabeth Cox, in "Hymns
from the German," 1864.

[Psa 37:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#006)

"He shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light," etc. If thou
shouldst be accused as a man of evil designs, let not that trouble thee
neither; for though thy fame may be obscured for a time by calumnies and
slanders, as the sun is by mists and clouds, yet as that scatters them
all at last, so shall thy integrity appear, and shine as bright as the
sun at noonday. - Symon Patrick.

[Psa 37:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#007)

"Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for him." There are two words in
the original, which express the privilege and the duty of resting on
Christ: one implies such a state of acquiescence, as silences and
clamours of conscience, and composes the perturbation of the spirit; the
other signifies the refreshment and repose of a weary pilgrim, when he
arrives at the end of his journey, and is settled for life in a secure,
commodious, plentiful habitation. - James Hervey.

[Psa 37:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#007)

"Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for him." Take the case of one
who, with a load above his strength, has been toiling some steep and
broken path, when suddenly he finds it lifted off and transferred to
another whose strength he knows to be more than equal to the task, and
in whose sympathy he can securely trust. What would his feeling be but
one of perfect rest, and calm reliance, and joyous freedom, as they went
on their way together? And such is the blessedness of rolling our care
upon the Lord - in weakness we are resting on superior strength, in
perplexity and doubt we are resting on superior wisdom, in all times of
trial and hard service we can stay ourselves on the assurance of his
perfect sympathy. The literal meaning of the word "rest," is "be silent"
towards the Lord. With the eye fixed on him let all unbelieving thoughts
be stilled, such thoughts as rise and rankle in the querulous spirit
when it sees only its troubles, and not God in them, when the mists of
earth hide from its sight the eternal stars of heaven. Then like Jacob,
it may say morosely, "All these things are against me;" or, like Elijah,
despondently, "It is enough, now, O Lord, take away my life;" or, like
Jonah, fretfully, "I do well to be angry." In regard to all such dark
and unbelieving suggestions, the heart is to keep silence, to be still
and know that he is God; silent as to murmuring, but not silent as to
prayer, for in that holy meditative stillness the heart turns to commune
with him. What is "resting in God," but the instinctive movement and
upward glance of the spirit to him; the confiding all one's griefs and
fears to him, and feeling strengthened, patient, hopeful in the act of
doing so! It implies a willingness that he should choose for us, a
conviction that the ordering of all that concerns us is safer in his
hands than in our own.

A few practical remarks: - 1. Our "resting patiently" in the Lord
applies only to the trials which he sends, not to the troubles which
even Christians often make for themselves. There is a difference in the
burdens that come in the way of duty, and those that come through our
wandering into other ways. We can roll the one upon the Lord, but with
the other our punishment may be to be left to bear them long, and to be
bruised in bearing them. 2. The duty here enjoined is to be carried
through all our life. We all admit that patient waiting is needed for
the great trials of life, but may not acknowledge so readily that it is
needed as much for little, daily, commonplace vexations. But these are
as much a test of Christian principle as the other. 3. This resting in
God is a criterion of a man's spiritual state. It needs a special
faculty of discernment, a new sense to be opened in the soul, before our
fallen nature can understand or desire it. - James D. Burns, M.A.

"Hold thee still" (so it may be translated). And this is the hardest
precept that is given to man; insomuch that the most difficult precept
of action sinks into nothing when compared with this command to
inaction. - Jerome.

[Psa 37:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#007) (first clause)

The Hebrew word rendered silent is דּום, dom, from which the English
word dumb appears to be derived. The silence here enjoined is opposed to
murmuring or complaining. - James Anderson, in Calvin's Commentary.

Note again the twin duties, "rest" and "wait."

[Psa 37:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#007)

"Bringeth wicked devices to pass." Observe the opposition between this
and God's bringing to pass, in verse five. The ground for grief is that
the ungodly appear to achieve their end, the reason for comfort is that
our end shall be achieved also, and that in the best manner by God
himself. - C. H. S.

[Psa 37:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#008)

"Forsake wrath;" which is anger wrought up to a greater degree; and the
rather to be shunned and avoided, as being very disagreeable to the
character of a good man. "Fret not thyself in any wise to do evil;" evil
may be done by fretting at the prosperity of wicked men, or by imitating
them, doing as they do, in hope of being prosperous as they are. - John
Gill.

[Psa 37:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#009)

"They shall inherit the earth." He means that they shall live in such a
manner as that the blessing of God shall follow them, even to the grave.
- John Calvin.

"Thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be." To wit
because he shall be grubbed up by the roots. - Arthur Jackson.

[Psa 37:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#010)

"His place... shall not be." The very land he occupied as a home, and
the title to which was unimpeachable, is no longer "his place." It has
passed into other hands. Nothing of all he had on earth is his. He is as
poor as the most miserable object that subsisted on alms. - William S.
Plumer.

[Psa 37:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#010)

The peacock, a glorious fowl, when he beholds that comely fan and circle
which he maketh of the beautiful feathers of his tail, he rejoiceth, he
setteth, and beholdeth every part thereof: but when he looketh on his
feet which he perceiveth to be black and foul, he by-and-by, with great
misliking, vaileth his top-gallant, and seemeth to sorrow. In like
manner, a great many know by experience, that when they see themselves
to abound in riches and honours, they glory and are deeply conceited of
themselves; they praise their fortune, and admire themselves; they make
plots, and appoint much for themselves to perform in many years to come.
This year, they say, we will bear this office, and the next year that:
afterward we shall have the rule of such a province; then we will build
a palace in such a city, whereunto we will adjoin such gardens of
pleasure, and such vineyards: and thus they make a very large reckoning
aforehand, who if they did but once behold their feet, if they did but
think upon the shortness of their life, so transitory and unconstant;
how soon would they let fall their proud feathers, forsake their
arrogancy, and change their purpose, their minds, their lives, and their
manners. - Thomas Tymme.

[Psa 37:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#011)

"The meek shall inherit the earth." In the meantime, they, and they
only, possess the present earth, as they go toward the kingdom of
heaven, by being humble, and cheerful, and content with what their good
God has allotted them. They have no turbulent, repining, vexatious
thoughts that they deserve better; nor are vexed when they see others
possessed of more honour, or more riches, than their wise God has
allotted for their share. But they possess what they have with a meek
and contented quietness; such a quietness as makes their very dreams
pleasing, both to God and themselves. - Izaak Walton (1593-1683), in
"The Complete Angler."

[Psa 37:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#011)

"The meek." What is thy Beloved more than any other beloved? It is
spoken to the spouse. So what is meekness more than any other virtues?
We may say, here is synecdoche speciei, one particular taken for the
general, one virtue for all the rest. Or the effect is put for the
cause; because meekness is one of the principal and chiefest parts of
holiness. But if you will give me leave to conjecture, the Holy Ghost
may seem in this promise at once to show the condition of the church,
and to comfort her; and because being laid hard at on every side, she
stands in need of this virtue more than any other, to fit and fashion
the reward to the virtue, to cherish and exalt it in us with the promise
of something beyond our expectation, even the inheritance of the earth.
And indeed what fitter reward can there be of meekness? What more fit
and just than that they who have been made the anvil for injuries to
beat on, who have been viri perpessitii, as Seneca speaks of Socrates,
men of great sufferance, who have suffered not only their goods to be
torn from them by oppression and wrong, but their reputations to be
wounded with the sharp razor of detraction, and have withstood the shock
of all spectantibus similes, with the patience of a looker on, should be
raised and comforted with a promise of that which their meekness gave up
to the spoil; and that by the providence of God which loves to thwart
the practice of the world, they should be made heirs even of those
possessions which the hand of violence hath snatched from them. -
Anthony Farindon, B.D., 1596-1658.

[Psa 37:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#011)

Not the hot stirring spirits who bustle for the world shall have it, but
the meek, who are thrust up and down from corner to corner, and hardly
suffered to remain anywhere quietly in it. This earth, which they seem
most deprived of, they only shall have and enjoy. When the Lord hath
made it worth the having, then none shall have it but they. "They shall
inherit the earth." The earth is the Lord's; these are the children of
the Lord, and they shall inherit his earth. When the Lord taketh it into
his own possession and enjoyment, they shall succeed him in the
possession and enjoyment of it. It is their right, and shall descend
unto them by right, by inheritance. It is the Lord's right, and by the
Lord shall descend to them as their right. They cannot yet have it for
the Lord hath it not yet; but when the Lord hath it, it shall fairly
descend to them. This accursed earth they shall never have, but when it
is taken into the hands of the Lord, and blessed by the Lord, then it
shall be theirs, then it shall be inherited by the children of blessing.
- John Pennington.

"And shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace." Surely when
the glory of the Lord covers the earth, and all the kingdoms of this
world become the kingdoms of the Prince of Peace, and the wicked one is
rooted out, we may well expect peace in rich abundance. - W. Wilson.

[Psa 37:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#012), [Psa
37:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#013)

Note how the gesture of the wicked in gnashing their teeth is returned
to them in the Lord's scornful laughter at their devices. Their
plotting, too, is countermined by that winding up of all plots, which
the Lord knoweth, though they are wilfully ignorant of it. - C. H. S.

[Psa 37:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#013)

"The Lord shall laugh at him," etc. He seems to provide very coldly for
our consolation under sorrow, for he represents God as merely laughing.
But if God values highly our salvation, why does he not set himself to
resist the fury of our enemies, and vigorously oppose them? We know that
this, as has been said in [Psa 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#004), is
a proper trial of our patience when God does not come forth at once,
armed for the discomfiture of the ungodly, but connives for a time, and
withholds his hand. Lest the flesh should still murmur and complain,
demanding why God should only laugh at the wicked, and not rather take
vengeance upon them, the reason is added, that he sees the day of their
destruction at hand. "For he seeth that his day is coming." - John
Calvin.

[Psa 37:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#013)

"For he seeth that his day is coming:" He laughs at such poor worms, who
make themselves so great upon the earth, and act so loftily in their
impotence seeing it must so soon be over with them. - Berleb. Bible,
quoted by E. W. Hengstenberg.

[Psa 37:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#013)

"For he seeth that his day is coming." His dismal day, his death's day,
which will also be his doom's day. - John Trapp.

The tongue is a "sword" and a "bow," which shooteth its arrows, even
bitter words, against the humble and upright, Jesus and his disciples.
But these are not the only weapons that have been drawn against them.

ignorant, though few lay it to heart, and consider them as set forth for
an example. - George Horne.

When the wicked are most near to do a mischief to the Lord's people,
then is a mischief most near unto them. - David Dickson.

[Psa 37:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#016)

"A little that a righteous man hath," etc. To wit, 1. Because the wicked
do often enrich themselves by unjust means, and so have much vexation
and trouble with them, and likewise thereby do treasure up wrath against
the day of wrath; whereas the righteous with a little, well gotten, have
much peace of conscience, with hope of heaven hereafter. 2. Because the
righteous use thefts well, and are the better for them; whereas the
wicked abuse their many ways, and are in many respects the worse for
them. 3. Because the righteous enjoy what they have from hand to mouth
as the gifts of God, and the pledges of his fatherly love and care over
them, and so it is to them as manna from heaven, and hereby they enjoy
much sweet comfort, and are fully satisfied with what they have; whereas
the wicked have none of this joy nor satisfaction by their wealth. 4.
Because God by his blessing doth usually make that the righteous enjoy
to be more effectual for their good than is the abundance of the wicked.
A little coarse fare makes them more healthful and strong than the
wicked are with all their plenty. And, 5. Because the wicked enjoyeth
not his wealth long, as the righteous man doth; and this indeed agrees
best with the following words. - Arthur Jackson.

[Psa 37:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#016)

Strangers to Christ have the use of outward mercies, but cannot be
properly said to have the enjoyment; they seem to be masters of them,
but indeed they are servants to them; possessors as to outward use, but
slaves as to their inward affections; they serve them while they seem to
dispose of them; they do not dominari, but servire - have not the
command of, but are enslaved. Nor is their use truly comfortable; they
may fancy comfort, but their comfort is but a fancy; it flows from
another fountain than can be digged in earth; true, solid comfort is the
portion of those only who have the righteousness of Christ for their
portion. These may look upon every temporal enjoyment as a token of
everlasting love, as a pledge and earnest of eternal glory; and both
these, because they may receive them as the purchase of the blood and
righteousness of Christ; ay, here is the well-spring of comfort, the
fountain of that comfort which is better than life. Oh, what comfort is
it to taste the sweetness of Christ's love in every enjoyment! When we
can say, "Christ loved me, and gave himself for me, that I might enjoy
these blessings," oh, how will this raise the value of every common
mercy! Christ's righteousness which was performed, the highest
expression of his love, purchased this for me! Upon this account is that
of the Psalmist true, "A little that a righteous man hath is better than
the riches of many wicked." He that hath but food and raiment hath in
this respect more than he that hath the Turkish empire, or the gold of
the Indies. He hath more ground of comfort in his little than they in
all. - David Clarkson.

[Psa 37:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#016)

If thine estate were but little, yet it would be perfumed with love and
that lump of sugar in thy cup would make the liquor sweet, be it never
so small. As the waters which flow from the hills of some of the islands
of Molucca taste of the cinnamon and cloves which grow there, so should
thy gift, though it were but water, taste of the goodwill and special
grace of the Giver. Thy "little," with the fear of the Lord, would be
"better than the riches of many wicked men." As a little ring with a
very costly diamond in it is far more worth than many great ones without
it, so thy estate, though it were but a penny, should be joined with the
precious jewel of that love which is better than life, and enjoyed by
special promise, and thereby be infinitely more worth than the thousands
and millions of others bestowed merely from common bounty, and enjoyed
only by a general providence. - George Swinnock.

[Psa 37:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#016)

'Tis as possible for a wicked man to fill his body with air and his
chest with grace, as his mind with wealth. 'Tis with them as with a
ship; it may be overladen with silver and gold, even unto sinking, and
yet have compass and sides to hold ten times more. So here, a covetous
wretch, though he have enough to sink him, yet he shall never have
enough to satisfy him. So that the conclusion which the Psalmist
delivers is most worthy to be observed: "A little that a righteous man
hath is better than the riches of many wicked;" he doth not say of how
many, because let us think of never so many, yea, of all of them, the
righteous man's little is better in very many respects than all their
greatest treasures heaped together. The King of Spain although the
greatest prince in Christendom by far, having his empire so far
extended, that he may truly say, that the sun ever shines upon his
dominions, yet gives this for his motto, Totus non sufficit orbis, The
whole world is not sufficient. God by Solomon tells us that "In the
house of the righteous is much treasure" ([Pro
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#006)), although many times there is
scarce a good bed to lie, or a seat to sit on. The time will certainly
come, when the richest wicked men that ever lived will see clearly that
their account would have been much narrower and consequently their
condition to all eternity less miserable, if they had been so poor as to
have begged their bread from door to door all their lives long. 'Tis
with the blessings of this life as 'tis with perfumed gloves; when they
are richly perfumed their perfume is much more valuable than the leather
of which they are made: so, not so much earthly blessings considered in
themselves, as their being perfumed with the sweet love of God in
Christ, is that which maketh them blessings indeed, truly deserving the
name they bear. Now all the blessings of those who have made Mary's
choice are all thus perfumed; all the barley bread they eat, be it never
so coarse; all the clothes they wear, be they never so mean; with all
their other temporal blessings, they proceed from the same sweet love of
God, wherewith he was moved to bestow Jesus Christ upon them for
salvation. [Rom 8:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#032). - John
Glascock's Sermon, entitled "Mary's Choice," 1659.

[Psa 37:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#016), [Psa

A little blest is better than a great deal curst; a little blest is
better than a world enjoyed; a pound blest is better than a thousand
curst; a black crust blest is better than a feast curst; the gleanings
blest are better than the whole harvest curst; a drop of mercy blest is
better than a sea of mercy curst; Lazarus' crumbs blest was better than
Dives' delicates curst; Jacob's little blest unto him was better than
Esau's great estate that was curst unto him. 'Tis always better to have
scraps with a blessing, than to have manna and quails with a curse; a
thin table with a blessing is always better than a full table with a
snare; a threadbare coat with a blessing is better than a purple robe
curst; a hole, a cave, a den, a barn, a chimney-corner with a blessing,
is better than stately palaces with a curse; a woollen cap blest is
better than a golden crown curst; and it may be that emperor understood
as much, that said of his crown, when he looked on it with tears, "If
you knew the cares that are under this crown you would never stoop to
take it up." And therefore, why should not a Christian be contented with
a little, seeing his little shall be blest unto him? Isaac tills the
ground and sows his seed, and God blesses him with an hundredfold; and
Cain tills the ground and sows his seed, but the earth is cursed to him
and commanded not to yield to him his strength. Oh, therefore never let
a Christian murmur because he hath but little, but rather let him be
still a-blessing of that God that hath blest his little, and doth bless
his little, and that will bless his little to him. - Thomas Brooks.

"For the arms of the wicked shall be broken but he upholdeth (or
underprops) the righteous." By "the arms of the wicked," you are to
understand their strength, their valour, their power, their wit, their
wealth, their abundance, which is all the arms they have to support and
bear up themselves in the world with. Now, these arms shall be broken,
and when they are broken, then, even then will God uphold the righteous,
that is, God will be a continual overflowing fountain of good to his
righteous ones; so that they shall never want, though all the springs of
the wicked are dried up round about them. - Thomas Brooks.

"As the fat of lambs." As the glory of fat sheep, which are at length
slain. - Targum.

[Psa 37:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#020)

"Fat of lambs." As the fat of the sacrifices was consumed on the altar
by the fire (which was a type of God's righteous vengeance upon
sinners), till it vanished into smoke; so the wicked will be the
sacrifices to God's justice, and be destroyed by the fire of his
indignation. - Thomas Scott.

[Psa 37:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#020)

"Into smoke shall they consume." "What hath pride profited us? or what
hath our boasting of riches given us?" Such are the things, they shall
speak who are in hell, and who have sinned. For the hope of the ungodly
is like a dry thistle-down, by the wind carried away, or the thin foam
spread upon the billows or as a smoke floated hither and thither by the
wind, or as the remembrance of a wayfaring man for a day. - Wouter of
Stoelwk, 1541.

"Payeth not again;" i.e., has it not in his power, from his straitened
circumstances, to repay what he has borrowed: comp. [Deu

the bond-slave of his creditors: comp. [Kg2

"The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord." When this Pilot
undertakes to steer their course, their vessel shall never split upon
the rock, run upon the sands, or spring a leak, so as to sink in the
seas. To be sure he will see them safe in their harbour. He was no
Christian, yet I suppose none will deny but he spake good divinity, who
said, "If a man will choose God for his Friend, he shall travel securely
through a wilderness that hath many beasts of prey in it; he shall pass
safely through this world; for he only is safe that hath God for his
guide." (At. Epist 27.) Doth he not speak a little like David himself
([Psa 37:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#023)) who never expected to
come to glory except he were guided by his counsel? Now, if a poor
heathen could say thus, and see good reason to trust God, and admire his
faithfulness as he doth frequently (and so doth Seneca, justifying God's
faithfulness in all his dealings with the best men in all their
sufferings, and the prosperity of the wicked); what then shall the
heavenly Christian say, who hath experienced so much of God's
faithfulness in answering his prayers, in fulfilling his promises, and
supplying all his exigencies? - James Janeway.

[Psa 37:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#023)

"He delighteth in his way." Note that in verse four, we are bidden to
delight in the Lord, and here he delights in us, and as here our way is
his delight, so in [Psa 37:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#034)we are to
"keep his way." These antitheses are instructive. - C. H. S.

[Psa 37:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#023), [Psa
37:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#024)

Strange words to us! the very "steps" all "ordered," and that by an
Almighty One, who "delights" in the goodness of the good man's way. And
yet the inference so distinctly to be drawn is that the good man may
fall, and that his God and Guide may stand by and behold and permit!

Let us add to the suggestion of these verses, one or two references
which may help us to establish the principle in our hearts, that the
child of God may fall and still remain the child of God; and also to
explain somewhat of the reason why this is part of their lot, whether
ordered, or only permitted, at all events, a step of the "right way," by
which God leads them to a city of habitation. [Psa
107:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#007).

It is observed near the close of Hezekiah's good and prosperous life
that, "in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon....
God left him to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart."
[Ch2 32:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#031). And again, in Daniel's
prophecy regarding the latter days, we find ([Dan
11:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#035)), "And some of them of
understanding shall fall, to try them, and to purge, and to make them
white." In the two preceding verses, we have also some valuable details
regarding such falls, such as the help with which God will uphold them,
the flatteries with which the world will still beset, and hinder them
from rising again; the outward troubles into which their fall shall lead
them, as through a furnace; the high position (instructors of many)
which yet shall not save them from their needed ordeal - the time
appointed - and the end in view. So here. The acknowledgment of the
possibility of the good man's fall is accompanied with the precious
assurance that "he shall not be utterly cast down." - Mary B. M. Duncan,
in "Under the Shadow," 1867.

[Psa 37:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#024)

"Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down," etc. Thus the
Spirit comforts and answers the secret thoughts which everyone might
have, saying with himself, I have, however, seen it happen, that the
righteous is oppressed, and his cause is trodden in the dust by the
wicked. Nay, he replies, dear child, let it be so, that he falls; he
still cannot remain lying thus and be cast away; he must be up again,
although all the world doubts of it. For God catches him by the hand,
and raises him again. - Martin Luther.

[Psa 37:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#024)

"Though he fall," namely, as one that were faint-hearted, "he shall not
be cast off," namely, utterly, or for ever from God ([Co2
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#009)); "for the Lord putteth under his
hand," i.e., his power and might, namely, to uphold him from utter
falling away, which we should quickly do if God were not with us. -
Thomas Wilcocks.

[Psa 37:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#024)

A man pardoned, and justified by faith in Christ, though he may, and
sometimes doth, fall into foul sins, yet they never prevail so far as to
reverse pardon, and reduce to a state of non-justification. "Though he
fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the Lord upholdeth him with
his hand!" He speaks of a good man pardoned, justified; he may fall; but
how far? from pardon, from justification? No, then he should utterly
fall, be cast down beneath God's hand; but the text saith, he shall not
be utterly cast down; for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand; or, as
Montanus renders the words, the Lord upholdeth his hands, and he will
not let him sink into such a condition. If it were so, then sin should
have dominion over him, but, [Rom
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#014). "Sin shall not have dominion
over you;" and [Rom 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#002), justified
ones are freed from the law of sin and death; and [Rom
8:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#030), the predestinated, called,
justified, and glorified ones, are so linked together, that there is no
breaking their chain; if they do sin, they have an "Advocate with the
Father, Jesus Christ the righteous, and he is the propitiation for our
sins." [Jo1 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#001), [Jo1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#002). - William Greenhill.

[Psa 37:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#025)

"I have been young, and now am old, yet have I not seen the righteous
forsaken" (he doth not say, In my experience I never saw the righteous
afflicted, but, I never saw him left or forsaken in his affliction),
"and I never saw his seed begging their bread:" he puts in that, because
begging of bread, especially in the commonwealth of Israel, and in the
state of the Jews, was a note of utter dereliction! for though God had
told them that they should have the poor always with them, yet he had
given an express law that there should be no beggar among them;
therefore, saith he, I have not seen the righteous so forsaken, that
they should be forced to live by begging. If any say, that David himself
begged, he asked bread of Abimelech and of Nabal; I answer, it is a good
rule, and it resolves the case; transitory cases, and sudden accidents,
make no beggars: we must not say, David was a beggar, or begged his
bread, because once he was in a strait and asked bread of Abimelech; and
in a second strait sent to Nabal: in such sudden cases, the richest man
in the world may be put to ask a piece of bread. A good man may fall
into such wants, but good men are rarely, if ever or at all, left in
them. - Joseph Caryl.

[Psa 37:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#025)

"Yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging
bread." Perhaps it will be objected that there have been many righteous
men poor: but the place speaketh of a righteous charitable man, for so
the following verse showeth, which saith, "He is ever merciful, and
lendeth; and his seed is blessed." And who hath seen such a one or his
seed to be brought to such poverty as to beg his bread? When our Saviour
Christ had fed four thousand with seven loaves and a few fishes, all
being filled, seven baskets full of fragments were gathered up; and it
is Saint Austin's note upon it, crescit dum impenditur vicius, sic
eleemosyna si indigentibus erogetur, the victuals in expending were
augmented, and so is the alms which is given to the poor. - Michael
Jermin.

[Psa 37:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#025)

"Yet have I not seen," etc. I believe this to be literally true in all
cases. I am now grey-headed myself; I have travelled in different
countries, and have had many opportunities of seeing and conversing with
religious people in all situations in life; and I have not, to my
knowledge, seen one instance to the contrary. I have seen no righteous
man forsaken, nor any children of the righteous begging their bread. God
puts honour upon all that fear him; and thus careful is he of them, and
of their posterity. - Adam Clarke.

[Psa 37:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#025)

"Begging bread." This is not meant of an occasional seeking relief in
want (for so David himself desired bread of Abimelech, [Sa1
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#003), and he and his soldiers desired
some supply of victuals from Nabal, [Sa1
25:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#008)); but of living in a continual
way of begging from door to door, which is denounced as a curse against
the wicked ([Psa 109:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#010)), "Let his
children be continually vagabonds and beg." Nor doth it hence follow,
that neither the righteous man, nor his seed, are ever brought to this
sad degree of misery; but only that it doth so rarely happen, that David
in all his time had never seen it. - Arthur Jackson.

[Psa 37:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#025)

This observation of the Psalmist will be found generally verified. We
find indeed exceptions, as in the case of Eli's family. But this was the
result of his defect of character as a righteous man. And we know that
the promises must fail, if they neglect the means necessary to their
accomplishment (see [Gen 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#019)). But
some think that this verse admits of an explanatory supplement; and
render the last clause thus, "Nor his seed (forsaken, though) begging
bread." - David Davidson, in "The Pocket Commentary, 1836."

[Psa 37:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#025)

These words must be taken as a general observation, not absolutely
verified in every case; yet the strict fact is, I apprehend, that the
immediate descendants of truly pious persons are very seldom, if ever
reduced to such extremities, unless by their own great imprudence, or
their abandoned practices. - William Walford.

[Psa 37:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#025)

Here he recordeth an experiment of his (such as whereof Psalm 119 is
mostly made up), and if other men's experiences agree not altogether
with his, it is no wonder: kings use not to mind beggars. - John Trapp.

[Psa 37:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#025), [Psa
37:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#026)

Many persons are solicitously perplexed how their children shall do when
they are dead; yet they consider not, how God provided for them when
they were children. Is the Lord's arm shortened? Did he take thee from
thy mother's breasts; and when thy parents forsook thee (as the Psalmist
saith), became thy Father? And cannot this experienced mercy to thee,
persuade thee that he will not forsake thine? Is not "Jesus Christ the
same yesterday, and today, and for ever?" "I have been young," saith
David, "and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken,"
that is granted, nay, "nor his seed begging bread."

Many distrustful fathers are so caring for their posterity, that while
they live they starve their bodies, and hazard their souls, to leave
them rich. To such a father it is said justly, Dives es hoeredi, pauper
inopsque tibi. Like an over-kind hen he feeds his chickens, and
famisheth himself. If usury, circumvention, oppression, extortion, can
make them rich, they shall not be poor. Their folly is ridiculous; they
fear lest their children should be miserable, yet take the only course
to make them miserable; for they leave them not so much heirs to their
goods as to their evils They do as certainly inherit their fathers' sins
as their lands: "God layeth up his iniquity for his children: and his
offspring shall want a morsel of bread." [Job
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#019).

On the contrary, the good man "is merciful, and lendeth; and his seed is
blessed." What the worldling thinks shall make his posterity poor, God
saith shall make the good man's rich. The precept gives a promise of
mercy to obedience, not confined to the obedient man's self, but
extended to his seed, and that even to a thousand generations, [Exo
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#006). Trust, then, Christ with thy
children; when thy friends shall fail, usury bear no date, oppression be
condemned to hell, thyself rotten to the dust, the world itself turned
and burned into cinders, still "Jesus Christ is the same, yesterday, and
today, and for ever." - Thomas Adams.

[Psa 37:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#026)

"He is ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed is blessed." He, the
good man, is "merciful" to himself, for mercy, like charity, begins at
home; he is not afraid to eat a good meal because he hath children. And
he is merciful to others too; for he will lend and do good to whom he
can, and then his seed fares the better for it. Mark, that the more he
gives and lends in doing works of mercy, the better it is for his
children; for those children are ever best provided for whose parents
bear this mind - they had rather trust God with their children, than
their children with riches; and have made this their hope, that though
they die, yet God lives. Did but one of those rich and wretched parents
(who pinched and pined himself to make his son a gentleman, forsooth),
rise from the dead, and see that proverb of Solomon fulfilled in
himself, "He begetteth a son, and in his hand is nothing;" I persuade
myself, the rumination of this world afflict him in his soul as much as
any one pain of sense, even in hell itself, O consider this, you that
now live and see it in others; and remember withal, that if your goods
be either ill-gotten, or worse kept, it may be your children's case when
you are departed, and feel it, though you see it not. - Matthew
Griffith.

[Psa 37:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#028)

"For the Lord.... forsaketh not his saints; they are preserved for
ever." How? since they die as others do. Mark the antithesis, and that
will explain it. "They are preserved for ever: but the seed of the
wicked shall be cut off." They are preserved in their posterity:
children are but the parents multiplied, and the parents continued; 'tis
nodosa aeternitas; when the father's life is run out to the last, there
is a knot tied, and the line is still continued by the child. I confess
temporal blessings, such as long life, and the promise of an happy
posterity, are more visible in the eye of that dispensation of the
covenant; but yet God still taketh care for the children of his people,
and many promises run that way that belong to the gospel administration,
and still God's service is the surest way to establish a family, as sin
is the ready way to root it out. And if it doth not always fall out
accordingly, yet for the most part it doth; and we are no competent
judges of God's dispensations in this kind, because we see providence by
pieces, and have not the skill to set them together; but at the day of
judgment, when the whole contexture of God's dealings is laid before us,
we shall clearly understand how the children of his servants continue,
and their seed is established. [Psa
102:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#028). - Thomas Manton.

[Psa 37:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#029)

"The righteous shall inherit the land," or the earth. There is clearly
an emphasis in the repetition of the same promise in the same terms
which ought to have been uniformly rendered throughout [Psa

there is a reference to the new heavens and the new earth of [Isa

"The righteous shall inherit the land," etc. Comp. [Mat

of the future exclusive possession of the earth by the righteous. The
millennial kingdom furnishes a fuller explanation. - T. C. Barth.

[Psa 37:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#031)

"The law of his God is in his heart," etc. The flock of sheep that's
indisposed and unwilling to drive, start out of the way into every
lane's end, one this way and another that; and just so is it with an
unwilling heart; one thought starts this way, and another that, and it's
a piece of skill to drive them through. But a willing heart, a heart
prepared and ready to every good work, it flies quite up an end, and
delights itself in the Lord. - Richard Steele.

The Jews "watched" that Just One daily and hourly; they "sought to slay
him," and did so; but Jehovah left him not in their hands, but
vindicated his innocence by raising him from the dead. - George Horne.

[Psa 37:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#034)

"Wait on the Lord," etc. He that truly trusts in God will stay God's
time, and use God's means, and walk in God's way, though it seem round
about; they will not neglect their souls for haste; they know this would
be to make more haste than good speed. Nor would they step out of the
way, the way that is holy and righteous, though they may escape a loss,
an affliction by it, though they might gain some desirable advantage by
it. True faith goes leaning upon God, and therefore will "keep his way."
He that will not be liberal for the promoting and honouring of the
gospel; he that fears poverty or affliction more than he fears sin; he
that is more careful for the things of the world than for his soul; he
that takes indirect or suspected courses, to get, or increase, or secure
his estate; he that is not jealous or watchful, lest his cares for the
world (when he is much engaged therein) should be immoderate - it is
plain he doth not trust God with his estate; and he that does not trust
God for his estate, whatever he think or pretend, he does not trust God
for his soul, for his salvation; his hopes of heaven and salvation are
but presumption. - David Clarkson.

[Psa 37:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#034)

"Wait on the Lord." Bind him not to a day, wake not the Beloved till he
please. - John Trapp.

[Psa 37:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#034)

"Wait.... keep." While we are waiting let us take heed of wavering. Go
not a step out of God's way, though a lion be in the way; avoid not duty
to meet with safety; keep God's highway, the good old way ([Jer
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#016)), the way which is paved with
holiness. "And an highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be
called the way of holiness." [Isa
35:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#008). Avoid crooked paths, take heed
of turning to the left hand, lest you be set on the left hand. Sin doth
cross our hopes, it barricades up our way; a man may as well expect to
find heaven in hell, as in a sinful way. - Thomas Watson.

[Psa 37:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#035)

"Green bay tree." The lxx translates כּאורח רעגן as if it were כּאזרח
לבגן, "Like the cedar of Lebanon;" but אזרח רעגן according to Delitzsch,
means a noble timber-tree, one that in the course of centuries of growth
has acquired a gigantic trunk, and an umbrageous, dome-like crown.

[Psa 37:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#035)

"Green bay tree." The marginal rendering - "a tree that groweth in his
own soil" - is, no doubt, the true one. The idea generally formed of
this passage by the reader of the English Bible is that the tree
referred to was the bay laurel (Prunus laurocerasus), or cherry laurel
of our gardens. But this plant belongs to an entirely different family.
The bay and the Portugal laurels, whose forms of growth and evergreen
leaves make them highly ornamental in shrubberies belong to a sub-family
(Drupaceae, Lind.) of the rose tribe (Rosace), but the bay tree proper,
which flourisheth luxuriantly in Southern Europe, is the type of the
laurel family (Laurace). Several circumstances make it unlikely that the
true bay tree represents the Hebrew esrāch. There is no evidence that it
was ever so plentiful in Palestine as to be chosen by the Psalmist in an
illustration in a poem for popular use. It is indeed to be met with, but
that chiefly in localities on the borders of the eastern shore of the
Great Sea. The chief objection to the supposition that the bay tree was
referred to by the royal poet is to be found in the Psalm itself. Having
mentioned it in the lines quoted above, he adds, "Yet he passed away,
and, lo, he was not: yea, I sought him, but he could not be found." The
idea here is not one which could be represented and illustrated by an
evergreen plant, slow of growth, and yet reaching in maturity a height
of above thirty feet. The words demand a quick growing tree, in a soil
more than usually favourable to its growth. Thus planted, and shooting
up in calm and sunshine, it would attract every eye; but when the storm
broke over it, when the strong wind swept impetuously through its
branches, it would not stand. Torn up by the root, and its timber
comparatively useless, like Abraham's dead, it would be buried out of
sight. And thus with the wicked. He was sought and could not be found. -
John Duns, D.D., F.R.S.E., in "Biblical Natural Science."

[Psa 37:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#035)

We see no force in the observation of Dr. Duns; in fact, if there were
not other reasons for preferring the translation given in the following
note by Wilson, we should see all the more reason to keep to the bay
tree. It was a tree of permanence and of long-continued verdure, and so
the prosperous wicked seem to be. They look as if their happiness would
be eternal; yet, for all that, those who carefully note the dealings of
providence observe with holy wonder that divine justice cuts short their
glory, and they perish utterly. - C. H. S.

"I have seen the wicked in great power (terrible, fierce, violent), and
spreading himself like a green bay tree" (a tree in its native soil,
vigorous, and luxuriant, that had never been transplanted). A striking
figure of the ungodly man of the world, firmly rooted in earthly things
- his native soil, grown proud and wanton in his prosperity, without
fear or apprehension of any reverse. - William Wilson.

[Psa 37:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#035)

"Like a green bay tree," which produceth all leaves and no fruit. -
Matthew Henry.

[Psa 37:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#035)

"I have seen the wicked," saith David, "in great power, and spreading
himself like a green bay-tree." And why like a green bay-tree? Because
in the winter, when all other trees - as the vine-tree, fig-tree,
apple-tree, &c., which are more profitable trees - are withered and
naked, yet the bay-tree continueth as green in the winter as the summer.
So fareth it with wicked men: when the children of God, in the storms of
persecutions, and afflictions, and miseries, seem withered, and, as it
were, dead, yet the wicked all that time flourish, and do appear green
in the eyes of the world: they wallow in worldly wealth, but it is for
their destruction; they wax fat, but it is for the day of slaughter. It
was the case of Hophni and Phinehas: the Lord gave them enough and
suffered them to go on and prosper in their wickedness; but what was the
reason? Because he would destroy them. - J. Gore's Sermon at St. Paul's,
1633.

\- "Today he puts forth

The tender leaves of hopes, tomorrow blossoms,

And bears his blushing honours thick upon him:

And then he falls, as I do."

The hawk flies high, and is as highly prized, being set upon a perch,
vervelled with the gingling bells of encouragement, and carried on his
master's fist; but being once dead and picked over the perch, is cast
upon the dunghill as good for nothing. The hen scrapes in the dust, not
anything rewarded when she is alive, but being dead, is brought as a
choice dish to her master's table. Thus wicked men are commonly set in
high places, and prosper in this life; and good men lie grovelling with
their mouths in the dust, as the very underlings of the world; but being
once dead, the one is cast into the dungeon of hell, the other advanced
to the kingdom of heaven: the one is into Abraham's bosom, whilst the
other is tormented with the devil and his angels. - Thomas Westfield,
D.D., 1644.

[Psa 37:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#037)

"Mark.... and behold." Herodotus maketh mention of a custom among the
Ethiopians to set the dead bodies of their friends in glazed sepulchres,
that their proportions might be obvious to the passengers. How needless
soever that custom was, 'tis doubtless no more than just that the pious
lineaments of their minds who die in the Lord should be presented to the
living in the mirrour of art. Indeed, commendation after death is the
tribute of a religious life. Good works are jewels not to be locked up
in a cabinet, but to be set forth to public view. If Christ would have
Mary's name remembered in the gospel until the world's end for one box
of ointment poured on his head, we cannot imagine that he would have the
many pious and charitable deeds of his servants to be buried in
oblivion. Consult the Scriptures, and you shall scarce find any godly
man laid in his grave without an epitaph of honour. View the fathers,
and you shall observe it their practice to honour the death of the good
by giving them their deserved praises. - Nathanael Hardy.

[Psa 37:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#037)

"The perfect man," etc. - Divines well distinguish of a double
perfection, it is absoluta or comparata. That is absolutely perfect, to
which nothing (that may be accounted truly good) is wanting; and thus He
only is perfectus who is infactus; God, who made all things, and himself
is not made, only enjoying an all-sufficient perfection, in and of
himself. That is comparatively perfect, in which, notwithstanding some
wants, there is a fulness compared with others. Thus every saint is
perfect in comparison of the wicked among whom he liveth. In this
respect it is said of Noah, "That he was a perfect man in his
generations;" his grace compared with the wickedness of the old world
well deserving the name of perfection; indeed every upright man is
perfect in comparison of them who are openly bad, or but openly good;
stained with wickedness, or but painted with holiness. Thus one saint
may be perfect if compared with another, the strong Christian in respect
of the weak, whom he outstrips in grace and piety: such saints Paul
means when he saith, "We speak wisdom among them that are perfect;" that
is, such as have attained to greater measures of grace than others. It
was said of Benaiah, "He was more honourable than thirty, but he
attained not to the first three;" and though no saint can ever attain to
the perfections of the first three, the blessed Trinity yet many saints
may be honourable amongst thirty perfect in comparison of those among
whom they live.

We must further distinguish of a double perfection, it is extrinseca and
intrinseca. Extrinsical perfection so called, because by imputation, is
that which every believer is partaker of through the perfect
righteousness of Christ, whereby all his imperfections are covered; in
this respect the author to the Hebrews tells us, "That by one offering
he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified;" and S. Paul tells
the Colossians that they were "complete in him." meaning Christ. Indeed
omnia Dei mandata tune facta deputantur, quartrio id quod non fit
ignoscitur: divine commands are then in God's account fulfilled when our
defects for Christ's sake are pardoned; and the evangelical perfection
of a Christian consists not in perfectione virtutumn, sed remissione
vitiorum, in the completion of our graces, but remission of our sins.

Intrinsical perfection, so called because by inhsion, is no less
rationally than usually thus distinguished, there is perfectio partium
et graduum. He is said to be perfect, cui nihil deest eorum quae ad
statum salutis necessaria, who wants no graces that accompany salvation;
or he is perfect, cui nihil deest in gradibus gratiarum et virtutum; who
is not defective in the measures of those graces; both these are
frequently and fitly illustrated by the resemblance of a child, and a
grown man; the one whereof hath all the essential and integral parts of
a man, the other a complete use and measure of those parts. - Nathanael
Hardy.

[Psa 37:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#037)

"The end." All wise men affect the conclusion to be best: to ride two or
three miles of fair way, and to have a hundred deep and foul ones to
pass afterward is uncomfortable; especially when the end is worse than
the way. But let the beginning be troublesome, the progress somewhat
more easy, and the journey's end happy, and there is fair amends. "Mark
the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of that man is
peace." Mark him in the setting out, he hath many oppositions; mark him
in the journey, he is full of tribulations; but mark in the conclusion,
and the end of that man is peace. - Thomas Adams.

[Psa 37:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#037)

"The end of that man is peace." Give me leave to determine what it is to
end or die in peace. To end in peace with Euthymius, is to end in pace
cogitationis, in peace of mind as it is opposed to doubting. To end in
peace with Cyprian, is to end in pace securitatis, in peace of security,
as it is opposed to final falling. To end in peace with Origen, is to
end in pace conscientiee, in peace of conscience as it is opposed to
despairing. To end in peace with old Irenaeus, is to end in pace mortis,
in the peace of death as it is opposed to labouring. Again, to end in
peace, is to end in pace Dei, in the peace of God which passeth all
understanding, i.e., far beyond men's apprehensions. To end in peace, is
to end in pace proximi, in peace with our neighbours, i.e., when no
outcries or exclamations follow us. And lastly, to end in peace, is to
end in pace sui, in peace with ourselves, i.e., when no distractions or
perturbations of mind molest us. - Richard Parre.

[Psa 37:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#037)

The text may be divided into these two parts. Here is, 1. The godly
man's property; and 2. The godly man's privilege. His property is
perfection; his privilege is peace. Here is the saint's character and
the saint's crown: he is characterised by uprightness or sincerity, and
crowned with peace. Here is the Christian's way and his end, his motion,
and his rest. His way is holiness, his end happiness; his motion is
towards perfection and in uprightness; his rest is peace at his
journey's end. - John Whitlock, in a Funeral Sermon entitled, "The
Upright Man and his Happy End," 1658.

[Psa 37:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#037)

Time would fail me to tell how Christians die, nor can anything save the
pen of the recording angel who has stood by their bed of death and borne
them to Abraham's bosom, narrate the unnumbered instances of their
delightful departure from the present world, which verify the truth of
the Bible. "I could never have believed," said a dying saint, "that it
was so delightful a thing to die, or that it was possible to have such
views of the heavenly world as I now enjoy." The memorable Melancthon,
just before he died, chanted in his sleep the words, "I will not any
more eat thereof until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God." He seemed
restless, and on being asked by one near him, "Whether there were
anything more that he desired?" replied, Aliud nihil nisi coelum -
nothing more, unless it be heaven. - Gardiner Spring.

[Psa 37:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#037)

To die well be sure to live well; we must not think to have Lazarus's
death, and Dives's life; like him in Plutarch that would live with
Croesus, as he said, but he would die with Socrates. No, Balaam's wishes
are foolish and fruitless: if you would die well, Christians, you must
have a care to live well: qualis vita, finis ita, if you would die
quietly, you must live strictly; if you would die comfortably, you must
live comfortably; if you would die happily, you must live holily. "Mark
the perfect man, and behold the upright, for the end of that man is
peace." - John Kitchin, M.A., 1660.

[Psa 37:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#038)

"The end of the wicked shall be cut off." The wicked in this world do
easily run up without rub or interruption, many times with acclamations
and applause, all the golden steps of honours and preferments; but upon
the highest stair they find the most slippery standing, and the top of
their earthly felicity is the most immediate and certain descent unto
the greatest downfall. They are royally mounted here upon earth, and
gallop swiftly over the fair and green plains of plenty and pleasures;
but at the end of their race they are overturned horse and man, and
tumbled headlong into the pit of destruction. They fairly glide over the
sea of this world with full sail, with much calmness and serenity, and
richly laden; but in the brightest sunshine, and when they least suspect
it, they suddenly and without recovery, sink into the gulf of darkness
and desolation. - Robert Bolton.

[Psa 37:40](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#040)

"And the Lord shall help them." He shall, he shall, he shall. Oh, the
rhetoric of God! the safety of the saints! the certainty of the
promises! - John Trapp.

Luther closes his Exposition of the Psalm with the words, Oh, shame on
our faithlessness, mistrust, and vile unbelief, that we do not believe
such rich, powerful consolatory, declarations of God, and take up so
readily with little grounds of offence, whenever we but hear the wicked
speeches of the ungodly. Help, O God, that we may once attain to right
faith. Amen.

[Psalms 37:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 37:1</span></span>

1 Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious against
the workers of iniquity.

2 For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the
green herb.

[Psa 37:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#001)

The Psalm opens with the first precept. It is alas! too common for
believers in their hours of adversity to think themselves harshly dealt
with when they see persons utterly destitute of religion and honesty,
rejoicing in abundant prosperity. Much needed is the command, "Fret not
thyself because of evildoers." To fret is to worry, to have the
heart-burn, to fume, to become vexed. Nature is very apt to kindle a
fire of jealousy when it sees law-breakers riding on horses, and
obedient subjects walking in the mire: it is a lesson learned only in
the school of grace, when one comes to view the most paradoxical
providences with the devout complacency of one who is sure that the Lord
is righteous in all his acts. It seems hard to carnal judgments that the
best meat should go to the dogs, while loving children pine for want of
it. "Neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity." The same
advice under another shape. When one is poor, despised, and in deep
trial, our old Adam naturally becomes envious of the rich and great; and
when we are conscious that we have been more righteous than they, the
devil is sure to be at hand with blasphemous reasonings. Stormy weather
may curdle even the cream of humanity. Evil men instead of being envied,
are to be viewed with horror and aversion; yet their loaded tables, and
gilded trappings, are too apt to fascinate our poor haft-opened eyes.
Who envies the fat bullock the ribbons and garlands which decorate him
as he is led to the shambles? Yet the case is a parallel one; for
ungodly rich men are but as beasts fattened for the slaughter.

[Psa 37:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#002)

"For they shall soon be cut down like the grass." The scythe of death is
sharpening. Green grows the grass, but quick comes the scythe. The
destruction of the ungodly will be speedy, sudden, sure, overwhelming,
irretrievable. The grass cannot resist or escape the mower. "And wither
as the green herb." The beauty of the herb dries up at once in the heat
of the sun, and so all the glory of the wicked shall disappear at the
hour of death. Death kills the ungodly man like grass, and wrath withers
him like hay; he dies, and his name rots. How complete an end is made of
the man whose boasts had no end! Is it worth while to waste ourselves in
fretting about the insect of an hour, an ephemera which in the same day
is born and dies? Within believers there is a living and incorruptible
seed which liveth and abideth for ever; why should they envy mere flesh,
and the glory of it, which are but as grass, and the flower thereof?

[Psalms 37:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 37:3</span></span>

3 Trust in the Lord, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the land, and
verily shalt be fed.

"Trust in the Lord." Here is the second precept, and one appropriate to
the occasion. Faith cures fretting. Sight is cross-eyed, and views
things only as they seem, hence her envy; faith has clearer optics to
behold things as they really are, hence her peace. "And do good." True
faith is actively obedient. Doing good is a fine remedy for fretting.
There is a joy in holy activity which drives away the rust of
discontent. "So shalt thou dwell in the land." In "the land" which
floweth with milk and honey; the Canaan of the covenant. Thou shalt not
wander in the wilderness of murmuring, but abide in the promised land of
content and rest. "We which have believed do enter into rest." Very much
of our outward depends upon the inward; where there is heaven in the
heart there will be heaven in the house. "And verily thou shall be fed,"
or shepherded. To integrity and faith necessaries are guaranteed. The
good shepherd will exercise his pastoral care over all believers. In
truth they shall be fed, and fed on truth. The promise of God shall be
their perpetual banquet; they shall neither lack in spirituals nor in
temporals. Some read this as an exhortation, "Feed on truth;" certainly
this is good cheer, and banishes for ever the hungry heart-burnings of
envy.

[Psalms 37:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 37:4</span></span>

4 Delight thyself also in the Lord; and he shall give thee the desires
of thine heart.

There is an ascent in this third precept. He who was first bidden not to
fret, was then commanded actively to trust, and now is told with holy
desire to delight in God. "Delight thyself also in the Lord." Make
Jehovah the joy and rejoicing of thy spirit. Bad men delight in carnal
objects; do not envy them if they are allowed to take their fill in such
vain idols; look thou to thy better delight, and fill thyself to the
full with thy sublimer portion. In a certain sense imitate the wicked;
they delight in their portion - take care to delight in yours, and so
far from envying you will pity them. There is no room for fretting if we
remember that God is ours, but there is every incentive to sacred
enjoyment of the most elevated and ecstatic kind. Every name, attribute,
word, or deed of Jehovah, should be delightful to us, and in meditating
thereon our soul should be as glad as is the epicure who feeds
delicately with a profound relish for his dainties. "And he shall give
thee the desires of thine heart." A pleasant duty is here rewarded with
another pleasure. Men who delight in God desire or ask for nothing but
what will please God.; hence it is safe to give them carte blanche.
Their will is subdued to God's will, and now they may have what they
will. Our innermost desires are here meant, not our casual wishes; there
are many things which nature might desire which grace would never permit
us to ask for; these deep, prayerful, asking desires are those to which
the promise is made.

[Psalms 37:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 37:5</span></span>

5 Commit thy way unto the Lord, trust also in him; and he shall bring it
to pass.

6 And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy
judgment as the noonday.

[Psa 37:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#005)

"Commit thy way unto the Lord." Roll the whole burden of life upon the
Lord. Leave with Jehovah not thy present fretfulness merely, but all thy
cares; in fact, submit the whole tenor of thy way to him. Cast away
anxiety, resign thy will, submit thy judgment, leave all with the God of
all. What a medicine is this for expelling envy! What a high attainment
does this fourth precept indicate! How blessed must he be who lives
every day in obedience to it! "Trust also in him; and he shall bring it
to pass." Our destiny shall be joyfully accomplished if we confidently
entrust all to our Lord. We may serenely sing -

"Thy way, not mine, O Lord,

However dark it be;

O lead me by thine own right hand,

Choose out the path for me.

Smooth let it be or rough,

It will be still the best;

Winding or straight, it matters not,

It leads me to thy rest.

I dare not choose my lot,

I would not if I might;

But choose Thou for me, O my God.

So shall I walk aright.

Take thou my cup, and it

With joy or sorrow fill;

As ever best to thee may seem.

Choose thou my good and ill."

The ploughman sows and harrows, and then leaves the harvest to God. What
can he do else? He cannot cover the heavens with clouds, or command the
rain, or bring forth the sun or create the dew. He does well to leave
the whole matter with God; and so to all of us it is truest wisdom,
having obediently trusted in God, to leave results in his hands, and
expect a blessed issue.

[Psa 37:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#006)

"And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light." In the matter
of personal reputation we may especially be content to be quiet, and
leave our vindication with the Judge of all the earth. The more we fret
in this case, the worse for us. Our strength is to sit still. The Lord
will clear the slandered. If we look to his honour, he will see to ours.
It is wonderful how, when faith learns to endure calumny with composure,
the filth does not defile her, but falls off like snow-balls from a wall
of granite. Even in the worst eases, where a good name is for awhile
darkened, Providence will send a clearing like the dawning light, which
shall increase until the man once censured shall be universally admired.
"And thy judgment as the noonday." No shade of reproach shall remain.
The man shall be in his meridian of splendour. The darkness of his
sorrow and his ill-repute shall both flee away.

[Psalms 37:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 37:7</span></span>

7 Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for him fret not thyself because
of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked
devices to pass.

"Rest in the Lord." This fifth is a most divine precept, and requires
much grace to carry it out. To hush the spirit, to be silent before the
Lord, to wait in holy patience the time for clearing up the difficulties
of Providence - this is what every gracious heart should aim at. "Aaron
held his peace:" "I opened not my mouth, because thou didst it." A
silent tongue in many eases not only shows a wise head, but a holy
heart. "And wait patiently for him." Time is nothing to him; let it be
nothing to thee. God is worth waiting for. "He never is before his time,
he never is too late." In a story we wait for the end to clear up the
plot; we ought not to prejudge the great drama of life, but stay till
the closing scene, and see to what a finish the whole arrives. "Fret not
thyself because of him who prospereth in his wall, because of the man
who bringeth wicked devices to pass." There is no good, but much evil,
in worrying your heart about the present success of graceless plotters
be not enticed into premature judgments - they dishonour God, they weary
yourself. Determine, let the wicked succeed as they may, that you will
treat the matter with indifference, and never allow a question to be
raised as to the righteousness and goodness of the Lord. What if wicked
devices succeed and your own plans are defeated! there is more of the
love of God in your defeats than in the successes of the wicked.

[Psalms 37:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 37:8</span></span>

8 Cease from anger, and forsake wrath fret not thyself in any wise to do
evil.

9 for evil doers shall be cut off but those that wait upon the Lord,
they shall inherit the earth.

10 For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be; yea, thou shalt
diligently consider his place, and it shall not be.

11 But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in
the abundance of peace.

[Psa 37:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#008)

"Cease from anger and forsake wrath." Especially anger against the
arrangements of Providence, and jealousies of the temporary pleasures of
those who are so soon to be banished from all comfort. Anger anywhere is
madness, here it is aggravated insanity. Yet since anger will try to
keep us company, we must resolvedly forsake it. "Fret not thyself in any
wise to do evil." By no reasonings and under no circumstances be led
into such a course. Fretfulness lies upon the verge of great sin. Many
who have indulged a murmuring disposition have at last come to sin, in
order to gain their fancied rights. Beware of carping at others, study
to be yourself found in the right way; and as you would dread outward
sin, tremble at inward repining.

[Psa 37:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#009)

"For evil doers shall be cut off." Their death shall be a penal
judgment; not a gentle removal to a better state, but an execution in
which the axe of justice shall be used. "But those that wait upon the
Lord" - those who in patient faith expect their portion in another life
- "they shall inherit the earth." Even in this life they have the most
of real enjoyment, and in the ages to come theirs shall be the glory and
the triumph. Passion, according to Bunyan's parable, has his good things
first, and they are soon over; Patience has his good things last, and
they last for ever.

[Psa 37:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#010)

"For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be." When bad men
reach to greatness, the judgments of God frequently sweep them away;
their riches melt, their powers decay, their happiness turns to
wretchedness; they themselves cease any longer to be numbered with the
living. The shortness of life makes us see that the glitter of the
wicked great is not true gold. O wherefore, tried believer, dost thou
envy one who in a little while will lie lower than the dust? "Yea, thou
shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be." His house
shall be empty, his chair of office vacant, his estate without an owner;
he shall be utterly blotted out, perhaps cut off by his own debauchery,
or brought to a deathbed of penury by his own extravagance. Gone like a
passing cloud - forgotten as a dream - where are his boastings and
hectorings, and where the pomp which made poor mortals think the sinner
blest?

[Psa 37:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#011)

"But the meek shall inherit the earth." Above all others they shall
enjoy life. Even if they suffer, their consolations shall overtop their
tribulations. By inheriting the land is meant obtaining covenant
privileges and the salvation of God. Such as are truly humble shall take
their lot with the rest of the heirs of grace, to whom all good things
come by a sacred birthright. "And shall delight themselves in the
abundance of peace." Peace they love and peace they shall have. If they
find not abundance of gold, abundance of peace will serve their turn far
better. Others find joy in strife, and thence arises their misery in due
time, but peace leads on to peace, and the more a man loves it the more
shall it come to him. In the halcyon period of the latter days, when
universal peace shall make glad the earth, the full prophetic meaning of
words like these will be made plain.

[Psalms 37:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 37:12</span></span>

12 The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his
teeth.

13 The Lord shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is coming.

14 The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast
down the poor and needy, and to slay such as be of upright conversation.

15 Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be
broken.

Here is the portrait of a proud oppressor armed to the teeth.

[Psa 37:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#012)

"The wicked plotteth against the just." Why can he not let the good man
alone? Because there is enmity between the serpent's seed and the seed
of the woman. Why not attack him fairly? Why plot and scheme? Because it
is according to the serpent's nature to be very subtle. Plain sailing
does not suit those who are on board of "The Apollyon." "And gnasheth
upon him with his teeth." The wicked show by their gestures what they
would do if they could; if they cannot gnaw they will gnash: if they may
not bite they will at least bark. This is precisely what the graceless
world did with "that just One," the Prince of Peace. Yet he took no
vengeance upon them, but like a silent lamb received injuries in
patience.

[Psa 37:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#013)

"The Lord shall laugh at him." The godly man needs not trouble himself,
but leave well-deserved vengeance to be dealt out by the Lord, who will
utterly deride the malice of the good man's enemies. Let the proud
scorner gnash his teeth and foam at the mouth; he has one to deal with
who will look down upon him and his ravings with serene contempt. "For
he seeth that his day is coming." The evil man does not see how close
his destruction is upon his heels; he boasts of crushing others when the
foot of justice is already uplifted to trample him as the mire of the
streets. Sinners, in the hand of an angry God, and yet plotting against
his children! Poor souls, thus to run upon the point of Jehovah's spear.

[Psa 37:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#014)

"The wicked have drawn out the sword." They hold their weapon out of its
sheath, and watch for a time to use it. "And have bent their bow." One
weapon is not enough, they carry another ready for action. They carry so
strong a bow that they have trodden upon it to bend it - they will lose
nothing for want of force or readiness. "To cast down the poor and
needy." These are their game, the objects of their accursed malice.
These cowards attack not their equals, but seek out those excellent ones
who, from the gentleness of their spirits and the poverty of their
estates, are not able to defend themselves. Note how our meek and lowly
Lord was beset by cruel foes, armed with all manner of weapons to slay
him. "And to stay such as be of upright conversation." Nothing short of
the overthrow and death of the just will content the wicked. The sincere
and straightforward are hated by the crafty schemers who delight in
unrighteousness. See, then, the enemies of the godly doubly armed, and
learn how true were our Lord's words, "If ye were of the world, the
world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I
have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you."

[Psa 37:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#015)

"Their sword shall enter into their own heart." Like Haman they shall be
hanged upon the gallows built by themselves for Mordecai. Hundreds of
times has this been the case. Saul, who sought to slay David, fell on
his own sword; and the bow, his favourite weapon, the use of which he
taught the children of Israel, was not able to deliver him on Gilboa.
"And their bows shall be broken." Their inventions of evil shall be
rendered useless. Malice outwits itself. It drinks the poisoned cup
which it mixed for another, and burns itself in the fire which it
kindled for its neighbour. Why need we fret at the prosperity of the
wicked when they are so industriously ruining themselves while they
fancy they are injuring the saints?

The next nine verses mainly describe the character and blessedness of
the godly, and the light is brought out with a few black touches
descriptive of the wicked and their doom.

[Psalms 37:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 37:16</span></span>

16 A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many
wicked.

17 For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the Lord upholdeth
the righteous.

18 The Lord knoweth the days of the upright: and their inheritance shall
be for ever.

19 They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of famine
they shall be satisfied.

20 But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the Lord shall be as
the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume
away.

21 The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous sheweth
mercy, and giveth.

22 For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and they that
be cursed of him shall be cut off.

23 The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord: and he delighteth in
his way.

24 Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the Lord
upholdeth him with his hand.

[Psa 37:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#016)

"A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many
wicked." This is a fine proverb. The little of one good man is
contrasted with the riches of many wicked, and so the expression is
rendered the more forcible. There is more happiness in the godly dinner
of herbs than in the stalled ox of profane rioters. In the original
there is an allusion to the noise of a multitude, as if to hint at the
turmoil and hurly-burly of riotous wealth, and to contrast it with the
quiet of the humbler portion of the godly. We would sooner hunger with
John than feast with Herod; better feed on scant fare with the prophets
in Obadiah's cave than riot with the priests of Baal. A man's happiness
consists not in the heaps of gold which he has in store. Content finds
multum in parvo, while for a wicked heart the whole world is too little.

[Psa 37:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#017)

"For the arms of the wicked shall be broken." Their power to do mischief
shall be effectually taken away, for the arms which they lifted up
against God shall be crushed even to the bone. God often makes
implacable men incapable men. What is a more contemptible sight than
toothless malice, aimless malevolence! "But the Lord upholdeth the
righteous." Their cause and course shall be safe, for they are in good
keeping. The sword of two edges smites the wicked and defends the just.

[Psa 37:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#018)

"The Lord knoweth the days of the upright." His foreknowledge made him
laugh at the proud, but in the case of the upright he sees a brighter
future, and treats them as heirs of salvation. Ever is this our comfort,
that all events are known to our God, and that nothing in our future can
take him at unawares. No arrow can pierce us by accident, no dagger
smite us by stealth; neither in time nor in eternity can any unforeseen
ill occur to us. Futurity shall be but a continual development of the
good things which the Lord has laid up in store for us. "And their
inheritance shall be for ever." Their inheritance fades not away. It is
entailed, so that none can deprive them of it, and preserved, so that
none shall destroy it. Eternity is the peculiar attribute of the
believer's portion: what they have on earth is safe enough, but what
they shall have in heaven is theirs without end.

[Psa 37:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#019)

"They shall not be ashamed in the evil time." Calamities will come, but
deliverances will come also. As the righteous never reckoned upon
immunity from trouble, they will not be disappointed when they are
called to take their share of it, but the rather they will cast
themselves anew upon their God, and prove again his faithfulness and
love. God is not a friend in the sunshine only, he is a friend indeed
and a friend in need. "And in the days of famine they shall be
satisfied." Their barrel of meal and cruse of oil shall last out the day
of distress, and if ravens do not bring them bread and meat, the supply
of their needs shall come in some other way, for their bread shall be
given them. Our Lord stayed himself upon this when he hungered in the
wilderness, and by faith he repelled the tempter; we too may be enabled
not to fret ourselves in any wise to do evil by the same consideration.
If God's providence is our inheritance, we need not worry about the
price of wheat. Mildew, and smut, and bent, are all in the Lord's hands.
Unbelief cannot save a single ear from being blasted, but faith, if it
do not preserve the crop, can do what is better, namely, preserve our
joy in the Lord.

[Psa 37:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#020)

"But the wicked shall perish." Whatever phantom light may mock their
present their future is black with dark, substantial night. Judgment has
been given against them, they are but reserved for execution. Let them
flaunt their scarlet and fine linen, and fare sumptuously every day; the
sword of Damocles is above their heads, and if their wits were a little
more awake, their mirth would turn to misery. "The enemies of the Lord
shall be as the fat of lambs." As the sacrificial fat was all consumed
upon the altar, so shall the ungodly utterly vanish from the place of
their honour and pride. How can it be otherwise? If the stubble dares to
contend with the flame, to what end can it hope to come? "They shall
consume." As dry wood, as heaps of leaves, as burning coals, they shall
soon be gone, and gone altogether, for "into smoke shall they consume
away." Sic transit gloria mundi. A puff is the end of all their puffing.
There fuming ends in smoke. They made themselves fat, and perished in
their own grease. Consumers of the good they tried to be, and consumed
they shall be.

[Psa 37:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#021)

"The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again." Partly because he will
not, but mainly because he cannot. Want follows upon waste, and debt
remains undischarged. Often are the wicked thus impoverished in this
life. Their wanton extravagance brings them down to the usurer's door
and to the bankrupt's suit. "But the righteous sheweth mercy, and
giveth." Mercy has given to him, and therefore he gives in mercy. He is
generous and prosperous. He is not a borrower, but a giver. So far as
the good man can do it, he lends an ear to the requests of need, and
instead of being impoverished by what he imparts, he grows richer, and
is able to do more. He does not give to encourage idleness, but in real
mercy, which supposes real need. The text suggests to us how much better
it generally is to give than to lend. Generally, lending comes to giving
in the end, and it is as well to anticipate the fact, and by a little
liberality forestall the inevitable. If these two sentences describe the
wicked and the righteous, the writer of these lines has reason to know
that in and about the city of London the wicked are very numerous.

[Psa 37:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#022)

"For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth. God's
benediction is true wealth after all. True happiness, such as the
covenant secures to all the chosen of heaven, lies wrapped up in the
divine favour, "And they that be cursed of him shall be cut off." His
frown is death; nay, more, 'tis hell.

[Psa 37:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#023)

"The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord." All his course of
life is graciously ordained, and in lovingkindness all is fixed,
settled, and maintained. No reckless fate, no fickle chance rules us;
our every step is the subject of divine decree. "He delighteth in his
way," as parents are pleased with the tottering footsteps of their
babes. All that concerns a saint is interesting to his heavenly Father.
God loves to view the holy strivings of a soul pressing forward to the
skies. In the trials and the joys of the faithful, Jesus has fellowship
with them, and delights to be their sympathising companion.

[Psa 37:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#024)

"Though he fall." Disasters and reverses may lay him low; he may, like
Job, be stripped of everything; like Joseph, be put in prison; like
Jonah, be cast into the deep. "He shall not be utterly cast down." He
shall not be altogether prostrate. He shall be brought on his knees, but
not on his face; or, if laid prone for a moment he shall be up again ere
long. No saint shall fall finally or fatally. Sorrow may bring us to the
earth, and death may bring us to the grave, but lower we cannot sink,
and out of the lowest of all we shall arise to the highest of all. "For
the Lord upholdeth him with his hand." Condescendingly, with his own
hand, God upholds his saints; he does not leave them to mere delegated
agency, he affords personal assistance. Even in our falls the Lord gives
a measure of sustaining. Where grace does not keep from going down, it
shall save from keeping down. Job had double wealth at last, Joseph
reigned over Egypt, Jonah was safely landed. It is not that the saints
are strong, or wise, or meritorious, that therefore they rise after
every fall, but because God is their helper, and therefore none can
prevail against them.

[Psalms 37:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">psa 37:25</span></span>

25 I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous
forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.

26 He is ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed is blessed.

[Psa 37:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#025)

This was David's observation, "I have been young, and now am old; yet
have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread." It
is not my observation just as it stands, for I have relieved the
children of undoubtedly good men, who have appealed to me as common
mendicants. But this does not cast a doubt upon the observation of
David. He lived under a dispensation more outward, and more of this
world than the present rule of personal faith. Never are the righteous
forsaken; that is a rule without exception. Seldom indeed do their seed
beg bread; and although it does occasionally occur, through dissipation,
idleness, or some such causes on the part of their sons, yet doubtless
it is so rare a thing that there are many alive who never saw it. Go
into the union house and see how few are the children of godly parents;
enter the gaol and see how much rarer still is the case. Poor ministers'
sons often become rich. I am not old, but I have seen the families of
the poor godly become rich, and have seen the Lord reward the
faithfulness of the father in the success of the son, so that I have
often thought that the best way to endow one's seed with wealth is to
become poor for Christ's sake. In the Indian mission of the "Baptist
Missionary Society," this is abundantly illustrated.

[Psa 37:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#026)

"He is ever merciful, and lendeth." The righteous are constantly under
generous impulses; they do not prosper through parsimony, but through
bounty. Like the bounteous giver of all good, of who in they are the
beloved sons, they delight in doing good. How stingy, covetous
professors can hope for salvation is a marvel to those who read such
verses as this in the Bible. "And his seed is blessed." God pays back
with interest in the next generation. Where the children of the
righteous are not godly, there must be some reason for it in parental
neglect, or some other guilty cause. The friend of the father is the
friend of the family. The God of Abraham is the God of Isaac and of
Jacob.

[Psalms 37:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">psa 37:27</span></span>

27 Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore.

28 For the Lord loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they are
preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.

29 The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever.

Here we have the seventh precept, which takes a negative and positive
form, and is the quintessence of the entire Psalm.

[Psa 37:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#027)

"Depart from evil, and do good." We must not envy the doers of evil, but
depart altogether from their spirit and example. As Lot left Sodom
without casting a look behind, so must we leave sin. No truce or parley
is to he held with sin, we must turn away from it without hesitation,
and set ourselves practically to work in the oposite direction. He who
neglects to do good will soon fall into evil. "And dwell for evermore."
Obtain an abiding and quiet inheritance. Short-lived are the gains and
pleasures of evil, but eternal are the rewards of grace.

[Psa 37:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#028)

"For the Lord loveth judgment." The awarding of honour to whom honour is
due is God's delight, especially when the upright man has been traduced
by his fellow men. It must be a divine pleasure to right wrongs, and to
defeat the machinations, of the unjust. The great Arbiter of human
destinies is sure to deal out righteous measure both to rich and poor,
to good and evil, for such judgment is his delight. "And forsaketh not
his saints." This would not be right, and, therefore, shall never be
done. God is as faithful to the objects of his love as he is just
towards all mankind. "They are preserved for ever." By covenant
engagements their security is fixed, and by suretyship fulfilments that
safety is accomplished; come what may, the saints are preserved in
Christ Jesus, and because he lives, they shall live also. A king will
not lose his jewels, nor will Jehovah lose his people. As the manna in
the golden pot, which else had melted, was preserved in the ark of the
covenant beneath the mercy-seat, so shall the faithful be preserved in
the covenant by the power of Jesus their propitiation. "But the seed of
the wicked shall be cut off." Like the house of Jeroboam and Ahab, of
which not a dog was left. Honour and wealth ill-gotten seldom reach the
third generation; the curse grows ripe before many years have passed,
and falls upon the evil house. Among the legacies of wicked men the
surest entail is a judgment on their family.

[Psa 37:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#029)

"The righteous shall inherit the land." As heirs with Jesus Christ, the
Canaan above, which is the antitype of "the land," shall be theirs with
all covenant blessing. "And dwell therein for ever." Tenures differ, but
none can match the holding which believers have of heaven. Paradise is
theirs for ever by inheritance, and they shall live for ever to enjoy
it. Who would not be a saint on such terms? Who would fret concerning
the fleeting treasures of the godless?

[Psalms 37:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">psa 37:30</span></span>

30 The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue talketh of
judgment.

31 The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall slide.

32 The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.

33 The Lord will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is
judged.

[Psa 37:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#030)

"The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom." Where the whole Psalm is
dedicated to a description of the different fates of the just and the
wicked, it was meet to give a test by which they could be known. A man's
tongue is no ill index of his character. The mouth betrays the heart.
Good men, as a rule, speak that which is to edifying, sound speech,
religious conversation, consistent with the divine illumination which
they have received. Righteousness is wisdom in action, hence all good
men are practically wise men, and well may the speech be wise. "His
tongue talketh of judgment." He advocates justice, gives an honest
verdict on things and men, and he foretells that God's judgments will
come upon the wicked, as in the former days. His talk is neither foolish
nor ribald, neither vapid nor profane. Our conversation is of far more
consequence than some men imagine.

[Psa 37:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#031)

"The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall slide." The
best thing in the best place, producing the best results. Well might the
man's talk be so admirable when his heart was so well stored. To love
holiness, to have the motives and desires sanctified, to be in one's
inmost nature obedient to the Lord - this is the surest method of making
the whole run of our life efficient for its great ends, and even for
securing the details of it, our steps from any serious mistake. To keep
the even tenor of one's way, in such times as these, is given only to
those whose hearts are sound towards God, who can, as in the text, call
God their God. Policy slips and trips, it twists and tacks, and after
all is worsted in the long run, but sincerity plods on its plain pathway
and reaches the goal.

[Psa 37:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#032)

"The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him." If it were
not for the laws of the land, we should soon see a massacre of the
righteous. Jesus was watched by his enemies, who were thirsting for his
blood: his disciples must not look for favour where there Master found
hatred and death.

[Psa 37:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#033)

"The Lord will not leave him in his hand." God often appears to deliver
his servants, and when he does not do so in this life as to their
bodies, he gives their souls such joy and peace 'that they triumphantly
rise beyond their tormentor's power. We may be in the enemy's hand for
awhile, as Job was, but we cannot be left there. "Nor condemn him when
he is judged." Time shall reverse the verdict of haste, or else eternity
shall clear away the condemnation of time. In due season just men will
be justified. Temporary injustices are tolerated, in the order of
Providence, for purposes most wise; but the bitter shall not always be
called sweet; not light for ever be traduced as darkness; the right
shall appear in due season; the fictitious and pretentious shall be
unmasked, and the real and true shall be revealed. If we have done
faithfully, we may appeal from the petty sessions of society to the
solemn assize of the great day.

[Psalms 37:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">psa 37:34</span></span>

34 Wait on the Lord, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to
inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it.

35 I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a
green bay tree.

36 Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not: yea, I sought him, but he
could not be found.

37 Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of that man
is peace.

38 But the transgressors shall be destroyed together; the end of the
wicked shall be cut off.

39 But the salvation of the righteous is of the Lord; he is their
strength in the time of trouble.

40 And the Lord shall help them, and deliver them: he shall deliver them
from the wicked, and save them, because they trust in him.

[Psa 37:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#034)

"Wait on the Lord." We have here the eighth precept, and it is a lofty
eminence to attain to. Tarry the Lord's leisure. Wait in obedience as a
servant, in hope as an heir, in expectation as a believer. This little
word "wait" is easy to say, but hard to carry out, yet faith must do it.
"And keep his way." Continue in the narrow path; let no haste for riches
or ease cause unholy action. Let your motto be, "On, on, on," Never
flag, or dream of turning aside. "He that endureth to the end, the same
shall be saved." "And he shall exalt thee to inherit the land." Thou
shalt have all of earthly good which is really good, and of heavenly
good there shall be no stint. Exaltation shall be the lot of the
excellent. "When the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it." A sight how
terrible and how instructive! What a rebuke for fretfulness! what an
incentive to gratitude! My soul, be still, as thou foreseest the end,
the awful end of the Lord's enemies.

[Psa 37:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#035)

A second time David turns to his diary, and this time in poetic imagery
tells us of what he had observed. It were well if we too took notes of
divine providences. "I have seen the wicked in great power." The man was
terrible to others, ruling with much authority, and carrying things with
a high hand, a Caesar in might, a Croesus in wealth. "And spreading
himself like a green bay tree." Adding house to house and field to
field, rising higher and higher in the state. He seemed to be ever
verdant like a laurel, he grew as a tree in its own native soil, from
which it had never been transplanted. No particular tree is here meant,
a spreading beech or a wide expanding oak may serve us to realise the
picture; it is a thing of earth, whose roots are in the clay; its
honours are fading leaves; and though its shadow dwarfs the plants which
are condemned to pine beneath it, yet it is itself a dying thing, as the
feller's axe shall prove. In the noble tree, which claims to be king of
the forest, behold the grandeur of the ungodly today; wait awhile and
wonder at the change, as the timber is carried away, and the very root
torn from the ground.

[Psa 37:36](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#036)

"Yet he passed away." Tree and man both gone, the son of man as surely
as the child of the forest. What clean sweeps death makes! "And lo, he
was not." To the surprise of all men the great man was gone, his estates
sold, his business bankrupt, his house alienated, his name forgotten,
and all in a few months! "Yea, I sought him, but he could not be found."
Moved by curiosity, if we enquire for the ungodly, they have left no
trace; like birds of ill omen none desire to remember them. Some of the
humblest of the godly are immortalised, their names are imperishably
fragrant in the church, while of the ablest of infidels and blasphemers
hardly their names are remembered beyond a few years. Men who were in
everybody's mouths but yesterday are forgotten tomorrow, for only virtue
is immortal.

[Psa 37:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#037)

"Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright." After having watched
with surprise the downfall of the wicked, give your attention to the
sincerely godly man, and observe the blessed contrast. Good men are men
of mark, and are worth our study. Upright men are marvels of grace, and
worth beholding. "For the end of that man is peace." The man of peace
has an end of peace. Peace without end comes in the end to the man of
God. His way may be rough, but it leads home. With believers it may rain
in the morning, thunder at midday, and pour in torrents in the
afternoon, but it must clear up ere the sun goes down. War may last till
our last hour, but them we shall hear the last of it.

[Psa 37:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#038)

"But the transgressors shall be destroyed together." A common ruin
awaits those who joined in common rebellion. "The end of the wicked
shall be cut off." Their time shall be shortened, their happiness shall
be ended, their hopes for ever blasted, their execution hastened on.
Their present is shortened by their sins; they shall not live out half
their days. They have no future worth having, while the righteous count
their future as their true heritage.

[Psa 37:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#039)

"But the salvation of the righteous is of the Lord." Sound doctrine
this. The very marrow of the gospel of free grace. By salvation is meant
deliverance of every kind; not only the salvation which finally lands us
in glory, but all the minor rescues of the way; these are all to be
ascribed unto the Lord, and to him alone. Let him have glory from those
to whom he grants salvation. "He is their strength in the time of
trouble." While trouble overthrows the wicked, it only drives the
righteous to their strong Helper, who rejoices to uphold them.

[Psa 37:40](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#040)

"And the Lord shall help them." In all future time Jehovah will stand up
for his chosen. Our Great Ally will bring up his forces in the heat of
the battle. "He shall deliver them from the wicked." As he rescued
Daniel from the lions, so will he preserve his beloved from their
enemies; they need not therefore fret, nor be discouraged. "And save
them, because they trust in him." Faith shall ensure the safety of the
elect. It is the mark of the sheep by which they shall be separated from
the goats. Not their merit, but their believing, shall distinguish them.
Who would not try the walk of faith? Whoever truly believes in God will
be no longer fretful against the apparent irregularities of this present
life, but will rest assured that what is mysterious is nevertheless
just, and what seems hard, is, beyond a doubt ordered in mercy. So the
Psalm ends with a note which is the death-knell of the unhallowed
disquietude with which the Psalm commenced. Happy they who can thus sing
themselves out of ill frames into gracious conditions.
