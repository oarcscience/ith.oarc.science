### [Psalms Chapter 53](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 53:0</span></span>

Title - To the Chief Musician - If the leader of the choir is privileged
to sing the jubilates of divine grace, he must not disdain to chant the
misereres of human depravity. This is the second time he has had the
same Psalm entrusted to him (see [Psa
14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001)), and he must, therefore, be
the more careful in singing it. Upon Mahalath. Here the tune is chosen
for the musician, probably some mournfully solemn air; or perhaps a
musical instrument is here indicated, and the master of the choir is
requested to make it the prominent instrument in the orchestra; at any
rate, this is a direction not found in the former copy of the Psalm, and
seems to call for greater care. The word "Mahalath" appears to signify,
in some forms of it, "disease," and truly this Psalm is the Song of
Man's Disease - the mortal, hereditary taint of sin. Maschil. This is a
second additional note not found in [Psa
14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001), indicating that double
attention is to be given to this most instructive song. A Psalm of
David. It is not a copy of the[Psa
14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001), emended and revised by a
foreign hand; it is another edition by the same author, emphasised in
certain parts, and re-written for another purpose.

Subject - The evil nature of man is here brought before our view a
second time, in almost the same inspired words. All repetitions are not
vain repetitions. We are slow to learn, and need line upon line. David
after a long life, found men no better than they were in his youth. Holy
Writ never repeats itself needlessly, there is good cause for the second
copy of this Psalm; let us read it with more profound attention than
before. If our age has advanced from fourteen to fifty-three, we shall
find the doctrine of this Psalm more evident than in our youth.

\[The reader is requested to peruse [Psa
14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001), "Treasury of David," Vol. I.\]

Hints to Preachers

\[See the Hints of [Psa 14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001).\]

[Psa 53:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#001) - The fool's inside and
outside.

[Psa 53:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#001) -

I. The folly of atheism. He who says there is no God is a fool.

1\. No reason for the assertion.

2\. All reason against it.

II\. The seat of atheism is the heart; it is a moral unbelief not an
intellectual, the language of the will not of the understanding.

III\. Cause of atheism.

1\. Loving evil.

2\. Hating good.

\- G. R.

[Psa 53:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#002) -

I. God has not left the world to itself.

II\. He takes particular notice of all that is in it.

III\. The only thing he values in it is the knowledge of himself.

\- G.R.

[Psa 53:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#004) - How far knowledge is and
is not a restraint upon ungodliness.

[Psa 53:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#004) - It is a sin not to call
upon God.:

I. What is it to call upon God? Three things required in it.

1\. A drawing near to him.

2\. A speaking to him. [Sa1 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#012), [Sa1
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#013).

3\. A praying to him.

II\. How should we call upon God?

1\. Reverently, considering

\(1\) God's holiness and greatness;

\(2\) Our own sin and weakness. [Gen
18:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#027).

2\. Understandingly. [Co1 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#015).

\(1\) Of what we ask.

\(2\) Of whom we ask it.

3\. Submissively.

4\. Believingly. [Mar 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#024); [Jam
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#006).

5\. Sincerely. [Jam 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#003).

6\. Constantly.

\(1\) So as to be always in a praying frame.

\(2\) So as to take all occasions of pouring forth our souls in prayer
to God.

\(3\) So as to let no day slip without prayer.

III\. How it appears to be a sin not to call upon God.

1\. He hath commanded it. [Isa 55:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#006);
[Ti1 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#008).

2\. Because praying is one of the principal parts of worship we owe to
God.

IV\. Who are guilty of this sin?

1\. All who pray to any one else but God.

2\. All who neglect either public, private, or family prayer.

3\. All who pray, but not aright.

\- William Beveridge (1636-1708), in "Thesaurus Theoligicus."

[Psa 53:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#005) -

I. What persecutors are to themselves - their own tormentors, full even
of groundless fears.

II\. What they are to one another - though in concert here, their bones
are scattered hereafter.

III\. What they are to those whom they persecute - made ashamed before
them.

IV\. What they are to God - a contempt and derision.

\- G. R.

[Psa 53:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#006) -

I. There is salvation for Israel.

II\. That salvation is in Zion.

III\. Their salvation remains there when they are banished from it.

IV\. Their joy becomes greater when they return.

\- G. R.

Explanatory Notes and Quaint Sayings

Whole Psalm

Probably the two Psalms refer to different periods; the [Psa
14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001)to the earlier portion of the
world, or of Jewish history; the [Psa
53:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#001)to a later, perhaps a still
future time. Jehovah, through Christ, is frequently said to turn to the
world to see what its condition is, and always with the same result.
"All flesh had corrupted its way" in the days of Noah, and, "when the
Son of Man cometh" again, it is intimated that he will scarcely "find
faith on the earth." The two Psalms also apply to different persons. The
former refers to the enemies of God, who tremble when his presence is
made known; "they are in great fear," because vengeance is about to be
inflicted on them for their sins. Here the Supreme Being is called
Jehovah. In the [Psa 53:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#001)the
interests of God's people are principally kept in view. The ungodly are
regarded as plotting against the righteous, and it is in this relation
their case is considered. The fear that was just and reasonable, in
the[Psa 14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001), because it concerned
the unrighteous under a sense of impending judgment, is said to be
unfounded in the [Psa 53:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#001), because
God was in the midst of his people, "scattering the bones of their
enemies," and showing himself, not as Jehovah, but as the Elohim of his
redeemed children. The [Psa
14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001)contemplates judgment; the [Psa
53:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#001)deliverance; and thus, though
seemingly alike, a different lesson is conveyed in each.

The Psalm, then, descriptive of the universal and continuous corruption
of man's nature, very properly occupies an introductory place in a
series intended to represent the enemies of Messiah, who oppose his
church during his absence, and who are to attempt to resist his power
when he comes again. Before entering upon an examination of the
character of these opponents, this Psalm teaches that, until changed by
grace, all are gone astray; "there is none righteous, no, not one," and
that for all there is but one remedy, "the Deliverer coming out of Zion,
who shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob." - R. H. Ryland, M.A., in
"The Psalms restored to Messiah," 1853.

Whole Psalm

The state of earth ought to be deeply felt by us. The world lying in
wickedness should occupy much of our thoughts. The enormous guilt, the
inconceivable pollution, the ineffably provoking Atheism of this fallen
province of God's dominion, might be a theme for our ceaseless
meditation and mourning. To impress it the more on us, therefore, the
Psalm repeats what has been already sung in [Psa
14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001). It is the same Psalm, with
only a few words varied; it is "line upon line, precept upon precept;"
the harp's most melancholy, most dismal notes again sounded in our ear.
Not that the Lord would detain us always, or disproportionately long,
amid scenes of sadness; for elsewhere he repeats in like manner that
most triumphant melody, [Psa 60:6-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#006);
[Psa 108:6-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#006); but it is good to
return now and then to the open field on which we all were found, cast
out in loathsome degradation. - Andrew A. Bonar, in "Christ and his
Church in the Book of Psalms," 1859.

Whole Psalm

A second edition of the [Psa 14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001),
with variations more or less important, in each verse. That either of
these compositions is an incorrect copy of the other is highly
improbable, because two such copies of the same Psalm would not have
been retained in the collection, and because the variations are too
uniform, consistent, and significant, to be the work of chance or mere
traditional corruption. That the changes were deliberately made by a
later writer is improbable, because such a liberty would hardly have
been taken with a Psalm of David, and because the later form, in that
case, would either have been excluded from the Psalter or substituted
for the first form, or immediately connected with it.

The only satisfactory hypothesis is, that the original author afterwards
re-wrote it, with such modifications as were necessary to bring out
certain points distinctly, but without any intention to supersede the
use of the original composition, which therefore still retains its place
in the collection. This supposition is confirmed by the titles, which
ascribe both Psalms to David.... As a general fact, it may be stated,
that the variations in the Psalm before us are such as render the
expression stronger, bolder, and in one or two cases more obscure and
difficult. - J. A. Alexander 1850.

Whole Psalm

This Psalm is a variation of [Psa
14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001). In each of these two Psalms
the name of God occurs seven times. In [Psa
14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001) it is three times Elohim, and
four times Jehovah; in the present Psalm it is seven times Elohim. -
Christopher Wordsworth, 1868.

Whole Psalm

God, in this Psalm, "speaketh twice," for this is the same almost
verbatim with the [Psa 14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001). The
scope of it is to convince us of our sins, to set us a-blushing, and to
set us a-trembling because of them; there is need of "line upon line" to
this purpose. God, by the Psalmist, here shows -

I. The fact of sin. God is a witness to it. He looks down from heaven
and sees all the sinfulness of men's hearts and lives. All this is open
and naked before him.

II\. The fault of sin. It is iniquity ([Psa
53:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#001), [Psa
53:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#004)); it is an unrighteous thing; it
is that in which there is no good ([Psa
53:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#001), [Psa
53:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#003)); it is going back from God ([Psa
53:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#003)).

III\. The fountain of sin. How comes it that men are so bad? Surely, it
is because there is no fear of God before their eyes; they say in their
hearts, there is no God at all to call us to account, none that we need
to stand in awe of. Men's bad practices flow from their bad principles.

IV\. The folly of sin. He is a fool (in the account of God, whose
judgment we are sure is right) who harbours such corrupt thoughts. The
"workers of iniquity," whatever they pretend to, "have no knowledge;"
they may truly be said to know nothing that do not know God. [Psa
53:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#004).

V. The filthiness of sin. Sinners are "corrupt" ([Psa
53:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#001)); their nature is vitiated and
spoiled; their iniquity is "abominable;" it is odious to the holy God,
and renders them so; whereas, otherwise he "hates nothing that he has
made." What neatness soever proud sinners pretend to, it is certain that
wickedness is the greatest nastiness in the world.

VI\. The fruit of sin. See to what a degree of barbarity it brings men
at last! See their cruelty to their brethren! They "eat them up as they
eat bread." As if they had not only become beasts, but beasts of prey.
See their contempt of God at the same time - they have not called upon
him, but scorn to be beholden to him.

VII\. The fear and shame that attends sin ([Psa
53:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#005)). "There were they in great fear"
who had made God their enemy; their own guilty consciences frightened
them and filled them with horror. This enables the virgin, the daughter
of Zion, to put them to shame and expose them, "because God hath
despised them."

VIII\. The faith of the saints, and their hope and power touching this
great evil ([Psa 53:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#006)). There will
come a Saviour, a great salvation, a salvation from sin. O that it might
be hastened! for it will bring in glorious and joyful times. There were
those in the Old Testament times that looked and hoped, that prayed and
waited for this redemption. Such salvations were often wrought, and all
typical of the everlasting triumphs of the glorious church. - Condensed
from Matthew Henry, 1662-1714.

[Psa 53:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#001)

"The fool hath said is his heart," etc. It is in his heart he says this;
this is the secret desire of every unconverted bosom. If the breast of
God were within reach of men, it would be stabbed a million of times in
one moment. When God was manifest in the flesh, he was altogether
lovely; he did no sin; he went about continually doing good: and yet
they took him and hung him on a tree; they mocked him and spat upon him.
And this is the way men would do with God again. Learn - 1st. The
fearful depravity of your heart. I venture to say there is not an
unconverted man present, who has the most distant idea of the monstrous
wickedness that is now within his breast. Stop till you are in hell, and
it will break out unrestrained. But still let me tell you what it is -
you have a heart that would kill God if you could. If the bosom of God
were now within your reach, and one blow would rid the universe of God,
you have a heart fit to do the deed. 2nd. The amazing love of Christ -
"While we were enemies, Christ died for us." - Robert Murray M' Cheyne,
1813-1843.

[Psa 53:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#001)

"There is no God." אין is properly a noun, and means nonentity, or
non-existence: "nothing of God," or "no such thing as God." It cannot be
explained as a wish - "No God!" i.e., O that there were no God! -
because אין in usage always includes the substantive verb, and denies
the existence, or at least the presence of the person or thing to which
it is prefixed. This is also clear from the use of the same word in the
last clause, where its sense is unambiguous. - J. A. Alexander on [Psa
14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001).

[Psa 53:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#001)

"There is no God." Thus denying the agency of Providence, for the word
Elohim, here translated God, means judge (compare [Exo
22:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#028)), and has reference not to the
essence, but to the providence of the Deity. - Daniel Cresswell,
1776-1844.

[Psa 53:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#001)

It is to be noted that Scripture saith, "The fool hath said in his
heart," and not "thought in his heart;" that is to say, he doth not so
fully think it in judgment, as he hath a good will to be of that belief
for seeing that it makes not for him that there should be a God, he doth
seek by all means accordingly to persuade and resolve himself, and
studies to affirm, prove, and verify it to himself as some theme or
position, all which labour, notwithstanding that sparkle of our creation
light, whereby men acknowledge a Deity, burneth still within; and in
vain doth he strive utterly to alienate it or put it out, so that it is
out of the corruption of his heart and will, and not out of the natural
apprehension of his brain and conceit, that he doth set down his
opinion, as the comical poet saith, "Then came my mind to be of my
opinion," as if himself and his mind had been two diverse things;
therefore, the atheist hath rather said, and held it in his heart, than
thought or believed in his heart that there is no God. - Francis Bacon
(1560-1626), in "Thoughts on Holy Scripture."

[Psa 53:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#002)

"That did seek God." Although all things are full of God, yet is he to
be sought for of godly men, by reason of the darkness which compasseth
our minds through original sin. For both the flesh, and the senses, and
earthly affections do hinder us from knowing of him, yea, though he be
present - Peter Martyr, 1500-1562.

[Psa 53:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#002), [Psa
53:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#003)

Their sin is described in gradation. They do not understand, because a
true knowledge of things divine forms the basis of proper conduct
towards God; they do not ask for God, because they only care for him
whose clear and sure insight apprehends him as their highest possession;
they are gone aside, because he who cares not for him is sure to get
estranged from him, and to deviate from his paths; and they are
altogether become filthy (i.e., worthless), because man's proper
strength and fitness for virtue must well from the fountain of communion
with God. - Augustus F. Tholuck, 1856.

[Psa 53:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#003)

"They are altogether become filthy." גאלחוּ neelachu. They are become
sour and rancid; a metaphor taken from milk that has fermented and
turned sour, rancid and worthless. - Adam Clarke, 1760-1832.

[Psa 53:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#003) (second clause)

The word גאלחוּ, rendered "they are become filthy," might be read, they
have become rotten or putrid. - John Morison, 1829.

[Psa 53:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#003) (last clause)

Evil men are not only guilty of sins of commission, having done
abominable iniquity, but they are guilty of many sins of omission. In
fact, they have never done one holy act. They may be moral, decent,
amiable, they may belong to the church; but "there is none that doeth
good, no not one." - William S Plumer, 1867.

[Psa 53:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#004)

"Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge?" Conscience is a means to
curb and restrain, control and rebuke corrupt nature, and the swelling
forms of it. It is not there as a native inhabitant, but as a garrison
planted in a rebellious town by the great Governor of the world, to keep
the rebellion of the inhabitants within compass, who else would break
forth into present confusion. David, speaking of the corruption of man
by nature after this question, Whether there be not some knowledge to
discover their evil doings to them? yes, says he, "Have they no
knowledge, who eat up my people as bread?" Yes; and therefore ([Psa
53:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#005)) "They are often in fear, "God
having placed this there to overcome them with fear; and by that to
restrain them from many outrages against God's people, whom in their
desires, and sometimes practice, they eat up as bread. Therefore this
knowledge is put in as a bridle to corrupt nature, as a hook was put
into Sennacherib's nostrils ([Isa
37:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#029)) to rule and tame men, and
overcome them with fear. If they had no knowledge they would eat up one
another, and the church, as bread; but there is their fear, says he.,
that is, thence it comes to pass they are kept in awe. - Thomas Goodwin,
1600-1679.

[Psa 53:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#004)

"Who eat up my people as they eat bread." C'est, n'en font non plus de
conscience, que de manger un morceau de pain. \[That is, they have no
more scruple in doing this than in eating a morsel of bread.\] - French
margin.

[Psa 53:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#004)

"My people." David may call the serious his people, because of his
regard for them, and because they were his supporters and friends. They
adhered to him in all his afflictions. \["Thy people shall be my people,
and thy God my God." [Rut 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#016).\] -
Benjamin Boothroyd, 1836.

[Psa 53:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#005)

"There were they in great fear, where no fear was." There is a fond and
superstitious fear, when men are afraid of their shadows, as Pisander
was afraid of meeting his own soul; and Antenor would never go forth of
the doors, but either in a coach closed upon all sides, or with a target
borne over his head, gearing, I guess, lest the sky should fall down
upon it, according to that in the Psalm, "They fear where no fear is." -
John King, 1559-1621.

[Psa 53:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#005)

"There were they in great fear, where no fear was." Behold how fearful a
hell a wounded conscience is! For why is Cain afraid to be killed,
seeing there is none living to perform it, but his father and mother,
and perhaps some women children which the Scripture nameth not? It is
God's just judgment, that they that will not fear the Lord who is only
to be feared, should stand in fear of them who are justly no cause of
fear. He that lately feared not to kill his brother, is now made a
terror to him self. Hereby also we may consider what is the repentance
of the wicked; they see perhaps the fault together with the punishment,
but they admit the fault and lament the punishment. - Nicholas Gibbens,
1602.

[Psalms 53:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 53:1</span></span>

1 The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt are they,
and have done abominable iniquity: there is none that doeth good.

2 God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there
were any that did understand, that did seek God.

3 Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become filthy;
there is none that doeth good, no, not one.

4 Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as
they eat bread: they have not called upon God.

5 There were they in great fear, where no fear was: for God hath
scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee: thou hast put
them to shame, because God hath despised them.

6 Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When God
bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and
Israel shall be glad.

[Psa 53:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#001)

"The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God." And this he does
because he is a fool. Being a fool he speaks according to his nature;
being a great fool he meddles with a great subject, and comes to a wild
conclusion. The atheist is, morally, as well as mentally, a fool, a fool
in the heart as well as in the head; a fool in morals as well as in
philosophy. With the denial of God as a starting point, we may well
conclude that the fool's progress is a rapid, riotous, raving, ruinous
one. He who begins at impiety is ready for anything. "No God," being
interpreted, means no law, no order, no restraint to lust, no limit to
passion. Who but a fool would be of this mind? What a Bedlam, or rather
what an Aceldama, would the world become if such lawless principles came
to be universal! He who heartily entertains an irreligious spirit, and
follows it out to its legitimate issues is a son of Belial, dangerous to
the commonwealth, irrational and despicable. Every natural man, is, more
or less a denier of God. Practical atheism is the religion of the race.
"Corrupt are they." They are rotten. It is idle to compliment them as
sincere doubters, and amiable thinkers - they are putrid. There is too
much dainty dealing nowadays with atheism; it is not a harmless error,
it is an offensive, putrid sin, and righteous men should look upon it in
that light. All men being more or less atheistic in spirit, are also in
that degree corrupt; their heart is foul, their moral nature is decayed.
"And have done abominable iniquity." Bad principles soon lead to bad
lives. One does not find virtue promoted by the example of your
Voltaires and Tom Paines. Those who talk so abominably as to deny their
Maker will act abominably when it serves their turn. It is the abounding
denial and forgetfulness of God among men which is the source of the
unrighteousness and crime which we see around us. If all men are not
outwardly vicious it is to be accounted for by the power of other and
better principles, but left to itself the "No God" spirit so universal
in mankind would produce nothing but the most loathsome actions. -
"There is none that doeth good." The one typical fool is reproduced in
the whole race; without a single exception men have forgotten the right
way. This accusation twice made in the Psalm, and repeated a third time
by the inspired apostle Paul, is an indictment most solemn and sweeping,
but he who makes it cannot err, he knows what is in man; neither will he
lay more to man's charge than he can prove.

[Psa 53:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#002)

"God looked down from heaven upon the children of men." He did so in
ages past, and he has continued his steadfast gaze from his
all-surveying observatory. "To see if there were any that did
understand, that did seek God." Had there been one understanding man,
one true lover of his God, the divine eye would have discovered him.
Those pure heathens and admirable savages that men talk so much of, do
not appear to have been visible to the eye of Omniscience, the fact
being that they live nowhere but in the realm of fiction. The Lord did
not look for great grace, but only for sincerity and right desire, but
these he found not. He saw all nations, and all men in all nations, and
all hearts in all men, and all motions of all hearts, but he saw neither
a clear head nor a clean heart among them all. Where God's eyes see no
favourable sign we may rest assured there is none.

[Psa 53:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#003)

"Every one of them is gone back." The whole mass of manhood, all of it,
is gone back. In the[Psa 14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001) it was
said to turn aside, which was bad enough, but here it is described as
running in a diametrically opposite direction. The life of unregenerate
manhood is in direct defiance of the law of God, not merely apart from
it but opposed to it. "They are altogether become filthy." The whole
lump is soured with an evil leaven, fouled with an all-pervading
pollution, made rank with general putrefaction. Thus, in God's sight,
our atheistic nature is not the pardonable thing that we think it to be.
Errors as to God are not the mild diseases which some account them, they
are abominable evils. Fair is the world to blind eyes, but to the
all-seeing Jehovah it is otherwise. "There is none that doeth good, no,
not one." How could there be, when the whole mass was leavened with so
evil a leaven? This puts an end to the fictions of the innocent savage,
the lone patriarch, "the Indian whose untutored mind," etc. Pope's verse
-

Father of all, in every age,

In every clime adored,

By saint, by savage, or by sage,

Jehovah, Jove, or Lord,"

evaporates in smoke. The fallen race of man, left to its own energy, has
not produced a single lover of God or doer of holiness, nor will it ever
do so. Grace must interpose or not one specimen of humanity will be
found to follow after the good and true. This is God's verdict after
looking down upon the race. Who shall gainsay it?

[Psa 53:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#004)

"Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge?" They have no wisdom,
certainly, but even so common a thing as knowledge might have restrained
them. Can they not see that there is a God? that sin is an evil thing?
that persecution recoils upon a man's own head? Are they such utter
fools as not to know that they are their own enemies, and are ruining
themselves? "Who eat up my people as they eat bread." Do they not see
that such food will be hard to digest, and will bring on them a horrible
vomit when God deals with them in justice? Can they imagine that the
Lord will allow them to devour his people with impunity? They must be
insane indeed. "They have not called upon God." They carry on their
cruel enterprise against the saints, and use every means but that which
is essential to success in every case, namely, the invocation of God. In
this respect persecutors are rather more consistent than Pharisees who
devoured widows' houses, and prayed too. The natural man, like Ishmael,
loves not the spiritual seed, is very Jealous of it, and would fain
destroy it, because it is beloved of God; yet the natural man does not
seek after the like favour from God. The carnal mind envies those who
obtain mercy, and yet it will not seek mercy itself. It plays the dog in
the manger. Sinners will out of a malicious jealousy devour those who
pray, but yet they will not pray themselves.

[Psa 53:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#005)

"There were they in great fear, where no fear was." David sees the end
of the ungodly and the ultimate triumph of the spiritual seed. The
rebellious march in fury against the gracious, but suddenly they are
seized with a causeless panic. The once fearless boasters tremble like
the leaves of the aspen, frightened at their own shadows. In this
sentence and this verse, this Psalm differs much from the fourteenth. It
is evidently expressive of a higher state of realisation in the poet, he
emphasises the truth by stronger expressions. Without cause the wicked
are alarmed. He who denies God is at bottom a coward, and in his
infidelity he is like the boy in the churchyard who "whistles to keep
his courage up." "For God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth
against thee." When the wicked see the destruction of their fellows they
may well quail. Mighty were the hosts which besieged Zion, but they were
defeated, and their unburied carcasses proved the prowess of the God
whose being they dared to deny. "Thou hast put them to shame, because
God hath despised them." God's people may well look with derision upon
their enemies since they are the objects of divine contempt. They scoff
at us, but we may with far greater reason laugh them to scorn, because
the Lord our God considers them as less than nothing and vanity.

[Psa 53:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#006)

"Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion." Would God the
final battle were well over. When will the Lord avenge his own elect?
When will the long oppression of the saints come to its close, and glory
crown their heads? The word "salvation" is in the plural, to show its
greatness. "When God bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob
shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad." Inasmuch as the yoke has been
heavy, and the bondage cruel, the liberty will be gladsome, and the
triumph joyous. The second advent and the restoration of Israel are our
hope and expectation.

We have attempted to throw into rhyme the last two verses of this Psalm:
-

The foes of Zion quake for fright,

Where no fear was they quail;

For well they know that sword of might

Which cuts through coats of mail.

The Lord of old defiled their shields,

And all their spears he scorn'd;

Their bones lay scatter'd o'er the fields.

Unburied and unmourn'd.

Let Zion's foes be filled with shame;

Her sons are bless'd of God;

Though scoffers now despise their name,

The Lord shall break the rod.

Oh! would our God to Zion turn,

God with salvation clad;

Then Judah's harps should music learn.

And Israel be glad.
