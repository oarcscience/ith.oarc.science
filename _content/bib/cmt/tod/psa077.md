### [Psalms Chapter 77](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 77:0</span></span>

Title. - To the Chief Musician, to Jeduthun. It was meet that another
leader of the psalmody should take his turn. No harp should be silent in
the courts of the Lord's house. A Psalm of Asaph. Asaph was a man of
exercised mind, and often touched the minor key; he was thoughtful,
contemplative, believing, but withal there was a dash of sadness about
him, and this imparted a tonic flavour to his songs. To follow him with
understanding, it is needful to have done business on the great waters,
and weathered many an Atlantic gale.

Divisions. - If we follow the poetical arrangement, and divide at the
Selahs, we shall find the troubled man of God pleading in [Psa
77:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#001), and then we shall hear him
lamenting and arguing within himself [Psa
77:4-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#004). From [Psa
77:10-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#010) his meditations run Godward,
and in the close he seems as in a vision to behold the wonders of the
Red Sea and the wilderness. At this point, as if lost in an ecstacy, he
hurriedly closes the Psalm with an abruptness, the effect of which is
quite startling. The Spirit of God knows when to cease speaking, which
is more than those do who, for the sake of making a methodical
conclusion, prolong their words even to weariness. Perhaps this Psalm
was meant to be a prelude to the next, and, if so, its sudden close is
accounted for. The hymn now before us is for experienced saints only,
but to them it will be of rare value as a transcript of their own inner
conflicts.

Hints to Preachers

[Psa 77:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#001). - The benefit of using the
voice in private prayer.

[Psa 77:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#001), [Psa
77:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#003), [Psa
77:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#005), [Psa
77:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#010). - Note the wise man's progress
out of his soul trouble.

I. I cried.

II\. I remembered.

III\. I considered.

IV\. I said.

[Psa 77:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#002). - See "Spurgeon's Sermons,"
No. 853. "A Sermon for the Most Miserable of Men."

[Psa 77:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#002). -

I. Special prayer: "In the day," etc.

II\. Persevering prayer: hands lifted up to God by night as well as by
day.

III\. Agonising prayer: "my soul refused to be comforted," until the
answer came. "Being in an agony, he prayed," etc. - G. R.

[Psa 77:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#002) (last clause). - When this
is wise, and when it is censurable.

[Psa 77:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#004). -

I. A good man cannot rest on his bed until his soul rests on God.

II\. He cannot speak freely to others until God speaks peace to his
soul. - G. R.

[Psa 77:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#004). - Occupation for the
sleepless, and consolation for the speechless.

[Psa 77:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#005), [Psa
77:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#006). - There are four rules for
obtaining comfort in affliction.

I. The consideration of God's goodness to his people of old.

II\. Remembrance of our own past experience.

III\. Self-examination.

IV\. The diligent study of the word. - G.R.

[Psa 77:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#006). - "Remembrance." A ood

hearing, if you remember nothing?

II\. It is a menas of faith: [Co1
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#002).

remeber God's promises they would inspire him with new life; but when
they are forgotten, his spirits sink.

IV\. It is a means of thankfulness.

V. It is a means of hope; for "experience worketh hope" ([Rom
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#004)), and the memory is the storehouse
of experience.

VI\. It is a means of repentance; for, how can we repent or mourn for
what we have forgotten?

VII\. It is a means of usefulness. When one spark of grace is truly
kindled in the heart, it will quickly endeavor to heat others also. - R.
Steele.

IV\. Are to be met in the power of the Spirit, with strong faith in the
Eternal God.

[Psa 77:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#010). - A confession applicable
to many other matters. Such as, fear of death, fear of desertion, dread
of public service, sensitiveness of neglect, etc.

[Psa 77:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#010). - "My infirmity."

taken in prayer to God for his Spirit's help, and others lamented and
repented of.

[Psa 77:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#010), [Psa

77:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#019). - "In the sea, in the
sanctuary." God's way incomprehensible, though undoubtedly right: in his
holiness lies the answer to the enigmas.

[Psa 77:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#014). - Thaumaturgeis, or the
Great Wonder-worker.

[Psa 77:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#015). - "And Joseph." The honour
of nourishing those who have been begotten of God by other men's
labours.

[Psa 77:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#015). - Redemption by power, the

Explanatory Notes and Quaint Sayings

Whole Psalm

Whenever, and by whomsoever, the Psalm may have been written, it clearly
is individual, not national. It utterly destroys all the beauty, all the
tenderness and depth of feeling in the opening portion, if we suppose
that the people are introduced speaking in the first person. The
allusions to the national history may indeed show that the season was a
season of national distress, and that the sweet singer was himself bowed
down by the burden of the time, and oppressed by woes which he had no
power to alleviate; but it is his own sorrow, not the sorrow of others
under which he sighs, and of which he has left the pathetic record. - J.
J. Stewart Perowne.

[Psa 77:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#001)

In the beginning of the Psalm, before speaking of his sorrows, he
hastens to show the necessary and most efficacious remedy for allaying
sorrow. He says that he did not, as many do, out of their impatience of
grief or murmuring, either accuse God of cruelty or tyranny, or utter
blasphemous words by which dishonour might fall upon God, or by
indulging in sorrow and distrust hasten his own destruction, or fill the
air with vain complainings, but fled straight to God, and to him
unburdened his sorrow, and sought that he would not shut him from that
grace which he bountifully offers to all. This is the only and sure
sovereign remedy which most effectually heals his griefs. - Mollerus.

[Psa 77:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#001)

"I cried." To the Orientals the word צעק presented the idea of a crash,
as of the heavens sending out thunders and lightnings. Whence beyond
other things he metaphorically says, he cried for sorrow;... shaken with
a tempest of thoughts he burst out into an open and loud-sounding
complaint. - Hermann Venema.

[Psa 77:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#001)

"Even unto God with my voice." The repetition here is emphatic. The idea
is that it was an earnest or fervent cry. - Albert Barnes.

[Psa 77:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#001) (last clause)

At the second knock, the door of grace flew open: the Lord heard me. -
John Collings.

[Psa 77:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#002)

"In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord." Days of trouble must be
days of prayer; in days of inward trouble, especially when God seems to
have withdrawn from us, we must seek him, and seek till we find him. In
the day of his trouble he did not seek for the diversions of business or
recreation, to shake off his trouble that way, but he sought God, and
his favour and grace. Those that are under trouble of mind, must not
think to drink it away, or laugh it away, but pray it away. - Matthew
Henry.

[Psa 77:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#002)

"My sore ran in the night." Hebrew: My hand was poured out; that is,
stretched out in prayer; or wet with continual weeping. Non fuit
remissa, nec retracta in lecturn. - John Trapp.

[Psa 77:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#002)

"My sore ran in the night, and ceased not," etc. - "There is no healing
of this wound, no easing of this sore, no cleansing of the conscience,
no quieting of a man's spirit: till God whom the soul seeketh show
himself as the Physician, the evil continueth still and groweth." -
David Dickson.

[Psa 77:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#002)

"My soul refused to be comforted." God has provided suitable and
sufficient comfort for his people. He sends them comforters just as
their circumstances require. But they at times refuse to hear the voice
of the charmer. The Lord has perhaps taken away an idol - or he
withholds his sensible presence, that they may learn to live by faith or
he has blighted their worldly prospects or he has written vanity and
emptiness upon all their gourds, cisterns, and delights. They give way
to passion, as did Jonah - or they sink into sullen gloom - or allow
unhumbled pride to rule the spirit - or yield to extreme sorrow, as
Rachel did - or fall under the power of temptation - or imbibe the
notion that they have no right to comfort. This is wrong, all wrong,
decidedly wrong. Look at what is left you, at what the gospel presents
to you, at what heaven will be to you. But the Psalmist was recovered
from this state. He was convinced that it was wrong. He was sorry for
his sin. He was reformed in his spirit and conduct. He wrote this Psalm
to instruct, caution, and warn us. Observe, they who are entitled to all
comfort, often through their own folly, enjoy the least. The Lord's
people are often their own tormentors, they put away the cup of comfort
from them, and say they are unworthy of it.

O Thou source of every blessing,

Chase my sorrows, cheer my heart,

Till in heaven, thy smiles possessing,

Life, and joy, and peace impart.

\- James Smith.

[Psa 77:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#002)

"My soul refused to be comforted." Poor I, that am but of yesterday,
have known some that have been so deeply plunged in the gulf of despair,
that they would throw all the spiritual cordials that have been tendered
to them against the walls. They were strong in reasoning against their
own souls, and resolved against everything that might be a comfort and
support unto them. They have been much set against all ordinances and
religious services; they have cast off holy duties themselves, and
peremptorily refused to join with others in them; yea, they have, out of
a sense of sin and wrath, which hath laid hard upon them, refused the
necessary comforts of this life, even to the overthrow of natural life,
and yet out of this horrible pit, this hell upon earth, hath God
delivered their souls, and given them such manifestations of his grace
and favour, that they would not exchange them for a thousand worlds. O
despairing souls, you see that others, whose conditions have been as bad
if not worse than yours, have obtained mercy. God hath turned their hell
into a heaven; he hath remembered them in their low estate; he hath
pacified their raging consciences, and quieted their distracted souls;
he hath wiped all tears from their eyes; and he hath been a well-spring
of life unto their hearts. Therefore be not discouraged, O despairing
souls, but look up to the mercy-seat. - Thomas Brooks.

[Psa 77:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#003)

"I remembered God, and was troubled." If our hearts or consciences
condemn us, it is impossible to remember him without being troubled.: It
will then be painful to remember that he is our Creator and Benefactor,
for the remembrance will be attended with a consciousness of base
ingratitude. It will be painful to think of him as Lawgiver; for such
thoughts will remind us that we have broken his law. It will be painful
to think of his holiness; for if he is holy, he must hate our sins, and
be angry with us as sinners: - of his justice and truth, for these
perfections make it necessary that he should fulfil his threatenings and
punish us for our sins. It will be painful to think of his omniscience -
for this perfection makes him acquainted with our most secret offences,
and renders it impossible to conceal them from his view; of his
omnipresence - for the constant presence of an invisible witness must be
disagreeable to those who wish to indulge their sinful propensities. It
will be painful to think of his power - for it enables him to restrain
or destroy, as he pleases: of his sovereignty, for sinners always hate
to see themselves in the hands of a sovereign God: of his eternity and
immutability - for from his possessing these perfections it follows that
he will never alter the threatenings which he has denounced against
sinners, and that he will always live to execute them. It will be
painful to think of him as judge; for we shall feel, that as sinners, we
have no reason to expect a favourable sentence from his lips. It will
even be painful to think of the perfect goodness and excellence of his
character; for his goodness leaves us without excuse in rebelling
against him, and makes our sins appear exceeding sinful. - Edward
Payson.

[Psa 77:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#003)

"I remembered God, and was troubled." All had not been well between God
and him; and whereas formerly, in his remembrance of God, his thoughts
were chiefly exercised about his love and kindness, now they were wholly
possessed with his own sin and unkindness. This causeth his trouble.
Herein lies a share of the entanglements occasioned by sin. Saith such a
soul in itself, "Foolish creature, hast thou thus requited the Lord? Is
this the return that thou hast made unto him for all his love, his
kindness, his consolations, mercies? Is this thy kindness for him, thy
love to him? Is this thy kindness to thy friend? Is this thy boasting of
him, that thou hadst found so much goodness and excellence in him and
his love, that though all men should forsake him, thou never wouldst do
so? Are all thy promises, all thy engagements which thou madest unto
God, in times of distress, upon prevailing obligations, and mighty
impressions of his good Spirit upon thy soul, now come to this, that
thou shouldst so foolishly forget, neglect, despise, cast him off? Well!
now he is gone; he is withdrawn from thee; and what wilt thou do? Art
thou not even ashamed to desire him to return?" They were thoughts of
this nature that cut Peter to the heart upon his fall. The soul finds
them cruel as death, and strong as the grave. It is bound in the chains
of them, and cannot be comforted, [Psa
38:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#003). John Owen.

[Psa 77:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#003)

There are moments in the life of all believers When God and his ways
become unintelligible to them. They get lost in profound meditation, and
nothing is left them but a desponding sigh. But we know from Paul the
apostle that the Holy Spirit intercedes for believers with God, when
they cannot utter their sighs. [Rom
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#026). - Augustus F. Tholuck.

[Psa 77:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#003)

"Selah." In the end of this verse is put the word, "Selah." And it doth
note unto the reader or hearer what a miserable and comfortless thing
man is in trouble, if God be not present with him to help him. It is
also put as a spur and prick for every Christian man and woman to
remember and call upon God in the days of their troubles. For as the
Jews say, wheresoever this word "Selah" is, it doth admonish and stir up
the reader or hearer to mark what Was said before it; for it is a word
always put after very notable sentences. - John Hooper.

[Psa 77:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#004)

"Thou holdest mine eyes waking." Thou art afflicted with want of sleep:
- A complaint incident to distempered bodies and thoughtful minds. Oh,
how wearisome a thing it is to spend the long night in tossing up and
down in a restless bed, in the chase of sleep; which the more eagerly it
is followed, flies so much the farther from us! Couldst thou obtain of
thyself to forbear the desire of it, perhaps it would come alone: now
that thou suest for it, like to some froward piece, it is coy and
overly, and punishes thee with thy longing. Lo, he that could command a
hundred and seven and twenty provinces, yet could not command rest. 'On
that night his sleep departed from him,' [Est
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#001), neither could be forced or
entreated to his bed. And the great Babylonian monarch, though he had
laid some hand on sleep, yet he could not hold it; for "his sleep brake
from him," [Dan 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#001). And, for great
and wise Solomon, it would not so much as come within his view. "Neither
day nor night seeth he sleep with his eyes," [Ecc
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#016). Surely, as there is no earthly
thing more comfortable to nature than bodily rest ([Jer
31:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#026)); so, there is nothing whose
loss is more grievous and disheartening.... Instead of closing thy lids
to wait for sleep, lift up thy stiff eyes to him that "giveth his
beloved rest," [Psa 127:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#002). Whatever be
the means, he it is that "holdeth mine eyes waking." He that made thine
eyes, keeps off sleep from thy body, for the good of thy soul: let not
thine eyes wake, without thy heart. The spouse of Christ can say, "I
sleep, but my heart waketh," [Sol 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#002).
How much more should she say, "Mine eyes wake, and my heart waketh
also!" When thou canst not sleep with thine eyes, labour to see him that
is invisible: one glimpse of that sight is more worth than all the sleep
that thine eyes can be capable of. Give thyself up into his hands, to be
disposed of at his will. What is this sweet acquiescence but the rest of
the soul? which if thou canst find in thyself, thou shalt quietly digest
the want of thy bodily sleep. - Joseph Hall, in his "Balm of Gilead."

[Psa 77:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#004)

"I am so troubled that I cannot speak." He adds that he was so cut down
and lifeless that he could not speak. Little griefs, as it is often
said, are uttered, great ones strike us dumb. In great troubles and
affrights the spirit fails the exterior members, and flows back to its
fountain; the limbs stand motionless, the whole body trembles, the eyes
remain fixed, and the tongue forgets its office. Hence it is that Niobe
was represented by the poets as turned into a stone. The history of
Psammenitus also, in Herodotus, is well known, how over the misfortunes
of his children he sat silent and overwhelmed, but when he saw his
friend's Calamities he bewailed them with bitter tears. - Mollerus.

[Psa 77:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#004)

"I am so troubled that I cannot speak." Sometimes our grief is so
violent that it finds no vent, it strangles us, and we are overcome. It
is with us in our desertions as with a man that gets a slight hurt; at
first he walks up and down, but not looking betimes to prevent a growing
mischief, the neglected wound begins to fester, or to gangrene, and
brings him to greater pain and loss. So it is with us many times in our
spiritual sadness; when we are first troubled, we pray and pour out our
souls before the Lord; but afterwards the waters of our grief drown our
cries and we are so overwhelmed, that if we might have all the world we
cannot pray, or at least we can find no enlargement, no life, no
pleasure in our prayers; and God himself seems to take no delight in
them, and that makes us more sad, [Psa
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#001). - Timothy Rogers (1660-1729), in
"A Discourse on Trouble of Mind, and the Disease of Melancholy."

[Psa 77:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#004)

"Troubled," Or, bruised: the Hebrew word properly signifieth an
astonishment caused by some great blow received. - John Diodati.

[Psa 77:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#004)

"I cannot speak." Words are but the body, the garment, the outside of
prayer; sighs are nearer the heart work. A dumb beggar getteth an alms
at Christ's gates, even by making sighs, when his tongue cannot plead
for him; and the rather, because he is dumb. Objection. I have not so
much as a voice to utter to God; and Christ saith, "Cause me to hear thy
voice" ([Sol 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#014)). Answer. Yea, but
some other thing hath a voice beside the tongue: "The Lord has heard the
voice of my weeping" ([Psa 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#008)). Tears
have a tongue, and grammar, and language, that our Father knoweth. Babes
have no prayer for the breast, but weeping: the mother can read hunger
in weeping. - Samuel Rutherford.

[Psa 77:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#004)

If through all thy discouragements thy condition prove worse and worse,
so that thou canst not pray, but art struck dumb when thou comest into
his presence, as David, then fall a-making signs when thou canst not
speak; groan, sigh, sob, "chatter," as Hezekiah did; bemoan thyself for
thine unworthiness, and desire Christ to speak thy requests for thee,
and God to hear him for thee. - Thomas Goodwin.

[Psa 77:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#005)

"The days of old." Doubtless to our first parents the darkness of the
first night was somewhat strange; persons who had never seen anything
but the light of the day, when the shadows of the night first did
encompass them, could not be without some apprehension: yet when at the
back of a number of nights they had seen the day-spring of the morning
light constantly to arise; the darkness of the blackest nights was
passed over without fear, and in as great security, as the light of the
fairest days. To men who have always lived upon land, when first they
set to sea, the winds, waves, and storms are exceeding terrible; but
when they are a little beaten with the experience of tempests, their
fears do change into resolution and courage. It is of no small use to
remember that those things which vex most our spirit, are not new, but
have already been in times before our days. - Robert Baylie's Sermon
before the House of Commons. 1643.

[Psa 77:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#006)

"I call to remembrance my song in the night." Either, (1) "I will now,
in the present night of affliction, remember my former songs." "Though
this is a time of distress, and my present circumstances are gloomy, yet
I have known brighter days. He that lifted me up, has cast me down, and
he can raise me up again." Sometimes this reflection, indeed, adds a
poignancy to our distress, as it did to David's trouble, [Psa
42:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#004). Yet it will bear a better
improvement, which he seems to make of it; [Psa
77:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#011), and so Job, ([Job
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#010).) "Shall we receive good at the
hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?" And his case shows that
after the most sweeping calamities the Lord can again give things a turn
in favour of them that hope in him. Therefore, present troubles should
not make us forget former comforts, especially as the former so much
exceeded our deserts, and the present afflictions fall so short of our
demerits. Or, (2) the text may mean, "I will remember how I have been
enabled to sing in the former nights of affliction." And surely it is
especially seasonable to remember supports and consolations granted
under preceding distresses. Elihu complained ([Job
35:10](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#010)), "There is none that saith,
Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the night." David comforted
himself with the thought, "Though deep calleth unto deep, yet the Lord
will command his loving-kindness in the daytime, and in the night his
song shall be with me." [Psa 42:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#008). And
the Lord promised by Isaiah ([Isa
30:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#029)), "Ye shall have a song, as in
the night when a holy solemnity is kept." No doubt Paul and Silas
remembered their song in the night, when imprisoned at Philippi; and it
afforded them encouragement under subsequent trials. And cannot many of
you, my brethren, in like manner, remember the supports and consolations
you have enjoyed in former difficulties, and how the Lord turned the
shadow of death into morning? And ought you not to trust to him that
hath delivered, that he will yet deliver? He that hath delivered in six
troubles will not forsake you in seven. The "clouds may return after the
rain;" but not a drop can fall without the leave of him, who rides on
the heavens for your help, and in his excellency on the sky. Did you not
forbode at first a very different termination of the former troubles?
and did the Lord disappoint your fears, and put a new song into your
mouth; and will you not now begin to trust him, and triumph in him?
Surely you have found that the Lord can clear the darkest skies. "Light
is sown for the righteous," and ere long you shall see an eternal day.
If such songs are given to the pilgrims of the night, how shall they
sing in that world where the sun shall set no morel There will be no
night there. - John Ryland. 1753-1825.

"I call to remembrance" being glad in this scarcity of comfort, to live
upon the old store, as bees do in winter. - John Trapp.

[Psa 77:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#006)

"My song in the night." The "songs of the night" is as favourite a word
of the Old Testament as "glory in tribulation" is of the New, and it is
one of those which prove that both Testaments have the self-same root
and spirit. - John Ker.

[Psa 77:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#006)

"My spirit made diligent search." He falls upon self-examination, and
searcheth his spirit, to consider why the hand of God was so against
him, and why the face of God was so hid from him. Some read it, "I
digged into my spirit;" as Ezekiel digged into the wall, to search for
and find out the abomination, that made the Lord thus leave him in the
dark, and hide his face from him. He searcheth the wound of his spirit;
that was another way to cure it. It is a notable way to cure the wounds
of the soul, for the soul to search them. - John Collings.

[Psa 77:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#006)

"My spirit made diligent search." The verb חפשׂ, chaphas, signifies such
an investigation as a man makes who is obliged to strip himself in order
to do it; or, to lift up coverings, to search fold by fold, or in our
own phrase, to leave no stone unturned. - Adam Clarke.

[Psa 77:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#006)

"My spirit made diligent search." As Ahasuerus, when he could not sleep,
called for the records and chronicles of his kingdom, so the doubting
soul betakes himself to the records of heaven, the word of God in the
Scriptures, and one while he is reading there, another while looking
into his heart, if he can find there anything that answers the
characters of Scripture-faith, as the face in the glass doth the face of
man. David, when he was at a loss what to think of himself, and many
doubts did clog his faith, insomuch that the thinking of God increased
his trouble, he did not sit down and let the ship drive, as we say, not
regarding whether God loved him or no, but communes with his own heart,
and his spirit makes diligent search. Thus it is with every sincere soul
under doubtings: he dares no more sit down contented in that unresolved
condition, than one who thinks he smells fire in his house dares settle
himself to sleep till he hath looked in every room and corner, and
satisfied himself that all is safe, lest he should be waked with the
fire about his ears in the night; and the poor doubting soul is much
more afraid, lest it should wake with hell-fire about it: whereas a soul
in a state and under the power of unbelief is secure and careless. -
William Gurnall.

[Psa 77:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#006)

"Diligent search." This duty requires diligence. External acts of
religion are facile; to lift up the eye to heaven, to bow the knee, to
read a prayer, this requires no more labour than for a papist to tell
over his beads; but to examine a man's self, to take the heart all in
pieces as a watch, and see what is defective, this is not easy.
Reflective acts are hardest. The eye can see everything but itself. It
is easy to spy the faults of others, but hard to find out our own. -
Thomas Watson.

[Psa 77:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#008)

"Doth his promise fail for evermore?" Let no appearing impossibilities
make you question God's accomplishment of any of his gracious words.
Though you cannot see how the thing can be done, 'tis enough, if God has
said that he will do it. There can be no obstructions to promised
salvation, which we need to fear. He who is the God of this salvation,
and the Author of the promise, will prepare his own way for the doing of
his own work, so that "every valley shall be filled, and every mountain
and hill brought low." [Luk 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#005).
Though the valleys be so deep that we cannot see the bottom, and the
mountains so high that we cannot see the tops of them, yet God knows how
to raise the one and level the other; [Isa
63:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#001) : "I that speak in righteousness
(or faithfulness) am mighty to save." If anything would keep back the
kingdom of Christ, it would be our infidelity; but he will come, though
he should find no faith on the earth. See [Rom
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#003). Cast not away your confidence
because God defers his performances. Though providences run cross,
though they move backwards and forwards, you have a sure and faithful
word to rely upon. Promises, though they be for a time seemingly
delayed, cannot be finally frustrated. Dare not to harbour such a
thought within yourselves. The being of God may as well fail as the
promise of God. That which does not come in your time, will be hastened
in his time, which is always the more convenient season. - Timothy
Cruso.

[Psa 77:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#009)

"Hath God forgotten to be gracious?" In what pangs couldst thou be, O
Asaph, that so woeful a word should fall from thee: "Hath God forgotten
to be gracious?" Surely, the temptation went so high, that the next step
had been blasphemy. Had not that good God, whom thy bold weakness
questions for forgetfulness, in great mercies remembered thee, and
brought thee speedily to remember thyself and him; that, which thou
confessest to have been infirmity, had proved a sinful despair. I dare
say for thee, that word washed thy cheeks with many a tear, and was
worthy of more; for, O God, what can be so dear to thee, as the glory of
thy mercy? There is none of thy blessed attributes, which thou desirest
to set forth so much unto the sons of men, and so much abhorrest to be
disparaged by our detraction, as thy mercy. Thou canst, O Lord, forget
thy displeasure against thy people; thou canst forget our iniquities,
and cast our sins out of thy remembrance, [Mic
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#018), [Mic
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#019); but thou canst no more forget to
be gracious, than thou canst cease to be thyself. O my God, I sin
against thy justice hourly, and thy mercy interposes for my remission:
but, oh, keep me from sinning against thy mercy. What plea can I hope
for, when I have made my advocate my enemy? - Joseph Hall.

[Psa 77:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#009)

"Hath God forgotten to be gracious?" The poor child crieth after the
mother. What shall I do for my mother! Oh, my mother, my mother, what
shall I do for my mother! And it may be the mother stands behind the
back of the child, only she hides herself, to try the affection of the
child: so the poor soul cries after God, and complains, Oh, my Father!
my Father; Where is my heavenly Father? Hath he forgotten to be
gracious? Hath he shut up his loving-kindness in displeasure? when (all
the while), God is nearer than they think for, shining upon them in "a
spirit of grace and supplications," with sighs and "groans that cannot
be uttered." Thus the gracious woman, Mary Magdelene, she seeks after
Christ, she enquires, she cries after him, and weeps: My dear Saviour,
my dear Lord and Master, he is "taken out of the sepulchre, and I know
not where they have laid him!" Thus she complains to the disciples, and
thus she complains to the angels, when Christ stood at her very back and
overheard all: nay, when she turned her about and saw him, yet at first
she did not know him; nay, when he spoke to her and she to him, yet she
knew him not, but thought he had been the gardener, [Joh
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#015). Thus is it with many a gracious
soul; though God speaks home to their hearts in his Word, and they speak
to him by prayer, and they cannot say but the Spirit "helps their
infirmities;" yet they complain for want of his presence, as if there
were nothing of God in them. - Matthew Lawrence.

[Psa 77:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#009)

"Hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies?" The metaphor here is
taken from a spring, the mouth of which is closed, so that its waters
can no longer run in the same channel; but, being confined, break out
and take some other course. Wilt thou take thy mercy from the Israelites
and give it to some other people? - Adam Clarke.

[Psa 77:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#009)

"Selah." Thus was he going on with his dark and dismal apprehensions,
when on a sudden he first checked himself with that word, "Selah;" stop
there; go no further; let us hear no more of these unbelieving surmises;
and he then chide himself, [Psa 77:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#010)
: "This is mine infirmity." - Matthew Henry.

[Psa 77:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#010)

"This is my infirmity." Literally, this is my disease. - which appears
to mean, This is my lot and I must bear it; lo! it is a partial evil,
for which the equity of God's government should not be questioned. The
authorised version, "This is my infirmity," suggests, perhaps advisedly,
another signification, viz., These thoughts are but hallucinations of my
agony, - but to this gloss I should scruple to commit myself. - C. B.
Cayley.

[Psa 77:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#010)

It is the "infirmity" of a believer to be thinking of himself, and
drawing false inferences (for all such inferences are necessarily
erroneous), from what he sees or feels, as to the light in which he is
beheld and estimated on the part of God. It is his strength, on the
other hand, to remember the right hand of the Most High - to meditate
upon the changeless truth and mercy of that God who has committed
himself in holiness to the believing sinner's sure salvation, by causing
the Son of his love to suffer in our stead the dread reality of penal
death. - Arthur Pridham.

[Psa 77:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#010)

"Infirmity." An "infirmity" is this, - some sickness or indisposition of
the soul, that arises from the weakness of grace. Or an infirmity is
this, - when the purpose and inclination of the heart is upright, but a
man wants strength to perform that purpose; when "the spirit is willing,
but the flesh is weak" ([Mat 26:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#041));
when a man can say with the apostle, "To will is present with me; but
how to perform that which is good I find not," [Rom
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#018). When the bent and inclination of
the soul is right, but either through some violence of corruption or
strength of temptation, a man is diverted and turned out of the way. As
the needle in the seaman's compass, you know if it be right it will
stand always northwards, the bent of it will be toward the North Pole,
but being jogged and troubled, it may sometimes be put out of frame and
order, yet the bent and inclination of it is still northward; this is an
infirmity. - James Nalton. 1664.

[Psa 77:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#010)

It is unnecessary to state all the renderings which the learned have
given of this verse. It is unquestionably ambiguous, as the word הלּותי
may be derived from different roots, which have different
significations. I derive it from חוּל morf ti or חלל which signifies to
be in pain as a woman in labour, and as it is in the infinitive, I
render it, "the time of my sorrow or pain." The next term, שׁגות, I
derive from שׁגה to change, as the Chaldee does, Ainsworth, Hammond, and
others; and I render potentially. I consider the whole as a beautiful
metaphor. The author considers himself as in distress, like a woman in
travail; and like her, hopes soon to have his sorrow turned to joy. He
confides in God's power to effect such a change; and hence naturally
recollects the past instances of God's favour to his people. - Benjamin
Boothroyd.

[Psa 77:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#010)

"I will remember the years of the right hand of the Most High." Not the
moments, nor the hours, nor days of a few short afflictions, that his
left hand hath dealt to me: but the "years of his right hand;" those
long, large, and boundless mercies wherewith he hath comforted me. -
Thomas Adams.

[Psa 77:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#010)

"I will remember the years," etc. The words in the Hebrew text are
shenoth jemin gneljon, which I find to be variously rendered and
translated by interpreters. I shall not trouble you with them all at
this present time, but only take notice of two of them, which I conceive
are the principal and most comprehensive; the one is of our oldest
English translation, and the other of our last and newest; the former
reads the words thus: "The right hand of the Most High can change all
this." The latter reads the words thus, as we have it now before us, "I
will remember the years," etc. The main ground of this variation is the
different exposition of the Hebrew word shenoth, which may be translated
either to change, from the verb in the infinitive mood, or else may be
translated years, from the noun in the plural number. This hath given
the occasion to this difference and variety of translation, but the
sense is very good and agreeable which way soever we take it -

First, take it according to the former translation, as it does exhibit
to us the power of God. "The right hand of the Lord can change all
this." This was that whereby David did support himself in his present
affliction; that the Lord was able to change and alter this his
condition to him, and that for the better ... For the second sense here
before us, that's this: "I will remember the years of the right hand of
the most High;" where the word "remember" is borrowed from the next
following verse, to supply the sense of this, as otherwise being not in
the text. Now here the prophet David fetches a ground of comfort from
God's practice, as before he did from his power; there, from what God
could do; here, from what he had done already in former time, and ages,
and generations. - Thomas Horton.

[Psa 77:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#011)

"I will remember," etc. Remember and commemorate as the Hebrew (by a
double reading) importeth. - John Trapp.

[Psa 77:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#011)

"I will remember." Faith is a considering grace: he that believes will
not make haste; no, not to think or speak of God. Faith hath a good
memory, and can tell the Christian many stories of ancient mercies; and
when his present meal falls short, it can entertain the soul with a cold
dish: and not complain that God keeps a bad house. Thus David recovered
himself, when he was even tumbling down the hill of temptation: "This is
my infirmity; but I will remember the years of the right hand of the
Most High. I will remember thy wonders of old." Therefore, Christian,
when thou art in the depths of affliction, and Satan tempts thee to
asperse God, as if he were forgetful of thee, stop his mouth with this:
No, Satan, God hath not forgot to do for me, but I have forgot what he
hath done for me, or else I could not question his fatherly care at
present over me. Go, Christian, play over thy own lessons, praise God
for past mercies, and it will not be long before thou hast a new song
put into thy mouth for a present mercy....

Sometimes a little writing is found in a man's study that helps to save
his estate, for want of which he had gone to prison; and some one
experience remembered keeps the soul from despair, a prison which the
devil longs to have the Christian in. "This I recall to my mind,
therefore have I hope," [Lam 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#021).
David was famous for his hope, and not less eminent for his care to
observe and preserve the experiences he had of God's goodness. He was
able to recount the dealings of God with him; they were so often the
subject of his meditation and matter of his discourse, that he had made
them familiar to him. When his hope is at a loss, he doth but exercise
his memory a little, and he recovers himself presently, and chides
himself for his weakness. "I said, this is my infirmity: but I will
remember the years of the right hand of the Most High." The hound, when
he hath lost the scent, hunts backward and so recovers it, and pursues
his game with louder cry than ever. Thus, Christian, when thy hope is at
a loss, and thou questionest thy salvation in another world, then look
backward and see what God hath already done for thee. Some promises have
their day of payment here, and others we must stay to receive in heaven.
Now the payment which God makes of some promises here, is an earnest
given to our faith that the others also shall be faithfully discharged
when their date expires; as every judgment inflicted here on the wicked
is sent as a pledge of that wrath the full sum whereof God will make up
in hell. - William Gurnall.

[Psa 77:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#011)

"The works of the Lord."..."Thy wonders." The Psalmist does not mean to
draw a distinction between the works and the wonders of God; but,
rather, to state that all God's works are wonders all, whether in
providence or grace - all God's works are wonderful. If we take the
individual experience of the Christian, of what is that experience made
up? Of wonders. The work of his conversion, wonderful! - arrested in a
course of thoughtlessness and impiety; graciously sought and gently
compelled to be at peace with God, whose wrath he had provoked. The
communication of knowledge, wonderful! - Deity and eternity gradually
piled up; the Bible taken page by page, and each page made a volume
which no searching can exhaust. The assistance in warfare, wonderful! -
himself a child of corruption, yet enabled to grapple with the world,
the flesh, and the devil, and often to trample them under foot. The
solaces in affliction, wonderful! - sorrow sanctified so as to minister
to joy, and a harvest of gladness reaped from a field which has been
watered with tears. The foretastes of heaven, wonderful! - angels
bringing down the clusters of the land, and the spirit walking with
lightsome tread the crystal river and the streets of gold. All
wonderful! Wonderful that the Spirit should strive with man; wonderful
that God should bear with his backslidings; wonderful that God should
love him notwithstanding his pollution; wonderful that God should
persist in saving him, in spite, as it were, of himself. Oh! those
amongst you who know anything, experimentally, of salvation through
Christ, well know that the work is wonderful in its commencement,
wonderful in its continuance, and they will need no argument to
vindicate the transition from "works" to "wonders." It will be the
transition of your own thoughts and your own feelings, and you will
never give in the record of God's dealings with yourselves without
passing, as the Psalmist passed, from mentioning to ascription. Ye may
set yourselves to commemorate God's "works," ye will find yourselves
extolling God's "wonders." Ye may begin with saying, "I will remember
the works of the Lord;" but ye will conclude by exclaiming, "Surely I
will remember thy wonders of old." - Henry Melvill.

[Psa 77:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#011)

"Thy wonders." The word is in the singular here, and also in [Psa
77:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#014). So also in the next verse, "Thy
work," because the one great wonder, the one great work in which all
others were included, is before his thoughts. - J. J. Stewart Perowne.

[Psa 77:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#011)

"Thy wonders." He had before spoken to others, but here he turns to God.
It is good for a soul in a hard exercise, to raise itself from thinking
of God and of his works, unto speaking unto God directly: no ease or
relief will be found till address be made unto himself, till we turn our
face toward him and direct our speech unto him, as here the Psalmist
doth, from the midst of the [Psa 77:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#011)
to the end of the psalm. - David Dickson.

[Psa 77:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#013)

"Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary." The word "sanctuary" is to be
taken either for heaven or for the temple. I am rather inclined to refer
it to heaven, conceiving the meaning to be, that the ways of God rise
high above the world, so that if we are truly desirous to know them, we
must ascend above all heavens. Although the works of God are in part
manifest to us, yet all our knowledge of them comes far short of their
immeasurable height. Besides, it is to be observed, that none enjoy the
least taste of his works but those who by faith rise up to heaven. And
yet, the utmost point to which we can ever attain is, to contemplate
With admiration and reverence the hidden wisdom and power of God, which,
while they shine forth in his works, yet far surpass the limited powers
of our understanding. - John Calvin.

[Psa 77:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#013)

"Thy way is in the sanctuary." That is, every one of the elect may and
ought to learn in thy church the conduct and proceedings of thy
providence towards those that were thine. - John Diodati.

[Psa 77:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#013), [Psa
77:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#019)

"In the sanctuary" and "In the sea." His "way" is "in the sanctuary,"
and His "way" is "in the sea." Now there is a great difference between
these two things. First of all, God's way is in the sanctuary, where all
is light, all is clear. There is no mistake there. There is nothing, in
the least degree, that is a harass to the spirit. On the contrary, it is
when the poor, troubled one enters into the sanctuary, and views things
there in the light of God, that he sees the end of all else - everything
that is entangled, the end of which he cannot find on the earth. But not
only is God's way in the sanctuary (and when we are there, all is bright
and happy); but God's way is in the "sea." He walks where we cannot
always trace his footsteps. God moves mysteriously by times, as we all
know. There are ways of God which are purposely to try us. I need not
say that it is not at all as if God had pleasure in our perplexities.
Nor is it as if we had no sanctuary to draw near to, where we can rise
above it. But, still, there is a great deal in the ways of God that must
be left entirely in his own hands. The way of God is thus not only in
the sanctuary, but also in the sea. And yet, what we find even in
connection with his footsteps being in the sea is, "Thou leddest thy
people like a flock, by the hand of Moses and Aaron." That was through
the sea; afterwards, it was through the wilderness. But it had been
through the sea. The beginnings of the ways of God with his people were
there; because, from first to last, God must be the confidence of the
saint. It may be an early lesson of his soul, but it never ceases to be
the thing to learn. How happy to know that, while the sanctuary is open
to us, yet God himself is nearer still - and to him we are brought now.
As it is said (1 Pet. 3), "Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the
just for the unjust, to bring us to God." This is a most precious thing;
because there we are in the sanctuary at once, and brought to God
himself. And I am bold to say, that heaven itself would be but a small
matter if it were not to God that we are brought. It is better than any
freedom from trial - better than any blessing, to be in the presence of
the One we belong to; who is himself the source of all blessing and joy.
That we are brought to him now is infinitely precious. There we are in
the sanctuary brought to God. But, still, there are other ways of God
outside the sanctuary - "In the sea." And there we often find ourselves
at a loss. If we are occupied with the sea itself, and with trying to
scan God's footsteps there, then "they are not known." But confidence in
God himself is always the strength of faith. May the Lord grant us
increasing simplicity and quietness in the midst of all that we pass
through, for his name's sake. - From "Things New and Old." 1865.

[Psa 77:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#014)

"The God that doest wonders." If he said, Thou art the God that hast
done wonders, it would be plain that he spake only of those ancient
miracles which were wrought in former days: but now that he saith, Thou
art the God that doest wonders, he evidently refers to those wonderful
works, which he is doing now, and shall not cease to do even to the end
of the world. - Gerhohus.

[Psa 77:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#015)

"The sons of Jacob and Joseph." The distinction between the sons of
Jacob and Joseph is not meaningless. For by the sons of Jacob or Israel
the believing Jews are properly intended, those that trace their descent
to him not only according to the flesh but according to faith. Of whom
although Joseph was one, yet since he was sold by his brethren and after
many sufferings among foreign tribes raised to high rank, it is highly
congruous to distinguish him from the sons of Jacob, and he is fitly
regarded as a prince of the Gentiles apart from Jacob's sons, who sold
him. - Gerhohus.

[Psa 77:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#015)

"The sons of Jacob and Joseph." Was it Joseph or was it Jacob that begat
the children of Israel? Certainly Jacob begat; but as Joseph nourished
them, they are called by his name also. - Talmud.

[Psa 77:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#016)

"The waters saw thee, O God," etc. "The waters of the Red Sea," says
Bishop Horne, "are here beautifully represented as endued with
sensibility; as seeing, feeling, and being confounded, even to the
lowest depths, at the presence and power of their great Creator, when he
commanded them to open a way, and to form a wall on each side of it,
until his people were passed over." This in fact is true poetry; and in
this attributing of life, spirit, feeling, action, and suffering to
inanimate objects, there are no poets who can vie with those of the
Hebrew nation. - Richard Mant.

[Psa 77:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#016)

"The depths also were troubled." The depths are mentioned in addition to
the waters, to show that the dominion and power of God reach not only to
the surface of the waters, but penetrate to the most profound abysses,
and agitate and restrain the waters from their lowest bottom. -
Mollerus.

[Psa 77:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#016)

The waters saw thee, but men do not see thee. The depths were troubled,
but men say in their heart, There is no God. The clouds poured out
water, but men pour not out cries and tears unto God. The skies send out
a sound, but men say not, Where is God my Maker? Thine arrows also went
abroad, but no arrows of contrition and supplication are sent back by
men in return. The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven, but men hear
not the louder thunders of the law. The lightnings lightened the world,
but the light of truth shines in darkness and the darkness comprehendeth
it not. The earth trembled and shook, but human hearts remain unmoved.

"My heart it shakes not at the wrath

And terrors of a God."

\- George Rogers.

[Psa 77:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#016)

As soon as ever the whole Egyptian army was within it, the sea flowed to
its own place, and came down with a torrent raised by storms of wind and
encompassed the Egyptians. Showers of rain also came down from the sky,
and dreadful thunders and lightning, with flashes of fire. Thunder-bolts
also were darted upon them; nor was there anything which used to be sent
by God upon men, as indications of his wrath, which did not happen at
this time; for a dark and dismal night oppressed them. And thus did all
these men perish, so that there was not one man left to be a messenger
of this calamity to the rest of the Egyptians. - Josephus.

[Psa 77:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#019)

"Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters," etc. Until
lately, not much was known of oceanic currents, nor of their influences
on the condition of particular localities and the intercourse of man
with man. They are now seen to be the "way" or "path" of the Creator "in
the great waters." Numerous agencies tend to the production of these
currents. Amongst them we may reckon the propagation of the tide wave in
its progress over the globe, the duration and strength of certain winds,
the variations in density which sea-water undergoes in different
latitudes, and at different depths, by change of temperature, and the
quantity of salt it contains, and by the hourly alterations of
atmospheric pressure which take place within the tropics. The oceanic
currents are nearly constant in breadth, crossing the sea in many
directions. Long bands of seaweed carried by the currents shew at once
their velocity, and the line of demarcation between the waters at rest
and the waters in motion. Between the tropics there is a general
movement of the sea from east to west, called the equatorial current,
supposed to be due to the trade winds, and the progress of the tide
wave. There are narrower currents carrying warm water to higher and cold
water to lower latitudes. - Edwin Sidney, in "Conversations on the Bible
and Science." 1866.

[Psa 77:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#019)

"Thy way is in the sea," where no man can wade, except God be before
him, but where any man may walk if God take him by the hand and lead him
through. - David Dickson.

[Psa 77:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#019)

"Thy footsteps are not known." He often goeth so much out of our sight,
that we are unable to give an account of what he doeth, or what he is
about to do. Frequently the pillar of divine providence is dark
throughout, to Israelites as well as Egyptians; so that his own people
understand not the riddles, till he is pleased to be his own
interpreter, and to lead them into his secrets. - Samuel Slater ( -
1704), in "The Morning Exercises."

[Psa 77:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#019)

"Thy footsteps are not known." That is, they are not always known; or,
they are not known in all things; yea, they are not altogether known in
anything. - Joseph Caryl.

[Psa 77:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#019)

"Thy footsteps are not known." Upon some affair of great consequence,
which had occurred in some providential dispensations, Luther was very
importunate at the throne of grace to know the mind of God in it; and it
seemed to him as if he heard God speak to his heart thus: "I am not to
be traced." Referring to this incident, one adds, "If he is not to be
traced, he may be trusted;" and that religion is of little value which
will not enable a man to trust God where he can neither trace nor see
him. But there is a time for everything beneath the sun, and the
Almighty has his 'times and seasons.' It has been frequently with my
hopes and desires, in regard to providence, as with my watch and the
sun, which has often been ahead of true time; I have gone faster than
providence, and have been forced to stand still and wait, or I have been
set back painfully. That was a fine sentiment of Flavel, "Some
providences, like Hebrew letters, must be read backwards." - Quoted in
"Christian Treasury," 1849. Author not mentioned.

See also notes on verse 13.

[Psa 77:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#020)

"Thou leddest thy people like a flock," etc. From this verse the
afflicted may learn many consolations. First, that the best people that
be are no better able to resist temptation, than the simple sheep is
able to withstand the brier that catcheth him. The next, that man is of
no more ability to beware of temptations, than the poor sheep is to
avoid the brier, being preserved only by the diligence of the shepherd.
The third, that as the shepherd is careful of his entangled and briefed
sheep, so is God of his afflicted faithful. And the fourth is, that the
people of Israel could take no harm of the water, because they entered
the sea at God's commandment. Whereof we learn, that no danger can hurt
when God doth command us to enter into it; and all dangers overcome us
if we choose them ourselves, besides God's commandment; as Peter, when
he went at God's commandment upon the water, took no hurt; but when he
entered into the bishop's house upon his own presumption, was overcome
and denied Christ. The Israelites, when they fought at God's
commandment, the peril was nothing; but when they would do it of their
own heads, they perished: so that we are bound to attend upon God's
commandment, and then no danger shall destroy us, though it pain us. The
other doctrine is in this, that God used the ministry of Moses and Aaron
in the deliverance of his people, who did command them to do nothing but
that the Lord did first bid. Whereof we learn that such as be ministers
appointed of God, and do nothing but as God commandeth, are to be
followed; as Paul saith, "Follow me, as I follow Christ." - John Hooper.

[Psa 77:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#020)

"Thou leddest thy people like a flock." Observe, the good shepherd leads
his followers like sheep: First, with great solicitude and care, to
protect them from wolves. Secondly, with consideration and kindness, for
the sheep is a harmless animal. Thirdly, with a wise strictness, for
sheep easily wander, and they are of all animals the most stupid. -
Thomas Le Blanc.

[Psa 77:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#020)

"Leddest thy people." Our guiding must be mild and gentle, else it is
not duxisti, but traxisti; drawing and driving, and no leading. Lent
spiritu non dura manu, rather by an inward sweet influence to be led,
than by an outward extreme violence to be forced forward. So did God
lead his people here. Not the greatest pace, I wis, for they were a year
marching that they might have posted in eleven days, as Moses saith.
([Deu 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#002).) No nor yet the nearest way
neither, as Moses telleth us. ([Exo
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#018).) For he fetched a compass
divers times, as all wise governors by his example must do, that desire
rather safely to lead, than hastily to drive forward. "The Spirit of God
leadeth this people," saith Isaiah ([Isa
63:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#014)) "as an horse is ridden down the
hill into a valley" which must not be at a gallop, lest horse and ruler
both come down one over another; but warily and easily. - Lancelot
Andrewes.

[Psa 77:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#020)

"By the hand of Moses and Aaron." He says not, Moses and Aaron led the
people of Israel; but, Thou leddest the people, and that thy people, by
the hand of Moses and Aaron. Great was the power of these two men;
nevertheless neither of them was the shepherd of the sheep, but each was
a servant to the one and only true shepherd, to whom the sheep
exclusively belonged. Nor yet was either the leader of the sheep, but
the shepherd himself was present and led his own flock, to whom these
two acted as servants. There are therefore three things to be learned
from this passage. First, the sheep do not belong to the servants, but
to the true shepherd. Secondly, the true shepherd is the leader of his
own sheep. Thirdly, the office of Moses and Aaron was to attend to this
duty, that the Lord's sheep should be properly led and pastured. So
Christ himself leads the sheep, his own sheep, and for this work he
employs the ministry of his servants. - Musculus.

[Psa 77:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#020)

The Psalmist has reached the climax of his strain, he has found relief
from his sorrow by forcing his thoughts into another channel, by
dwelling on all God's mightiest wonders of old; but there he must end:
in his present intensity of passion he cannot trust himself to draw
forth in detail any mere lessons of comfort. There are seasons when even
the holiest faith cannot bear to listen to words of reasoning; though it
can still find a support whereon to rest, in the simple contemplation,
in all their native grandeur, of the deeds that God hath wrought. -
Joseph Francis Thrupp.

[Psalms 77:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 77:1</span></span>

1 I cried unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice; and he
gave ear unto me.

2 In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the night,
and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted.

3 I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit was
overwhelmed. Selah.

[Psa 77:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#001)

"I cried unto God with my voice." This Psalm has much sadness in it, but
we may be sure it will end well, for it begins with prayer, and prayer
never has an ill issue. Asaph did not run to man but to the Lord, and to
him he went, not with studied, stately, stilted words, but with a cry,
the natural, unaffected, unfeigned expression of pain. He used his voice
also, for though vocal utterance is not necessary to the life of prayer,
it often seems forced upon us by the energy of our desires. Sometimes
the soul feels compelled to use the voice, for thus it finds a freer
vent for its agony. It is a comfort to hear the alarm-bell ringing when
the house is invaded by thieves. "Even unto God with my voice." He
returned to his pleading. If once sufficed not, he cried again. He
needed an answer, he expected one, he was eager to have it soon,
therefore he cried again and again, and with his voice too, for the
sound helped his earnestness. "And he gave ear unto me." Importunity
prevailed. The gate opened to the steady knock. It shall be so with us
in our hour of trial, the God of grace will hear us in due season.

[Psa 77:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#002)

"In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord." All day long his distress
drove him to his God, so that when night came he continued still in the
same search. God had hidden his face from his servant, therefore the
first care of the troubled saint was to seek his Lord again. This was
going to the root of the matter and removing the main impediment first.
Diseases and tribulations are easily enough endured when God is found of
us, but without him they crush us to the earth. "My sore ran in the
night, and ceased not." As by day so by night his trouble was on him and
his prayer continued. Some of us know what it is, both physically and
spiritually, to be compelled to use these words: no respite has been
afforded us by the silence of the night, our bed has been a rack to us,
our body has been in torment, and our spirit in anguish. It appears that
this sentence is wrongly translated, and should be, "my hand was
stretched out all night;" this shews that his prayer ceased not, but
with uplifted hand he continued to seek succour of his God. "My soul
refused to be comforted." He refused some comforts as too weak for his
case, others as untrue, others as unhallowed; but chiefly because of
distraction, he declined even those grounds of consolation which ought
to have been effectual with him. As a sick man turns away even from the
most nourishing food, so did he. It is impossible to comfort those who
refuse to be comforted. You may bring them to the waters of the promise,
but who shall make them drink if they will not do so? Many a daughter of
despondency has pushed aside the cup of gladness, and many a son of
sorrow has hugged his chains. There are times when we are suspicious of
good news, and are not to be persuaded into peace, though the happy
truth should be as plain before us as the King's highway.

[Psa 77:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#003)

"I remembered God, and was troubled." He who is the wellspring of
delight to faith became an object of dread to the Psalmist's distracted
heart. The justice, holiness, power, and truth of God have all a dark
side, and indeed all the attributes may be made to look black upon us if
our eye be evil; even the brightness of divine love blinds us, and fills
us with a horrible suspicion that we have neither part nor lot in it. He
is wretched indeed whose memories of The Ever Blessed prove distressing
to him; yet the best of men know the depth of this abyss. "I complained,
and my spirit was overwhelmed." He mused and mused but only sank the
deeper. His inward disquietudes did not fall asleep as soon as they were
expressed, but rather they returned upon him, and leaped over him like
raging billows of an angry sea. It was not his body alone which smarted,
but his noblest nature writhed in pain, his life itself seemed crushed
into the earth. It is in such a case that death is coveted as a relief,
for life becomes an intolerable burden. With no spirit left in us to
sustain our infirmity, our case becomes forlorn; like a man in a tangle
of briars who is stripped of his clothes, every hook of the thorns
becomes a lancet, and we bleed with ten thousand wounds. Alas, my God,
the writer of this exposition well knows what thy servant Asaph meant,
for his soul is familiar with the way of grief. Deep glens and lonely
caves of soul depressions, my spirit knows full well your awful glooms!
"Selah." Let the song go softly; this is no merry dance for the swift
feet of the daughters of music, pause ye awhile, and let sorrow take
breath between her sighs.

[Psalms 77:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 77:4</span></span>

4 Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak.

5 I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.

6 I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own
heart: and my spirit made diligent search.

7 Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more?

8 Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promise fail for evermore?

9 Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender
mercies? Selah.

[Psa 77:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#004)

"Thou holdest mine eyes waking." The fears which thy strokes excite in
me forbid my eyelids to fall, my eyes continue to watch as sentinels
forbidden to rest. Sleep is a great comforter, but it forsakes the
sorrowful, and then their sorrow deepens and eats into the soul. If God
holds the eyes waking, what anodyne shall give us rest? How much we owe
to him who giveth his beloved sleep! "I am so troubled that I cannot
speak." Great griefs are dumb. Deep streams brawl not among the pebbles
like the shallow brooklets which live on passing showers. Words fail the
man whose heart fails him. He had cried to God but he could not speak to
man, what a mercy it is that if we can do the first, we need not despair
though the second should be quite out of our power. Sleepless and
speechless Asaph was reduced to great extremities, and yet he rallied,
and even so shall we.

[Psa 77:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#005)

"I have considered the days old, the years of ancient times." If no good
was in the present, memory ransacked the past to find consolation. She
fain would borrow a light from the altars of yesterday to light the
gloom of to-day. It is our duty to search for comfort, and not in sullen
indolence yield to despair; in quiet contemplation topics may occur to
us which will prove the means of raising our spirits, and there is
scarcely any theme more likely to prove consolatory than that which
deals with the days of yore, the years of the olden time, when the
Lord's faithfulness was tried and proved by hosts of his people. Yet it
seems that even this consideration created depression rather than
delight in the good man's soul, for he contrasted his own mournful
condition with all that was bright in the venerable experiences of
ancient saints, and so complained the more. Ah, sad calamity of a
jaundiced mind to see nothing as it should be seen, but everything as
through a veil of mist.

[Psa 77:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#006)

"I call to remembrance my song in the night." At other times his spirit
had a song for the darkest hour, but now he could only recall the strain
as a departed memory. Where is the harp which once thrilled
sympathetically to the touch of these joyful fingers? My tongue, hast
thou forgotten to praise? Hast thou no skill except in mournful ditties?
Ah me, how sadly fallen am I! How lamentable that I who like the
nightingale could charm the night, am now fit comrade for the hooting
owl. "I commune with mine own heart." He did not cease from
introspection, for he was resolved to find the bottom of his sorrow, and
trace it to its fountain head. He made sure work of it by talking not
with his mind only, but his inmost heart; it was heart work with him. He
was no idler, no melancholy trifler; he was up and at it, resolutely
resolved that he would not tamely die of despair, but would fight for
his hope to the last moment of life. "And my spirit made diligent
search." He ransacked his experience, his memory, his intellect, his
whole nature, his entire self, either to find comfort or to discover the
reason why it was denied him. That man will not die by the hand of the
enemy who has enough force of soul remaining to struggle in this
fashion.

[Psa 77:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#007)

"Will the Lord cast off for ever?" This was one of the matters he
enquired into. He painfully knew that the Lord might leave his people
for a season, but his fear was that the time might be prolonged and have
no close; eagerly, therefore, he asked, will the Lord utterly and
finally reject those who are his own, and suffer them to be the objects
of his contemptuous reprobation, his everlasting cast-offs? This he was
persuaded could not be. No instance in the years of ancient times led
him to fear that such could be the case. "And will he be favourable no
more?" Favourable he had been; would that goodwill never again show
itself? Was the sun set never to rise again? Would spring never follow
the long and dreary winter? The questions are suggested by fear, but
they are also the cure of fear. It is a blessed thing to have grace
enough to look such questions in the face, for their answer is
self-evident and eminently fitted to cheer the heart.

[Psa 77:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#008)

"Is his mercy clean gone for ever?" If he has no love for his elect, has
he not still his mercy left? Has that dried up? Has he no pity for the
sorrowful? "Doth his promise Jail for evermore?" His word is pledged to
those who plead with him; is that become of none effect? Shall it be
said that from one generation to another the Lord's word has fallen to
the ground; whereas aforetime he kept his covenant to all generations of
them that fear him? It is a wise thing thus to put unbelief through the
catechism. Each one of the questions is a dart aimed at the very heart
of despair. Thus have we also in our days of darkness done battle for
life itself.

[Psa 77:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#009)

"Hath God forgotten to be gracious?" Has El, the Mighty One, become
great in everything but grace? Does he know how to afflict, but not how
to uphold? Can he forget anything? Above all, can he forget to exercise
that attribute which lies nearest to his essence, for he is love? "Hath
he in anger shut up his tender mercies?" Are the pipes of goodness
choked up so that love can no more flow through them? Do the bowels of
Jehovah no longer yearn towards his own beloved children? Thus with cord
after cord unbelief is smitten and driven out of the soul; it raises
questions and we will meet it with questions: it makes us think and act
ridiculously, and we will heap scorn upon it. The argument of this
passage assumes very much the form of a reductio ad absurdtlm. Strip it
naked, and mistrust is a monstrous piece of folly. "Selah." Here rest
awhile, for the battle of questions needs a lull.

[Psalms 77:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 77:10</span></span>

10 And I said, This is my infirmity: but I will remember the years of
the right hand of the most High.

11 I will remember the works of the Lord: surely I will remember thy
wonders of old.

12 I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings.

13 Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is so great a God as our
God?

14 Thou art the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy strength
among the people.

15 Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and
Joseph. Selah.

[Psa 77:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#010)

"And I said, This is my infirmity." He has won the day, he talks
reasonably now, and surveys the field with a cooler mind. He confesses
that unbelief is an infirmity, a weakness, a folly, a sin. He may also
be understood to mean, "this is my appointed sorrow," I will bear it
without complaint. When we perceive that our affliction is meted out by
the Lord, and is the ordained portion of our cup, we become reconciled
to it, and no longer rebel against the: inevitable. Why should we not be
content if it be the Lord's will? What he arranges it is not for us to
cavil at. "But I will remember the years of the right hand of the most
High." Here a good deal is supplied by our translators, and they make
the sense to be that the Psalmist would console himself by remembering
the goodness of God to himself and others of his people in times gone
by: but the original seems to consist only of the words, "the years of
the right hand of the most High," and to express the idea that his long
continued affliction, reaching through several years, was allotted to
him by the Sovereign Lord of all. 'Tis well when a consideration of the
divine goodness and greatness silences all complaining, and creates a
childlike acquiescence.

[Psa 77:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#011)

"I will remember the works of the Lord." Fly back, my soul, away from
present turmoils, to the grandeurs of history, the sublime deeds of
Jehovah, the Lord of Hosts; for he is the same and is ready even now to
defend his servants as in the days of yore. "Surely I will remember thy
wonders of old." Whatever else may glide into oblivion, the marvellous
works of the Lord in the ancient days must not be suffered to be
forgotten. Memory is a fit handmaid for faith. When faith has its seven
years of famine, memory like Joseph in Egypt opens her granaries.

[Psa 77:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#012)

"I will meditate also of all thy work." Sweet work to enter into
Jehovah's work of grace, and there to lie down and ruminate, every
thought being absorbed in the one precious subject. "And talk of thy
doings." It is well that the overflow of the mouth should indicate the
good matter which fills the heart. Meditation makes rich talking; it is
to be lamented that so much of the conversation of professors is utterly
barren, because they take no time for contemplation. A meditative man
should be a talker, otherwise he is a mental miser, a mill which grinds
corn only for the miller. The subject of our meditation should be
choice, and then our talk will be edifying; if we meditate on folly and
affect to speak wisdom, our double-mindedness will soon be known unto
all men. Holy talk following upon meditation has a consoling power in it
for ourselves as well as for those who listen, hence its value in the
connection in which we find it in this passage.

[Psa 77:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#013)

"Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary," or in holiness. In the holy place
we understand our God, and rest assured that all his ways are just and
right. When we cannot trace his way, because it is "in the sea," it is a
rich consolation that we can trust it, for it is in holiness. We must
have fellowship with holiness if we would understand "the ways of God to
man." He who would be wise must worship. The pure in heart shall see
God, and pure worship is the way to the philosophy of providence. "Who
is so great a God as our God?" In him the good and the great are
blended, He surpasses in both. None can for a moment be compared with
the mighty One of Israel.

[Psa 77:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#014)

"Thou art the God that doest wonders." Thou alone art Almighty. The
false gods are surrounded with the pretence of wonders, but thou really
workest them. It is thy peculiar prerogative to work marvels: it is no
new or strange thing with thee, it is according to thy wont and use.
Herein is renewed reason for holy confidence. It would be a great wonder
if we did not trust the wonder-working God. "Thou hast declared thy
strength among the people." Not only Israel, but Egypt, Bashan, Edom,
Philistia, and all the nations have seen Jehovah's power. It was no
secret in the olden time and to this day it is published abroad, God's
providence and grace are both full of displays of his power; he is in
the latter peculiarly conspicuous as "mighty to save." Who will not be
strong in faith when there is so strong an arm to lean upon? Shall our
trust be doubtful when his power is beyond all question? My soul see to
it that these considerations banish thy mistrust.

[Psa 77:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#015)

"Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and
Joseph." All Israel, the two tribes of Joseph as well as those which
sprang from the other sons of Jacob, were brought out of Egypt by a
display of divine power, which is here ascribed not to the hand but to
the arm of the Lord, because it was the fulness of his might. Ancient
believers were in the constant habit of referring to the wonders of the
Red Sea, and we also can unite with them, taking care to add the song of
the Lamb to that of Moses, the servant of God. The comfort derivable
from such a meditation is obvious and abundant, for he who brought up
his people from the house of bondage will continue to redeem and deliver
till we come into the promised rest. "Selah." Here we have another pause
preparatory to a final burst of song.

[Psalms 77:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 77:16</span></span>

16 The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid:
the depths also were troubled.

17 The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine arrows
also went abroad.

18 The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven: the lightnings lightened
the world: the earth trembled and shook.

19 Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy
footsteps are not known.

20 Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.

[Psa 77:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#016)

"The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid." As
if conscious of its Maker's presence, the sea was ready to flee from
before his face. The conception is highly poetical, the Psalmist has the
scene before his mind's eye, and describes it gloriously. The water saw
its God, but man refuses to discern him; it was afraid, but proud
sinners are rebellious and fear not the Lord. "The depths also were
troubled." To their heart the floods were made afraid. Quiet caves of
the sea, far down in the abyss, were moved with affright; and the lowest
channels were left bare, as the water rushed away from its place, in
terror of the God of Israel.

[Psa 77:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#017)

"The clouds poured out water." Obedient to the Lord, the lower region of
the atmosphere yielded its aid to overthrow the Egyptian host. The
cloudy chariots of heaven hurried forward to discharge their floods.
"The skies sent out a sound." From the loftier aerial regions thundered
the dread artillery of the Lord of Hosts. Peal on peal the skies sounded
over the heads of the routed enemies, confusing their minds and adding
to their horror. "Thine arrows also went abroad." Lightnings flew like
bolts from the bow of God. Swiftly, hither and thither, went the red
tongues of flame, on helm and shield they gleamed; anon with blue
bale-fires revealing the innermost caverns of the hungry sea Which
waited to swallow up the pride of Mizraim. Behold, how all the creatures
wait upon their God, and show themselves strong to overthrow his
enemies.

[Psa 77:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#018)

"The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven," or "in the whirlwind."
Rushing on with terrific swiftness and bearing all before it, the storm
was as a chariot driven furiously, and a voice was heard (even thy
voice, O Lord!) out of the fiery car, even as when a mighty man in
battle urges forward his charger, and shouts to it aloud. All heaven
resounded with the voice of the Lord. "The lightnings lightened the
world." The entire globe shone in the blaze of Jehovah's lightnings. No
need for other light amid the battle of that terrible night, every wave
gleamed in the fire-flashes, and the shore was lit up with the blaze.
How pale were men's faces in that hour, when all around the fire leaped
from sea to shore, from crag to hill, from mountain to star till the
whole universe was illuminated in honour of Jehovah's triumph, "The
earth trembled and shook." It quaked and quaked again. Sympathetic with
the sea, the solid shore forgot its quiescence and heaved in dread. How
dreadful art thou, O God, when thou comest forth in thy majesty to
humble thine arrogant adversaries.

[Psa 77:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#019)

"Thy way is in the sea." Far down in secret channels of the deep is thy
roadway; when thou wilt thou canst make a sea a highway for thy glorious
march. "And thy path in the great waters." There, where the billows
surge and swell, thou still dost walk; Lord of each crested wave. "And
thy footsteps are not known." None can follow thy tracks by foot or eye.
Thou art alone in thy glory, and thy ways are hidden from mortal ken.
Thy purposes thou wilt accomplish, but the means are often concealed,
yea, they need no concealing, they are in themselves too vast and
mysterious for human understanding. Glory be to thee, O Jehovah.

[Psa 77:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#020)

"Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron."
What a transition from tempest to peace, from wrath to love. Quietly as
a flock Israel was guided on, by human agency which veiled the excessive
glory of the divine presence. The smiter of Egypt was the shepherd of
Israel. He drove his foes before him, but went before his people. Heaven
and earth fought on his side against the sons of Ham, but they were
equally subservient to the interests of the sons of Jacob. Therefore,
with devout joy and full of consolation, we close this Psalm; the song
of one who forgot how to speak and yet learned to sing far more sweetly
than his fellows.
