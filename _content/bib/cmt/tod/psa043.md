### [Psalms Chapter 43](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 43:0</span></span>

Subject - On account of the similarity of the structure of this Psalm to
that of [Psa 42:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001), it has been
supposed to be a fragment wrongly separated from the preceding song; but
it is always dangerous to allow these theories of error in Holy
Scripture, and in this instance it would be very difficult to show just
cause for such an admission. Why should the Psalm have been broken? Its
similarity would have secured its unity had it ever been part and parcel
of the [Psa 42:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001). Is it not far
more likely that some in their fancied wisdom united them wrongly in the
few MSS in which they are found as one? We believe the fact is that the
style of the poetry was pleasant to the writer, and therefore in after
life he wrote this supplemental hymn after the same manner. As an
appendix it needed no title. David complains of his enemies, and asks
the privilege of communion with God as his surest deliverance from them.

Division - The Psalmist cries to God in prayer, [Psa
43:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#001). Promises praise in the
anticipation of an answer, [Psa 43:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#004),
and chides himself for his despondency, [Psa
43:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#005).

Explanatory Notes and Quaint Sayings

Whole Psalm

This Psalm is evidently a continuation or supplement to the preceding.
In some MSS of Kennicott and de Rossi's, they are united, and make one
Psalm. - George Phillips, B.D.

[Psa 43:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#001)

"Judge me, O God, and plead my cause," etc. - Believers may appeal to
God's justice, and plead God's righteousness. I. Touching suffering
wrongs of men. II. Touching sin in relation to God's wrath. I. Touching
suffering wrongs of men, believers may appeal upon these three grounds:
1. The injustice that men do to believers, is as well against God's just
nature, as against the believers' ease. So their appeals to God are
agreeable to God's enmity against injustice; therefore, his enmity
concurs with their appeals. [Rom 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#018).
2. Justice in men is according to God's nature, as well as for the
believer's welfare, and, therefore, the disposition and inclination of
God's nature concurs with their prayers for deliverance. [Psa
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#007); [Luk
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#006), [Luk
23:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#007). 3. Such wrong God who do wrong
his people ([Ch2 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#011); [Zac
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#008); [Act
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#004), [Act
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#005)); so that in deliverance God
vindicates himself as well as the believers. II. Touching sin in
relation to God's wrath, a true believer may plead God's justice or
righteousness on these three grounds: 1. Christ our Advocate or Attorney
so pleads. [Joh 17:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#024), etc. Now, the
client may plead the same as the advocate, seeing it is in relation to
the same party and the same issue. 2. Christ hath satisfied God's
justice, so that on Christ was laid all the sins of all believers. He
was "wounded" for them. Now, God cannot in justice punish twice;
therefore, seeing Christ was wounded, believers must be healed. [Isa
53:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#003). Believers have God's
righteousness imputed to them (2 Cor 5); therefore, God must deal with
believers as he will deal with his own righteousness.

Useful is this doctrine two ways. I. For terror to the enemies of
believers. How man prevailing cries to the justice of God are against
such enemies? 1. Their own sins cry. 2. Believers' injuries cry. 3.
Believers' prayers cry. 4. Christ's intercession cries over again their
prayers and desires ([Rev 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#009) compared
with [Rev 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#003)). II. The second use is
for comfort to believers, that as God's mercy is for them, so is his
justice to deliver them, not only from men, but from sin; and in and
through Christ they may humbly plead justice as against sinners, so
against sin; not only against the guilt but against the power, that
seeing Christ died, sin should not live. - Condensed from Nathanael
Homes, 1652.

[Psa 43:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#001)

"Ungodly.... deceitful.... unjust." There are ungodly men who, being
destitute of religious principle, will not scruple to injure us, when
they can thereby gratify their passions or advance their worldly
interests. There are deceitful men who will put on the garb of
friendship, and acquire our confidence and esteem, and then
treacherously cheat us out of our property, or our reputation, or our
peace. There are unjust men, who by fraud or by violence, would rob us
of our dearest rights and most valuable possessions, and not only reduce
our powers and opportunities of doing good, but even diminish our means
of comfortable subsistence. And there are oppressors, who taking
advantage of our weakness or dependence, and trampling alike on the
maxims of equity and humanity, may exact from us unreasonable services,
impose upon us heavy burdens and cruel restraints, and ply us with
insults, and harrassments, and deprivations, from which we can make no
escape, and for which we can find no redress. - Andrew Thomson, D.D., in
"Lectures on Portions of the Psalms," 1826.

[Psa 43:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#002)

"Thou art the God of my strength." The godly man hath from God a
threefold strength, namely: natural, providential, and spiritual. I.
Natural, [Act 17:28](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#028). This is twofold:
of body, of mind. Of robustness, hardness, and agility of body; of wit,
invention, and valour of mind. Now, these donations of corporal and
mental natural endowments are God's gifts. [Psa
18:43](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#043), [Psa
18:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#039).... II. Providential strength,
which is threefold: 1. God's donation of strengthening mercies, (1)
Corporal: wine to make glad, and bread to strengthen. [Psa
104:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#015). (2) Mental, common gifts; as
Paul had a singular gift of language and single life; Apollos of
elocution, argument, power of convincing. 2. Providential strength is
God's making way for his people to act and put forth their strength.
[Psa 78:50](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#050). 3. Providential strength
is God's concurrence with our lawful human acting. [Psa
18:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#029).

III\. The third sort of power is spiritual: God is the godly man's
spiritual power. [Jo1 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#014) : "I have
written unto you, young men, because ye are strong," namely, with
spiritual strength, for it follows, "The word of God abideth in you, and
ye have overcome the wicked one." This is the main strength of a godly
man; as that text hints, namely, young men are naturally strong, but St.
John takes no notice of that, but commends them for their spiritual
strength. This spiritual strength is from the word of the Spirit, and
from the Spirit of the word, that is, from the Spirit accompanying the
word. 1. From the word of the Spirit, the word of God. [Psa
119:50](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#050) : "This is my comfort in my
affliction: for thy word hath quickened me." To be "quickened," i.e.,
enlivened, is to be full of rigour and spirit and to act mightily, and
to "comfort" is, as the word signifies, to make strong; for when a man
is most cheerful with sobriety, he is most strong. St. John in that
place fore-quoted, saith the young men to whom he wrote were strong
because the word of God abode in them. For ([Pro
12:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#025)) "whereas sorrow in the heart of
man maketh it stoop" - makes it sickly, weak, drooping - "a good word
maketh it glad," cheerful, strong, vigorous. And so if the word of a
wise friend, how much more the word of God, with its many strengthening
promises? [Psa 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#002); [Psa
119:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#028). The word of God is the very
mind and will of God, and power of God, and with the word God created
the world, therefore, he that receives this word must needs receive a
great deal of strength. [Rom 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#016).

[Psa 43:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#002)

The Spirit of the word, the Holy Spirit that useth to accompany the word
to them that receive it. By his Spirit God is in a believer ([Co1
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#009); Eph 2); and this is the spirit of
strength and power. [Eph 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#016); [Ti2
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#007). As a powerful, active soul makes
a vigorous body, so the Spirit in the soul makes the soul powerful and
strong, being the soul of the soul of a believer. We read more than once
or twice in the Scriptures, that when believers did any eminent act, it
is said, the Spirit of the Lord came upon them, and they did so and so,
i.e., the Spirit of God in them did then put forth its power to make
them act powerfully. - Condensed from Nathanael.

[Psa 43:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#003)

"O send out thy light and thy truth." Possibly there may be an allusion
to the Urim and Thummim, as the symbol of light and truth. - J. J.
Stewart Perowne.

[Psa 43:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#003)

"Light and Truth." Delightful and all-comprehensive words. They contain
all the salvation and all the desire of a believing, confiding soul. But
it is only when thus combined - separated they are no longer a ground of
trust and joy. For what would favour avail without faithfulness? It
would be no more than the uncertain friendship of men, who smile today
and reproach tomorrow; who make large promises, but do not perform them.
Even the "light" which angels and glorified spirits enjoy in heaven
would be insufficient to banish all fear and to fill them with
satisfaction, were it not for their confidence in the "truth" of God.
How much more, then, must this be the case with erring, sinful mortals
on earth? When the humble spirit is bowed down under a sense of its
utter unworthiness and innumerable weaknesses and defilements, its
negligences, follies, and wanderings, what should save from despair but
the confidence that he who has been merciful will also be faithful; that
God is truth as well as light; that he hath said, "I will never leave
thee nor forsake thee;" that he "cannot lie," and that, therefore, "his
mercy endureth for ever"? On the other hand, truth without light,
faithfulness without grace, would be only the dreadful execution of
terrible but just denunciations on the transgressors of the holy law.
"In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die." Adam ate,
and in that day became the subject of sin and death. This was truth
executing judgment. But light arose around the darkness; beams of mercy
tempered the heavy cloud. The promise of the Great Deliverer was given;
then faithfulness was enlisted on the side of grace, and became engaged
for its bestowment; "mercy and truth met together; righteousness and
peace kissed each other." Since then, all humble and trusting souls have
beheld them united, and have made their union the ground of their
confidence and joy. - Henry March.

[Psa 43:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#003)

"Thy tabernacles." There were two tabernacles, one at Zion, where the
ark stood, and another at Gibeon. [Ch1
16:37](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#037), [Ch1
16:39](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#039). It is not to this fact that the
Psalmist alludes, however, but to the circumstance, in all probability
of the different parts of the tabernacle. There was, first the holiest
of all, then the sanctuary, and then the tabernacle of the convocation.
[Heb 9:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#001). - John Morison.

[Psa 43:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#004)

"Then will I go unto the altar of God." Let us remember that the
approach to God in the holy place is by means of the altar, whence
eternally ascendeth the fragrance and the preciousness of the one whole,
perfect burnt-offering, and where for ever and ever the divine holiness
resteth and feedeth with its pure fire with infinite satisfaction, with
inconceivable delight. Oh, what a holy, a divine, a wondrous place is
this "altar of God!" That altar now means all the value and everlasting
efficacy of the one offering of Christ unto God for us; and it is in the
full power and blessedness thereof that we draw nigh to God. To this
point, to this unspeakably blessed position, the light and the truth of
God will attract the child of God. Toward this altar all the rays of the
light of divine favour and grace, and of divine truth, and holiness,
have from eternity converged; and from this point they shine forth
toward and upon the soul and heart of the poor, far-off penitent,
attracting him to that altar where he may meet his God. Let us then come
to the altar of God; let us enter the cloud of holy incense that filleth
the tabernacle of the Most High; let us realise how perfectly God is
satisfied with that which Christ has done, with his obedience in dying
to meet the claims of divine justice on the sinner, and to complete the
perfect surrender of himself as our "exceeding joy," even the gladness
of our joy, the heart, essence, substance, and reality of our joy. -
John Offord, 1868.

[Psa 43:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#004)

"There will I go unto the altar of God." He would with cheerfulness run
and offer up the sacrifices of thanksgiving to his gracious deliverer;
he would take his own soul as the burnt-offering, and kindle and burn it
up with the fire of a vigorous love and raised affections terminating
upon God, the flames whereof should ascend to him alone..... "Unto God
my exceeding joy," or, as the Hebrew is more exactly translated, unto
God the gladness of his joy - that which gave a relish to every other
comfort, which was the soul and life of his pleasures, and could only
make them real and lasting; it was God who raised his joy to fulness of
satisfaction and contentment. - William Dunlop.

[Psa 43:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#004)

"Then will I go.... unto God." The expression of going to God implies
submission and friendship. I. Submission. I will go and pay my homage to
him, as my Sovereign; I will go and hear what he says; I will go and
receive his orders. II. Friendship. I will go and consult him, and
converse with him as a friend; and be thankful that, in such a
troublesome and ensnaring world, I have such a friend to advise with. 1.
I will go and tell him my griefs; how greatly I am distressed with some
particular disorder in my body, or with some disturbance in my family,
or with some disappointment in my worldly circumstances, or (which is
worse than all of them together) with a sad darkness in my soul. 2. I
will go and tell him my joys, for even in this vale of tears "my heart
is" sometimes "glad, and my glory rejoiceth." 3. I will go and tell him
of my sins. He knows them, indeed, already, but he shall hear them from
me. 4. I will go and tell him my fears; how greatly I am distressed at
times, when I perceive this or the other corruption so strong, which I
thought had received its death wound.... how I tremble when I have by my
folly provoked the Lord to leave me, for fear he will never return
again, etc. 5. I will go and tell him my hopes, for some hope I have
amidst all my discouragements..... I will go and tell him all this; I
will unbosom and unburthen my whole heart to him; and if my necessities
did not drive me to him, I should go to him from inclination. -
Condensed from Samuel Lavington.

[Psa 43:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#004)

"Unto God." Believers are not satisfied in the use of religious duties,
unless they arrive at God himself in those duties. We speak not here of
that arrival at God himself which is by and after all duties, to a
beatifical vision of God in glory, but we speak of that arrival at God
himself which is to be had in duties, while we are in the exercise of
duties; namely, to attain to God's special presence in them, in an
actual communion, communication and conversing with God, so that we are
spiritually sensible he is with us therein. I say God's special presence
and actual communion, to distinguish it from that ordinary habitual
presence and communion of God's being with a believer at all times. [Joh
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#016). - Nathanael Homes.

[Psa 43:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#004)

"My exceeding joy." The Psalmist might well call God his exceeding joy,
for it infinitely exceeds all other joy in its nature, degree, and
duration. - Samuel Lavington.

[Psa 43:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#004)

"My exceeding joy." As faith acquires more strength we come to think of
God and address him in more endearing terms. - J. P. Lange.

[Psa 43:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#004)

"Exceeding joy." This can be said of no other joy. All other beauties
have their boundaries, all other glories have their glooms. This is that
illimitable sea, God. - E. Paxton Hood.

[Psa 43:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#005)

"Why art thou cast down O my soul." He comes to his former remedy; he
had stilled his grief once before with the same meditation and
upbraiding of his own soul, and chiding himself; but he comes to it here
as a probatum est, as a tried remedy; he takes up his soul very short,
"Why art thou so cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted
within me?" You see how David's passions here are interlaced with
comforts, and his comforts with passions, till at last he gets the
victory of his own heart. Beloved, neither sin nor grief for sin, are
stilled and quieted at the first. You have some short-spirited
Christians, if all be not quiet at the first, all is lost with them; but
it is not so with a true Christian soul, with the best soul living. It
was not so with David when he was it, distemper; he checks himself, the
distemper was not yet stilled; he checks himself again, then the
distemper breaks out again; he checks himself again, and all little
enough to bring his soul to a holy, blessed, quiet, temper, to that
blessed tranquillity and rest that the soul should be in before it can
enjoy its own happiness, and enjoy sweet communion with God. As you see
in physic, perhaps one purge will not carry away the peccant humour,
then a second must be added; perhaps that will not do it, then there
must be a third; so when the soul hath been once checked, perhaps it
will not do, we must fall to it again, go to God again. And then it may
be there will be breaking out of the grief and malady again; we must to
it again, and never give over, that is the right temper of a Christian.
- Richard Sibbes.

[Psa 43:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#005)

"Hope in God." The more terrible the storm, the more necessary is the
anchor. [Heb 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#019). - William S.
Plumer.

[Psa 43:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#005)

"Hope in God." The complete and perfect state of God's children here is
not in re, but in spe: as Christ's kingdom is not of this world, so is
not our hope. The worldling's motto is, "a bird in the hand." Give me
today, say they, and take tomorrow whoso will. But the word of believers
is, spero meliora - my hopes are better than my present possessions. -
Elnathan Parr.

[Psa 43:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#005)

The varied conflicts of the soul afford occasion for the exercise of the
graces, and thus, through the divine wisdom and goodness, are made the
means of eventual good. - Henry March.

[Psalms 43:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 43:1</span></span>

1 Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation: O
deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.

2 For thou art the God of my strength: why dost thou cast me off? why go
I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?

3 O send out thy light and thy truth: let them lead me; let them bring
me unto thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacles.

[Psa 43:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#001)

"Judge me, O God." Others are unable to understand my motives, and
unwilling to give me a just verdict. My heart is clear as to its intent,
and therefore I bring my case before thee, content that thou wilt
impartially weigh my character, and right my wrongs. If thou wilt judge,
thy acceptance of my conduct will be enough for me; I can laugh at human
misrepresentation if my conscience knows that thou art on my side; thou
art the only one I care for; and besides, thy verdict will not sleep,
but thou wilt see practical justice done to thy slandered servant. "And
plead my cause against an ungodly nation." One such advocate as the Lord
will more than suffice to answer a nation of brawling accusers. When
people are ungodly no wonder that they are unjust: those who are not
true to God himself cannot be expected to deal rightly with his people.
Hating the King they will not love his subjects. Popular opinion weighs
with many, but divine opinion is far more weighty with the gracious few.
One good word from God outweighs ten thousand railing speeches of men.
He bears a brazen shield before him whose reliance in all things is upon
his God; the arrows of calumny fall harmlessly from such a buckler. "O
deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man." Deceit and injustice are
boon companions: he who fawns will not fear to slander. From two such
devils none can deliver us but God. His wisdom can outwit the craft of
the vilest serpent, and his power can overmatch the most raging lion.
Whether this was Doeg or Ahithophel is small matter, such double
distilled villains are plentiful, and the only way of dealing with them
is to refer the matter to the righteous Judge of all; if we try to fight
them with their own weapons, we shall suffer more serious injury from
ourselves than from them. O child of God, leave these thine enemies in
better hands, remembering that vengeance belongeth not to thee, but to
the Lord. Turn to him in prayer, crying, "O deliver me," and ere long
you shall publish abroad the remembrance of his salvation.

[Psa 43:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#002)

"For." - Here is argument, which is the very sinew of prayer. If we
reasoned more with the Lord we should have more victories in
supplication. "Thou art the God of my strength." All my strength belongs
to thee - I will not, therefore, use it on my own behalf against my
personal foes. All my strength comes from thee, I therefore seek help
from thee, who art able to bestow it. All my strength is in thee. I
leave therefore this task of combating my foes entirely in thy hands.
Faith which leaves such things alone is wise faith. Note the assurance
of David, "thou art," not I hope and trust so, but I know it is so; we
shall find confidence to be our consolation. "Why dost thou cast me
off?" Why am I treated as if thou didst loathe me? Am I become an
offence unto thee? There are many reasons why the Lord might cast us
off, but no reason shall prevail to make him do so. He hath not cast off
his people, though he for awhile treats them as cast-offs. Learn from
this question that it is well to enquire into dark providences, but we
must enquire of God, not of our own fears. He who is the author of a
mysterious trial can best expound it to us.

"Blind unbelief is sure to err,

And scan his work in vain;

God is his own interpreter,

And he will make it plain."

"Why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?" Why do I
wander hither and thither like a restless spirit? Why wear I the weeds
of sorrow on my body, and the lines of grief on my face? Oppression
makes a wise man mad; why, Lord, am I called to endure so much of it for
so long a time? Here again is a useful question, addressed to the right
quarter. The answer will often be because we are saints, and must be
made like our Head, and because such sorrow is chastening to the spirit,
and yieldeth comfortable fruit. We are not to cross-question the Lord in
peevishness, but we may ask of him in humility; God help us to observe
the distinction so as not to sin through stress of sorrow.

[Psa 43:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#003)

"O send out thy light and thy truth." The joy of thy presence and the
faithfulness of thy heart; let both of these be manifest to me. Reveal
my true character by thy light, and reward me according to thy truthful
promise. As the sun darts forth his beams, so does the Lord send forth
his favour and his faithfulness towards all his people; and as all
nature rejoices in the sunshine, even so the saints triumph in the
manifestation of the love and fidelity of their God, which, like the
golden sunbeam, lights up even the darkest surroundings with delightful
splendour. "Let them lead me." Be these my star to guide me to my rest.
Be these my Alpine guides to conduct me over mountains and precipices to
the abodes of grace. "Let them bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy
tabernacles." First in thy mercy bring me to thine earthly courts, and
end my weary exile, and then in due time admit me to thy celestial
palace above. We seek not light to sin by, nor truth to be exalted by
it, but that they may become our practical guides to the nearest
communion with God: only such light and truth as are sent us from God
will do this, common light is not strong enough to show the road to
heaven, nor will mere moral or physical truths assist to the holy hill;
but the light of the Holy Spirit, and the truth as it is in Jesus, these
are elevating, sanctifying, perfecting; and hence their virtue in
leading us to the glorious presence of God. It is beautiful to observe
how David's longing to be away from the oppression of man always leads
him to sigh more intensely for communion with God.

[Psalms 43:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 43:4</span></span>

4 Then will I go unto the altar of God, unto God my exceeding joy: yea,
upon the harp will I praise thee, O God my God.

5 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within
me? hope in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my
countenance, and my God.

[Psa 43:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#004)

"Then will I go unto the altar of God." If David might but be favoured
with such a deliverance as would permit his return, it would not be his
own house of heritage which would be his first resort, but to the altar
of God his willing feet should conduct him. His whole heart would go as
a sacrifice to the altar, he himself counting it his greatest happiness
to be permitted to lie as a burnt offering wholly dedicated to the Lord.
With what exultation should believers draw near unto Christ, who is the
antitype of the altar! clearer light should give greater intensity of
desire. "Unto God my exceeding joy." It was not the altar as such that
the Psalmist cared for, he was no believer in the heathenism of
ritualism: his soul desired spiritual fellowship, fellowship with God
himself in very deed. What are all the rites of worship unless the Lord
be in them; what, indeed, but empty shells and dry husks? Note the holy
rapture with which David regards his Lord! He is not his joy alone, but
his exceeding joy; not the fountain of joy, the giver of joy, or the
maintainer of joy, but that joy itself. The margin hath it, "The
gladness of my joy," i.e., the soul, the essence, the very bowels of my
joy. To draw near to God, who is such a joy to us, may well be the
object of our hungering and thirsting. "Yea, upon the harp will I praise
thee." His best music for his best love. When God fills us with joy we
ought ever to pour it out at his feet in praise, and all the skill and
talent we have should be laid under contribution to increase the divine
revenue of glory. "O God, my God." How he dwells upon the name which he
loves so well! He already harps on it as though his harp music had
begun. What sweeter sounds can music know than these four words? To have
God in possession, and to know it by faith, is the heart's heaven - a
fulness of bliss lies therein.

[Psa 43:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#005)

"Why art thou cast down, O my soul?" If God be thine, why this
dejection? If he uplifts thee, why art thou so near the ground? The dew
of love is falling, O withering heart, revive. "And why art thou
disquieted within me?" What cause is there to break the repose of thy
heart? Wherefore indulge unreasonable sorrows, which benefit no one,
fret thyself, and dishonour thy God? Why overburden thyself with
foregodings? "Hope in God," or "wait for God." There is need of
patience, but there is ground for hope. The Lord cannot but avenge his
own elect. The heavenly Father will not stand by and see his children
trampled on for ever; as surely as the sun is in the heavens, light must
arise for the people of God, though for awhile they may walk in
darkness. Why, then, should we not be encouraged, and lift up our head
with comfortable hope? "For I shall yet praise him." Times of complaint
will soon end, and seasons of praise will begin. Come, my heart, look
out of the window, borrow the telescopic glass, forecast a little, and
sweeten thy chamber with sprigs of the sweet herb of hope. "Who is the
health of my countenance, and my God." My God will clear the furrows
from my brow, and the tear marks from my cheek; therefore will I lift up
my head and smile in the face of the storm. The Psalm has a blessed
ending, such as we would fain imitate when death puts an end to our
mortal existence.
