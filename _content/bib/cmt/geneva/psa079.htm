<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#001">Psalms 79:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">psa 79:1</A></FONT></span></p>"A Psalm of Asaph." O God, (a) the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps. 
<p>
<p>(a) The people cry to God against the barbarous tyranny of the Babylonians who spoiled God's inheritance, polluted his temple, destroyed his religion, and murdered his people.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#002">Psalms 79:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">psa 79:2</A></FONT></span></p>The (b) dead bodies of thy servants have they given [to be] meat unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth. 
<p>
<p>(b) The prophets show to what extremities God sometimes allows his Church to fall to exercise their faith, before he sets his hand to deliver them.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#003">Psalms 79:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">psa 79:3</A></FONT></span></p>Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; and [there was] none to (c) bury [them]. 
<p>
<p>(c) Their friends and relatives did not dare to bury them for fear of the enemies.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#004">Psalms 79:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">psa 79:4</A></FONT></span></p>We are become a reproach to our (d) neighbours, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us. 
<p>
<p>(d) Of which some came from Abraham but were degenerate: and others were open enemies to your religion, but they both laughed at our miseries.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#005">Psalms 79:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">psa 79:5</A></FONT></span></p>How long, LORD? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy jealousy (e) burn like fire? 
<p>
<p>(e) Will you completely consume us for our sins, before you take us to mercy?  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#008">Psalms 79:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">psa 79:8</A></FONT></span></p>O remember not against us (f) former iniquities: let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low. 
<p>
<p>(f) Which we and our fathers have committed.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#009">Psalms 79:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">psa 79:9</A></FONT></span></p>Help us, O God of our (h) salvation, for the glory of thy name: and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name's sake. 
<p>
<p>(h) Seeing we have no other Saviour, neither can we help ourselves, and also by our salvation your Name will be praised: therefore O Lord, help us.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#011">Psalms 79:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">psa 79:11</A></FONT></span></p>Let the sighing of the (i) prisoner come before thee; according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou (k) those that are appointed to die; 
<p>
<p>(i) Who though in respect to God they were justly punished for their sins, yet in consideration of their cause were unjustly murdered. 
<p>
<p>(k) Who were captives among their enemies and could look for nothing but death.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#013">Psalms 79:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">psa 79:13</A></FONT></span></p>So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever: (l) we will shew forth thy praise to all generations. 
<p>
<p>(l) We ought to desire no benefit from God, but on this condition to praise his name, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#021">Isa 43:21</A>).
