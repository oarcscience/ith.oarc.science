<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#001">Proverbs 9:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">pro 9:1</A></FONT></span></p>Wisdom hath built her (a) house, she hath hewn out her (b) seven pillars: 
<p>
<p>(a) Christ has prepared him a Church. 
<p>
<p>(b) That is, many chief supports and principal parts of his Church, as were the patriarchs, prophets, apostles, pastors and teachers.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#002">Proverbs 9:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">pro 9:2</A></FONT></span></p>She hath killed her beasts; she hath mixed her wine; she hath also (c) furnished her table. 
<p>
<p>(c) He compares wisdom with great princes who keep open house for all who come.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#003">Proverbs 9:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">pro 9:3</A></FONT></span></p>She hath sent forth her (d) maidens: she crieth upon the highest places of the city, 
<p>
<p>(d) Meaning, true preachers, who are not infected with man's wisdom.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#004">Proverbs 9:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">pro 9:4</A></FONT></span></p>Whoever [is] (e) simple, let him turn in here: [as for] him that lacketh understanding, she saith to him, 
<p>
<p>(e) He who knows his own ignorance, and is void of malice.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#005">Proverbs 9:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">pro 9:5</A></FONT></span></p>Come, eat of my (f) bread, and drink of the wine [which] I have mixed. 
<p>
<p>(f) By meat and drink is meant the word of God, and the ministration of the sacraments, by which God nourishes his servants in his house which is the Church.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#007">Proverbs 9:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">pro 9:7</A></FONT></span></p>He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he that rebuketh a wicked [man getteth] himself a (g) blot. 
<p>
<p>(g) For the wicked will contemn him and labour to defame him.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#008">Proverbs 9:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">pro 9:8</A></FONT></span></p>Reprove not a (h) scorner, lest he shall hate thee: rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee. 
<p>
<p>(h) Meaning them who are incorrigible, which Christ calls dogs and swine: or he speaks this in comparison, not that the wicked should not be rebuked, but he shows their malice, and the small hope of the profit.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#010">Proverbs 9:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">pro 9:10</A></FONT></span></p>The fear of the LORD [is] the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the Holy One [is] (i) understanding. 
<p>
<p>(i) He shows what true understanding is, to know the will of God in his word which is meant by holy things.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#012">Proverbs 9:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">pro 9:12</A></FONT></span></p>If thou art wise, thou shalt be wise for (k) thyself: but [if] thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear [it]. 
<p>
<p>(k) You will have the chief profit and convenience of it.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#013">Proverbs 9:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">pro 9:13</A></FONT></span></p>A (l) foolish woman [is] clamorous: [she is] simple, and knoweth nothing. 
<p>
<p>(l) By the foolish woman, some understand the wicked preachers, who counterfeit the word of God: as appears in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#016">Pro 9:16</A>) which were the words of the true preachers as in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#004">Pro 9:4</A>) but their doctrine is as stolen waters: meaning that they are men's traditions, which are more pleasant to the flesh than the word of God, and therefore they themselves boast of it.
