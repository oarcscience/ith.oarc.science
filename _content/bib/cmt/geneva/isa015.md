### [Isaiah Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#001)

[Isaiah 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 15:1</span></span>

The (a) burden of Moab. Because in the night (b) Ar of Moab is laid
waste, \[and\] brought to silence; because in the night Kir of Moab is
laid waste, \[and\] brought to silence;

\(a\) See [Isa 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#001)

\(b\) The chief city by which the whole country was meant.

[Isaiah 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 15:2</span></span>

\(c\) He is gone up to Bajith, and to Dibon, the high places, to weep:
Moab shall wail over (d) Nebo, and over Medeba: on all (e) their heads
\[shall be\] baldness, \[and\] every beard shorn.

\(c\) The Moabites will flee to their idols for comfort but it will be
too late.

\(d\) Which were cites of Moab.

\(e\) For as in the west parts the people used to let their hair grow
long when they mourned, so in the East part they cut it off.

[Isaiah 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 15:5</span></span>

My (f) heart shall cry out for Moab; his fugitives \[shall flee\] to
Zoar, (g) an heifer of three years old: for they shall go up the ascent
of Luhith with weeping for in the way of Horonaim they (h) shall raise a
cry of destruction.

\(f\) The prophet speaks this in the person of the Moabites: or as one
who felt the great judgment of God that God would come on them.

\(g\) Meaning that it was a city that always lived in pleasure and never
felt sorrow.

\(h\) He describes the miserable dissipation and flight of the Moabites.

[Isaiah 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 15:7</span></span>

Therefore the abundance they have gained, and that which they have laid
up, shall they carry away to the (i) brook of the willows.

\(i\) To hide themselves and their goods there.

[Isaiah 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 15:9</span></span>

For the waters of Dimon shall be full (k) of blood: for I will bring
more upon Dimon, lions (l) upon him that escapeth of Moab, and upon the
remnant of the land.

\(k\) Of them who are slain.

\(l\) So that by no means would they escape the hand of God: thus will
God punish the enemies of his Church.
