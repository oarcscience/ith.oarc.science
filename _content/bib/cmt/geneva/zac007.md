### [Zechariah Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#001)

[Zechariah 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">zac 7:1</span></span>

And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, \[that\] the word
of the LORD came to Zechariah in the fourth \[day\] of the ninth month,
\[even\] in (a) Chisleu;

\(a\) Which contained part of November and part of December.

[Zechariah 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">zac 7:2</span></span>

When (b) they had sent to the house of God Sherezer and Regemmelech, and
their men, to pray before the LORD,

\(b\) That is, the rest of the people that yet remained in Chaldea, sent
to the Church at Jerusalem for the resolution of these questions,
because these feasts were consented upon by the agreement of the whole
Church, the one in the month that the temple was destroyed, and the
other when Gedaliah was slain; ([Jer
41:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#002)).

[Zechariah 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">zac 7:3</span></span>

\[And\] to speak to the priests who \[were\] in the house of the LORD of
hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I (c) weep in the fifth
month, (d) separating myself, as I have done these so many (e) years?

\(c\) By weeping and mourning are shown what exercises they used in
their fasting.

\(d\) That is, prepare myself with all devotion to his fast.

\(e\) Which had been since the time the temple was destroyed.

[Zechariah 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">zac 7:5</span></span>

Speak to all the people of the land, and to the (f) priests, saying,
When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh \[month\], even
those seventy years, did ye at all fast to me, (g) \[even\] to me?

\(f\) For there were both of the people, and of the priests, those who
doubted with regard to this controversy, besides those who as yet
remained in Chaldea, and argue about it, as of one of the chief points
of their religion.

\(g\) For they thought they had gained favour with God because of this
fast, which they invented by themselves: and though fasting of itself is
good, yet because they thought it a service toward God, and trusted in
it, it is here reproved.

[Zechariah 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">zac 7:6</span></span>

And when ye ate, and when ye drank, did ye not eat (h) \[for
yourselves\], and drink \[for yourselves\]?

\(h\) Did you not eat and drink for your own benefit and necessity, and
so likewise you abstained according to your own imaginings, and not
after the command and direction of my Law.

[Zechariah 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">zac 7:7</span></span>

\[Should ye\] not \[hear\] the words which the LORD (i) hath cried by
the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, and
her cities around her, when \[men\] inhabited the south and the plain?

\(i\) By this he condemns their hypocrisy, who thought by their fasting
to please God, and by such things as they invented, and in the meantime
would not serve him as he had commanded.

[Zechariah 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">zac 7:9</span></span>

Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, (k) Execute true judgment, and
show mercy and compassions every man to his brother:

\(k\) He shows that they did not fast with a sincere heart, but because
of hypocrisy, and that it was not done from a pure religion, because
they lacked these offices of charity which should have declared that
they were godly; ([Mat 23:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#023)).

[Zechariah 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">zac 7:11</span></span>

But they refused to hearken, and (l) withdrew the shoulder, and stopped
their ears, that they should not hear.

\(l\) And would not carry the Lord's burden, which was sweet and easy,
but would bear their own, which was heavy and grievous to the flesh,
thinking to gain merit by it: which metaphor is taken from oxen, which
shrink at the yoke; ([Neh 9:29](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#029)).

[Zechariah 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">zac 7:12</span></span>

Yea, they made their hearts \[as\] an adamant stone, lest they should
hear the law, and the words which the LORD of hosts hath sent in his (m)
spirit by the former prophets: therefore came a great wrath from the
LORD of hosts.

\(m\) Which declares that they did not only rebel against the Prophets,
but against the Spirit of God that spoke in them.

[Zechariah 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">zac 7:14</span></span>

But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they
knew not. Thus the land was desolate (n) after them, that no man passed
through nor returned: for they laid the pleasant land (o) desolate.

\(n\) That is, after they were taken captive.

\(o\) By their sins by which they provoked God's anger.
