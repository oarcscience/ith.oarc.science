<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#002">Jeremiah 21:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">jer 21:2</A></FONT></span></p>(a) Enquire, I pray thee, of the LORD for us; for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon maketh war against us; it may be that the LORD will deal with us according to all his wondrous works, that he may go up from us. 
<p>
<p>(a) Not that the king was touched with repentance of his sins and so sought God, as did Hezekiah when he sent for Isaiah, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#001">Kg2 19:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#002">Isa 37:2</A>) but because the prophet might pray to God to take this present plague away, as Pharaoh sought Moses (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#028">Exo 9:28</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#004">Jeremiah 21:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">jer 21:4</A></FONT></span></p>Thus saith the LORD God of Israel; Behold, I will (b) turn back the weapons of war that [are] in your hands, with which ye fight against the king of Babylon, and [against] the Chaldeans, who besiege you outside the walls, and I will assemble them into the midst of this city. 
<p>
<p>(b) That is, from your enemies to destroy yourselves.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#008">Jeremiah 21:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">jer 21:8</A></FONT></span></p>And to this people thou shalt say, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I set before you the (c) way of life, and the way of (d) death. 
<p>
<p>(c) By yielding yourselves to Nebuchadnezzar. 
<p>
<p>(d) By resisting him.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#009">Jeremiah 21:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">jer 21:9</A></FONT></span></p>He that abideth in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth out, and falleth to the Chaldeans that besiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be to him for a (e) prize. 
<p>
<p>(e) As a thing recovered from extreme danger, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#002">Jer 37:2</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#018">Jer 39:18</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer045.htm#005">Jer 45:5</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#012">Jeremiah 21:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">jer 21:12</A></FONT></span></p>O house of David, thus saith the LORD; Execute judgment (f) in the morning, and deliver [him that is] made desolate out of the hand of the oppressor, lest my fury go out like fire, and burn that none can quench [it], because of the evil of your doings. 
<p>
<p>(f) Be diligent to do justice.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#013">Jeremiah 21:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">jer 21:13</A></FONT></span></p>Behold, I [am] against thee, (g) O inhabitant of the valley, [and] rock of the plain, saith the LORD; who say, Who shall come down against us? or who shall enter into our habitations? 
<p>
<p>(g) Meaning, Jerusalem which was built part on the hill and part in the valley and was compassed about with mountains.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#014">Jeremiah 21:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">jer 21:14</A></FONT></span></p>But I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings, saith the LORD: and I will kindle a fire (h) in its forest, and it shall devour all things around it. 
<p>
<p>(h) That is, in the houses of it, which stood as thick as trees in the forest.
