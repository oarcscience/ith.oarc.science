### [Psalms Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#001)

[Psalms 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 3:1</span></span>

"A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son." LORD, how are
they (a) increased that trouble me! many \[are\] they that rise up
against me.

\(a\) This was a token of his stable faith, that for all his troubles he
turned to God.

[Psalms 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 3:2</span></span>

Many \[there be\] which say of my soul, \[There is\] no help for him in
God. (b) Selah.

\(b\) Selah here signifies a lifting up of the voice, to cause us to
consider the sentence as a thing of great importance.

[Psalms 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 3:6</span></span>

I will not be afraid of (c) ten thousands of people, that have set
\[themselves\] against me round about.

\(c\) When he considered the truth of God's promise, and tried the same,
his faith increased marvellously.

[Psalms 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 3:8</span></span>

\(d\) Salvation \[belongeth\] unto the LORD: thy blessing \[is\] upon
thy people. Selah.

\(d\) No matter how great or many the dangers may be, yet God always has
ways to deliver his.
