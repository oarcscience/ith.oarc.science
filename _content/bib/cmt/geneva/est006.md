### [Esther Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#001)

[Esther 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">est 6:3</span></span>

And the king said, What honour and dignity hath been done to Mordecai
(a) for this? Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him,
There is nothing done for him.

\(a\) For he thought it unworthy of his estate to receive a benefit and
not reward it.

[Esther 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">est 6:4</span></span>

And the king said, Who \[is\] in the court? Now Haman was come into the
outward court of the king's house, to speak unto the king to (b) hang
Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.

\(b\) Thus while the wicked imagine the destruction of others, they
themselves fall into the same pit.

[Esther 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">est 6:8</span></span>

Let the royal apparel be brought which the king \[useth\] to wear, and
the (c) horse that the king rideth upon, and the crown royal which is
set upon his head:

\(c\) Meaning by this that the king should make him next to himself as
Joseph was known to be next to Pharaoh in ([Gen
41:43](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#043)).

[Esther 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">est 6:13</span></span>

And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every \[thing\] that
had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife unto him,
If Mordecai \[be\] of the seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun
to fall, thou shalt not prevail against him, (d) but shalt surely fall
before him.

\(d\) Thus God sometimes puts in the mouth of the very wicked to speak
that thing which he has decreed shall come to pass.
