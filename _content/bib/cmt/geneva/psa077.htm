<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#001">Psalms 77:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">psa 77:1</A></FONT></span></p>"To the chief Musician, to Jeduthun, A Psalm of Asaph." I cried unto God with my (a) voice, [even] unto God with my voice; and he gave ear unto me. 
<p>
<p>(a) The prophet teaches us by his example to flee to God for help in our necessities.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#003">Psalms 77:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">psa 77:3</A></FONT></span></p>I remembered God, and was (b) troubled: I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah. 
<p>
<p>(b) He shows that we must patiently abide though God does not deliver us from our troubles at the first cry.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#004">Psalms 77:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">psa 77:4</A></FONT></span></p>Thou holdest mine eyes (c) waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak. 
<p>
<p>(c) Meaning that his sorrows were as watchmen that kept his eyes from sleeping.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#006">Psalms 77:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">psa 77:6</A></FONT></span></p>I call to remembrance my (d) song in the night: I commune with mine own heart: and my spirit made (e) diligent search. 
<p>
<p>(d) Of thanksgiving, which I was accustomed to sing in my prosperity. 
<p>
<p>(e) Both the reasons why I was chastened, and when my sorrows would end.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#008">Psalms 77:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">psa 77:8</A></FONT></span></p>Is his (f) mercy clean gone for ever? doth [his] promise fail for evermore? 
<p>
<p>(f) As if he would say, It is impossible: by which he exhorts himself to patience.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#010">Psalms 77:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">psa 77:10</A></FONT></span></p>And I said, This [is] my (g) infirmity: [but I will remember] the years of the right hand of the most High. 
<p>
<p>(g) Though I first doubted of my life, yet considering that God had his years, that is, change of times, and was accustomed also to lift up them whom he had beaten, I took heart again.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#013">Psalms 77:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">psa 77:13</A></FONT></span></p>Thy way, O God, [is] (h) in the sanctuary: who [is so] great a (i) God as [our] God? 
<p>
<p>(h) That is in heaven, to which we must ascend by faith, if we will know the ways of God. 
<p>
<p>(i) He condemns all who worship anything save the only true God, whose glory appears through the world.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#016">Psalms 77:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">psa 77:16</A></FONT></span></p>The (k) waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid: the depths also were troubled. 
<p>
<p>(k) He declares how the power of God was declared when he delivered the Israelites through the Red Sea.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#017">Psalms 77:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">psa 77:17</A></FONT></span></p>The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a (l) sound: thine arrows also went abroad. 
<p>
<p>(l) That is, thundered and lightninged.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#019">Psalms 77:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">psa 77:19</A></FONT></span></p>Thy way [is] in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not (m) known. 
<p>
<p>(m) For when you had brought over your people, the water returned to her course, and the enemies who thought to have followed them, could not pass through, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#028">Exo 14:28-29</A>).
