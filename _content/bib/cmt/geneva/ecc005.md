### [Ecclesiastes Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#001)

[Ecclesiastes 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ecc 5:1</span></span>

Keep thy (m) foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more ready
to hear, than to give the sacrifice of (n) fools: for they consider not
that they do evil.

\(m\) That is, with what affection you come to hear the word of God.

\(n\) Meaning, of the wicked, who think to please God with common uses,
and have neither faith nor repentance.

[Ecclesiastes 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ecc 5:2</span></span>

Be not (a) rash with thy mouth, and let not thy heart be hasty to utter
\[any\] thing before God: for God \[is\] in heaven, and thou upon earth:
therefore let thy words be (b) few.

\(a\) Either in vowing or in praying, meaning, that we should use all
reverence toward God.

\(b\) He hears you not for the sake of your many words or often
repetitions, but considers your faith and servant's mind.

[Ecclesiastes 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ecc 5:4</span></span>

When thou vowest a vow to God, defer not to pay it; for \[he hath\] no
pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast (c) vowed.

\(c\) He speaks of vows which are approved by God's word and serve to
his glory.

[Ecclesiastes 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ecc 5:6</span></span>

Allow not thy mouth to cause thy (d) flesh to sin; neither say thou
before the (e) angel, that it \[was\] an error: why should God be angry
at thy voice, and destroy the work of thy hands?

\(d\) Do not cause yourself to sin by vowing rashly as they do who make
a vow to live unmarried and such like.

\(e\) That is, before God's messenger when he will examine your doing,
as though your ignorance should be a just excuse.

[Ecclesiastes 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ecc 5:8</span></span>

If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of
judgment and justice in a province, wonder not at the matter: for \[he
that is\] (f) higher than the highest regardeth; and \[there are\]
higher than they.

\(f\) Meaning, that God will address these things, and therefore we must
depend on him.

[Ecclesiastes 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ecc 5:9</span></span>

Moreover the (g) profit of the earth is for all: the king (h)
\[himself\] is served by the field.

\(g\) The earth is to be preferred above all things which belong to this
life.

\(h\) Kings and princes cannot maintain their estate without tillage,
which commends the excellency of tillage.

[Ecclesiastes 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ecc 5:12</span></span>

The sleep of a labouring man \[is\] sweet, whether he eateth little or
much: but the (i) abundance of the rich will not allow him to sleep.

\(i\) That is, his great abundance of riches, or the surfeiting, which
comes by his great feeding.

[Ecclesiastes 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ecc 5:13</span></span>

There is a grievous evil \[which\] I have seen under the sun,
\[namely\], riches (k) kept for the owners of them to their hurt.

\(k\) When covetous men heap up riches, which turn to their destruction.

[Ecclesiastes 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ecc 5:14</span></span>

But those riches perish by evil labour: and he begetteth a son, and
\[there is\] nothing in his (l) hand.

\(l\) He does not enjoy his father's riches.

[Ecclesiastes 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ecc 5:16</span></span>

And this also \[is\] a grievous evil, \[that\] in all points as he came,
so shall he go: and what profit hath he that hath laboured for the (m)
wind?

\(m\) Meaning, in vain and without profit.

[Ecclesiastes 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ecc 5:17</span></span>

All his days also he eateth in (n) darkness, and \[he hath\] much sorrow
and wrath with his sickness.

\(n\) In affliction and grief of mind.

[Ecclesiastes 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ecc 5:18</span></span>

Behold \[that\] which I have seen: \[it is\] good and proper \[for one\]
to (o) eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he
taketh under the sun all the days of his life, which God giveth him: for
it \[is\] his portion.

\(o\) See [Ecc 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#022)

[Ecclesiastes 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ecc 5:20</span></span>

For he shall not much remember the days of his (p) life; because God
answereth \[him\] in the joy of his heart.

\(p\) He will take no great thought for the pains that he has endured in
times past.
