<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#001">Psalms 103:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">psa 103:1</A></FONT></span></p>"[A Psalm] of David." (a) Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, [bless] his holy name. 
<p>
<p>(a) He wakens his dulness to praise God, showing that both understanding and affections, mind and heart, are too little to set forth his praise.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#003">Psalms 103:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">psa 103:3</A></FONT></span></p>Who (b) forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases; 
<p>
<p>(b) That is, the beginning and chiefest of all benefits, remission of sin.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#004">Psalms 103:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">psa 103:4</A></FONT></span></p>Who redeemeth thy life from (c) destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies; 
<p>
<p>(c) For before we have remission of our sins, we are as dead men in the grave.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#005">Psalms 103:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">psa 103:5</A></FONT></span></p>Who satisfieth thy mouth with good [things; so that] thy (d) youth is renewed like the eagle's. 
<p>
<p>(d) As the eagle, when her beak overgrows, sucks blood and so is renewed in strength, even so God miraculously gives strength to his Church above all man's expectations.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#007">Psalms 103:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">psa 103:7</A></FONT></span></p>He made known his ways unto (e) Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel. 
<p>
<p>(e) As to his chief minister, and next to his people.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#009">Psalms 103:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">psa 103:9</A></FONT></span></p>He will not always (f) chide: neither will he keep [his anger] for ever. 
<p>
<p>(f) He shows first his severe judgment, but as soon as the sinner is humbled, he receives him to mercy.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#010">Psalms 103:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">psa 103:10</A></FONT></span></p>He hath not (g) dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities. 
<p>
<p>(g) Who have proved by continual experience that his mercy has always prevailed against our offences.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#012">Psalms 103:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">psa 103:12</A></FONT></span></p>As far as (h) the east is from the west, [so] far hath he removed our transgressions from us. 
<p>
<p>(h) As great as the world is, so full is it of signs of God's mercies toward his faithful when he has removed their sins.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#015">Psalms 103:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">psa 103:15</A></FONT></span></p>[As for] (i) man, his days [are] as grass: as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth. 
<p>
<p>(i) He declares that man has nothing in himself to move God to mercy, but only the confession of his infirmity and misery.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#017">Psalms 103:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">psa 103:17</A></FONT></span></p>But the mercy of the LORD [is] from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his (k) righteousness unto children's children; 
<p>
<p>(k) His just and faithful keeping of his promise.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#018">Psalms 103:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">psa 103:18</A></FONT></span></p>To such as keep his (l) covenant, and to those that remember his commandments to do them. 
<p>
<p>(l) To whom he gives grace to fear him, and to obey his word.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#020">Psalms 103:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">psa 103:20</A></FONT></span></p>Bless the LORD, ye (m) his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word. 
<p>
<p>(m) In that we, who naturally are slow to praise God, exhort the angels, who willingly do it, we stir up ourselves to consider our duty and wake from our sluggishness.
