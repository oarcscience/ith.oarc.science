<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#001">Hebrews 5:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">heb 5:1</A></FONT></span></p>For (1) every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things [pertaining] to God, (2) that he may offer both (a) gifts and (b) sacrifices for sins: 
<p>
<p>(1) The first part of the first comparison of Christ's high priesthood with Aaron's: Other high priests are taken from among men, and are called after the order of men. (2) The first part of the second comparison: Others though weak, are made high priests, to the end that feeling the same infirmity in themselves which is in all the rest of the people, they should in their own and the peoples name offer gifts and sacrifices, which are witnesses of common faith and repentance. 
<p>
<p>(a) Offering of things without life. 
<p>
<p>(b) Beasts which were killed, but especially in the sacrifices for sins and offences.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#002">Hebrews 5:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">heb 5:2</A></FONT></span></p>Who (c) can have compassion on the ignorant, and (d) on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is (e) compassed with infirmity. 
<p>
<p>(c) Fit and meet. 
<p>
<p>(d) On them that are sinful: for in the Hebrew tongue, under ignorance and error is every sin meant, even that sin that is voluntary. 
<p>
<p>(e) He carries with him a nature subject to the same inconveniences and vices.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#004">Hebrews 5:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">heb 5:4</A></FONT></span></p>(3) And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as [was] Aaron. 
<p>
<p>(3) The third comparison which is complete: The others are called by God and so was Christ, but in another order than Aaron. For Christ is called the Son, begotten by God and a Priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#006">Hebrews 5:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">heb 5:6</A></FONT></span></p>As he saith also in another [place], Thou [art] a priest for ever after the (f) order of Melchisedec. 
<p>
<p>(f) After the likeness or manner as it is later declared.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#007">Hebrews 5:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">heb 5:7</A></FONT></span></p>(4) Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to (h) save him from death, and was heard in that he feared; 
<p>
<p>(4) The other part of the second comparison: Christ being exceedingly afflicted and exceedingly merciful did not pray because of his sins, for he had none, but for his fear, and obtained his request, and offered himself for all who are his. 
<p>
<p>(h) To deliver him from death.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#008">Hebrews 5:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">heb 5:8</A></FONT></span></p>Though he were a Son, yet (i) learned he obedience by the things which he suffered; 
<p>
<p>(i) He learned in deed what it is to have a Father, whom a man must obey.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#009">Hebrews 5:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">heb 5:9</A></FONT></span></p>(5) And being made (k) perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him; 
<p>
<p>(5) The other part of the first comparison: Christ was consecrated by God the Father as the author of our salvation, and an High Priest for ever, and therefore he is a man, though nonetheless he is far above all men. 
<p>
<p>(k) See (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#010">Heb 2:10</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#011">Hebrews 5:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">heb 5:11</A></FONT></span></p>(6) Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing ye are dull of hearing. 
<p>
<p>(6) A digression until he comes to the beginning of the seventh chapter; (Hebrews 5:11-6:20): in which he partly holds the Hebrews in the diligent consideration of those things which he has said, and partly prepares them for the understanding of those things of which he will speak.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#012">Hebrews 5:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">heb 5:12</A></FONT></span></p>(7) For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which [be] the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat. 
<p>
<p>(7) An example of an apostolic exhortation.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#013">Hebrews 5:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">heb 5:13</A></FONT></span></p>For every one that useth milk [is] unskilful in the (l) word of righteousness: for he is a babe. 
<p>
<p>(l) In the word that teaches righteousness.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#014">Hebrews 5:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">heb 5:14</A></FONT></span></p>But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, [even] those who by reason of use have their (m) senses exercised to discern both good and evil. 
<p>
<p>(m) All their power by which they understand and judge.
