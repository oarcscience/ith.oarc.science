<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#001">Matthew 7:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">mat 7:1</A></FONT></span></p>Judge (1) not, that ye be not judged. 
<p>
<p>(1) We ought to find fault with one another, but we must beware we do not do it without cause, or to seem holier than others or because of hatred of others.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#006">Matthew 7:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">mat 7:6</A></FONT></span></p>(2) Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your (a) pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you. 
<p>
<p>(2) The stiff-necked and stubborn enemies of the gospel are unworthy to have it preached unto them. 
<p>
<p>(a) A pearl is known among the Greeks for its oriental brightness: and a pearl was in ancient times greatly valued by the Latins: for a pearl that Cleopatra had was valued at two hundred and fifty thousand crowns: and the word is now borrowed from that, to signify the most precious heavenly doctrine.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#007">Matthew 7:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">mat 7:7</A></FONT></span></p>(3) Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: 
<p>
<p>(3) Prayers are a sure refuge in all miseries.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#012">Matthew 7:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">mat 7:12</A></FONT></span></p>(4) Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the (b) law and the prophets. 
<p>
<p>(4) An explanation of the meaning of the second table. 
<p>
<p>(b) That is to say, The doctrine of the law and prophets.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#013">Matthew 7:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">mat 7:13</A></FONT></span></p>(5) Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide [is] the gate, and broad [is] the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: 
<p>
<p>(5) The example of life must not be taken from the multitude.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#014">Matthew 7:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">mat 7:14</A></FONT></span></p>Because (c) strait [is] the gate, and narrow [is] the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it. 
<p>
<p>(c) The way is straight and narrow: we must pass through this rough way and suffer, endure, be changed and so enter into life.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#015">Matthew 7:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">mat 7:15</A></FONT></span></p>(6) Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. 
<p>
<p>(6) False teachers must be taken heed of: and they are known by false doctrine and evil living.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#021">Matthew 7:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">mat 7:21</A></FONT></span></p>(7) Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. 
<p>
<p>(7) Even the best gifts that exist are nothing without godliness.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#022">Matthew 7:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">mat 7:22</A></FONT></span></p>Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy (d) name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many (e) wonderful works? 
<p>
<p>(d) By "name" here is meant mighty working power of God, which every man witnesses that calls upon him. 
<p>
<p>(e) Properly, powers: Now these excellent works which are done are called powers because of those things which they bring to pass, for by them we understand how mighty the power of God is.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#023">Matthew 7:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">mat 7:23</A></FONT></span></p>And then will I profess unto them, (f) I never knew you: depart from me, (g) ye that work iniquity. 
<p>
<p>(f) This is not of ignorance, but because he will cast them away. 
<p>
<p>(g) You that are given to all kinds of wickedness, and seem to make an art of sin.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#024">Matthew 7:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">mat 7:24</A></FONT></span></p>(8) Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock: 
<p>
<p>(8) True godliness rests only upon Christ, and therefore always remains invincible.
