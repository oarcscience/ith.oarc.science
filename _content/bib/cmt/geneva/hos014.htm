<p>
<p>(a) He exhorts them to repentance to avoid all these plagues, exhorting them to declare by words their obedience and repentance.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#002">Hosea 14:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">hos 14:2</A></FONT></span></p>Take with you words, and turn to the LORD: say unto him, (b) Take away all iniquity, and receive [us] graciously: so will we render the calves of our (c) lips. 
<p>
<p>(b) He shows them that they ought to confess their sins. 
<p>
<p>(c) Declaring that this is the true sacrifice that the faithful can offer, even thanks and praise; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#015">Heb 13:15</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#003">Hosea 14:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">hos 14:3</A></FONT></span></p>Asshur shall (d) not save us; we will not ride upon horses: neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, [Ye are] our gods: for in thee the fatherless findeth mercy. 
<p>
<p>(d) We will forsake all vain confidence and pride.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#004">Hosea 14:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">hos 14:4</A></FONT></span></p>(e) I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely: for mine anger is turned away from him.

<p>(e) He declares how ready God is to receive those that do repent.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#007">Hosea 14:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">hos 14:7</A></FONT></span></p>They that dwell under his (f) shadow shall return; they shall revive [as] the corn, and grow as the vine: the scent thereof [shall be] as the wine of Lebanon. 
<p>
<p>(f) Whoever unites themselves to this people will be blessed.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#008">Hosea 14:8</A></p>

<p>
<p>(g) God shows how prompt he is to hear his own when they repent, and to offer himself as a protection and safeguard for them, as a most sufficient fruit and benefit.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#009">Hosea 14:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">hos 14:9</A></FONT></span></p>Who [is] (h) wise, and he shall understand these [things]? prudent, and he shall know them? for the ways of the LORD [are] right, and the just shall walk in them: but the transgressors shall fall therein. 
<p>
<p>(h) Signifying that the true wisdom and knowledge consists in this, even to rest upon God.
