### [Nehemiah Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#001)

[Nehemiah 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">neh 10:8</span></span>

Maaziah, Bilgai, Shemaiah: these \[were\] (a) the priests.

\(a\) Who subscribed to keep the promise.

[Nehemiah 10:28](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">neh 10:28</span></span>

And the rest of the people, the priests, the Levites, the porters, the
singers, the (b) Nethinims, and all they that had (c) separated
themselves from the people of the lands unto the law of God, their
wives, their sons, and their daughters, every one having knowledge, and
having understanding;

\(b\) Read ([Ezr 2:43](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#043)).

\(c\) Who being idolaters forsook their wickedness and gave themselves
to serve God.

[Nehemiah 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">neh 10:29</span></span>

They (d) clave to their brethren, their nobles, and entered into a (e)
curse, and into an oath, to walk in God's law, which was given by Moses
the servant of God, and to observe and do all the commandments of the
LORD our Lord, and his judgments and his statutes;

\(d\) They made the oath in the name of the whole multitude.

\(e\) To which they gave themselves if they broke the law, ([Deu
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#015)).

[Nehemiah 10:31](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">neh 10:31</span></span>

And \[if\] the people of the land bring ware or any victuals on the
sabbath day to sell, (f) \[that\] we would not buy it of them on the
sabbath, or on the holy day: and \[that\] we would leave the seventh
year, and the exaction of every debt.

\(f\) Which nonetheless they broke soon after, ([Neh
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#015)).

[Nehemiah 10:33](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">neh 10:33</span></span>

For the (g) shewbread, and for the continual meat offering, and for the
continual burnt offering, of the sabbaths, of the new moons, for the set
feasts, and for the holy \[things\], and for the sin offerings to make
an atonement for Israel, and \[for\] all the work of the house of our
God.

\(g\) This states why they gave this third part of the shekel which was
beyond the half shekel that they were required to pay, ([Exo
30:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#013)).

[Nehemiah 10:36](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">neh 10:36</span></span>

Also the firstborn of our sons, and of our cattle, as \[it is\] (h)
written in the law, and the firstlings of our herds and of our flocks,
to bring to the house of our God, unto the priests that minister in the
house of our God:

\(h\) This rehearsal shows that there was no part or ceremony in the
Law, to which they did not bind themselves by covenant.

[Nehemiah 10:37](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">neh 10:37</span></span>

And \[that\] we should bring the firstfruits of our dough, and our
offerings, and the fruit of all manner of trees, of wine and of oil,
unto the priests, to the chambers of the house of our God; and the
tithes of our ground unto the Levites, that the same Levites might have
the tithes in all the cities of our (i) tillage.

\(i\) Wherever we laboured or worked, there the tithes were due to the
Lord both by the law, and according to the oath and covenant that we
made.

[Nehemiah 10:39](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">neh 10:39</span></span>

For the children of Israel and the children of Levi shall bring the
offering of the corn, of the new wine, and the oil, unto the chambers,
where \[are\] the vessels of the sanctuary, and the priests that
minister, and the porters, and the singers: and (k) we will not forsake
the house of our God.

\(k\) We will not leave it destitute of that which is needed for it.
