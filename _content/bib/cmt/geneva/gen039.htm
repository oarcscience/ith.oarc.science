<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#001">Genesis 39:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">gen 39:1</A></FONT></span></p>And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an (a) officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither. 
<p>
<p>(a) See (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#036">Gen 37:36</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#002">Genesis 39:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">gen 39:2</A></FONT></span></p>And the (b) LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian. 
<p>
<p>(b) The favour of God is the fountain of all prosperity.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#004">Genesis 39:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">gen 39:4</A></FONT></span></p>And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him (c) overseer over his house, and all [that] he had he put into his hand. 
<p>
<p>(c) Because God prospered him: and so he made religion serve his profit.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#005">Genesis 39:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">gen 39:5</A></FONT></span></p>And it came to pass from the time [that] he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD (d) blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house, and in the field. 
<p>
<p>(d) The wicked are blessed by the company of the godly.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#006">Genesis 39:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">gen 39:6</A></FONT></span></p>And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; (e) and he knew not ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was [a] goodly [person], and well favoured. 
<p>
<p>(e) For he was sure that everything would prosper: therefore he ate and drank and did not worry.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#007">Genesis 39:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">gen 39:7</A></FONT></span></p>And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, (f) Lie with me. 
<p>
<p>(f) In this word he declares the purpose she was working towards.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#009">Genesis 39:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">gen 39:9</A></FONT></span></p>[There is] none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou [art] his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against (g) God? 
<p>
<p>(g) The fear of God preserved him against her continual temptations.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#014">Genesis 39:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">gen 39:14</A></FONT></span></p>That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I (h) cried with a loud voice: 
<p>
<p>(h) This declares that in which lack of restraint exists and to this is joined extreme impudency and deceit.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#020">Genesis 39:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">gen 39:20</A></FONT></span></p>And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the (i) prison, a place where the king's prisoners [were] bound: and he was there in the prison. 
<p>
<p>(i) His bad treatment in the prison may be gathered from (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#018">Psa 105:18</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#022">Genesis 39:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">gen 39:22</A></FONT></span></p>And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that [were] in the prison; and (k) whatsoever they did there, he was the doer [of it]. 
<p>
<p>(k) That is, nothing was done without his commandment.
