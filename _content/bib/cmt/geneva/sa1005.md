### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#001)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 5:1</span></span>

And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from Ebenezer
unto (a) Ashdod.

\(a\) Which was one of the five principal cities of the Philistines.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 5:2</span></span>

When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the house
of (b) Dagon, and set it by Dagon.

\(b\) Which was their chief idol, and as some write, from the navel
downward was like a fish, and upward like a man.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa1 5:5</span></span>

Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon's
house, (c) tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto this day.

\(c\) Thus instead of acknowledging the true God by this miracle, they
fall into greater superstition.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa1 5:8</span></span>

They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto
them, and said, (d) What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?
And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about
unto Gath. And they carried the ark of the God of Israel about
\[thither\].

\(d\) Though they had felt God's power and were afraid of it, yet they
tried him even further, which God turned to their destruction and his
glory.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa1 5:11</span></span>

So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and
said, Send (e) away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to
his own place, that it slay us not, and our people: for there was a
deadly destruction throughout all the city; the hand of God was very
heavy there.

\(e\) The wicked when they feel the hand of God, grudge and reject him,
where the godly humble themselves, and cry for mercy.
