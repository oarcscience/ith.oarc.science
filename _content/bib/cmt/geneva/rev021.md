### [Revelation Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#001)

[Revelation 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 21:1</span></span>

And (1) I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the
first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.

\(1\) Now follows the second part of the history prophetic of the future
estate of the Church in heaven after the last judgment, to ([Rev
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#002); [Rev
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#005)). In this are two things briefly
declared. The station, seat, or place of it, ([Rev
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#001)). Then her state and condition,
in the verses following. Before the state of the Church described, is
set down the state of the whole world, that there shall be a new heaven,
and a new earth; ([Isa 65:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#017); [Isa
66:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#022); [Pe2
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#013)) and this is the seat or place of
the Church, in which righteousness shall dwell.

[Revelation 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rev 21:2</span></span>

\(2\) And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God
out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.

\(2\) The state of this glorious Church is first described generally to
([Rev 21:3-8](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#003)), and then specially and
by parts, in the verses following. The general description consists in a
vision shown afar off, ([Rev 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#002)) and
in speech spoken from heaven. In the general these things are common,
that the Church is holy, new, the workmanship of God, heavenly, most
glorious, the spouse of Christ, and partaker of his glory in this verse.

[Revelation 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rev 21:3</span></span>

\(3\) And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the
tabernacle of God \[is\] with men, and he will dwell with them, and they
shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, \[and be\]
their God.

\(3\) The Church is described by the speech, first of an angel, in two
verses, then by God himself, in four verses. The angel's speech
describes the glory of the Church, by the most intimate communion with
God, by giving of all manner of good things according to the covenant,
in this verse: and by removing or putting away of all evil things, in
the verse following ([Rev 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#004)).

[Revelation 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rev 21:5</span></span>

\(4\) And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things
new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful.

\(4\) In the speech of God himself describing the Church, is first an
introduction, or entrance. Then follows a magnificent description of the
Church, by the present and future good things of the same, in three
verses following ([Rev 21:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#006)). In the
introduction God challenges to himself the restoring of all the
creatures, ([Rev 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#001)) and witnesses
the calling of John to the writing of these things, in this verse.

[Revelation 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rev 21:6</span></span>

And he said unto me, (5) It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning
and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the
water of life freely.

\(5\) The description of the Church is in three parts, by the abolishing
of old things, by the being of present things in God, that is, of things
eternal: and by the giving of all good things with the godly. If so be
they shall contend manfully; ([Rev
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#007)). But the reprobate are excluded
from there; ([Rev 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#008)).

[Revelation 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rev 21:8</span></span>

But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and
whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have
their (a) part in the lake which burneth with fire and

\(a\) Their lot, and inheritance as it were.

[Revelation 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rev 21:9</span></span>

\(6\) And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven
vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come
hither, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb's wife.

\(6\) A transition to the describing of the heavenly Church, by the
express calling of John in this verse, and his enrapturing by the
Spirit, in confirmation of the truth of God in the verse following.

[Revelation 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rev 21:10</span></span>

And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and (7) high mountain,
and shewed me (8) that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of
heaven from God,

\(7\) He means the place and stately seat of the Church, foreshadowed in
a mountain. (8) A type of that Church which is one, ample, or catholic,
holy celestial, built by God, in this verse: and glorious in the verse
following ([Rev 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#011)). This type
propounded generally, is particularly declared; ([Rev
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#012)).

[Revelation 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rev 21:12</span></span>

\(9\) And had a wall great and high, \[and\] had (10) twelve gates, and
at the gates (11) twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are
\[the names\] of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:

\(9\) A particular description of the celestial Church, first, by its
essential parts, compared to a city down to verse 22, ([Rev
21:12-22](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#012)). Secondly, from the outside,
to the end of the chapter ([Rev
21:23-27](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#023)). Thirdly, by the effects, in
the beginning of the next chapter, the essential parts are noted the
matter and the form in the whole work: of these the superstructure and
foundation of the wall are entire parts (as they use to be called) which
parts are first described in figure, to the 14th verse afterwards more
exactly.

\(10\) According to the number of the tribes. For here the outward part
is attributed to the Old Testament, and the foundation of the New
Testament.

\(11\) He means the prophets, who are the messengers of God, and
watchmen of the Church.

[Revelation 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rev 21:14</span></span>

And the wall of the city had (12) twelve foundations, and in them the
names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.

\(12\) That is, foundation stones, according to the number of the gates,
as is shown in ([Rev 21:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#019)).

[Revelation 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rev 21:15</span></span>

\(13\) And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city,
and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof.

\(13\) A transition to a more exquisite description of the parts of the
Church, by finding out its size, by the angel that measured them.

[Revelation 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rev 21:16</span></span>

\(14\) And the city lieth (b) foursquare, and the length is as large as
the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand
furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.

\(14\) The measure and form most equal, in two verses.

\(b\) A foursquare figure has equal sides, and outright corners, and
therefore the Greeks call by this name those things that are steady, and
of continuance and perfect.

[Revelation 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rev 21:17</span></span>

And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred \[and\] forty \[and\] four
cubits, \[according to\] the measure of a man, that is, of the (c)
angel.

\(c\) He adds this, because the angel had the shape of a man.

[Revelation 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rev 21:18</span></span>

\(15\) And the building of the wall of it was \[of\] jasper: and the
city \[was\] pure gold, like unto clear glass.

\(15\) The matter most precious and glittering, which the presence of
God makes most glorious.

[Revelation 21:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">rev 21:21</span></span>

And the twelve gates \[were\] twelve pearls; every several gate was of
one pearl: and the (d) street of the city \[was\] pure gold, as it were
transparent glass.

\(d\) By street, he means the broadest place of the city.

[Revelation 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">rev 21:23</span></span>

\(16\) And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to
shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb \[is\]
the light thereof.

\(16\) The second form of particular description (as I said) See [Rev
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#012) from exterior and outward
actions which are these, light from God himself, to this verse glory
from men, ([Rev 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#024)). Finally such
truth and incorruption of glory ([Rev
21:26](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#026)) as can bear and abide with it,
nothing that is inglorious, ([Rev
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#027)).
