### [Genesis Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#001)

[Genesis 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 7:1</span></span>

And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark;
for thee have I seen (a) righteous before me in this generation.

\(a\) In respect to the rest of the world, and because he had a desire
to serve God and live uprightly.

[Genesis 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 7:2</span></span>

Of every (b) clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and
his female: and of beasts that \[are\] not clean by two, the male and
his female.

\(b\) Which might be offered in sacrifice, of which six were for
breeding and the seventh for sacrifice.

[Genesis 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 7:9</span></span>

There (c) went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the
female, as God had commanded Noah.

\(c\) God compelled them to present themselves to Noah, as they did
before to Adam, when he gave them names, ([Gen
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#019)).

[Genesis 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gen 7:11</span></span>

In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the
seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the (e) fountains of
the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.

\(e\) Both the waters in the earth overflowed and also the clouds poured
down.

[Genesis 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gen 7:15</span></span>

And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two (f) of all flesh,
wherein \[is\] the breath of life.

\(f\) Every living thing that God would have be preserved on earth, came
into the ark to Noah.

[Genesis 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gen 7:16</span></span>

And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had
commanded him: and the LORD (g) shut him in.

\(g\) So that God's secret power defended him against the rage of the
mighty waters.

[Genesis 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">gen 7:23</span></span>

And every living substance was destroyed (h) which was upon the face of
the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl
of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only (i)
remained \[alive\], and they that \[were\] with him in the ark.

\(h\) That is, by God.

\(i\) Learn what it is to obey God only, and to forsake the multitude,
([Pe1 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#020)).
