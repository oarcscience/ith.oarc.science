### [Jeremiah Chapter 35](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 35:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 35:1</span></span>

The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the days (a) of
Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying,

\(a\) For the disposition and order of these prophecies. See [Jer
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 35:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 35:2</span></span>

Go to the house of the (b) Rechabites, and speak to them, and bring them
into the house of the LORD, into one of the chambers, and give them wine
to drink.

\(b\) They came from Hobab, Moses father-in-law, who was no Israelite,
but later joined with them in the service of God.

[Jeremiah 35:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 35:4</span></span>

And I brought them into the house of the LORD, into the chamber of the
sons of Hanan, the son of Igdaliah, a man (c) of God, who \[was\] by the
chamber of the princes, which \[was\] above the chamber of Maaseiah the
son of Shallum, the keeper of the door:

\(c\) That is, a prophet.

[Jeremiah 35:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 35:5</span></span>

And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots full of
wine, and cups, and I (d) said to them, Drink ye wine.

\(d\) The prophet says not. The Lord says thus, for then they ought to
have obeyed, but he tends to another end: that is, to declare their
obedience to man, seeing the Jews would not obey God himself.

[Jeremiah 35:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 35:6</span></span>

But they said, We will drink no wine: for (e) Jonadab the son of Rechab
our father commanded us, saying, Ye shall drink no wine, \[neither ye\],
nor your sons for ever:

\(e\) Whom the king of Israel favoured for his zeal, ([Kg2
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#015)).

\(f\) Teaching them by this to flee all opportunity for intemperancy,
ambition and greed and that they might know that they were strangers in
the earth, and be ready to depart at all opportunity.

[Jeremiah 35:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 35:10</span></span>

But we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to (g)
all that Jonadab our father commanded us.

\(g\) Which was now for the span of three hundred years from Jehu to
Jehoiakim.

[Jeremiah 35:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 35:11</span></span>

But it came to pass, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up into
the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the
army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians: so we
(h) dwell at Jerusalem.

\(h\) Which declares that they were not so bound to their vow that it
could not be broken for any need, for where they were commanded to dwell
in tents, they dwell now at Jerusalem for fear of the wars.

[Jeremiah 35:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 35:13</span></span>

Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Go and tell the men of
Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will (i) ye not receive
instruction to hearken to my words? saith the LORD.

\(i\) Whom I have chosen to be my children seeing these who were the
children of a heathen, obeyed the commandment of their father.

[Jeremiah 35:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 35:14</span></span>

The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his sons not
to drink wine, are performed; for to this day they drink none, but obey
their father's commandment: however I have spoken to you, (k) rising
early and speaking; but ye hearkened not to me.

\(k\) I have most diligently exhorted and warned you both by myself and
my prophet.

[Jeremiah 35:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 35:17</span></span>

Therefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I
will bring upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the
evil that I have pronounced against them: because I have (l) spoken to
them, but they have not heard; and I have called to them, but they have
not answered.

\(l\) That is, by his prophets and ministers which shows that it is as
much, as though he would speak to us himself when he sends his ministers
to speak in his Name.

[Jeremiah 35:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 35:19</span></span>

Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Jonadab the
son of Rechab shall (m) not lack a man to stand before me for ever.

\(m\) His posterity will continue and be in my favour for ever.
