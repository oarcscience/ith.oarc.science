<p>
<p>(a) Not taken from the altar, which was sent from heaven, and endured till the captivity of Babylon.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#003">Leviticus 10:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">lev 10:3</A></FONT></span></p>Then Moses said unto Aaron, This [is it] that the LORD spake, saying, I will be (b) sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace. 
<p>
<p>(b) I will punish them that serve me in other ways than I have commanded, not sparing the chief, that the people may fear and praise my judgments.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">lev 10:6</A></FONT></span></p>And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons, (c) Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die, and lest wrath come upon all the people: but let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the LORD hath (d) kindled. 
<p>
<p>(c) As though you lamented for them, preferring your carnal affection to God's just judgment; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#018">Lev 19:18</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#001">Deu 14:1</A>). 
<p>
<p>(d) In destroying Nadab and Abihu the chief, and menacing the rest, unless they repent.

<p>
<p>(e) For the breast and shoulders of the peace offerings might be brought to their families, so that their daughters might eat of them, as also of the offerings of first fruits, the first born, and the Easter lamb, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#012">Lev 22:12-13</A>).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">lev 10:16</A></FONT></span></p>And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and, behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron [which were] (f) left [alive], saying, 
<p>
<p>(f) And not consumed as Nadab and Abihu.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#019">Leviticus 10:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">lev 10:19</A></FONT></span></p>And Aaron said unto Moses, Behold, this day (g) have they offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD; and such things have befallen me: and [if] I had eaten the sin offering to day, should it have been accepted in the sight of the LORD? 
<p>
<p>(g) That is, Nadab and Abihu.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#020">Leviticus 10:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">lev 10:20</A></FONT></span></p>And when Moses heard [that], he was (h) content. 
<p>
<p>(h) Moses bore with his infirmity, considering his great sorrow, but does not leave an example to forgive them that maliciously transgress the commandment of God.
