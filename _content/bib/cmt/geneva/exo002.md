bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and (b) put the

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">exo 2:11</span></span>

And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was (d) grown, that he

7:23](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#023)).

And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that \[there was\]
no man, he (e) slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.

\(e\) Being assured that God had appointed him to deliver the
Israelites; ([Act 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#025)).

[Exodus 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#014)

And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou
to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses (f) feared, and
said, Surely this thing is known.

([Heb 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#027)).

good done to his.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">exo 2:23</span></span>

And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and
the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they (h)
cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.

\(h\) God humbles his by afflictions, that they should cry to him, and
receive the fruit of his promise.

[Exodus 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">exo 2:25</span></span>

And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had (i) respect unto
\[them\].

\(i\) He judges their causes or acknowledged them as his own.
