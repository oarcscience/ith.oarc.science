### [Judges Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#001)

[Judges 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 9:1</span></span>

And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his (a) mother's
brethren, and communed with them, and with all the family of the house
of his mother's father, saying,

\(a\) To practice with his kinsfolk for attaining the kingdom.

[Judges 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jdg 9:2</span></span>

Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem, Whether \[is\]
better for you, either that all the sons of Jerubbaal, \[which are\]
threescore and ten persons, reign over you, or that one reign over you?
remember also that I \[am\] your (b) bone and your flesh.

\(b\) Of your kindred by my mother's side.

[Judges 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jdg 9:5</span></span>

And he went unto his father's house at Ophrah, and (c) slew his brethren
the sons of Jerubbaal, \[being\] threescore and ten persons, upon one
stone: notwithstanding yet Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was
left; for he hid himself.

\(c\) Thus tyrants to establish their usurped power, spare not the
innocent blood, ([Kg2 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#007); [Ch2
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#004)).

[Judges 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jdg 9:6</span></span>

And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the house of (d)
Millo, and went, and made Abimelech king, by the plain of the pillar
that \[was\] in Shechem.

\(d\) Which was as the town house, or common hall, which he calls the
tower of Shechem in ([Jdg 9:49](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#049)).

[Judges 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jdg 9:8</span></span>

\(e\) The trees went forth \[on a time\] to anoint a king over them; and
they said unto the olive tree, Reign thou over us.

\(e\) By this parable he declares that those that are not ambitious, are
most worthy of honour and that the ambitious abuse their honour both to
their own destruction and others.

[Judges 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jdg 9:15</span></span>

And the bramble said unto the trees, If in truth ye anoint me king over
you, \[then\] come \[and\] put your trust in my shadow: and if not, let
(f) fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon.

\(f\) Abimelech will destroy the nobles of Shechem.

[Judges 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jdg 9:19</span></span>

If ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with Jerubbaal and with his
house this day, \[then\] (g) rejoice ye in Abimelech, and let him also
rejoice in you:

\(g\) That he is your king, and you his subjects.

[Judges 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jdg 9:23</span></span>

Then God (h) sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of
Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech:

\(h\) Because the people consented with the king in shedding innocent
blood, therefore God destroys both one and the other.

[Judges 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jdg 9:27</span></span>

And they (i) went out into the fields, and gathered their vineyards, and
trode \[the grapes\], and made merry, and went into the house of their
god, and did eat and drink, and cursed Abimelech.

\(i\) Before they were afraid of Abimelech's power, and did not dare go
out of the city.

[Judges 9:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jdg 9:29</span></span>

And would to God this people were under my hand! then would I remove
Abimelech. And he said to (k) Abimelech, Increase thine army, and come
out.

\(k\) Braggingly, as though he had been present, or to his captain
Zebul.

[Judges 9:36](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">jdg 9:36</span></span>

And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there come
people down from the top of the mountains. And Zebul said unto him, Thou
seest the (l) shadow of the mountains as \[if they were\] men.

\(l\) You are afraid of a shadow.

[Judges 9:39](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">jdg 9:39</span></span>

And Gaal (m) went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with
Abimelech.

\(m\) As their captain.

[Judges 9:43](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">jdg 9:43</span></span>

And he took the (n) people, and divided them into three companies, and
laid wait in the field, and looked, and, behold, the people \[were\]
come forth out of the city; and he rose up against them, and smote them.

\(n\) Which were in his company.

[Judges 9:45](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#045)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">jdg 9:45</span></span>

And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the
city, and slew the people that \[was\] therein, and beat down the city,
and sowed it with (o) salt.

\(o\) That it should be unfruitful and never serve to any use.

[Judges 9:46](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#046)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">jdg 9:46</span></span>

And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard \[that\], they
entered into an hold of the house of the god (p) Berith.

\(p\) That is, of Baniberith, as ([Jdg
8:33](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#033)).

[Judges 9:49](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#049)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">jdg 9:49</span></span>

And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed
Abimelech, and put \[them\] to the hold, and set the hold on fire upon
them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem (q) died also, about a
thousand men and women.

\(q\) Meaning, that all were destroyed as well as those in the tower.

[Judges 9:54](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#054)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">jdg 9:54</span></span>

Then he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer, and said
unto him, Draw thy sword, and slay me, that men say not of me, A woman
slew him. And his young man (r) thrust him through, and he died.

\(r\) Thus God by such miserable death takes vengeance on tyrants even
in this life.

[Judges 9:57](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#057)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_057">jdg 9:57</span></span>

And all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render upon their heads:
and upon them came the (f) curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.

\(f\) For making a tyrant their king.
