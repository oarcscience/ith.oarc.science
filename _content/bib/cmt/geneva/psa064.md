### [Psalms Chapter 64](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#001)

[Psalms 64:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 64:1</span></span>

"To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David." Hear my (a) voice, O God, in
my prayer: preserve my life from fear of the enemy.

\(a\) In that he calls to God with his voice, it is a sign that his
prayer was vehement, and that his life was in danger.

[Psalms 64:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 64:2</span></span>

Hide me from the (b) secret counsel of the wicked; from the (c)
insurrection of the workers of iniquity:

\(b\) That is, from their secret malice.

\(c\) That is, their outward violence.

[Psalms 64:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 64:3</span></span>

Who whet their tongue like a sword, \[and\] bend \[their bows to shoot\]
their arrows, \[even\] (d) bitter words:

\(d\) False reports and slanders.

[Psalms 64:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 64:4</span></span>

That they may shoot in secret at the perfect: suddenly do they shoot at
him, and (e) fear not.

\(e\) To be without fear of God and reverence of man, is a sign of
reprobation.

[Psalms 64:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 64:5</span></span>

They (f) encourage themselves \[in\] an evil matter: they commune of
laying snares privily; they say, Who shall see them?

\(f\) The more the wicked set God's children in misery, the more bold
and impudent are they in oppressing them.

[Psalms 64:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 64:6</span></span>

They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search: both the
inward \[thought\] of every one (g) \[of them\], and the heart, \[is\]
deep.

\(g\) There is no way so secret and subtle to do hurt, which they did
not invent for his destruction.

[Psalms 64:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 64:8</span></span>

So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves: all that
see them shall (h) flee away.

\(h\) To see God's heavy judgments against them, and how he has caught
them in their own snares.

[Psalms 64:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 64:10</span></span>

The righteous (i) shall be glad in the LORD, and shall trust in him; and
all the upright in heart shall glory.

\(i\) When they will consider that he will be favourable to them as he
was to his servant David.
