### [Psalms Chapter 98](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#001)

[Psalms 98:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 98:1</span></span>

"A Psalm." O sing (a) unto the LORD a new song; for he hath done
marvellous things: his right hand, and his holy (b) arm, hath gotten him
the victory.

\(a\) That is, some song newly made in token of their wonderful
deliverance by Christ.

\(b\) He preserves his Church miraculously.

[Psalms 98:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 98:2</span></span>

The LORD hath made known his (c) salvation: his righteousness hath he
openly shewed in the sight of the heathen.

\(c\) For the deliverance of his Church.

[Psalms 98:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 98:3</span></span>

He hath (d) remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of
Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.

\(d\) God was moved by no other means to gather his Church from the Jews
and Gentiles, but because he would perform his promise.

[Psalms 98:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 98:6</span></span>

With (e) trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before the
LORD, the King.

\(e\) By this repetition and earnest exhortation to give praise with
instruments, and also of the dumb creatures, he signifies that the world
is never able to praise God sufficiently for their deliverance.
