<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">psa 126:1</A></FONT></span></p>"A Song of degrees." When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that (a) dream. 
<p>
<p>(a) Their deliverance was incredible and therefore took away all excuse for ingratitude.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#002">Psalms 126:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">psa 126:2</A></FONT></span></p>Then was our mouth (b) filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the (c) heathen, The LORD hath done great things for them. 
<p>
<p>(b) He shows how the godly should rejoice when God gathers his Church or delivers it. 
<p>
<p>(c) If the infidels confess God's wonderful work, the faithful can never show themselves sufficiently thankful.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#004">Psalms 126:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">psa 126:4</A></FONT></span></p>Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the (d) streams in the south. 
<p>
<p>(d) It is no more impossible for God to deliver his people than to cause the rivers to run in the wilderness and barren places.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#006">Psalms 126:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">psa 126:6</A></FONT></span></p>He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing (e) precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves [with him]. 
<p>
<p>(e) That is, seed which was scarce and dear: meaning, that they who trusted in God's promise to return had their desire.
