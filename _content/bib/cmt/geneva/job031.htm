<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">job 31:1</A></FONT></span></p>I made a covenant with mine (a) eyes; why then should I think upon (b) a maid? 
<p>
<p>(a) I kept my eyes from all wanton looks. 
<p>
<p>(b) Would not God then have punished me?  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#003">Job 31:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">job 31:3</A></FONT></span></p>[Is] not destruction to the wicked? and a strange [punishment] to (c) the workers of iniquity? 
<p>
<p>(c) Job declares that the fear of God was a bridle to stay him from all wickedness.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#006">Job 31:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">job 31:6</A></FONT></span></p>Let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may know mine (d) integrity. 
<p>
<p>(d) He shows what his uprightness stands in, in as much as he was blameless before men and did not sin against the second table.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#007">Job 31:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">job 31:7</A></FONT></span></p>If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart (e) walked after mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands; 
<p>
<p>(e) That is, has accomplished the lust of my eyes.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#008">Job 31:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">job 31:8</A></FONT></span></p>[Then] let me sow, and let another (f) eat; yea, let my offspring be rooted out. 
<p>
<p>(f) According to the curse of the law, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#033">Deu 28:33</A>).

<p>(g) Let her be made a slave.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">job 31:12</A></FONT></span></p>For it [is] a fire [that] consumeth (h) to destruction, and would root out all mine increase. 
<p>
<p>(h) He shows that although man neglects the punishment of adultery, yet the wrath of God will never cease till such are destroyed.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#013">Job 31:13</A></p>

<p>(i) When they thought themselves evil intreated by me.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">job 31:14</A></FONT></span></p>What then shall I do when (k) God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him? 
<p>
<p>(k) If I had oppressed others, how would I have escaped God's judgment.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#015">Job 31:15</A></p>

<p>
<p>(l) He was moved to show pity to servants, because they were God's creatures as he was.

<p>(m) By long waiting for her request.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">job 31:21</A></FONT></span></p>If I have lifted (o) up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw my help in the gate: 
<p>
<p>(o) To oppress him and to do him harm.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#022">Job 31:22</A></p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">job 31:23</A></FONT></span></p>For destruction [from] God [was] a (q) terror to me, and by reason of his highness I could not endure. 
<p>
<p>(q) I did not refrain from sin for fear of men, but because I feared God.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#026">Job 31:26</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_026">job 31:26</A></FONT></span></p>If I beheld the (r) sun when it shined, or the moon walking [in] brightness; 
<p>
<p>(r) If I was proud of my worldly prosperity and happiness, which is meant by the shining of the sun, and brightness of the moon.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#027">Job 31:27</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_027">job 31:27</A></FONT></span></p>And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my (s) hand: 
<p>
<p>(s) If my own doings delighted me.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#028">Job 31:28</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_028">job 31:28</A></FONT></span></p>This also [were] an iniquity [to be punished by] the judge: for I should have denied the God [that is] (t) above. 
<p>
<p>(t) By putting confidence in anything but in him alone.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#031">Job 31:31</A></p>

<p>
<p>(u) My servants moved me to be avenged of my enemy, yet I never wished him harm.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#033">Job 31:33</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_033">job 31:33</A></FONT></span></p>If I covered (x) my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom:

<p>(x) Not confessed it freely, by which it is evident that he justified himself before men, and not before God.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#034">Job 31:34</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_034">job 31:34</A></FONT></span></p>Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families (y) terrify me, that I kept (z) silence, [and] went not out of the door? 
<p>
<p>(y) That is, I reverenced the most weak and contemned and was afraid to offend them. 
<p>
<p>(z) I suffered them to speak evil of me, and went not out of my house to avenge it.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#035">Job 31:35</A></p>

<p>
<p>(a) This is a sufficient token of my righteousness, that God is my witness and will justify my cause.

<p>
<p>(b) Should not this book of his accusations be a praise and commendation to me?  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#037">Job 31:37</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_037">job 31:37</A></FONT></span></p>I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a (c) prince would I go near unto him.

<p>(c) I will make him account of all my life, without fear.

<p>(d) As though I had withheld their wages that laboured in it.
