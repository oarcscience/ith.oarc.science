<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#002">Leviticus 4:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">lev 4:2</A></FONT></span></p>Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin through (a) ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD [concerning things] which ought not to be done, and shall do against any of them: 
<p>
<p>(a) That is, of negligence or ignorance, especially in the ceremonial law: for otherwise the punishment for a crime is determined according to the transgression, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#022">Num 15:22</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#003">Leviticus 4:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">lev 4:3</A></FONT></span></p>If (b) the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the people; then let him bring for his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemish unto the LORD for a sin offering. 
<p>
<p>(b) Meaning, the high priest.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#004">Leviticus 4:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">lev 4:4</A></FONT></span></p>And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD; and shall lay his hand upon the bullock's head, and (c) kill the bullock before the LORD. 
<p>
<p>(c) By this confessing that he deserved the same punishment which the beast suffered.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#006">Leviticus 4:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">lev 4:6</A></FONT></span></p>And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the LORD, before the vail of the (d) sanctuary. 
<p>
<p>(d) Which was between the holiest of holies and the sanctuary.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#007">Leviticus 4:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">lev 4:7</A></FONT></span></p>And the priest shall put [some] of the blood upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense before the LORD, which [is] in the (e) tabernacle of the congregation; and shall pour all the blood of the bullock at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which [is at] the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
<p>
<p>(e) Which was in the court: meaning by the tabernacle the sanctuary: and in the end of this verse it is taken for the court.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#013">Leviticus 4:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">lev 4:13</A></FONT></span></p>And if the (f) whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance, and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done [somewhat against] any of the commandments of the LORD [concerning things] which should not be done, and are guilty; 
<p>
<p>(f) The multitude does not excuse the sin, but if all have sinned, they must all be punished.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#015">Leviticus 4:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">lev 4:15</A></FONT></span></p>And the (g) elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock before the LORD: and the bullock shall be killed before the LORD. 
<p>
<p>(g) For all the people could not lay on their hands: therefore it was sufficient that the elders of the people did it in the name of all the congregation.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#024">Leviticus 4:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">lev 4:24</A></FONT></span></p>And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and kill it (h) in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the LORD: it [is] a sin offering. 
<p>
<p>(h) That is, the priest shall kill it; for it was not lawful for any out of that office to kill the beast.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#026">Leviticus 4:26</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_026">lev 4:26</A></FONT></span></p>And he shall burn all his fat upon the altar, as the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall make (i) an atonement for him as concerning his sin, and it shall be forgiven him. 
<p>
<p>(i) In which he represented Jesus Christ.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#029">Leviticus 4:29</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_029">lev 4:29</A></FONT></span></p>(k) And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and slay the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering. 
<p>
<p>(k) Read (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#024">Lev 4:24</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#033">Leviticus 4:33</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_033">lev 4:33</A></FONT></span></p>And he shall lay his (l) hand upon the head of the sin offering, and slay it for a sin offering in the place where they kill the burnt offering. 
<p>
<p>(l) Meaning that the punishment of his sin should be laid on the beast, or, that he had received all things from God, and offered this willingly.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#035">Leviticus 4:35</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_035">lev 4:35</A></FONT></span></p>And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat of the lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of the peace offerings; and the priest shall burn them upon the altar, (m) according to the offerings made by fire unto the LORD: and the priest shall make an atonement for his sin that he hath committed, and it shall be forgiven him. 
<p>
<p>(m) Or, besides the burnt offerings, which were daily offered to the Lord.
