### [Matthew Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#001)

[Matthew 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 22:1</span></span>

And (1) Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and said,

\(1\) Not all of the whole company of those that are called by the voice
of the gospel are the true Church before God: for the most part of them
would rather follow the conveniences of this life: and some persecute
very cruelly those that call them: but they are the true Church who obey
when they are called, such as for the most part are those whom the world
despises.

[Matthew 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mat 22:4</span></span>

Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden,
Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and \[my\] fatlings \[are\]
(a) killed, and all things \[are\] ready: come unto the marriage.

\(a\) The word used here is commonly used in sacrifices, and is by
translation used for other feasts also: For feasts and banquets usually
began with sacrifices.

[Matthew 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mat 22:7</span></span>

\(2\) But when the king heard \[thereof\], he was wroth: and he sent
forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their
city.

\(2\) A dreadful destruction of those that condemn Christ.

[Matthew 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mat 22:8</span></span>

Then saith he to his servants, The (b) wedding is ready, but they which
were bidden were not worthy.

\(b\) The marriage feast.

[Matthew 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 22:9</span></span>

\(3\) Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find,
bid to the marriage.

\(3\) God first calls us when we think nothing of it.

[Matthew 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mat 22:10</span></span>

So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all
as many as they found, both (c) bad and good: and the wedding was
furnished with guests.

\(c\) The general calling offers the gospel to all men: but those who
enter in have their life examined.

[Matthew 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mat 22:11</span></span>

\(4\) And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man
which had not on a wedding garment:

\(4\) In the small number which come at the calling, there are some
castaways who do not confirm their faith with newness of life.

[Matthew 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mat 22:12</span></span>

And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a
wedding garment? And he was (d) speechless.

\(d\) Literally, "haltered", that is to say, he held his peace, as
though he had a bridle or a halter around his neck.

[Matthew 22:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mat 22:13</span></span>

Then said the king to the (e) servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take
him away, and cast \[him\] into outer darkness; there shall be weeping
and gnashing of teeth.

\(e\) To those that served the guests.

[Matthew 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mat 22:15</span></span>

\(f\) Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle
him in \[his\] talk.

\(f\) Snare him in his words or talk. The Greek word is derived from
snares which hunters lay.

[Matthew 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mat 22:16</span></span>

And they sent out unto him their disciples with the (g) Herodians,
saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God
(h) in truth, neither carest thou for any \[man\]: for thou regardest
not the (i) person of men.

\(g\) Those who with Herod made a new religion, composed of both heathen
and Jewish religion.

\(h\) Truly and sincerely.

\(i\) You are not moved with any appearance and outward show.

[Matthew 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mat 22:17</span></span>

\(5\) Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give (k)
tribute unto Caesar, or not?

\(5\) The Christians must obey their magistrates, even though they are
wicked and extortioners, but only in as much as is in agreement with the
commandments of God, and only in as much as his honour is not
diminished.

\(k\) The word that is used here signifies a valuing and rating of men's
substance, according to the proportion of which they payed tribute in
those provinces which were subject to tribute, and it is here taken for
the tribute itself.

[Matthew 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mat 22:19</span></span>

Shew me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a (l) penny.

\(l\) Before ([Mat 17:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#024)) there is
mention made of a didrachma, and here of a penny, whereas a didrachma is
more by the seventh part then a penny: so that there seems to be an
inconsistency in these two places: but they may easily be reconciled in
this way: The penny was paid to the Romans for tribute, according to the
proportion they were rated at, and the drachma was payed by everyone to
the Temple, which also the Romans took to themselves when they had
subdued India.

[Matthew 22:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mat 22:23</span></span>

\(6\) The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is no
resurrection, and asked him,

\(6\) Christ affirms the resurrection of the flesh, as opposed to the
Sadducees.

[Matthew 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mat 22:24</span></span>

Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no (m) children, his
brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.

\(m\) Daughters are also included by this word "children", but even
though they were part of his family and bore his name, the man who had
only daughters was in the same position as the man who had no children
at all; this is because daughters were not at this time able to carry on
the family name. Therefore, by "children" here, we should understand it
to be referring to "sons".

[Matthew 22:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">mat 22:30</span></span>

For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage,
but are as the (n) angels of God in heaven.

\(n\) He does not say that they will be without bodies, for then they
would not be men any more; but, they will be as angels, for they will
neither marry nor be married.

[Matthew 22:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mat 22:34</span></span>

\(7\) But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to
silence, they were gathered together.

\(7\) The gospel does not abolish the precepts of the law, but rather it
confirms them.

[Matthew 22:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">mat 22:35</span></span>

Then (o) one of them, \[which was\] a lawyer, asked \[him a question\],
tempting him, and saying,

\(o\) A scribe, so it says in ([Mar
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#028)). To understand what a scribe
is, See [Mat 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#004)

[Matthew 22:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">mat 22:37</span></span>

Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
heart, and with all thy (p) soul, and with all thy mind.

\(p\) The Hebrew text in ([Deu 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#005))
reads, "with thine heart, soul, and strength"; and in ([Mar
12:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#030)) and ([Luk
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#027)) we read, "with soul, heart,
strength and thought."

[Matthew 22:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">mat 22:39</span></span>

And the second \[is\] like unto it, Thou shalt love thy (q) neighbour as
thyself.

\(q\) Another man.

[Matthew 22:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">mat 22:41</span></span>

\(8\) While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,

\(8\) Christ manifestly proves that he is David's son, according to the
flesh, but otherwise David's Lord, and very God.

[Matthew 22:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">mat 22:42</span></span>

Saying, What think ye of Christ? (r) whose son is he? They say unto him,
\[The Son\] of David.

\(r\) Of whose stock or family: for the Hebrews call a man's posterity
"sons".
