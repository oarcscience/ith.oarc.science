<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">lev 15:2</A></FONT></span></p>Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When any man hath a running issue out of his (a) flesh, [because of] his issue he [is] unclean. 
<p>
<p>(a) Whose seed either in sleeping or else of weakness of nature issues at his secret part.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#003">Leviticus 15:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">lev 15:3</A></FONT></span></p>And this shall be his uncleanness in his issue: whether his flesh run with his issue, or his flesh be stopped from his issue, it [is] (b) his uncleanness. 
<p>
<p>(b) Of the thing of which he shall be unclean.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#008">Leviticus 15:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">lev 15:8</A></FONT></span></p>And if he that hath the issue spit upon him that is clean; then (c) he shall wash his clothes, and bathe [himself] in water, and be unclean until the even. 
<p>
<p>(c) Of whom the unclean man did spit.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#009">Leviticus 15:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">lev 15:9</A></FONT></span></p>And what (d) saddle soever he rideth upon that hath the issue shall be unclean. 
<p>
<p>(d) The word signifies every thing on which a man rides.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#013">Leviticus 15:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">lev 15:13</A></FONT></span></p>And when he that hath an issue is (e) cleansed of his issue; then he shall number to himself seven days for his cleansing, and wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in running water, and shall be clean. 
<p>
<p>(e) That is, be restored to his old state, and be healed of it.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#016">Leviticus 15:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">lev 15:16</A></FONT></span></p>And if any man's seed of copulation go out from him, then he shall wash all his (f) flesh in water, and be unclean until the even. 
<p>
<p>(f) Meaning, all his body.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#020">Leviticus 15:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">lev 15:20</A></FONT></span></p>And every thing that she lieth upon in (g) her separation shall be unclean: every thing also that she sitteth upon shall be unclean. 
<p>
<p>(g) That is, when she has her period, by which she is separate from her husband, from the tabernacle and from touching any holy thing.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#024">Leviticus 15:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">lev 15:24</A></FONT></span></p>And if any man lie with her at all, and her flowers (h) be upon him, he shall be unclean seven days; and all the bed whereon he lieth shall be unclean. 
<p>
<p>(h) If any of her uncleanness touched him in the bed: for else the man that companied with such a woman should die, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#018">Lev 20:18</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#026">Leviticus 15:26</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_026">lev 15:26</A></FONT></span></p>Every bed whereon she lieth all the days of her issue shall be unto her as the (i) bed of her separation: and whatsoever she sitteth upon shall be unclean, as the uncleanness of her separation. 
<p>
<p>(i) Shall be unclean as the bed on which she lay when she had her natural disease.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#028">Leviticus 15:28</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_028">lev 15:28</A></FONT></span></p>But if she be cleansed of her issue, then she shall (k) number to herself seven days, and after that she shall be clean. 
<p>
<p>(k) After the time that she is recovered.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#031">Leviticus 15:31</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_031">lev 15:31</A></FONT></span></p>Thus shall ye (l) separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness; that they die not in their uncleanness, when they defile my tabernacle that [is] among them. 
<p>
<p>(l) Seeing that God required purity and cleanliness of his own: we cannot be his, unless our filth and sins are purged with the blood of Jesus Christ, and so we learn to detest all sin.
