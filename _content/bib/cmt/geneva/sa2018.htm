<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#001">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">sa2 18:1</A></FONT></span></p>And David (a) numbered the people that [were] with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them. 
<p>
<p>(a) For certain of the Reubenites, Gadites, and of the half tribe could not bear the insolence of the son against the father, and therefore joined with David. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#003">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">sa2 18:3</A></FONT></span></p>But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but (b) now [thou art] worth ten thousand of us: therefore now [it is] better that thou succour us out of the city. 
<p>
<p>(b) Signifying that a good governor is so dear to his people that they would rather lose their lives than have anything happen to him. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#006">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">sa2 18:6</A></FONT></span></p>So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the (c) wood of Ephraim; 
<p>
<p>(c) So called, because the Ephraimites (as some say) fed their cattle beyond Jordan in this wood. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#016">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">sa2 18:16</A></FONT></span></p>And Joab (d) blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the people. 
<p>
<p>(d) For he had pity on the people, who were seduced by Absalom's flattery. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#017">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">sa2 18:17</A></FONT></span></p>And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great (e) pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all Israel fled every one to his tent. 
<p>
<p>(e) Thus God turned his vain glory to shame. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#018">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">sa2 18:18</A></FONT></span></p>Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which [is] in the king's dale: for he said, I have no (f) son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day, Absalom's place. 
<p>
<p>(f) It seemed that God had punished him by taking away his children, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#027">Sa2 14:27</A>). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#020">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">sa2 18:20</A></FONT></span></p>And Joab said unto him, Thou (g) shalt not bear tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead. 
<p>
<p>(g) For Joab bore a good affection to Ahimaaz and doubted how David would take the report of Absalom's death. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#024">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">sa2 18:24</A></FONT></span></p>And David sat between the two (h) gates: and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone. 
<p>
<p>(h) He sat in the gate of the city of Mahanaim. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#027">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:27</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_027">sa2 18:27</A></FONT></span></p>And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He [is] a (i) good man, and cometh with good tidings. 
<p>
<p>(i) He had experienced his fidelity, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#021">Sa2 17:21</A>). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#029">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:29</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_029">sa2 18:29</A></FONT></span></p>And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king's (k) servant, and [me] thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what [it was]. 
<p>
<p>(k) That is, Cushi, who was an Ethiopian. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#033">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:33</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_033">sa2 18:33</A></FONT></span></p>And the king was much (l) moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son! 
<p>
<p>(l) Because he considers both the judgment of God against his sin, and could not otherwise hide his fatherly affection for his son.
