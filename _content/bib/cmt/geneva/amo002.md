### [Amos Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#001)

[Amos 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">amo 2:1</span></span>

Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Moab, and for four, I
will not turn away \[the punishment\] thereof; because he burned the (a)
bones of the king of Edom into lime:

\(a\) For the Moabites were so cruel against the King of Edom, that they
burnt his bones after he was dead: which declared their barbarous rage,
that they would avenge themselves upon the dead.

[Amos 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">amo 2:4</span></span>

Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Judah, and for four,
(b) I will not turn away \[the punishment\] thereof; because they have
despised the law of the LORD, and have not kept his commandments, and
their lies caused them to err, after the which their fathers have
walked:

\(b\) Seeing that the Gentiles who did have as much knowledge were
punished in this way, Judah which was so fully instructed by the Lord's
will, should not think that they would escape.

[Amos 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">amo 2:6</span></span>

Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of (c) Israel, and for
four, I will not turn away \[the punishment\] thereof; because they sold
the righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of (d) shoes;

\(c\) If he did not spare Judah unto whom his promises were made, much
more he will not spare this degenerate kingdom.

\(d\) They esteemed most vile bribes more than men's lives.

[Amos 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">amo 2:7</span></span>

That pant after the (e) dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and
turn aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father will go in unto
the \[same\] maid, to profane my holy name:

\(e\) When they have robbed him and thrown him to the ground, they open
wide their mouths for his life.

[Amos 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">amo 2:8</span></span>

And they lay \[themselves\] down upon clothes laid to pledge (f) by
every altar, and they (g) drink the wine of the condemned \[in\] the
house of their god.

\(f\) Thinking that by these ceremonies, that is, by sacrificing, and by
being near my altar, they may excuse all of their other wickedness.

\(g\) They rob others and offer it to God, thinking that he will exempt
them, when he is made partaker of their iniquity.

[Amos 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">amo 2:9</span></span>

Yet destroyed I the (h) Amorite before them, whose height \[was\] like
the height of the cedars, and he \[was\] strong as the oaks; yet I
destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.

\(h\) The destruction of their enemies and his mercy toward them, should
have caused their hearts to melt because of love toward him.

[Amos 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">amo 2:11</span></span>

And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of (i) your young men for
Nazarites. \[Is it\] not even thus, O ye children of Israel? saith the
LORD.

\(i\) You condemned my benefits, and abused my graces, and craftily went
about to stop the mouths of my Prophets.

[Amos 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">amo 2:13</span></span>

Behold, I am (k) pressed under you, as a cart is pressed \[that is\]
full of sheaves.

\(k\) You have wearied me with your sins; ([Isa
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#014)).

[Amos 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">amo 2:14</span></span>

Therefore the flight shall perish from the (l) swift, and the strong
shall not strengthen his force, neither shall the mighty deliver
himself:

\(l\) None will be delivered by any means.
