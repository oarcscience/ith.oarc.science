[Ezekiel 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 7:3</span></span>

Now \[is\] the end \[come\] upon thee, and I will send my anger upon
thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense
upon thee all (a) thy abominations.

\(a\) I will punish you as you have deserved for your idolatry.

[Ezekiel 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 7:6</span></span>

An end is come, the end is come: it (b) watcheth for thee; behold, it is
come.

\(b\) He shows that the judgments of God ever watch to destroy the
sinners, who notwithstanding he delays till there is no more hope of
repentance.

[Ezekiel 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 7:7</span></span>

The (c) morning is come upon thee, O thou that dwellest in the land: the
time is come, the day of trouble \[is\] near, and not the joyful (d)
shouting upon the mountains.

\(c\) The beginning of his punishments is already come.

\(d\) Which was a voice of joy and mirth.

[Ezekiel 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 7:10</span></span>

Behold the day, behold, it is come: the morning is gone forth; the (e)
rod hath blossomed, (f) pride hath budded.

\(e\) The scourge is ready.

\(f\) That is, the proud tyrant Nebuchadnezzar has gathered his force
and is ready.

[Ezekiel 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 7:11</span></span>

\(g\) Violence hath risen into a rod of wickedness: none of them \[shall
remain\], nor of their multitude, nor of any of theirs: neither \[shall
there be\] wailing for them.

\(g\) This cruel enemy will be a sharp scourge for their wickedness.

[Ezekiel 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 7:12</span></span>

The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer (i) rejoice,
nor the seller (k) mourn: for wrath \[is\] upon all its multitude.

\(i\) For the present profit.

\(k\) For he will lose nothing.

[Ezekiel 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 7:13</span></span>

For the seller shall not (l) return to that which is sold, although they
were yet alive: for the (m) vision \[is\] concerning its whole
multitude, \[which\] shall not return; (n) neither shall any strengthen
himself in the iniquity of his life.

\(l\) In the year of the Jubile, meaning that none would enjoy the
privilege of the law, ([Lev 25:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#013)) for
they would all be carried away captives.

\(m\) This vision signified that all would be carried away, and none
would return for the Jubile.

\(n\) No man for all this endeavours himself or takes heart to repent
for his evil life. Some read, for none will be strengthened in his
iniquity of his life: meaning that they would gain nothing by flattering
themselves in evil.

[Ezekiel 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 7:14</span></span>

\(o\) They have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but none
goeth to the battle: for my wrath \[is\] upon all its multitude.

\(o\) The Israelites made a brag, but their hearts failed them.

[Ezekiel 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 7:20</span></span>

As for the beauty of his (p) ornament, he set it in majesty: but they
made the images of their abominations \[and\] of their detestable things
in it: therefore have I set it far from them.

\(p\) Meaning, the sanctuary.

[Ezekiel 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eze 7:21</span></span>

And I will give it into the hands of the (q) strangers for a prey, and
to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall pollute it.

\(q\) That is, of the Babylonians.

[Ezekiel 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eze 7:22</span></span>

My face will I turn also from them, and they shall pollute my (r) secret
\[place\]: for the robbers shall enter into it, and defile it.

\(r\) Which signifies the most holy place, into which none might enter
but the high priest.

[Ezekiel 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eze 7:23</span></span>

Make a (s) chain: for the land is full of (t) bloody crimes, and the
city is full of violence.

\(s\) Signifying that they would be bound and led away captives.

their houses: I will also make the pomp of the strong to cease; and
their (u) holy places shall be defiled.
