<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">psa 48:1</A></FONT></span></p>"(a) A Song [and] Psalm for the sons of Korah." Great [is] the LORD, and greatly to be praised in the (b) city of our God, [in] the mountain of his holiness. 
<p>
<p>(a) Some put this difference between a song and psalm, saying that it is called a song when there is no instrument but the voice, and the song of the psalm is when the instruments begin and the voice follows. 
<p>
<p>(b) Even though God shows his wonders through all the world, yet he will be chiefly praised in his Church.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#002">Psalms 48:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">psa 48:2</A></FONT></span></p>Beautiful for situation, the (c) joy of the whole earth, [is] mount Zion, [on] the sides of the north, the city of the great King. 
<p>
<p>(c) Because the word of salvation came there to all who would believe.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#003">Psalms 48:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">psa 48:3</A></FONT></span></p>God is known in her palaces for a (d) refuge. 
<p>
<p>(d) Unless God is the defence of it, neither situation nor munition can prevail.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#004">Psalms 48:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">psa 48:4</A></FONT></span></p>For, lo, the kings were (e) assembled, they passed by together. 
<p>
<p>(e) They conspired and went against God's people.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#005">Psalms 48:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">psa 48:5</A></FONT></span></p>They saw [(f) it, and] so they marvelled; they were troubled, [and] hasted away. 
<p>
<p>(f) The enemies were afraid at the sight of the city.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#007">Psalms 48:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">psa 48:7</A></FONT></span></p>Thou breakest the ships (g) of Tarshish with an east wind. 
<p>
<p>(g) That is, of Cilicia or of the Mediterranean sea.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#008">Psalms 48:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">psa 48:8</A></FONT></span></p>As we have (h) heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever. Selah. 
<p>
<p>(h) That is, of our fathers: so have we proved: or God has performed his promise.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#010">Psalms 48:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">psa 48:10</A></FONT></span></p>According to thy name, O God, so [is] thy praise unto the ends of the (i) earth: thy right hand is full of righteousness. 
<p>
<p>(i) In all places where your Name will be heard of, men will praise you when they hear of your marvellous works.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#011">Psalms 48:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">psa 48:11</A></FONT></span></p>Let (k) mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be glad, because of thy judgments. 
<p>
<p>(k) Let Jerusalem and the cities of Judea rejoice, for your just judgments against your enemies.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#012">Psalms 48:12</A></p>

<p>
<p>(l) For in this outward defence and strength God's blessings also appeared, but the chief is to be referred to God's favour and secret defence, who never leaves his.
