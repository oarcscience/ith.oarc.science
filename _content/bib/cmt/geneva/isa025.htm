<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#001">Isaiah 25:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">isa 25:1</A></FONT></span></p>O LORD, thou (a) [art] my God; I will exalt thee, I will praise thy name; for thou hast done wonderful [things; thy] counsels of old [are] faithfulness [and] truth. 
<p>
<p>(a) Thus the prophet gives thanks to God because he will bring under subjection these nations by his corrections, and make them of his Church, who before were his enemies.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#002">Isaiah 25:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">isa 25:2</A></FONT></span></p>For thou hast made of a (b) city an heap; [of] a fortified city a ruin: a palace (c) of foreigners to be no city; it shall never be built. 
<p>
<p>(b) Not only of Jerusalem, but also of these other cities which have been your enemies. 
<p>
<p>(c) That is, a place where all vagabonds may live without danger and as it were at ease as in a palace.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#003">Isaiah 25:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">isa 25:3</A></FONT></span></p>Therefore shall the (d) strong people glorify thee, the city of the terrible nations shall fear thee. 
<p>
<p>(d) The arrogant and proud who before would not know you will by your corrections fear and glorify you.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#004">Isaiah 25:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">isa 25:4</A></FONT></span></p>For thou hast been a defence to the poor, a defence to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shade from the heat, when the blast (e) of the terrible ones [is] as a storm [against] the wall. 
<p>
<p>(e) The rage of the wicked is furious, till God breaks the force of it.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#005">Isaiah 25:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">isa 25:5</A></FONT></span></p>Thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers, as the (f) heat in a dry place; (g) [even] the heat with the shadow of a cloud: the branch of the terrible ones shall be brought low. 
<p>
<p>(f) Meaning, that as the heat is abated by the rain, so shall God bring down the rage of the wicked. 
<p>
<p>(g) As a cloud shades from the heat of the sun, so God will assuage the rejoicing of the wicked against the godly.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#006">Isaiah 25:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">isa 25:6</A></FONT></span></p>And on this (h) mountain shall the LORD of hosts make to all people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined. 
<p>
<p>(h) That is, in Zion, by which he means his Church, which would under Christ be assembled of the Jews and the Gentiles, and is here described under the figure of a costly banquet, as in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#002">Mat 22:2</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#007">Isaiah 25:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">isa 25:7</A></FONT></span></p>And he will destroy on this mountain (i) the face of the covering cast over all people, and the veil that is spread over all nations. 
<p>
<p>(i) Meaning, that ignorance and blindness, by which we are kept back from Christ.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#008">Isaiah 25:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">isa 25:8</A></FONT></span></p>He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will (k) wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he remove from all the earth: for the LORD hath spoken [it]. 
<p>
<p>(k) He will take away all opportunity for sorrow and fill his with perfect joy, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#017">Rev 7:17</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#004">Rev 21:4</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#010">Isaiah 25:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">isa 25:10</A></FONT></span></p>For on this mountain shall the hand of the LORD rest, and (l) Moab shall be trodden down under him, even as straw is trodden down for the (m) dunghill. 
<p>
<p>(l) By Moab are meant all the enemies of his Church. 
<p>
<p>(m) There were two cities by this name: one in Judah, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#081">Ch1 6:81</A>) and another in the land of Moab, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#002">Jer 48:2</A>) which seems to have been a plentiful place of corn, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#017">Isa 36:17</A>).
