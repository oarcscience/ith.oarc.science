### [Matthew Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#001)

[Matthew 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 4:1</span></span>

Then was (1) Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be
tempted of the devil.

\(1\) Christ is tempted in all manner of ways, and still overcomes, that
we also through his virtue may overcome.

[Matthew 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 4:2</span></span>

And when he had fasted (a) forty days and forty nights, he was afterward
an hungred.

\(a\) A full forty days.

[Matthew 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mat 4:5</span></span>

Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a
(b) pinnacle of the temple,

\(b\) The battlement which encompassed the flat roof of the Temple so
that no man might fall down: as was appointed by the law; ([Deu
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#008)).

[Matthew 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mat 4:7</span></span>

Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not (c) tempt the
Lord thy God.

\(c\) Literally, "Thou shalt not go on still in tempting."

[Matthew 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mat 4:12</span></span>

\(2\) Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he
departed into Galilee;

\(2\) When the Herald's mouth is stopped, the Lord reveals himself and
brings full light into the darkness of this world, preaching free
forgiveness of sins for those that repent.

[Matthew 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mat 4:13</span></span>

And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in (d) Capernaum, which is upon
the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:

\(d\) Which was a town a great deal more famous than Nazareth was.

[Matthew 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mat 4:15</span></span>

The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, \[by\] the way of the
(e) sea, beyond Jordan, (f) Galilee of the Gentiles;

\(e\) Of Tiberias, or because that country went toward Tyre, which
borders the eastern Mediterranean Sea.

\(f\) So called because it bordered upon Tyre and Sidon, and because
Solomon gave the king of Tyre twenty cities in that quarter; ([Kg1
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#011)).

[Matthew 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mat 4:17</span></span>

From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the
kingdom of heaven is at (g) hand.

\(g\) Is come to you.

[Matthew 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mat 4:18</span></span>

\(3\) And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon
called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for
they were fishers.

\(3\) Christ, thinking that he would eventually depart from us, even at
the beginning of his preaching gets himself disciples of a heavenly
sort, poor and unlearned, and therefore such as might be left as honest
witnesses of the truth of those things which they heard and saw.

[Matthew 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mat 4:23</span></span>

And (4) Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in (h) their (i)
synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the (k) kingdom, and healing (l)
all manner of sickness and all manner of (m) disease among the people.

\(4\) Christ assures the hearts of the believers of his spiritual and
saving virtue, by healing the diseases of the body.

\(h\) Their, that is, the Galilaeans.

\(i\) Synagogues, that is, the Churches of the Jews.

\(k\) Of the Messiah.

\(l\) Diseases of all kinds, but not every disease: that is, as we say,
some of every kind.

\(m\) The word properly signifies the weakness of the stomach: but here
it is taken for those diseases which make those that have them faint and
wear away.

[Matthew 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mat 4:24</span></span>

And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him all
sick people that were taken with divers diseases and (n) torments, and
those which were possessed with devils, and those which were (o)
lunatick, and those that had the (p) palsy; and he healed them.

\(n\) The word signifies properly the stone with which gold is tried:
and by a borrowed kind of speech, is applied to all kinds of
examinations by torture, when as by rough dealing and torments, we draw
out the truths from men who otherwise would not confess: in this place
it is taken for those diseases, which put sick men to great woe.

\(o\) Who at every full moon or the change of the moon, are troubled and
diseased.

\(p\) Weak and feeble men, who have the parts of their body loosed and
so weakened, that they are neither able to gather them up together, nor
do with them as they wish.
