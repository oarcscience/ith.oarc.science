### [Leviticus Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#001)

[Leviticus 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 1:1</span></span>

And the (a) LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the
tabernacle of the congregation, saying,

The Argument - As God daily by most singular benefits declared himself
mindful of his Church: he did not want them to have opportunity to trust
either in themselves, or to depend on others, either for lack of
physical things, or anything that belonged to his divine service and
religion. Therefore he ordained various kinds of duties and sacrifices,
to assure them of forgiveness for their offences (if they offered them
in true faith and obedience.) Also he appointed the priests and levites,
their apparel, offices, conversation and portion; he showed what feasts
they should observe, and when. Moreover, he declares by these sacrifices
and ceremonies that the reward of sin is death, and that without the
blood of Christ the innocent Lamb, there can be no forgiveness of sins.
Because they should not give priority to their own inventions (which God
detested, as appears by the terrible example of Nadab and Abihu) he
prescribed even to the least things, what they should do, what beasts
they should offer and eat, what diseases were contagious and to be
avoided, how they should purge all types of filthiness and pollution,
whose company they should flee, what marriages were lawful, and what
customs were profitable. After declaring these things, he promised
favour and blessing to those who keep his laws, and threatened his curse
to those who transgressed them.

\(a\) By this Moses declares that he taught nothing to the people but
that which he received from God.

[Leviticus 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lev 1:2</span></span>

Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man of you
bring an offering unto the LORD, ye shall bring your offering of the (b)
cattle, \[even\] of the herd, and of the flock.

\(b\) So they could offer of no other sort, but of those who were
commanded.

[Leviticus 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lev 1:3</span></span>

If his offering \[be\] a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a
male without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the
door of the (c) tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD.

\(c\) Meaning, within the court of the tabernacle.

[Leviticus 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">lev 1:5</span></span>

And (d) he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the priests,
Aaron's sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about
upon the (e) altar that \[is by\] the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation.

\(d\) A priest of the Levites.

\(e\) Of the burnt offering, ([Exo
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#001)).

[Leviticus 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">lev 1:9</span></span>

But his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water: and the priest
shall burn all on the altar, \[to be\] a burnt sacrifice, an offering
made by fire, of a sweet savour (f) unto the LORD.

\(f\) Or a savour of rest, which pacifies the anger of the Lord.

[Leviticus 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">lev 1:11</span></span>

\(g\) And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward (h) before
the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall sprinkle his blood round
about upon the altar.

\(g\) Read ([Lev 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#005)).

\(h\) Before the altar of the Lord.

[Leviticus 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">lev 1:15</span></span>

And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and (i) wring off his
head, and burn \[it\] on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be wrung
out at the side of the altar:

\(i\) The Hebrew word signifies to pinch off with the nail.

[Leviticus 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">lev 1:16</span></span>

And he shall pluck away his crop with his feathers, and cast it beside
the altar on the (k) east part, by the place of the ashes:

\(k\) On the side of the court gate in the pans which stood with ashes;
([Exo 27:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#003)).
