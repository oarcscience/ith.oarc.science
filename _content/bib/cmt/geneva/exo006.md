### [Exodus Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#001)

[Exodus 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">exo 6:3</span></span>

And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by \[the name
of\] God Almighty, but by my name (a) JEHOVAH was I not known to them.

\(a\) By which he signifies that he will perform indeed that which he
promised to their fathers: for this name declares that he is constant
and will perform his promise.

[Exodus 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">exo 6:7</span></span>

And I will (b) take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God:
and ye shall know that I \[am\] the LORD your God, which bringeth you
out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.

\(b\) He means, concerning the outward calling, the dignity of which
they lost later by their rebellion: but as for election to life
everlasting, it is unchangeable.

[Exodus 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">exo 6:9</span></span>

And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they

hearkened (c) not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel
bondage.

\(c\) So hard a thing it is to show true obedience under the cross.

[Exodus 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">exo 6:12</span></span>

And Moses spake before the LORD, saying, Behold, the children of Israel
have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who \[am\]
of (d) uncircumcised lips?

\(d\) Or barbarous and rude in speech and by this word

(uncircumcised) is signified the whole corruption of man's nature.

[Exodus 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">exo 6:14</span></span>

These \[be\] the heads (e) of their fathers' houses: The sons of Reuben
the firstborn of Israel; Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi: these
\[be\] the families of Reuben.

\(e\) This genealogy shows whom Moses and Aaron came from.

[Exodus 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">exo 6:16</span></span>

And these \[are\] the names of the sons of Levi according to their
generations; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari: and the years of the life
of Levi \[were\] an hundred (f) thirty and seven years.

\(f\) For he was 42 years old when he came into Egypt and lived there 94
years.

[Exodus 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">exo 6:20</span></span>

And Amram took him Jochebed his (g) father's sister to wife; and she
bare him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram \[were\] an
hundred and thirty and seven years.

\(g\) This type of marriage was later forbidden in the law; ([Lev
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#012)).

[Exodus 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">exo 6:21</span></span>

And the sons of Izhar; (h) Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri.

\(h\) Moses and he were cousins, whose rebellion was punished in ([Num
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#001)).

[Exodus 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">exo 6:23</span></span>

And Aaron took him Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of (i)
Naashon, to wife; and she bare him Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and
Ithamar.

\(i\) Who was a prince of Judah, ([Num
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#007)).

[Exodus 6:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">exo 6:26</span></span>

These \[are\] that Aaron and Moses, to whom the LORD said, Bring out the
children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their (k) armies.

\(k\) For their families were so great, that they might be compared to
armies.

[Exodus 6:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">exo 6:30</span></span>

And Moses said before the LORD, Behold, I \[am\] of (l) uncircumcised
lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me?

\(l\) The disobedience both of Moses and of the people, shows that their
deliverance came only from God's free mercy.
