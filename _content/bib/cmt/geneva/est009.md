### [Esther Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#001)

[Esther 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">est 9:1</span></span>

Now in the twelfth month, that \[is\], the month Adar, on the thirteenth
day of the same, when the king's commandment and his decree drew near to
be put in execution, in the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to
have power over them, (though it was (a) turned to the contrary, that
the Jews had rule over them that hated them;)

\(a\) This was by God's great providence, who turns the joy of the
wicked into sorrow, and the tears of the godly into gladness.

[Esther 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">est 9:3</span></span>

And all the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and the
deputies, and officers of the king, (b) helped the Jews; because the
fear of Mordecai fell upon them.

\(b\) Honoured them and befriended them.

[Esther 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">est 9:5</span></span>

Thus the Jews smote all their (c) enemies with the stroke of the sword,
and slaughter, and destruction, and did what they would unto those that
hated them.

\(c\) Who had conspired their death by the permission of the wicked
Haman.

[Esther 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">est 9:6</span></span>

And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed (d) five hundred
men.

\(d\) Besides the three hundred that they slew the second day, ([Est
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#015)).

[Esther 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">est 9:10</span></span>

The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews, slew
they; but (e) on the spoil laid they not their hand.

\(e\) By which they declared that this was God's just judgment on the
enemies of his Church as they fought not for their own gain, but to
execute his vengeance.

[Esther 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">est 9:13</span></span>

Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews
which \[are\] in Shushan to do to morrow also according (f) unto this
day's decree, and let Haman's ten sons be hanged upon the gallows.

\(f\) This she requires not out of a desire for vengeance but with zeal
to see God's judgment's executed against his enemies.

[Esther 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">est 9:16</span></span>

But the other Jews that \[were\] in the king's provinces gathered
themselves together, and stood for (g) their lives, and had rest from
their enemies, and slew of their (h) foes seventy and five thousand, but
they laid not their hands on the prey,

\(g\) Read ([Est 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#011)).

\(h\) Meaning, that they laid hands on no one that was not the enemy of
God.

[Esther 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">est 9:17</span></span>

On the (i) thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day
of the same rested they, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.

\(i\) Meaning, in all places saving Shushan.

[Esther 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">est 9:19</span></span>

Therefore the Jews of the villages, that dwelt in the unwalled towns,
(k) made the fourteenth day of the month Adar \[a day of\] gladness and
feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions one to another.

\(k\) As the Jews do even to this day, calling it in the Persian
language Purim, that is, the day of lots.

[Esther 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">est 9:20</span></span>

And Mordecai wrote (l) these things, and sent letters unto all the Jews
that \[were\] in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, \[both\] nigh
and far,

\(l\) The Jews gather from this that Mordecai wrote this book, but it
seems that he wrote only these letters and decrees that follow.

[Esther 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">est 9:22</span></span>

As the days wherein the Jews rested from their enemies, and the month
which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy, and from mourning into a
good day: that they should make them days of feasting and joy, and of
(m) sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor.

\(m\) He sets before our eyes the use of this feast which was for the
remembrance of God's deliverance, the maintenance of mutual friendship
and relief of the poor.

[Esther 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">est 9:24</span></span>

Because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the
Jews, had devised against the Jews to destroy them, and had (n) cast
Pur, that \[is\], the lot, to consume them, and to destroy them;

\(n\) Read ([Est 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#007)).

[Esther 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">est 9:25</span></span>

But when (o) \[Esther\] came before the king, he commanded by letters
that his wicked (p) device, which he devised against the Jews, should
return upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on
the gallows.

\(o\) That is, Esther.

\(p\) These are the words of the kings commandment to disannul Haman's
wicked enterprise.

[Esther 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">est 9:27</span></span>

The Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all
such as joined themselves unto them, so as it should not fail, that they
would keep these two (q) days according to their writing, and according
to their \[appointed\] time every year;

\(q\) Meaning, the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month of Adar.

[Esther 9:30](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">est 9:30</span></span>

And he sent the letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred twenty and
seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, \[with\] (r) words of peace
and truth,

\(r\) Which were letters declaring to them quietness and assurance and
putting them out of doubt and fear.

[Esther 9:31](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">est 9:31</span></span>

To confirm these days of Purim in their times \[appointed\], according
as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined them, and as they
had decreed for themselves and for their seed, the matters of the (s)
fastings and their cry.

\(s\) That they would observe this feast with fasting and earnest
prayer, which in Hebrew is signified by this word (they cry).
