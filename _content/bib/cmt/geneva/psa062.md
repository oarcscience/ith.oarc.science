### [Psalms Chapter 62](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#001)

[Psalms 62:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 62:1</span></span>

"To the chief Musician, to Jeduthun, A Psalm of David." Truly (a) my
soul waiteth upon God: from him \[cometh\] my salvation.

\(a\) Though Satan tempted him to murmur against God, yet he bridled his
affections, and resting on God's promise.

[Psalms 62:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 62:2</span></span>

\(b\) He only \[is\] my rock and my salvation; \[he is\] my defence; I
shall not be greatly moved.

\(b\) It appears by the often repetition of this word, that the prophet
endured many temptations by resting on God and by patience he overcame
them all.

[Psalms 62:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 62:3</span></span>

How long will ye imagine mischief against a (c) man? ye shall be slain
all of you: as a (d) bowing wall \[shall ye be, and as\] a tottering
fence.

\(c\) He means himself, being the man whom God had appointed to the
kingdom.

\(d\) Though you seem to be in honour, yet God will suddenly destroy
you.

[Psalms 62:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 62:5</span></span>

\(e\) My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation \[is\] from
him.

\(e\) David was greatly moved by these troubles, therefore he stirs up
himself to trust in God.

[Psalms 62:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 62:7</span></span>

In God \[is\] my salvation and my (f) glory: the rock of my strength,
\[and\] my refuge, \[is\] in God.

\(f\) These vehement and often repetitions were necessary to strengthen
his faith against the horrible assault of Satan.

[Psalms 62:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 62:8</span></span>

Trust in him at all times; \[ye\] people, (g) pour out your heart before
him: God \[is\] a refuge for us. Selah.

\(g\) He admonishes us of our wicked nature, which would rather hide our
sorrow and bite the bridle, than utter our grief to God to obtain
remedy.

[Psalms 62:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 62:10</span></span>

Trust not in oppression, and (h) become not vain in robbery: if riches
increase, set not your heart \[upon them\].

\(h\) Give yourselves wholly to God by putting away all things that are
contrary to his law.

[Psalms 62:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 62:11</span></span>

God hath spoken (i) once; twice have I heard this; that power
\[belongeth\] unto God.

\(i\) He has plainly born witness to his power, so that no one needs to
doubt it.

[Psalms 62:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 62:12</span></span>

Also unto thee, O Lord, \[belongeth\] mercy: for thou (k) renderest to
every man according to his work.

\(k\) So that the wicked will feel your power, and the godly your mercy.
