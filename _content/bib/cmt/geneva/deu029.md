### [Deuteronomy Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#001)

[Deuteronomy 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 29:1</span></span>

These \[are\] the (a) words of the covenant, which the LORD commanded
Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, beside
the covenant which he made with them in (b) Horeb.

\(a\) That is, the articles, or conditions.

\(b\) At the first giving of the law, which was forty years earlier.

[Deuteronomy 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 29:3</span></span>

The (c) great temptations which thine eyes have seen, the signs, and
those great miracles:

\(c\) The proofs of my power.

[Deuteronomy 29:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">deu 29:4</span></span>

Yet the LORD hath not (d) given you an heart to perceive, and eyes to
see, and ears to hear, unto this day.

\(d\) He shows that it is not in man's power to understand the mysteries
of God if it is not given to him from above.

[Deuteronomy 29:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">deu 29:6</span></span>

Ye have not eaten (e) bread, neither have ye drunk wine or strong drink:
that ye might know that I \[am\] the LORD your God.

\(e\) Made by man's art, but manna, which is called the bread of angels.

[Deuteronomy 29:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">deu 29:10</span></span>

Ye stand this day all of you before the LORD your (f) God; your captains
of your tribes, your elders, and your officers, \[with\] all the men of
Israel,

\(f\) Who knows your hearts, and therefore you may not think to conceal
from him.

[Deuteronomy 29:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">deu 29:12</span></span>

That thou shouldest (g) enter into covenant with the LORD thy God, and
into his oath, which the LORD thy God maketh with thee this day:

\(g\) Alluding to them, that when they made a sure covenant, divided a
beast in two, and past between the parts divided, ([Gen
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#010)).

[Deuteronomy 29:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">deu 29:15</span></span>

But with \[him\] that standeth here with us this day before the LORD our
God, and also with \[him\] (h) that \[is\] not here with us this day:

\(h\) Meaning, their posterity.

[Deuteronomy 29:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">deu 29:18</span></span>

Lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose
heart turneth away this day from the LORD our God, to go \[and\] serve
the gods of these nations; lest there should be among you (i) a root
that beareth gall and wormwood;

\(i\) Such sin, as the bitter fruit of it might choke and destroy you.

[Deuteronomy 29:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">deu 29:19</span></span>

And it come to pass, when he heareth the words of this curse, that he
bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in
the imagination of mine heart, to add (k) drunkenness to thirst:

\(k\) For as he that is thirsty desires to drink much so he that follows
his appetites seeks by all means and yet cannot be satisfied.

[Deuteronomy 29:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">deu 29:22</span></span>

So that the (l) generation to come of your children that shall rise up
after you, and the stranger that shall come from a far land, shall say,
when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses which the
LORD hath laid upon it;

\(l\) God's plagues on those who rebel against him will be so strong,
that all ages will be astonished.

[Deuteronomy 29:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">deu 29:29</span></span>

The (m) secret \[things belong\] unto the LORD our God: but those
\[things which are\] revealed \[belong\] unto us and to our children for
ever, that \[we\] may do all the words of this law.

\(m\) Moses by this proves their curiosity, who seek those things that
are only known to God: and their negligence who do not regard that which
God has revealed to them, as the law.
