### [Job Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#001)

[Job 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 17:2</span></span>

\[Are there\] not (a) mockers with me? and doth not mine eye continue in
(b) their provocation?

\(a\) Instead of comfort, being now at death's door, he had but them
that mocked at him, and discouraged him.

[Job 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 17:3</span></span>

\(c\) Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee; who \[is\] he \[that\]
(d) will strike hands with me?

\(c\) He reasons with God as a man beside himself, so that his cause
might be brought to light.

\(d\) And answers for you?

[Job 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 17:4</span></span>

For thou hast hid their heart from (e) understanding: therefore shalt
thou not exalt \[them\].

\(e\) That these my afflictions are your just judgments, though man does
not know the reason.

[Job 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 17:5</span></span>

\(f\) He that speaketh flattery to \[his\] friends, even the eyes of his
children shall fail.

\(f\) He who flatters a man, and only judges him happy in his
prosperity, will not himself only but in his posterity be punished.

[Job 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 17:6</span></span>

He hath made me also a (g) byword of the people; and aforetime I was as
a tabret.

\(g\) God has made all the world speak of me, because of my afflictions.

[Job 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 17:8</span></span>

Upright \[men\] shall be astonied at (i) this, and the innocent shall
stir up himself against the hypocrite.

\(i\) That is, when they see the godly punished: but in the end they
will come to understanding and know what will be the reward of the
hypocrite.

[Job 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 17:9</span></span>

The righteous also shall hold on his (k) way, and he that hath clean
hands shall be stronger and stronger.

\(k\) That is, will not be discouraged, considering that the godly are
punished as well as the wicked.

[Job 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 17:10</span></span>

But as for (l) you all, do ye return, and come now: for I cannot find
\[one\] wise \[man\] among you.

\(l\) Job speaks to the three who came to comfort him.

[Job 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 17:12</span></span>

They change the (m) night into day: the light \[is\] short because of
darkness.

\(m\) That is, have brought me sorrow instead of comfort.

[Job 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 17:13</span></span>

If I wait, (n) the grave \[is\] mine house: I have made my bed in the
darkness.

\(n\) Though I should hope to come from adversity to prosperity, as your
discourse pretends.

[Job 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 17:14</span></span>

I have said to corruption, Thou \[art\] my (o) father: to the worm,
\[Thou art\] my mother, and my sister.

\(o\) I have no more hope in father, mother, sister, or any worldly
thing: for the dust and worms will be to me instead of them.

[Job 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 17:16</span></span>

\(p\) They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when \[our\] rest
together \[is\] in the dust.

\(p\) All worldly hope and prosperity fail which you say, are only signs
of God's favour but seeing that these things perish, I set my hope in
God and in the life everlasting.
