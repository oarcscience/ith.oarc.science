### [1 Chronicles Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#001)

[1 Chronicles 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch1 23:13</span></span>

The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated, that he
should (a) sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons for ever, to
burn incense before the LORD, to minister unto him, and to bless in his
name for ever.

\(a\) That is, to serve in the most holy place, and to consecrate the
holy things.

[1 Chronicles 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch1 23:14</span></span>

Now \[concerning\] Moses the man of God, his sons were named of the (b)
tribe of Levi.

\(b\) They were but of the order of the Levites and not of the priests
as Aaron's sons.

[1 Chronicles 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch1 23:17</span></span>

And the sons of Eliezer \[were\], Rehabiah the (c) chief. And Eliezer
had none other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.

\(c\) The scripture calls him chief or first born even though he is
alone and there is no one born after him, ([Mat
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#025)).

[1 Chronicles 23:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch1 23:22</span></span>

And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters: and their (d) brethren
the sons of Kish took them.

\(d\) Meaning their cousins.

[1 Chronicles 23:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ch1 23:24</span></span>

These \[were\] the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers;
\[even\] the chief of the fathers, as they were counted by number of
names by their polls, that did the work for the service of the house of
the LORD, from the age of (e) twenty years and upward.

\(e\) David chose the Levites twice, first at the age of thirty as in
([Ch1 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#003)) and again afterward at
twenty as the office required: at the beginning they had no charge in
the temple before they were twenty-five years old, and had none after
fifty, ([Num 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#003)).

[1 Chronicles 23:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">ch1 23:28</span></span>

Because their office \[was\] to wait on the sons of Aaron for the
service of the house of the LORD, in the courts, and in the chambers,
and in the (f) purifying of all holy things, and the work of the service
of the house of God;

\(f\) In washing and cleansing all the holy vessels.
