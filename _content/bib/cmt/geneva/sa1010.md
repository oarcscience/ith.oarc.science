### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#001)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 10:1</span></span>

Then Samuel took a vial of (a) oil, and poured \[it\] upon his head, and
kissed him, and said, \[Is it\] not because the LORD hath anointed thee
\[to be\] captain over his inheritance?

\(a\) In the Law this anointing signified the gifts of the Holy Spirit,
which were necessary for those who would rule.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 10:2</span></span>

When thou art departed from me to day, then thou shalt find two men by
Rachel's sepulchre in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will
say unto thee, The (b) asses which thou wentest to seek are found: and,
lo, thy father hath left the care of the asses, and sorroweth for you,
saying, What shall I do for my son?

\(b\) Samuel confirms him by these signs, that God has appointed him
king.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa1 10:5</span></span>

After that thou shalt come to the (c) hill of God, where \[is\] the
garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when thou art
come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a company of prophets
coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a
pipe, and a harp, before them; and they shall prophesy:

\(c\) Which was a high place in the city Kirjath-jearim, where the ark
was, ([Sa1 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#002)).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa1 10:9</span></span>

And it was \[so\], that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel,
God gave him another (d) heart: and all those signs came to pass that
day.

\(d\) He gave him such virtues as were fitting for a king.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa1 10:12</span></span>

And one of the same place answered and said, But who \[is\] their (e)
father? Therefore it became a proverb, \[Is\] Saul also among the (f)
prophets?

\(e\) Meaning, that prophecy comes not by succession, but is given to
whom it pleases God.

\(f\) Noting by it him that from low degree comes suddenly to honour.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa1 10:17</span></span>

And Samuel (g) called the people together unto the LORD to Mizpeh;

\(g\) Both to declare to them their fault in asking a king, and also to
show God's sentence in it.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa1 10:20</span></span>

And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the
tribe of Benjamin was (h) taken.

\(h\) That is, by casting of lot.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">sa1 10:22</span></span>

Therefore they enquired of the LORD further, if the man should yet come
thither. And the LORD answered, Behold, he (i) hath hid himself among
the stuff.

\(i\) As though he were unworthy and unwilling.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">sa1 10:25</span></span>

Then Samuel told the people (k) the manner of the kingdom, and wrote
\[it\] in a book, and laid \[it\] up before the LORD. And Samuel sent
all the people away, every man to his house.

\(k\) As it is written in ([Deu
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#015)).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 10:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">sa1 10:27</span></span>

But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us? And they
despised him, and brought him no presents. But he (l) held his peace.

\(l\) Both to avoid disputing and also to win them by patience.
