<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#001">Ecclesiastes 7:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">ecc 7:1</A></FONT></span></p>A good name [is] better than precious ointment; and the day of (b) death than the day of one's birth. 
<p>
<p>(b) He speaks thus after the judgment of the flesh, which thinks death is the end of all evils, or else because this corporal death is the entering into everlasting life.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#002">Ecclesiastes 7:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">ecc 7:2</A></FONT></span></p>[It is] better to go to the house of (c) mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for that [is] the end of all men; and the living will lay [it] to his heart. 
<p>
<p>(c) Where we may see the hand of God and learn to examine our lives.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#006">Ecclesiastes 7:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">ecc 7:6</A></FONT></span></p>For as the crackling of (d) thorns under a pot, so [is] the laughter of the fool: this also [is] vanity. 
<p>
<p>(d) Which crackle for a while and profit nothing.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#007">Ecclesiastes 7:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">ecc 7:7</A></FONT></span></p>Surely oppression maketh a wise man (e) mad; and a gift destroyeth the heart. 
<p>
<p>(e) A man that is esteemed wise, when he falls to oppression, becomes like a beast.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#008">Ecclesiastes 7:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">ecc 7:8</A></FONT></span></p>Better [is] the (f) end of a thing than its beginning: [and] the patient in spirit [is] better than the proud in spirit. 
<p>
<p>(f) He notes their lightness who attempt a thing and suddenly leave it off again.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#010">Ecclesiastes 7:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">ecc 7:10</A></FONT></span></p>Say not thou, What is [the cause] that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not enquire (g) wisely concerning this. 
<p>
<p>(g) Murmur not against God when he sends adversities for man's sins.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#011">Ecclesiastes 7:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">ecc 7:11</A></FONT></span></p>Wisdom [is] good with an (h) inheritance: and [by it there is] profit to them that see the sun. 
<p>
<p>(h) He answers to them who do not value wisdom unless riches are joined with it, showing that both are the gifts of God, but that wisdom is far more excellent and may be without riches.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#014">Ecclesiastes 7:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">ecc 7:14</A></FONT></span></p>In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity (i) consider: God also hath appointed the one as well as the other, to the end that man should find (k) nothing after him. 
<p>
<p>(i) Consider why God sends it and what may comfort you. 
<p>
<p>(k) That man should be able to control nothing in his works.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#015">Ecclesiastes 7:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">ecc 7:15</A></FONT></span></p>All [things] have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just [man] that perisheth in his (l) righteousness, and there is a wicked [man] that prolongeth [his life] in his wickedness. 
<p>
<p>(l) Meaning that cruel tyrants put the godly to death and let the wicked go free.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#016">Ecclesiastes 7:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">ecc 7:16</A></FONT></span></p>Be not righteous (m) over much; neither make thyself over wise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself? 
<p>
<p>(m) Do not boast too much of your own justice and wisdom.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#017">Ecclesiastes 7:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">ecc 7:17</A></FONT></span></p>Be not (n) over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time? 
<p>
<p>(n) Do not tarry long when you are admonished to come out of the way of wickedness.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#018">Ecclesiastes 7:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">ecc 7:18</A></FONT></span></p>[It is] good that thou shouldest take hold of (o) this; yea, also from (p) this withdraw not thy hand: for he that feareth God shall escape from them all. 
<p>
<p>(o) That is, on these admonitions that go before. 
<p>
<p>(p) Consider what desolation and destruction will come, if you do not obey them.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#021">Ecclesiastes 7:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">ecc 7:21</A></FONT></span></p>Also take no (q) heed to all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy servant curse thee: 
<p>
<p>(q) Credit them not, neither care for them.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#024">Ecclesiastes 7:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">ecc 7:24</A></FONT></span></p>That which is far off, (r) and exceedingly deep, who can find it out? 
<p>
<p>(r) Meaning wisdom.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#027">Ecclesiastes 7:27</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_027">ecc 7:27</A></FONT></span></p>Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher, [counting] one by one, to (s) find out the account: 
<p>
<p>(s) That is, to come to a conclusion.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#029">Ecclesiastes 7:29</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_029">ecc 7:29</A></FONT></span></p>Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many (t) devices. 
<p>
<p>(t) And so are cause for their own destruction.
