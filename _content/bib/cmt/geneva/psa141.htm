<p>
<p>(a) He shows that there is no other refuge in our necessity but only to flee to God for comfort of soul.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#002">Psalms 141:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">psa 141:2</A></FONT></span></p>Let my prayer be set forth before thee [as] incense; [and] the (b) lifting up of my hands [as] the evening sacrifice. 
<p>
<p>(b) He means his earnest zeal and gesture, which he used in prayer: alluding to the sacrifices which were by God's commandment offered in the old law.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#003">Psalms 141:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">psa 141:3</A></FONT></span></p>Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth; (c) keep the door of my lips. 
<p>
<p>(c) He desires God to keep his thoughts and ways either from thinking or executing vengeance.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#004">Psalms 141:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">psa 141:4</A></FONT></span></p>Incline not my heart to [any] evil thing, to practise wicked works with men that work iniquity: and let me not eat of their (d) dainties. 
<p>
<p>(d) Let not their prosperity lure me to be wicked as they are.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#005">Psalms 141:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">psa 141:5</A></FONT></span></p>Let the righteous smite me; [it shall be] a kindness: and let (e) him reprove me; [it shall be] an excellent oil, [which] shall not break my head: for yet my prayer also [shall be] in their calamities. 
<p>
<p>(e) He could abide all corrections that came from a loving heart.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#006">Psalms 141:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">psa 141:6</A></FONT></span></p>When their judges are overthrown in stony places, they shall (g) hear my words; for they are sweet. 
<p>
<p>(g) The people who follow their wicked rulers in persecuting the prophet will repent and turn to God, when they see their wicked rulers punished.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#007">Psalms 141:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">psa 141:7</A></FONT></span></p>Our bones are scattered at the (h) grave's mouth, as when one cutteth and cleaveth [wood] upon the earth. 
<p>
<p>(h) Here it appears that David was miraculously delivered out of many deaths as in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#009">Co2 1:9-10</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#010">Psalms 141:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">psa 141:10</A></FONT></span></p>Let the wicked fall into (i) their own nets, (k) whilst that I withal escape. 
<p>
<p>(i) Into God's nets, by which he catches the wicked in their own malice. 
<p>
<p>(k) So that none of them escape.
