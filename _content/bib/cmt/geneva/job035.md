### [Job Chapter 35](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#001)

[Job 35:2](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 35:2</span></span>

Thinkest thou this to be right, \[that\] thou saidst, My (a)
righteousness \[is\] more than God's?

\(a\) Job never spoke these words: but because he maintained his
innocency, it seemed as though he would say, that God tormented him
without just cause.

[Job 35:4](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 35:4</span></span>

I will answer thee, and thy (b) companions with thee.

\(b\) Such as are in the same error.

[Job 35:5](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 35:5</span></span>

Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the (c) clouds \[which\] are
higher than thou.

\(c\) If you cannot control the clouds, will you presume to instruct
God?

[Job 35:6](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 35:6</span></span>

If thou sinnest, what doest thou (d) against him? or \[if\] thy
transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?

\(d\) Neither does your sin hurt God, nor your justice profit him: for
he will be glorified without you.

[Job 35:9](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 35:9</span></span>

By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make \[the oppressed\]
(e) to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty.

\(e\) The wicked may hurt man and cause him to cry, who if he sought God
who lends comfort would be delivered.

[Job 35:12](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 35:12</span></span>

There they cry, (f) but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil
men.

\(f\) Because they pray not in faith, as feeling God's mercies.

[Job 35:14](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 35:14</span></span>

Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, (g) \[yet\] judgment \[is\]
before him; therefore trust thou in him.

\(g\) God is just, however you judge him.

[Job 35:16](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 35:16</span></span>

Therefore doth Job (h) open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words
without knowledge.

\(h\) For if he punished you as you deserved, you would not be able to
open your mouth.
