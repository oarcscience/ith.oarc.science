<p>
<p>(a) He comforts the Church, that they would not be discouraged for their small number.

<p>
<p>(g) Forewarns them of the horrible changes and mutations of all things, and how he will preserve his church in the midst of all these dangers.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">isa 51:9</A></FONT></span></p>Awake, awake, put on thy strength, O arm of the LORD; awake, as in the ancient days, (h) in the generations of old. [Art] thou not that which hath cut (i) Rahab, [and] wounded the (k) dragon?

<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#011">Isaiah 51:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">isa 51:11</A></FONT></span></p>Therefore the redeemed of the LORD shall (l) return, and come with singing to Zion; and everlasting joy [shall be] upon their head: they shall obtain gladness and joy; sorrow and mourning shall flee away. 
<p>
<p>(l) From Babylon.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#014">Isaiah 51:14</A></p>

<p>
<p>(m) He comforts them by the short time of their banishment: for in seventy years they were restored and the greatest empire of the world destroyed.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#016">Isaiah 51:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">isa 51:16</A></FONT></span></p>And I have put my words in thy (n) mouth, and have covered thee in the shadow of my hand, that I may plant the (o) heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say to Zion, Thou [art] my people.

<p>(n) Meaning, of Isaiah and of all true ministers who are defended by his protection. 
<p>
<p>(o) That all things may be restored in heaven and earth, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#010">Eph 1:10</A>).

<p>
<p>(p) You have been justly punished and sufficiently as (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#002">Isa 40:2</A>) and this punishment in the elect is by measure, and according as God gives grace to hear it: but in the reprobate it is the just vengeance of God to drive them to an insensibleness and madness, as (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#015">Jer 25:15-16</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#019">Isaiah 51:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">isa 51:19</A></FONT></span></p>These two (q) [things] have come to thee; who shall be sorry for thee? desolation, and destruction, and famine, and the sword: by whom shall I comfort thee? 
<p>
<p>(q) Of which the one is outward as of the things that come to the body, as war, and famine and the other is inward, and belongs to the mind: that is, to be without comfort: therefore he says "How will you be comforted?"  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#021">Isaiah 51:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">isa 51:21</A></FONT></span></p>Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunk, but (r) not with wine:
