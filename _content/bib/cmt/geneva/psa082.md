### [Psalms Chapter 82](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#001)

[Psalms 82:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 82:1</span></span>

"A Psalm of Asaph." God standeth in the congregation of the (a) mighty;
he judgeth among the gods.

\(a\) The prophet shows that if princes and judges do not do their duty,
God whose authority is above them will take vengeance on them.

[Psalms 82:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 82:2</span></span>

How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the (b)
wicked? Selah.

\(b\) For thieves and murderers find favour in judgment when the cause
of the godly cannot be heard.

[Psalms 82:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 82:4</span></span>

Deliver the poor and (c) needy: rid \[them\] out of the hand of the
wicked.

\(c\) Not only when they cry for help, but when their cause requires aid
and support.

[Psalms 82:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 82:5</span></span>

They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness:
all the (d) foundations of the earth are out of course.

\(d\) That is, all things are out of order either by their tyranny or
careless negligence.

[Psalms 82:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 82:7</span></span>

\(e\) But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.

\(e\) No title of honour will excuse you, but you will be subject to
God's judgments, and tender account as well as other men.

[Psalms 82:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 82:8</span></span>

Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit (f) all nations.

\(f\) Therefore no tyrant will pluck your right and authority from you.
