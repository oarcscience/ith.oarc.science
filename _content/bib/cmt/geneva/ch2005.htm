<p>
<p>(c) Called in Hebrew Ethanim, containing part of September and part of October, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#002">Kg1 8:2</A>), which moves the Jews called the first month, because they say that the world was created in that month, and after they came from Egypt, they began at March: but because this opinion is uncertain, we always make March the first as the best writers do.

<p>
<p>(d) For Aaron's rod and manna were taken from there before it was brought to this place.
