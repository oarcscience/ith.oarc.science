<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">psa 146:1</A></FONT></span></p>Praise ye the LORD. Praise the LORD, O my (a) soul. 
<p>
<p>(a) He stirs up himself and all his affections to praise God.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#003">Psalms 146:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">psa 146:3</A></FONT></span></p>Put not your trust in (b) princes, [nor] in the son of man, in whom [there is] no help. 
<p>
<p>(b) That God may have the whole praise: in which he forbids all vain confidence showing that by nature we are more inclined to put our trust in creatures, than in God the Creator.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#004">Psalms 146:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">psa 146:4</A></FONT></span></p>His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his (c) thoughts perish. 
<p>
<p>(c) As their vain opinions, by which they flattered themselves and so imagined wicked enterprises.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#006">Psalms 146:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">psa 146:6</A></FONT></span></p>Which made (d) heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein [is]: which keepeth truth for ever: 
<p>
<p>(d) He encourages the godly to trust only in the Lord, both in his power's ability to deliver them from all danger, and for his promise sake, as his will is most ready to do it.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#007">Psalms 146:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">psa 146:7</A></FONT></span></p>Which executeth judgment (e) for the oppressed: which giveth food to the hungry. The LORD looseth the prisoners: 
<p>
<p>(e) Whose faith and patience for a while he tries but at length he punishes the adversaries, that he may be known to be the judge of the world.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#008">Psalms 146:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">psa 146:8</A></FONT></span></p>The LORD openeth [the eyes of] the blind: the LORD raiseth them that are bowed down: the LORD (f) loveth the righteous: 
<p>
<p>(f) Though he visits them with affliction, hunger, imprisonment and such like, yet his fatherly love and pity never fails them, yea rather to his these are signs of his love.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#009">Psalms 146:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">psa 146:9</A></FONT></span></p>The LORD preserveth the (g) strangers; he relieveth the fatherless and widow: but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down. 
<p>
<p>(g) Meaning, all who are destitute of worldly means and help.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#010">Psalms 146:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">psa 146:10</A></FONT></span></p>The LORD shall (h) reign for ever, [even] thy God, O Zion, unto all generations. Praise ye the LORD. 
<p>
<p>(h) He assures the Church that God reigns forever for the preservation of the same.
