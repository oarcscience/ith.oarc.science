<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 7:1</span></span>

And the men of (a) Kirjathjearim came, and fetched up the ark of the
LORD, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill, and
sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the LORD.

\(a\) A city in the tribe of Judah, called also Kirjathbaal, in ([Jos

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 7:2</span></span>

And it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kirjathjearim, that the time
was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of Israel lamented
(b) after the LORD.

\(b\) Lamented for their sins, and followed the Lord.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa1 7:5</span></span>

And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to (c) Mizpeh, and I will pray for
you unto the LORD.

\(c\) For Shiloh was now desolate, because the Philistines had taken the
ark from it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 7:6</span></span>

And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and (d) drew water, and poured
\[it\] out before the LORD, and fasted on that day, and said there, We
have sinned against the LORD. And Samuel judged the children of Israel
in Mizpeh.

\(d\) The Chaldee text says that they drew water out of their heart:
that is, wept abundantly for their sins.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa1 7:8</span></span>

And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to (e) cry unto the
LORD our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the
Philistines.

\(e\) Signifying that in the prayers of the godly, there should be a
vehement zeal.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa1 7:10</span></span>

And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew
near to battle against Israel: but the LORD (f) thundered with a great
thunder on that day upon the Philistines, and discomfited them; and they
were smitten before Israel.

\(f\) According to the prophecy of Hannah Samuel's mother, ([Sa1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#010)).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa1 7:12</span></span>

Then Samuel took a stone, and set \[it\] between Mizpeh and (g) Shen,
and called the name of it Ebenezer, saying, Hitherto hath the LORD
helped us.

\(g\) Which was a great rock over against Mizpeh.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa1 7:14</span></span>

And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored
to Israel, from Ekron even unto Gath; and the coasts thereof did Israel
deliver out of the hands of the Philistines. And there was peace between
Israel and the (h) Amorites.

\(h\) Meaning, the Philistines.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#017)

And his return \[was\] to Ramah; for there \[was\] his house; and there
he judged Israel; and there he built an (i) altar unto the LORD.

\(i\) Which was not contrary to the Law: for as yet a certain place was
not appointed.
