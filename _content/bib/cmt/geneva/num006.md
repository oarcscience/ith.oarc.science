<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 6:2</span></span>

Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When either man or
woman shall separate \[themselves\] to vow a vow of a (a) Nazarite, to
separate \[themselves\] unto the LORD:

\(a\) Who separated themselves from the world, and dedicated themselves
to God: a figure which was accomplished in Christ.

[Numbers 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">num 6:6</span></span>

All the days that he separateth \[himself\] unto the LORD he shall come
at no (b) dead body.

\(b\) As at burials, or mournings.

[Numbers 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">num 6:7</span></span>

He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother, for
his brother, or for his sister, when they die: because the consecration
of his God \[is\] upon (c) his head.

\(c\) In that he allowed his hair to grow, he signified that he was
consecrated to God.

[Numbers 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">num 6:9</span></span>

And if any man die very suddenly by him, and he hath defiled the (d)
head of his consecration; then he shall shave his head in the day of his
cleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave it.

\(d\) Whose long hair is a sign that he is dedicated to God.

[Numbers 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">num 6:11</span></span>

And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the other for
a burnt offering, and make an atonement for him, for that he sinned by
(e) the dead, and shall hallow his head that same day.

\(e\) By being present where the deceased was.

[Numbers 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">num 6:12</span></span>

And he shall (f) consecrate unto the LORD the days of his separation,
and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a trespass offering: but
the (g) days that were before shall be lost, because his separation was
defiled.

\(f\) Beginning at the eighth day, when he is purified.

\(g\) So that he shall begin his vow anew.

[Numbers 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">num 6:18</span></span>

And the Nazarite shall shave the head (h) of his separation \[at\] the
door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall take the hair of
the head of his separation, and (i) put \[it\] in the fire which \[is\]
under the sacrifice of the peace offerings.

\(h\) In token that his vow is ended.

\(i\) For the hair which was consecrated to the Lord, might not be cast
into any profane place.

[Numbers 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">num 6:21</span></span>

This \[is\] the law of the Nazarite who hath vowed, \[and of\] his
offering unto the LORD for his separation, (k) beside \[that\] that his
hand shall get: according to the vow which he vowed, so he must do after
the law of his separation.

\(k\) At the least he shall do this, if he is not able to offer more.

[Numbers 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">num 6:23</span></span>

Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying, On this wise ye shall (l)
bless the children of Israel, saying unto them,

\(l\) That is, pray for them.

[Numbers 6:27](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">num 6:27</span></span>

And they shall put my (m) name upon the children of Israel; and I will
bless them.

\(m\) They shall pray in my Name for them.
