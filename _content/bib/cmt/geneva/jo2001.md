### [2 John Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#001)

[2 John 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jo2 1:1</span></span>

The elder unto the (a) elect (b) lady and her children, (1) whom I love
in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the
truth;

\(a\) This is not a proper name, but is to be taken as it sounds that is
to say, the worthy and noble lady.

\(b\) Excellent and honourable woman. (1) The bond of Christian union is
the true and constant profession of the truth.

[2 John 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jo2 1:3</span></span>

Grace be with you, mercy, \[and\] peace, from God the Father, and from
the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in

\(c\) truth and love.

\(c\) With true knowledge which always has love united with it, and
following it.

[2 John 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jo2 1:4</span></span>

\(2\) I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in (d)
truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.

\(2\) This true profession consists both in love towards one another
which the Lord has commanded, and also especially in wholesome and sound
doctrine, which also is delivered to us: for the commandment of God is a
sound and sure foundation both of the rule of conduct and of doctrine,
and these cannot be separated from one another,

\(d\) According as the truth directs them.

[2 John 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jo2 1:7</span></span>

\(3\) For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not
that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an
antichrist.

\(3\) Antichrists fighting against the person and office of Christ had
already crept into the Church, in the time of the apostles.

[2 John 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jo2 1:8</span></span>

\(4\) (e) Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we
have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.

\(4\) He that makes shipwreck of doctrine, loses all.

\(e\) Beware, and take good heed.

[2 John 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jo2 1:10</span></span>

\(5\) If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive
him not into \[your\] house, neither bid him God speed:

\(5\) We should have nothing to do with those who defend perverse
doctrine.
