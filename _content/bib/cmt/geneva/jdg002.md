### [Judges Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#001)

[Judges 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 2:1</span></span>

And an (a) angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, I
made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you unto the land which
I sware unto your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant
with you.

\(a\) That is, messenger, or prophet, as some think, Phinehas.

[Judges 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jdg 2:6</span></span>

And when Joshua had (b) let the people go, the children of Israel went
every man unto his inheritance to possess the land.

\(b\) After that he had divided to every man his portion by lot, ([Jos
24:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#028)).

[Judges 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jdg 2:7</span></span>

And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days
of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great (c) works
of the LORD, that he did for Israel.

\(c\) Meaning, the wonders and miracles.

[Judges 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jdg 2:9</span></span>

And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in (d)
Timnathheres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill
Gaash.

\(d\) Heres, by turning the letters backward is Sereh, as in ([Jos
24:30](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#030)).

[Judges 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jdg 2:11</span></span>

And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and served
(e) Baalim:

\(e\) That is, all manner of idols.

[Judges 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jdg 2:13</span></span>

And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and (f) Ashtaroth.

\(f\) These were idols, which had the form of a ewe or sheep among the
Sidonians.

[Judges 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jdg 2:15</span></span>

\(g\) Whithersoever they went out, the (h) hand of the LORD was against
them for evil, as the LORD had said, and as the LORD had sworn unto
them: and they were greatly distressed.

\(g\) In all their enterprises.

\(h\) The vengeance.

[Judges 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jdg 2:17</span></span>

And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they went a
whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves unto them: they turned
quickly out of the (i) way which their fathers walked in, obeying the
commandments of the LORD; \[but\] they did not so.

\(i\) Meaning, from the true religion.

[Judges 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jdg 2:18</span></span>

And when the LORD raised them up judges, then the LORD was with the
judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days
of the judge: for it repented the LORD because of their groanings (k) by
reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them.

\(k\) Seeing their cruelty.

[Judges 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jdg 2:21</span></span>

I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the (l)
nations which Joshua left when he died:

\(l\) As the Hivites, Jebusites, Amorites, etc.

[Judges 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jdg 2:22</span></span>

That through them I may (m) prove Israel, whether they will keep the way
of the LORD to walk therein, as their fathers did keep \[it\], or not.

\(m\) So that both outward enemies and false prophets are but a trial to
prove our faith, ([Deu 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#003); [Jdg
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#001)).
