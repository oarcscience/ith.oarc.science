### [Acts Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#001)

[Acts 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 8:1</span></span>

And (1) Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a
great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they
were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria,
except the apostles.

\(1\) Christ uses the rage of his enemies in the spreading forth and
enlarging of his kingdom.

[Acts 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 8:2</span></span>

\(2\) And devout men (a) carried Stephen \[to his burial\], and made
great lamentation over him.

\(2\) The godly mourn for Steven after his death, and bury him, showing
in this an example of singular faith and charity: but no man prays to
him.

\(a\) Amongst all the duties of charity which the godly perform, there
is no mention made of enshrining relics.

[Acts 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 8:3</span></span>

\(3\) As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every
house, and haling men and women committed \[them\] to prison.

\(3\) The dispersion or scattering abroad of the faithful is the
gathering together of churches.

[Acts 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 8:5</span></span>

\(4\) Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ
unto them.

\(4\) Philip, who was before a deacon in Jerusalem, is made an
evangelist by God in an extraordinary way.

[Acts 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 8:9</span></span>

\(5\) But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the
same city used (b) sorcery, and (c) bewitched the people of Samaria,
giving out that himself was some great one:

\(5\) Christ overcomes Satan as often as he desires, and carries him
about as it were in triumph, in the sight of those whom Satan deceived
and bewitched.

\(b\) The word which is used in this place was at first used of good
things, and is borrowed from the language of the Persians, who call
their wise men by that name; but afterwards it was used of evil things.

\(c\) He had so allured the Samaritans with his witchcraft that as blind
and mad idiots they were wholly addicted to him.

[Acts 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 8:13</span></span>

\(6\) Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he
continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs
which were done.

\(6\) The wicked and the highly reprobate are often forced to taste the
good gift of God, but they immediately spit it out again.

[Acts 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 8:14</span></span>

\(7\) Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria
had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:

\(7\) Peter, not chief but as an ambassador sent from the whole company
of the apostles, and John his companion, according to the authority
which was committed unto them, strengthen, encourage, and build up the
churches of Samaria, whose foundation had been laid before by Philip.

[Acts 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 8:15</span></span>

Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive
the (d) Holy Ghost:

\(d\) Those excellent gifts which are necessary, especially for those
that were to be appointed rulers and governors of the Church.

[Acts 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 8:18</span></span>

\(8\) And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands
the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,

\(8\) Covetousness and the seeking of glory at length remove the
hypocrites from their dens.

[Acts 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 8:20</span></span>

\(9\) But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou
hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.

\(9\) They are the successors of Simon Magus, and not Simon Peter, who
either buy or sell holy things.

[Acts 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 8:21</span></span>

Thou hast neither part nor lot in this (e) matter: for thy heart is not
(f) right in the sight of God.

\(e\) In this doctrine which I preach.

\(f\) Is not upright indeed and without the concealing of hypocritical
motives.

[Acts 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 8:22</span></span>

\(10\) Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps
the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.

\(10\) We must hope well even for the vilest sinners, as long as and as
much as we can.

[Acts 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 8:23</span></span>

For I perceive that thou art in the (g) gall of bitterness, and \[in\]
the (h) bond of iniquity.

\(g\) He calls the inward malice of the heart and the venomous and
demonic wickedness with which the magician was wholly filled with the
gall of bitterness: and he is said to be in the gall, as though he were
wholly overwhelmed with gall, and buried in it.

\(h\) Entangled in the bonds of iniquity.

[Acts 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 8:26</span></span>

\(11\) And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and
go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto
Gaza, which is desert.

\(11\) Christ, who calls freely whom he wishes, now uses Philip, who was
not thinking about any such thing, to unexpectedly instruct and baptize
the eunuch, and by this means extends the limits of his kingdom even
into Ethiopia.

[Acts 8:27](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">act 8:27</span></span>

And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch (i) of
great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the
charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship,

\(i\) A man of great wealth and authority with Candace. Now this word
"Candace" is a common name of all the Queens of Ethiopia.

[Acts 8:31](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">act 8:31</span></span>

And he said, How can I, except some man should (k) guide me? And he
desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.

\(k\) To show me the way to understand it.

[Acts 8:32](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">act 8:32</span></span>

\(12\) The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as
a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so
opened he not his mouth:

\(12\) Those things which seem to come most by chance or fortune (as men
term it) are governed by the secret providence of God.

[Acts 8:33](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">act 8:33</span></span>

In his (l) humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall
declare his (m) generation? for his life is taken from the earth.

\(l\) The Hebrew text reads it in this way, "out of a narrow strait, and
out of judgment was he taken": and by the "narrow strait" he means the
grave and the very bonds of death, and by "judgment" he means the
punishment which was laid upon him, and the miserable state which Christ
took upon himself for our sakes, in bearing his Father's wrath.

\(m\) How long he will endure: for Christ, having once risen from the
dead, dies no more; ([Rom 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#009)).

[Acts 8:37](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">act 8:37</span></span>

\(13\) And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou
mayest. And he answered and said, (n) I believe that Jesus Christ is the
Son of God.

\(13\) Profession of faith is required of those being baptized, and
therefore it is evident that we are not first ingrafted into Christ when
we are baptized, but are already ingrafted, and then are baptized. (Ed.)

\(n\) The sum of the confession which is necessary for baptism.
