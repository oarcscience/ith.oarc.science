<p>
<p>(a) He means those who embalmed the dead and buried them.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#003">Genesis 50:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">gen 50:3</A></FONT></span></p>And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him (b) threescore and ten days. 
<p>
<p>(b) They were more excessive in lamenting than the faithful.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#006">Genesis 50:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">gen 50:6</A></FONT></span></p>And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according (c) as he made thee swear. 
<p>
<p>(c) Even the infidels would have oaths carried out.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#015">Genesis 50:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">gen 50:15</A></FONT></span></p>And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, (d) Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him. 
<p>
<p>(d) An evil conscience is never fully at rest.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#017">Genesis 50:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">gen 50:17</A></FONT></span></p>So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the (e) God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him. 
<p>
<p>(e) Meaning, that they who have one God should be joined in most sure love.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">gen 50:19</A></FONT></span></p>And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for [am] I in the place of (s) God? 
<p>
<p>(s) Who by the good success seems to remit it, and therefore it should not be revenged by me.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">gen 50:22</A></FONT></span></p>And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and Joseph lived an (g) hundred and ten years. 
<p>
<p>(g) Who, even though he ruled in Egypt about eighty years, yet was joined with the church of God in faith and religion.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_025">gen 50:25</A></FONT></span></p>And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, (h) God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence. 
<p>
<p>(h) He speaks this by the spirit of prophecy, exhorting his brethren to have full trust in God's promise for their deliverance.
