### [Micah Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#001)

[Micah 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mic 3:1</span></span>

And I said, Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob, and ye princes of the
house of Israel; \[Is it\] not for you to know (a) judgment?

\(a\) That thing which is just and lawful, both to govern my people
properly, and also to clear your own conscience.

[Micah 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mic 3:2</span></span>

Who hate the good, and love the evil; (b) who pluck off their skin from
off them, and their flesh from off their bones;

\(b\) The Prophet condemns the wicked governors not only of
covetousness, theft, and murder, but compares them to wolves, lions, and
most cruel beasts.

[Micah 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mic 3:4</span></span>

Then (c) shall they cry unto the LORD, but he will not hear them: he
will even hide his face from them at that time, as they have behaved
themselves ill in their doings.

\(c\) That is, when I will punish their wickedness: for though I hear
the godly before they cry ([Isa
65:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#024)), yet I will not hear these even
though they cry; ([Isa 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#015)) ([Eze
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#018); [Jam
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#013); [Pe1
3:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#011)).

[Micah 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mic 3:5</span></span>

Thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that make my people err,
that (d) bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and he that putteth not
into their mouths, they even prepare war against him.

\(d\) They devour all their substance, and then flatter them, promising
that all will go well. But if someone does not feed them, then they
invent all ways to do evil.

[Micah 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mic 3:6</span></span>

Therefore (e) night \[shall be\] unto you, that ye shall not have a
vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine; and the
sun shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark over
them.

\(e\) As you have loved to walk in darkness, and to prophesy lies, so
God will reward you with gross blindness and ignorance, so that when all
others will see the bright beams of God's grace, you will as blind men
grope as in the night.

[Micah 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mic 3:7</span></span>

Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded: yea, they
shall all cover (f) their lips; for \[there is\] no answer of God.

\(f\) When God will reveal them to the world, they will be afraid to
speak: for all will know that they were but false prophets, and did give
a false notion of the word of God.

[Micah 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mic 3:8</span></span>

But truly I am full (g) of power by the spirit of the LORD, and of
judgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression, and to
Israel his sin.

\(g\) The Prophet being assured of his vocation by the Spirit of God,
sets himself alone against all the wicked, showing how God gave him
gifts, ability and knowledge, to discern between good and evil, and also
steadfastness and endurance to reprove the sins of the people, and not
to flatter them.

[Micah 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mic 3:10</span></span>

They build up Zion with (h) blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.

\(h\) They will say that they are the people of God, and abuse his name,
as a pretence to disguise their hypocrisy.

[Micah 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mic 3:12</span></span>

Therefore shall Zion for your sake be (k) plowed \[as\] a field, and
Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high
places of the forest.

\(k\) Read ([Jer 26:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#018)).
