<p>
<p>(a) By this diversity of words, he means that nothing should be so dear to us as the word of God, nor that we look on anything more nor mind anything so much.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#006">Proverbs 7:6</A></p>

<p>
<p>(b) Solomon uses this parable to declare their folly, who allow themselves to be abused by harlots.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#009">Proverbs 7:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">pro 7:9</A></FONT></span></p>In the twilight, in the evening, in the (c) black and dark night: 
<p>
<p>(c) He shows that there was almost no one so impudent that they were not afraid to be seen, their consciences accusing them and causing them to seek the night to cover their filthiness.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#011">Proverbs 7:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">pro 7:11</A></FONT></span></p>(She (d) [is] loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house: 
<p>
<p>(d) He describes certain conditions, which are peculiar to harlots.

<p>
<p>(e) Because in peace offerings a portion is returned to them that offered, she shows him that she has meat at home to make good cheer with or else she would use some cloak of holiness till she had gotten him in her snares. 
<p>
<p>(f) Which declares that harlots outwardly will seem holy and religious: both because they may better deceive others, and also thinking to observe ceremonies and offerings to make satisfaction for their sins.

<p>
<p>(g) Which thinking he goes to the pasture goes willingly to his own destruction. 
<p>
<p>(h) Who goes cheerfully, not knowing that he will be chastised.

<p>
<p>(i) Neither wit nor strength can deliver them who fall into the hands of the harlot.
