### [Amos Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#001)

[Amos 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">amo 3:2</span></span>

You (a) only have I known of all the families of the earth: therefore I
will punish you for all your iniquities.

\(a\) I have only chosen you to be mine among all other people, and yet
you have forsaken me.

[Amos 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">amo 3:3</span></span>

Can two walk together, except they be (b) agreed?

\(b\) By this the Prophet signifies that he speaks not of himself, but
as God guides and moves him, which is called the agreement between God
and his Prophets.

[Amos 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">amo 3:4</span></span>

Will a (c) lion roar in the forest, when he hath no prey? will a young
lion cry out of his den, if he have taken nothing?

\(c\) Will God threaten by his Prophet, unless there is some great
occasion?

[Amos 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">amo 3:5</span></span>

\(d\) Can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth, where no gin \[is\] for
him? shall \[one\] take up a (e) snare from the earth, and have taken
nothing at all?

\(d\) Can anything come without God's providence?

\(e\) Will his threatenings be in vain?

[Amos 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">amo 3:6</span></span>

\(f\) Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be
afraid? shall there (g) be evil in a city, and the LORD hath not done
\[it\]?

\(f\) Will the Prophet's threaten God's judgments and the people not be
afraid?

\(g\) Does any adversity come without God's appointment? ([Isa
45:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#007))

[Amos 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">amo 3:7</span></span>

Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he (h) revealeth his secret
unto his servants the prophets.

\(h\) God does not deal with the Israelites as he does with other
people: for he always warns them before of his plagues by his Prophets.

[Amos 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">amo 3:8</span></span>

The lion hath roared, who will not fear? the Lord GOD hath spoken, who
can but (i) prophesy?

\(i\) Because the people always murmured against the Prophets, he shows
that God's Spirit moved them to speak as they did.

[Amos 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">amo 3:9</span></span>

Publish in the palaces at (k) Ashdod, and in the palaces in the land of
Egypt, and say, Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria, and
behold the great tumults in the midst thereof, and the oppressed in the
midst thereof.

\(k\) He calls the strangers, such as the Philistines and Egyptians, to
be witness of God's judgments against the Israelites for their cruelty
and oppression.

[Amos 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">amo 3:10</span></span>

For they know not to do right, saith the LORD, who store up violence and
robbery (l) in their palaces.

\(l\) The fruit of their cruelty and theft appears by their great
riches, which they have in their houses.

[Amos 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">amo 3:12</span></span>

Thus saith the LORD; As the shepherd taketh (m) out of the mouth of the
lion two legs, or a piece of an ear; so shall the children of Israel be
taken out that dwell in Samaria in the corner of a bed, and in (n)
Damascus \[in\] a couch.

\(m\) When the lion has satisfied his hunger, the shepherd finds a leg
or a piece of an ear, to show that the sheep have been torn by his
teeth.

\(n\) Where they thought to have had a sure stronghold, and to have been
in safety.
