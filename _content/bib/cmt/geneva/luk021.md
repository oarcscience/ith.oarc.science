\(3\) But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified:
for these things must first come to pass; but the end \[is\] not by and

tumults and most severe miseries, and this through invincible patience,
so that the end result can be nothing else but most happy.

[Luke 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">luk 21:13</span></span>

And it shall turn to you for (c) a testimony.

\(c\) This will be the result of your troubles and afflictions: they

dealing of your enemies, as well as of your steadfastness: A noble
saying, that the afflictions of the godly and holy men pertain to the
witness of the truth.

bravely.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">luk 21:20</span></span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">luk 21:23</span></span>

But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck, in
those days! for there shall be great distress in the land, and (e) wrath
upon this people.

[Luke 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">luk 21:24</span></span>

And they shall fall by the (f) edge of the sword, and shall be led away
captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the
Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.

\(f\) Literally, "mouth", for the Hebrews call the edge of a sword the
mouth because the edge of the sword bites.

[Luke 21:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">luk 21:25</span></span>

stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea
and the waves roaring;

of the Gentiles and the punishment of the Jews: And so he changes topics
from the destruction of Jerusalem to the history of the latter judgment.

[Luke 21:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#026)

\(5\) Men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those
things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be
shaken.

\(5\) After various severe trials the Lord will at last plainly appear
to deliver his Church.

[Luke 21:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">luk 21:29</span></span>

\(6\) And he spake to them a parable; Behold the fig tree, and all the
trees;

\(6\) We must be sober and watchful both day and night for the Lord's
coming, so that we are not taken unexpectedly.

[Luke 21:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">luk 21:35</span></span>

For as a snare shall it come (h) on all them that dwell on the face of
the whole earth.

\(h\) On all men wherever they may be.

[Luke 21:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#036)

Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to
escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to (i) stand before
the Son of man.

the presence and sentence of the Judge without fear.
