<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">psa 97:1</A></FONT></span></p>The (a) LORD reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the (b) multitude of isles be glad [thereof]. 
<p>
<p>(a) He shows that where God reigns, there is all happiness and spiritual joy. 
<p>
<p>(b) For the gospel will not only be preached in Judea, but through all isles and countries.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#002">Psalms 97:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">psa 97:2</A></FONT></span></p>(c) Clouds and darkness [are] round about him: righteousness and judgment [are] the habitation of his throne. 
<p>
<p>(c) He is thus described to keep his enemies in fear, who commonly contemn God's power.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#004">Psalms 97:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">psa 97:4</A></FONT></span></p>His lightnings enlightened the world: the earth saw, and (d) trembled. 
<p>
<p>(d) This fear does not bring the wicked to true obedience, but makes them run away from God.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#007">Psalms 97:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">psa 97:7</A></FONT></span></p>(e) Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols: worship him, (f) all [ye] gods. 
<p>
<p>(e) He signifies that God's judgments are ready to destroy the idolatry. 
<p>
<p>(f) Let all who are esteemed in the world fall down before him.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#008">Psalms 97:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">psa 97:8</A></FONT></span></p>Zion heard, and was glad; and the (g) daughters of Judah rejoiced because of thy judgments, O LORD. 
<p>
<p>(g) The Jews will have opportunity to rejoice that the Gentiles are made partakers with them of God's favour.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#010">Psalms 97:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">psa 97:10</A></FONT></span></p>Ye that (h) love the LORD, hate evil: he preserveth the souls of his saints; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked. 
<p>
<p>(h) He requires two things from his children: the one that they detest vice, the other, that they put their trust in God for their deliverance.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#011">Psalms 97:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">psa 97:11</A></FONT></span></p>(i) Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart. 
<p>
<p>(i) Though God's deliverance does not appear suddenly, yet it is sown and laid up in store for them.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#012">Psalms 97:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">psa 97:12</A></FONT></span></p>Rejoice in the LORD, ye righteous; and give thanks at the (k) remembrance of his holiness. 
<p>
<p>(k) Be mindful of his benefits and only trust in his defence.
