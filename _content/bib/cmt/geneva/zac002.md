### [Zechariah Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#001)

[Zechariah 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">zac 2:1</span></span>

I lifted up my eyes again, and looked, and behold a (a) man with a
measuring line in his hand.

\(a\) This is the angel who was Christ: for in respect of his office he
is often called an angel, but in respect of his eternal essence, is God,
and so called.

[Zechariah 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">zac 2:4</span></span>

And said to him, Run, speak to this (b) young man, saying, (c) Jerusalem
shall be inhabited \[as\] towns without walls for the multitude of men
and cattle in it:

\(b\) Meaning himself, Zechariah.

\(c\) Signifying the spiritual Jerusalem and Church under Christ, which
would be extended by the Gospel through all the world, and would need no
material walls, nor trust in any worldly strength, but would be safely
preserved and dwell in peace among all their enemies.

[Zechariah 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">zac 2:5</span></span>

For I, saith the LORD, will be to her a wall of (d) fire on every side,
and will (e) be the glory in the midst of her.

\(d\) To defend my Church, to strike fear in the enemies, and to destroy
them if they approach near.

\(e\) In me they will have their full felicity and glory.

[Zechariah 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">zac 2:6</span></span>

Ho, ho, \[come (f) forth\], and flee from the land of the north, saith
the LORD: for I have spread you abroad as the four (g) winds of the
heaven, saith the LORD.

\(f\) He calls to those who partly for fear, and partly for their own
case, remained still in captivity, and so preferred their own personal
benefits to the benefits of God promised in his Church.

\(g\) As it was I that scattered you, so I have power to restore you.

[Zechariah 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">zac 2:7</span></span>

\(h\) Deliver thyself, O Zion, that dwellest \[with\] the daughter of
Babylon.

\(h\) By fleeing from Babylon, and coming to the Church.

[Zechariah 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">zac 2:8</span></span>

For thus saith the LORD of hosts; After the (i) glory hath he sent me to
the nations which wasted you: for he that toucheth you toucheth the (k)
apple of his eye.

\(i\) Seeing that God had begun to show his grace among you by
delivering you, he continues the same still toward you, and therefore
sends me his angel and his Christ to defend you from your enemies, so
that they will not hurt you, neither along the way nor at home.

\(k\) You are so dear to God, that he can no more allow your enemies to
hurt you, than a man can endure to be thrust in the eye; ([Psa
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#008)).

[Zechariah 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">zac 2:9</span></span>

For, behold, I will shake my hand (l) upon them, and (m) they shall be a
spoil to their servants: and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath
(n) sent me.

\(l\) Upon the heathen your enemies.

\(m\) They will be your servants, as you have been theirs.

\(n\) This must necessarily be understood of Christ, who being God equal
with his Father, was sent, as he was Mediator to dwell in his Church and
to govern them.
