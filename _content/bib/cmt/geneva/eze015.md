### [Ezekiel Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#001)

[Ezekiel 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 15:2</span></span>

Son of man, What is the vine tree more than any tree, \[or than\] a
branch which is among the (a) trees of the forest?

\(a\) Which brings forth no fruit, no more than the other trees of the
forest do: meaning that if Jerusalem, which bore the name of his Church,
did not bring forth fruit it would be utterly destroyed.

[Ezekiel 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 15:7</span></span>

And I will set my face against them; they shall go out from \[one\] (b)
fire, and \[another\] fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that I
\[am\] the LORD, when I set my face against them.

\(b\) Though they escape one danger, yet another will take them.
