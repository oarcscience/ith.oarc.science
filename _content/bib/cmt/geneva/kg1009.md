<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg1 9:4</span></span>

And (a) if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, in
integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I
have commanded thee, \[and\] wilt keep my statutes and my judgments:

\(a\) If you walk in my fear, and withdraw yourself from the common
manner of men, who follow their sensualities.

\[But\] if ye shall at all turn from following me, ye or your children,
and will (b) not keep my commandments \[and\] my statutes which I have
set before you, but go and serve other gods, and worship them:

\(b\) God declares that disobedience against him, is the cause of his
displeasure, and so of all misery.

Then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and
this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my
sight; and Israel shall be a (c) proverb and a byword among all people:

\(c\) The world will make a mockery of you for the vile contempt and
abusing of God's most liberal benefit.

\(f\) Millo was as the town house or place of assembly which was open
above.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg1 9:19</span></span>

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#020)

of Israel,

\(h\) These were as bondmen and paid what was required, either labour or
money.

These \[were\] the chief of the officers that \[were\] over Solomon's
work, (i) five hundred and fifty, which bare rule over the people that
wrought in the work.

\(i\) The overseers of Solomon's works were divided into three parts:
the first contained 3300, the second 300, and the third 250 who were
Israelites. Here are the two last parts, which make 550. See ([Ch2
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#010)).

and twenty talents, and brought \[it\] to king Solomon.

mentioned who seem to have been employed for their wages.
