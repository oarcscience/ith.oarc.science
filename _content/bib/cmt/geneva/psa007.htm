<p>
<p>(c) If I did not reverence Saul for affinities sake, and preserved his life, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#008">Sa1 26:8-9</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#005">Psalms 7:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">psa 7:5</A></FONT></span></p>Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take [it]; yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay mine (d) honour in the dust. Selah.

<p>
<p>(g) As concerning my behaviour towards Saul and my enemies.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#009">Psalms 7:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">psa 7:9</A></FONT></span></p>Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the (h) hearts and reins.
