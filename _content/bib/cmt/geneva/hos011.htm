<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001">Hosea 11:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">hos 11:1</A></FONT></span></p>When Israel (a) [was] a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt. 
<p>
<p>(a) While the Israelites were in Egypt, and did not provoke my wrath by their malice and ingratitude.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#002">Hosea 11:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">hos 11:2</A></FONT></span></p>[As] they called them, so they (b) went from them: they sacrificed unto Baalim, and burned incense to graven images. 
<p>
<p>(b) They rebelled and went a contrary way when the Prophets called them to repentance.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#004">Hosea 11:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">hos 11:4</A></FONT></span></p>I drew them with cords (c) of a man, with bands of love: and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I laid meat unto them. 
<p>
<p>(c) That is, friendly, and not as beasts or slaves.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#005">Hosea 11:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">hos 11:5</A></FONT></span></p>He shall not return into the land of Egypt, but the Assyrian shall be his (d) king, because they refused to return. 
<p>
<p>(d) Seeing that they condemn all this kindness, they will be led captive into Assyria.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#007">Hosea 11:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">hos 11:7</A></FONT></span></p>And my people are bent to backsliding from me: though (e) they called them to the most High, none at all would exalt [him]. 
<p>
<p>(e) That is, the Prophets.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#008">Hosea 11:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">hos 11:8</A></FONT></span></p>(f) How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? [how] shall I deliver thee, Israel? how shall I make thee as (g) Admah? [how] shall I set thee as Zeboim? mine heart is turned within me, (h) my repentings are kindled together. 
<p>
<p>(f) God considers with himself, and that with a certain grief, how to punish them. 
<p>
<p>(g) Which were two of the cities that were destroyed with Sodom; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#023">Deu 29:23</A>). 
<p>
<p>(h) Meaning that his love with which he first loved them positioned him between doubt and assurance in terms of what to do: and in this appears his Fatherly affection, that his mercy toward his own will overcome his judgments, as he declares in the next verse.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#009">Hosea 11:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">hos 11:9</A></FONT></span></p>I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I [am] God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of thee: and I will not (i) enter into the city. 
<p>
<p>(i) To consume you, but will cause you to yield, and so have mercy on you: and this is meant of the final number who will walk after the Lord.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#011">Hosea 11:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">hos 11:11</A></FONT></span></p>(k) They shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria: and I will place them in their houses, saith the LORD. 
<p>
<p>(k) The Egyptians and the Assyrians will be afraid when the Lord maintains his people.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#012">Hosea 11:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">hos 11:12</A></FONT></span></p>Ephraim compasseth me about with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit: but Judah yet ruleth with (l) God, and is faithful with the saints. 
<p>
<p>(l) Governs their state according to God's word, and does not degenerate.
