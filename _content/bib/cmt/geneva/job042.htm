<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">job 42:2</A></FONT></span></p>I know that thou canst do every [thing], and [that] no (a) thought can be withholden from thee. 
<p>
<p>(a) No thought so secret but you see it, nor anything that you think but that you can bring it to pass.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#003">Job 42:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">job 42:3</A></FONT></span></p>Who [is] he that hideth counsel without (b) knowledge? therefore have I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for me, (c) which I knew not. 
<p>
<p>(b) Is there any but I? for this God laid to his charge, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#002">Job 38:2</A>). 
<p>
<p>(c) I confess in this my ignorance, and that I spoke of what I did not know.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#004">Job 42:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">job 42:4</A></FONT></span></p>Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of thee, (d) and declare thou unto me. 
<p>
<p>(d) He shows that he will be God's scholar to learn of him.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#005">Job 42:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">job 42:5</A></FONT></span></p>I have (e) heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee. 
<p>
<p>(e) I knew you only before by hearsay, but now you have caused me to feel what you are to me, that I may resign myself over to you.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#007">Job 42:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">job 42:7</A></FONT></span></p>And it was [so], that after the LORD had spoken these words unto Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me [the thing that is] (f) right, as my servant (g) Job [hath]. 
<p>
<p>(f) You took in hand an evil cause, in that you condemned him by his outward afflictions, and not comforted him with my mercies. 
<p>
<p>(g) Who had a good cause, but handled it evil.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#008">Job 42:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">job 42:8</A></FONT></span></p>Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall (h) pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you [after your] folly, in that ye have not spoken of me [the thing which is] right, like my servant Job. 
<p>
<p>(h) When you have reconciled yourselves to him for the faults that you have committed against him, he will pray for you, and I will hear him.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#010">Job 42:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">job 42:10</A></FONT></span></p>And the LORD turned the (i) captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before. 
<p>
<p>(i) He delivered him out of the affliction he was in.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#011">Job 42:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">job 42:11</A></FONT></span></p>Then came there unto him all his (k) brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one an earring of gold. 
<p>
<p>(k) That is, all his kindred, read (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#013">Job 19:13</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#012">Job 42:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">job 42:12</A></FONT></span></p>So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had (l) fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses. 
<p>
<p>(l) God made him twice as rich in cattle as he was before, and gave him as many children as he had taken from him.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#014">Job 42:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">job 42:14</A></FONT></span></p>And he called the name of the first, (m) Jemima; and the name of the second, (n) Kezia; and the name of the third, (o) Kerenhappuch. 
<p>
<p>(m) That is, of long life, or beautiful as the day. 
<p>
<p>(n) As pleasant as cassia or sweet spice. 
<p>
<p>(o) That is, the horn of beauty.
