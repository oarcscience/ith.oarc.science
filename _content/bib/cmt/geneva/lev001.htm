<p>
<p>The Argument - As God daily by most singular benefits declared himself mindful of his Church: he did not want them to have opportunity to trust either in themselves, or to depend on others, either for lack of physical things, or anything that belonged to his divine service and religion. Therefore he ordained various kinds of duties and sacrifices, to assure them of forgiveness for their offences (if they offered them in true faith and obedience.) Also he appointed the priests and levites, their apparel, offices, conversation and portion; he showed what feasts they should observe, and when. Moreover, he declares by these sacrifices and ceremonies that the reward of sin is death, and that without the blood of Christ the innocent Lamb, there can be no forgiveness of sins. Because they should not give priority to their own inventions (which God detested, as appears by the terrible example of Nadab and Abihu) he prescribed even to the least things, what they should do, what beasts they should offer and eat, what diseases were contagious and to be avoided, how they should purge all types of filthiness and pollution, whose company they should flee, what marriages were lawful, and what customs were profitable. After declaring these things, he promised favour and blessing to those who keep his laws, and threatened his curse to those who transgressed them. 
<p>
<p>(a) By this Moses declares that he taught nothing to the people but that which he received from God.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">lev 1:2</A></FONT></span></p>Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man of you bring an offering unto the LORD, ye shall bring your offering of the (b) cattle, [even] of the herd, and of the flock. 
<p>
<p>(b) So they could offer of no other sort, but of those who were commanded.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#003">Leviticus 1:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">lev 1:3</A></FONT></span></p>If his offering [be] a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the (c) tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD. 
<p>
<p>(c) Meaning, within the court of the tabernacle.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">lev 1:5</A></FONT></span></p>And (d) he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about upon the (e) altar that [is by] the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
<p>
<p>(d) A priest of the Levites. 
<p>
<p>(e) Of the burnt offering, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#001">Exo 27:1</A>).

<p>
<p>(f) Or a savour of rest, which pacifies the anger of the Lord.

<p>
<p>(g) Read (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#005">Lev 1:5</A>). 
<p>
<p>(h) Before the altar of the Lord.

<p>(i) The Hebrew word signifies to pinch off with the nail.

<p>(k) On the side of the court gate in the pans which stood with ashes; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#003">Exo 27:3</A>).
