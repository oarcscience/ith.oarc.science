Israel (a) asked the LORD, saying, (b) Who shall go up for us against
the Canaanites first, to fight against them?

\(a\) By the judgment of Urim; Read ([Exo
28:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#030); [Num
27:21](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#021); [Sa1
28:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#006))

\(b\) Who shall be our captain?

But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and (d)
cut off his thumbs and his great toes.

\(d\) This was God's just judgment, as the tyrant himself confesses,
that as he had done, so did he receive, ([Lev
24:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#019)).

Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken
it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the (e) city on
fire.

\(e\) Which was later built again, and possessed by the Jebusites, ([Sa2
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#006)).

[Judges 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#010)

Caleb said unto her, What wilt thou?

\(g\) Read ([Jos 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#018)).

And the children of the (h) Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up out of
the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of
Judah, which \[lieth\] in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelt
among the people.

\(h\) This was one of the names of Moses father in law, read ([Num
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#029)).

coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof.

\(i\) These cities and others were later possessed by the Philistines,
([Sa1 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#017)).

[Judges 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jdg 1:21</span></span>

And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that (k)
inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of
Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day.

\(k\) For after the tribe of Judah had burnt it, they built it again.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jdg 1:27</span></span>

Neither did Manasseh drive out \[the inhabitants of\] Bethshean and her
towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and her
towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns, nor the inhabitants
of Megiddo and her towns: (l) but the Canaanites would dwell in that
land.

\(l\) Wherefore God permitted the Canaanites to still dwell in the land,
