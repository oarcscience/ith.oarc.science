### [Isaiah Chapter 57](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#001)

[Isaiah 57:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 57:1</span></span>

The righteous perisheth, and no man layeth \[it\] to heart: and merciful
men \[are\] taken away, none considering that the righteous is taken
away (a) from the evil \[to come\].

\(a\) From the plague that is at hand, and also because God will punish
the wicked.

[Isaiah 57:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 57:2</span></span>

\(b\) He shall enter into peace: they shall rest in their beds, \[each
one\] walking \[in\] his uprightness.

\(b\) The soul of the righteous will be in joy, and their body will rest
in the grave to the time of the resurrection, because they walked before
the Lord.

[Isaiah 57:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 57:3</span></span>

But draw near here, ye (c) sons of the sorceress, the seed of the
adulterer and the harlot.

\(c\) He threatens the wicked hypocrites, who under the pretence of the
name of God's people, derided God's word and his promises: boasting
openly that they were the children of Abraham, but because they were not
faithful and obedient as Abraham was, he calls them bastards and the
children of sorcerers, who forsook God, and fled to wicked means for
comfort.

[Isaiah 57:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 57:5</span></span>

Inflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree, slaying the (d)
children in the valleys under the clefts of the rocks?

\(d\) Read ([Lev 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#021); [Kg2
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#010)).

[Isaiah 57:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 57:6</span></span>

Among the smooth \[stones\] (e) of the stream \[is\] thy portion; they,
they \[are\] thy lot: even to them hast thou poured a drink offering,
thou hast offered a meat offering. Should I receive comfort in (f)
these?

\(e\) Meaning every place was polluted with their idolatry: or every
fair stone they found they made into an idol.

\(f\) In the sacrifices which you offering before these idols thought
you served God.

[Isaiah 57:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 57:7</span></span>

Upon a lofty and high mountain hast thou set thy (g) bed: even there
thou wentest up to offer sacrifice.

\(g\) That is, your altars in an open place, like an impudent harlot,
that cares not for the sight of her husband.

[Isaiah 57:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 57:8</span></span>

Behind the (h) doors also and the door posts hast thou set up thy
remembrance: for thou hast uncovered \[thyself to another\] than me, and
hast gone up; thou hast (i) enlarged thy bed, and made thee \[a
covenant\] with them; thou didst love their bed where thou sawest
\[it\].

\(h\) Instead of setting up the word of God in the open places on the
posts and doors to have it in remembrance, ([Deu
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#009), [Deu
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#001)) you have set up signs and marks
of your idolatry in every place.

\(i\) That is, increased your idolatry more and more.

[Isaiah 57:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 57:9</span></span>

And thou wentest (k) to the king with ointment, and didst increase thy
perfumes, and didst send thy messengers far off, and didst debase
\[thyself even\] to hell.

\(k\) You sought the favour of the Assyrians by gifts and presents to
help you against the Egyptians and when they failed you sought the
Babylonians, and more and more tormented yourself.

[Isaiah 57:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 57:10</span></span>

Thou art wearied in the greatness of thy way; \[yet\] saidst thou not,
(l) There is no hope: thou (m) hast found the life of thy hand;
therefore thou wast not grieved.

\(l\) Although you saw all your labours to be in vain, yet would you
never acknowledge your fault and leave off.

\(m\) He derides their unprofitable diligence, who thought to have made
all sure, and yet were deceived.

[Isaiah 57:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 57:11</span></span>

And of whom hast thou been afraid or feared, that thou hast (n) lied,
and hast not remembered me, nor laid \[it\] to thy heart? have not I
held my peace even of (o) old, and thou fearest me not?

\(n\) Broken promises with me.

\(o\) Meaning, that the wicked abuse God's leniency, and grow to further
wickedness.

[Isaiah 57:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 57:12</span></span>

I will declare thy righteousness, (p) and thy works; for they shall not
profit thee.

\(p\) That is, your naughtiness, idolatry and impiety which the wicked
call God's service: thus he derides their obstinacy.

[Isaiah 57:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 57:13</span></span>

When thou criest, let thy companies deliver thee; but the wind (q) shall
carry them all away; vanity shall take \[them\]: but he that putteth his
trust in me shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holy mountain;

\(q\) Meaning, the Assyrians and others, whose help they looked for.

[Isaiah 57:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 57:14</span></span>

\(r\) And shall say, Cast ye up, cast ye up, prepare the way, take up
the stumblingblock out of the way of my people.

\(r\) God will say to Darius and Cyrus.

[Isaiah 57:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 57:16</span></span>

For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always angry: (s) for
the spirit should fail before me, and the souls \[which\] I have made.

\(s\) I will not use my power against frail man, whose life is but a
blast.

[Isaiah 57:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 57:17</span></span>

For the (t) iniquity of his covetousness I was angry, and smote him: I
hid myself, and was angry, and he went on backsliding in the way of his
heart.

\(t\) That is, for the vices and faults of the people, which is here
meant by covetousness.

[Isaiah 57:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 57:18</span></span>

I have seen his ways, and will (u) heal him: I will lead him also, and
restore comforts to him and to his mourners.

\(u\) Though they were obstinate, yet I did not withdraw my mercy from
them.

[Isaiah 57:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 57:19</span></span>

I create the (x) fruit of the lips; Peace, peace to \[him that is\] (y)
far off, and to \[him that is\] near, saith the LORD; and I will heal
him.

\(x\) That is, I frame the speech and words of my messengers who will
bring peace.

\(y\) As well to him that is in captivity as to him that remains at
home.

[Isaiah 57:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 57:20</span></span>

But the wicked \[are\] like the troubled sea, when it (z) cannot rest,
whose waters cast up mire and dirt.

\(z\) Their evil conscience always torments them and therefore they can
never have rest, ([Isa 48:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#022)).
