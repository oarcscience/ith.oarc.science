### [Isaiah Chapter 65](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#001)

[Isaiah 65:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 65:1</span></span>

I am sought by \[them that\] (a) asked not \[for me\]; I am found by
\[them that\] sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, to a nation
\[that\] was not called by my name.

\(a\) Meaning, the Gentiles who know not God, would seek him, when he
had moved their heart with his Holy Spirit, ([Rom
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#020)).

[Isaiah 65:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 65:2</span></span>

I have (b) spread out my hands all the day to a rebellious people, which
walketh in a way \[that is\] not good, after their own (c) thoughts;

\(b\) He shows the reason for the rejection of the Jews, because they
would not obey him or any admonition of his prophets, by whom he called
them continually and stretch out his hand to draw them.

\(c\) He shows that to delight in our own fantasies is the declining
from God and the beginning of all superstitions and idolatry.

[Isaiah 65:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 65:3</span></span>

A people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face; that
sacrificeth in (d) gardens, and burneth incense upon altars of (e)
brick;

\(d\) Which were dedicated to idols.

\(e\) Meaning their altars, which he thus named by contempt.

[Isaiah 65:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 65:4</span></span>

Which remain among the (f) graves, and lodge in the monuments, which eat
(g) swine's flesh, and broth of abominable \[things is in\] their
vessels;

\(f\) To consult with spirits, and to conjure devils, which was
forbidden.

\(g\) Which was contrary to God's commandment, ([Lev
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#007); [Deu
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#008)).

[Isaiah 65:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 65:5</span></span>

Which say, (h) Stand by thyself, come not near to me; for I am holier
than thou. These \[are\] a smoke in my nose, a fire that (i) burneth all
the day.

\(h\) He shows that hypocrisy is always joined with pride and contempt
of others.

\(i\) Their punishment will never have an end.

[Isaiah 65:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 65:6</span></span>

Behold, \[it is\] (k) written before me: I will not keep silence, but
will recompense, even recompense into their bosom,

\(k\) So that the remembrance of it cannot be forgotten.

[Isaiah 65:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 65:7</span></span>

Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers (l) together, saith
the LORD, who have burned incense upon the mountains, and blasphemed me
upon the hills: therefore will I measure their former work into their
bosom.

\(l\) Will be both punished together: and this declares how the children
are punished for their fathers faults, that is, when the same faults or
like are found in them.

[Isaiah 65:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 65:8</span></span>

Thus saith the LORD, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and
\[one\] saith, Destroy it not; for a (m) blessing \[is\] in it: so will
I do for my servants' sake, that I may not destroy them all.

\(m\) That is, it is profitable: meaning that God will not destroy the
faithful branches of his vineyard, when he destroys the rotten stocks,
that is, the hypocrites.

[Isaiah 65:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 65:10</span></span>

And (n) Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a
place for the herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me.

\(n\) Which was a plentiful place in Judea to feed sheep, as Achor was
for cattle.

[Isaiah 65:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 65:11</span></span>

But ye \[are\] they that forsake the LORD, that forget my holy mountain,
that prepare a table for that (o) troop, and that furnish the drink
offering to that number.

\(o\) By the multitude and number he means their innumerable idols of
whom they thought they could never have enough.

[Isaiah 65:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 65:12</span></span>

Therefore will I (p) number you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down
to the slaughter: because when I called, ye did not answer; when I (q)
spoke, ye did not hear; but did evil before my eyes, and did choose
\[that\] in which I delighted not.

\(p\) Seeing you cannot number your gods, I will number you with the
sword.

\(q\) By my prophets, whom you would not obey.

[Isaiah 65:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 65:13</span></span>

Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, my servants shall (r) eat,
but ye shall be hungry: behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be
thirsty: behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed:

\(r\) By these words, eat and drink, he means the blessed life of the
faithful, who have always had consolation and full contentment of all
things in their God, though sometimes they lack these corporal things.

[Isaiah 65:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 65:15</span></span>

And ye shall leave your name for a curse to my (s) chosen: for the Lord
GOD shall slay thee, and call his servants by (t) another name:

\(s\) Meaning, that he would call the Gentiles, who would abhor even the
very name of the Jews for their infidelities sake.

\(t\) Than by the name of the Jews.

[Isaiah 65:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 65:16</span></span>

That he who blesseth himself in the (u) earth shall bless himself in the
God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God
of truth; because the former (x) troubles are forgotten, and because
they are hid from my eyes.

\(u\) By blessing, and by swearing is meant the praising of God for his
benefits, and the true worshipping of him, who will not be only in
Judea, but through all the world.

\(x\) I will no longer permit my Church to be desolate as in times past.

[Isaiah 65:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 65:17</span></span>

For, behold, I create (y) new heavens and a new earth: and the former
shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.

\(y\) I will so altar and change the state of my church, that it will
seem to dwell in a new world.

[Isaiah 65:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 65:20</span></span>

There shall be no more from there an infant of days, nor an old man that
hath (z) not filled his days: for the child shall die an hundred years
old; but the sinner \[being\] (a) an hundred years old shall be
accursed.

\(z\) Meaning, in this wonderful restoration of the Church there would
be no weakness of youth, nor infirmities of age, but all would be fresh
and flourishing: and this is accomplished in the heavenly Jerusalem,
when all sins will cease, and the tears will be wiped away.

\(a\) By which he shows that the infidels and unrepentant sinners have
no part of this benediction.

[Isaiah 65:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 65:21</span></span>

And they shall (b) build houses, and inhabit \[them\]; and they shall
plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.

\(b\) He proposes to the faithful the blessings which are contained in
the law, and so under temporal things comprehends the spiritual
promises.

[Isaiah 65:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">isa 65:25</span></span>

The (c) wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat
straw like the ox: and dust \[shall be\] the serpent's food. They shall
not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the LORD.

\(c\) Read ([Isa 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#006)).
