<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#003">Proverbs 5:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">pro 5:3</A></FONT></span></p>For the lips (a) of a strange woman drop [as] an honeycomb, and her mouth [is] smoother than (b) oil: 
<p>
<p>(a) That is, a harlot who gives herself to someone other than her husband. 
<p>
<p>(b) By oil and honey he means flattering and crafty enticements.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#005">Proverbs 5:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">pro 5:5</A></FONT></span></p>Her (c) feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell. 
<p>
<p>(c) All her doings lead to destruction.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#006">Proverbs 5:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">pro 5:6</A></FONT></span></p>Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are (d) moveable, [that] thou canst not know [them]. 
<p>
<p>(d) She has always new means to allure to wickedness.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#009">Proverbs 5:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">pro 5:9</A></FONT></span></p>Lest thou give thine (e) honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel: 
<p>
<p>(e) That is, your strength and goods to her who will have no pity on you as is read of Samson and the prodigal son.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#010">Proverbs 5:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">pro 5:10</A></FONT></span></p>Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy (f) labours [be] in the house of a stranger; 
<p>
<p>(f) The goods gotten by your travel.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#014">Proverbs 5:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">pro 5:14</A></FONT></span></p>I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and (g) assembly. 
<p>
<p>(g) Although I was faithfully instructed in the truth, yet I almost fell to utter shame and destruction nonetheless, by good bringing up in the assembly of the godly.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#015">Proverbs 5:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">pro 5:15</A></FONT></span></p>Drink waters out of (h) thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well. 
<p>
<p>(h) He teaches us sobriety exhorting us to live of our own labours and to be beneficial to the godly who want.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#017">Proverbs 5:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">pro 5:17</A></FONT></span></p>Let them be only (i) thine own, and not strangers' with thee. 
<p>
<p>(i) Distribute them not to the wicked and infidels, but reserve them for yourself, your family and them who are of the household of faith.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#018">Proverbs 5:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">pro 5:18</A></FONT></span></p>Let thy (k) fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy (l) youth. 
<p>
<p>(k) Your children who will come from you in great abundance showing that God blesses marriage and curses whoredom. 
<p>
<p>(l) Who you married in your youth.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#021">Proverbs 5:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">pro 5:21</A></FONT></span></p>For the ways of man [are] before the (m) eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings. 
<p>
<p>(m) He declares that unless a man joins to his wife both in heart and in outward conversation, he will not escape the judgments of God.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#023">Proverbs 5:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">pro 5:23</A></FONT></span></p>He shall (n) die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray. 
<p>
<p>(n) Because he will not give ear to God's word and be admonished.
