### [Psalms Chapter 123](../../../bib/kjv/psa123.htm#001)

[Psalms 123:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa123.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 123:2</span></span>

Behold, as the eyes of (a) servants \[look\] unto the hand of their
masters, \[and\] as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress;
so our eyes \[wait\] upon the LORD our God, until that he have mercy
upon us.

\(a\) He compares the condition of the godly, to servants who are
destitute of all help, assuring that when all other help fails, God is
always at hand and like himself.

[Psalms 123:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa123.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 123:3</span></span>

Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us: for we are (b)
exceedingly filled with contempt.

\(b\) He declares that when the faithful are so full that they cannot
endure the oppression and scorning of the wicked any more, there is
always help above, if with hungry desires they call for it.
