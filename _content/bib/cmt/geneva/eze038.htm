<p>
<p>(f) That is, to molest and destroy the Church.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#011">Ezekiel 38:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">eze 38:11</A></FONT></span></p>And thou shalt say, I will go up to the land of unwalled villages; (g) I will go to them that are at rest, that dwell safely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates, 
<p>
<p>(g) Meaning Israel, which had now been destroyed and was not yet built again: declaring by this the simplicity of the godly, who seek not so much to fortify themselves by outward force, as to depend on the providence and goodness of God.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#013">Ezekiel 38:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">eze 38:13</A></FONT></span></p>Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all its young lions, shall say to thee, (h) Art thou come to take a spoil? hast thou gathered thy company to take a prey? to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to take a great spoil? 
<p>

<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#016">Ezekiel 38:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">eze 38:16</A></FONT></span></p>And thou shalt come against my people of Israel, as a cloud to cover the land; it shall be in the (k) latter days, and I will bring thee against my land, that the nations may know me, when I (l) shall be sanctified in thee, O Gog, before their eyes.

<p>
<p>(m) By this he declares that no affliction can come to the Church of which they have not been advertised before to teach them to endure all things with more patience when they know that God has so ordained.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#020">Ezekiel 38:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">eze 38:20</A></FONT></span></p>So that the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the field, and all creeping animals that creep upon the earth, and all the men that [are] upon the face of the earth, shall shake at my presence, and the mountains shall be overturned, and the (n) steep places shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground. 
<p>
<p>(n) All means by which man would think to save himself will fail, the affliction in those days will be so great, and the enemies destruction will be so terrible.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">eze 38:21</A></FONT></span></p>And I will call for a sword against him (o) throughout all my mountains, saith the Lord GOD: every man's sword shall be against his brother.
