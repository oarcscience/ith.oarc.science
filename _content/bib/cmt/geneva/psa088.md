### [Psalms Chapter 88](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#001)

[Psalms 88:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 88:1</span></span>

"A Song \[or\] Psalm for the sons of Korah, to the chief Musician upon
Mahalath (a) Leannoth, Maschil of Heman the Ezrahite." O LORD God of my
salvation, I have cried day \[and\] night (b) before thee:

\(a\) That is, to humble. It was the beginning of a song by which tune
this psalm was sung.

\(b\) Though many cry in their sorrows, yet they cry not earnestly to
God for remedy as he did whom he confessed to be the author of his
salvation.

[Psalms 88:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 88:5</span></span>

\(c\) Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom
thou rememberest no more: and they are cut off from thy (d) hand.

\(c\) For he who is dead is free from all cares and business of this
life and thus he says because he was unprofitable for all matters
concerning man's life, and as it were cut off from this world.

\(d\) That is, from your providence and care, which is meant according
to the judgment of the flesh.

[Psalms 88:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 88:7</span></span>

Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted \[me\] with all
thy (e) waves. Selah.

\(e\) The storms of your wrath have overwhelmed me.

[Psalms 88:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 88:8</span></span>

Thou hast put away mine (f) acquaintance far from me; thou hast made me
an abomination unto them: (g) \[I am\] shut up, and I cannot come forth.

\(f\) He attributes the loss and displeasure of his friends to God's
providence by which he partly punishes and partly tries his.

\(g\) I see no end to my sorrows.

[Psalms 88:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 88:9</span></span>

\(h\) Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction: LORD, I have called
daily upon thee, I have stretched out my hands unto thee.

\(h\) My eyes and face declare my sorrows.

[Psalms 88:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 88:10</span></span>

Wilt thou shew (i) wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise \[and\]
praise thee? Selah.

\(i\) He shows that the time is more convenient for God to help when men
call to him in their dangers, than to tarry till they are dead, and then
raise them up again.

[Psalms 88:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 88:12</span></span>

Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy righteousness in the
land (k) of forgetfulness?

\(k\) That is, in the grave, where only the body lies without all sense
and remembrance.

[Psalms 88:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 88:15</span></span>

I \[am\] afflicted and ready to die (l) from \[my\] youth up: \[while\]
I suffer thy terrors I am distracted.

\(l\) I am always in great dangers and sorrows as though my life would
utterly be cut off every moment.
