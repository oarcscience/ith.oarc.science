<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">neh 4:2</A></FONT></span></p>And he spake before his (a) brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, What do these (b) feeble Jews? will they fortify themselves? will they sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned? 
<p>
<p>(a) Of his companions who dwelt in Samaria. 
<p>
<p>(b) Thus the wicked who do not consider that God's power is always ready to defend his, mock them as thought they were weak and feeble.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#004">Nehemiah 4:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">neh 4:4</A></FONT></span></p>(c) Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn their reproach upon their own head, and give them for a prey (d) in the land of captivity: 
<p>
<p>(c) This is the remedy that the children of God have against the derision and threatenings of their enemies, to flee to God by prayer. 
<p>
<p>(d) Let them be spoiled and led away captive.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#005">Nehemiah 4:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">neh 4:5</A></FONT></span></p>And cover not their (e) iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee: for they have provoked [thee] to anger before the builders. 
<p>
<p>(e) Let the plagues declare to the world that they set themselves against you and your Church: that he prays only having respect for God's glory and not for any private affection, or grudge.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#012">Nehemiah 4:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">neh 4:12</A></FONT></span></p>And it came to pass, that when the Jews which dwelt by them came, they said unto us (f) ten times, (g) From all places whence ye shall return unto us [they will be upon you]. 
<p>
<p>(f) That is, often. 
<p>
<p>(g) They who brought the tidings said this, when you leave your work, and go either to eat or to rest, your enemies will assail you.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#014">Nehemiah 4:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">neh 4:14</A></FONT></span></p>And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of them: (h) remember the Lord, [which is] great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses. 
<p>
<p>(h) Who is always on hand to deliver his out of danger: and therefore seeing they should fight for the maintenance of God's glory, and for the preservation of their own lives and of theirs, he encourages them to play the valiant men.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#016">Nehemiah 4:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">neh 4:16</A></FONT></span></p>And it came to pass from that time forth, [that] the half of my servants wrought in the work, and the other half of them held both the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the habergeons; and the rulers [were] (i) behind all the house of Judah. 
<p>
<p>(i) To overcome them and encourage them in their work.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#020">Nehemiah 4:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">neh 4:20</A></FONT></span></p>In what place [therefore] ye hear the sound of the trumpet, (k) resort ye thither unto us: our God shall fight for us. 
<p>
<p>(k) Meaning, to resist their enemies, if need be.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#023">Nehemiah 4:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">neh 4:23</A></FONT></span></p>So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard which followed me, none of us put off our clothes, [saving that] every one put them off (l) for washing. 
<p>
<p>(l) That is, when they purified themselves or else when they washed their clothes.
