### [2 Chronicles Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 17:3</span></span>

And the LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the (a) first
ways of his father David, and sought not unto (b) Baalim;

\(a\) That is, his virtues meaning before he had committed with
Bathsheba, and against Uriah.

\(b\) Did not seek help from strange Gods.

[2 Chronicles 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 17:6</span></span>

And his heart was (c) lifted up in the ways of the LORD: moreover he
took away the high places and groves out of Judah.

\(c\) He gave himself wholly to serve the Lord.

[2 Chronicles 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 17:7</span></span>

Also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes, \[even\] to
Benhail, and to Obadiah, and to Zechariah, and to Nethaneel, and to
Michaiah, to (d) teach in the cities of Judah.

\(d\) He knew it was in vain to profess religion, unless such were
appointed who could instruct the people in the same, and had authority
to put away all idolatry.

[2 Chronicles 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch2 17:10</span></span>

And the fear of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that
\[were\] round about Judah, so that they (e) made no war against
Jehoshaphat.

\(e\) Thus God prospers all who with a pure heart seek his glory, and
keeps their enemies in fear, so that they are not able to execute their
rage against them.

[2 Chronicles 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch2 17:16</span></span>

And next him \[was\] Amasiah the son of Zichri, (f) who willingly
offered himself unto the LORD; and with him two hundred thousand mighty
men of valour.

\(f\) Meaning, who was a Nazarite.

[2 Chronicles 17:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch2 17:19</span></span>

These (g) waited on the king, beside \[those\] whom the king put in the
fenced cities throughout all Judah.

\(g\) That is, they were at his ordinary guard.
