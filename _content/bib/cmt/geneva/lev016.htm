<p>
<p>(a) The high priest entered into the holiest of holies just once a year in the month of September.

<p>
<p>(b) In Hebrew it is called Azazel, which some say is a mountain near Sinai, where this goat was sent. Rather it is called the scapegoat because it was not offered but sent into the desert, as in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#011">Lev 16:11</A>).

<p>
<p>(c) The holiest of holies.

<p>
<p>(d) That is, on the side which was toward the people: for the head of the sanctuary stood westward.
