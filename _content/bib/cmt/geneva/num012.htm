<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">num 12:1</A></FONT></span></p>And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married: for he had married (a) an Ethiopian woman. 
<p>
<p>(a) Zipporah, Moses' wife, was a Midianite, and because Midian bordered on Ethiopia, it is sometimes referred to in the scriptures by this name.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#003">Numbers 12:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">num 12:3</A></FONT></span></p>(Now the man Moses [was] very (b) meek, above all the men which [were] upon the face of the earth.) 
<p>
<p>(b) And so endured their grudging, although he knew of them.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#006">Numbers 12:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">num 12:6</A></FONT></span></p>And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you, [I] the LORD will make myself known unto him in a (c) vision, [and] will speak unto him in a dream. 
<p>
<p>(c) These were the two ordinary means.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#007">Numbers 12:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">num 12:7</A></FONT></span></p>My servant Moses [is] not so, who [is] faithful (d) in all mine house. 
<p>
<p>(d) In all Israel which was his Church.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#008">Numbers 12:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">num 12:8</A></FONT></span></p>With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in dark speeches; and the similitude of the LORD shall he (e) behold: wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses? 
<p>
<p>(e) As far as any man was able to comprehend, which he calls his back parts, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#023">Exo 33:23</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#010">Numbers 12:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">num 12:10</A></FONT></span></p>And the cloud departed from off the (f) tabernacle; and, behold, Miriam [became] leprous, [white] as snow: and Aaron looked upon Miriam, and, behold, [she was] leprous. 
<p>
<p>(f) From the door of the tabernacle.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#012">Numbers 12:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">num 12:12</A></FONT></span></p>Let her not be as one (g) dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he cometh out of his mother's womb. 
<p>
<p>(g) As a child that is stillborn, as if it is only the skin.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#014">Numbers 12:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">num 12:14</A></FONT></span></p>And the LORD said unto Moses, If her father had but (h) spit in her face, should she not be ashamed seven days? let her be shut out from the camp seven days, and after that let her be received in [again]. 
<p>
<p>(h) In his displeasure.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">num 12:16</A></FONT></span></p>And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth, and pitched in the wilderness of (a) Paran. 
<p>
<p>(a) That is, in Rithmah, which was in Paran, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#018">Num 33:18</A>).
