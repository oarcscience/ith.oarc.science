<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#001">Micah 7:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">mic 7:1</A></FONT></span></p>Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the (a) summer fruits, as the grapegleanings of the vintage: [there is] no cluster to eat: my soul desired the firstripe fruit. 
<p>
<p>(a) The Prophet takes upon himself the voice of the earth, which complains that all her fruits are gone, so that none are left: that is, that there is no godly man remaining, for all are given to cruelty and deceit, so that none spares his own brother.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#002">Micah 7:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">mic 7:2</A></FONT></span></p>The good [man] is perished out of the earth: and [there is] none upright among men: (b) they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man his brother with a net. 
<p>
<p>(b) He shows that the prince, the judge, and the rich man are all linked together to do evil, and to disguise the deeds of one another.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#003">Micah 7:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">mic 7:3</A></FONT></span></p>That they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the prince asketh, and the judge [asketh] for a reward; and the (c) great [man], he uttereth his mischievous desire: so (d) they wrap it up. 
<p>
<p>(c) That is, the rich man that is able to give money, abstains from no wickedness or injury. 
<p>
<p>(d) These men agree among themselves, and conspire with one another to do evil.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#004">Micah 7:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">mic 7:4</A></FONT></span></p>The best of them [is] as (e) a brier: the most upright [is sharper] than a thorn hedge: the day of (f) thy watchmen [and] thy visitation cometh; now shall be their perplexity. 
<p>
<p>(e) They that are of most estimation and are counted most honest among them, are but thorns and briers to prick. 
<p>
<p>(f) Meaning the prophets and governors.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#007">Micah 7:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">mic 7:7</A></FONT></span></p>Therefore (g) I will look unto the LORD; I will wait for the God of my salvation: my God will hear me. 
<p>
<p>(g) The Prophet shows that the only remedy for the godly in desperate evils, is to flee to God for help.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#008">Micah 7:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">mic 7:8</A></FONT></span></p>Rejoice not against me, (h) O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, the LORD [shall be] a light unto me. 
<p>
<p>(h) This is spoken in the voice of the Church, which calls the malignant church her enemy.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#011">Micah 7:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">mic 7:11</A></FONT></span></p>[In] (i) the day that thy walls are to be built, [in] that day shall (k) the decree be far removed.

<p>
<p>(l) When the Church will be restored, those that were enemies before will come out of all the corners of the world to her, so that neither fortresses, rivers, seas, nor mountains will be able to stop them.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">mic 7:13</A></FONT></span></p>Notwithstanding the land shall be desolate because of them that dwell therein, for the fruit of (m) their doings. 
<p>
<p>(m) Before this grace appears, he shows how grievously the hypocrites themselves will be punished, seeing that the earth itself, which cannot sin, will be made waste because of their wickedness.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">mic 7:14</A></FONT></span></p>(n) Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage, which dwell solitarily [in] the wood, in the midst of Carmel: let them feed [in] Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.

<p>
<p>(p) They will be as dumb men, and dare brag no more. 
<p>
<p>(q) They will be astonished and afraid to hear men speak, lest they should hear of their destruction.

<p>
<p>(r) They will fall flat on the ground because of fear.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#018">Micah 7:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">mic 7:18</A></FONT></span></p>Who [is] a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and (s) passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth [in] mercy. 
<p>
<p>(s) As though he did not see it, ignoring it.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#019">Micah 7:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">mic 7:19</A></FONT></span></p>He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all (t) their sins into the depths of the sea.

<p>
<p>(u) The Church is assured that God will perform the truth of his merciful promise, which he had made long ago to Abraham, and to all that would apprehend the promise by faith.
