<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#001">Zephaniah 3:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">zep 3:1</A></FONT></span></p>Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppressing (a) city! 
<p>
<p>(a) That is, Jerusalem.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#003">Zephaniah 3:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">zep 3:3</A></FONT></span></p>Her princes within her [are] roaring lions; her judges [are] evening wolves; they (b) gnaw not the bones till the morrow. 
<p>
<p>(b) They are so greedy, that they eat up bones and all.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#005">Zephaniah 3:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">zep 3:5</A></FONT></span></p>The (c) just LORD [is] in the midst thereof; he will not do iniquity: every morning doth he bring his judgment to light, he faileth not; but the unjust knoweth no shame. 
<p>
<p>(c) The wicked thus boasted that God was ever among them, but the Prophet answers that that cannot excuse their wickedness: for God will not bear with their sins. Yet he did patiently abide and sent his Prophets continually to call them to repentance, but he profited nothing.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#006">Zephaniah 3:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">zep 3:6</A></FONT></span></p>I have (d) cut off the nations: their towers are desolate; I made their streets waste, that none passeth by: their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, that there is none inhabitant. 
<p>
<p>(d) By the destruction of other nations he shows that the Jews should have learned to fear God.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#007">Zephaniah 3:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">zep 3:7</A></FONT></span></p>I said, Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive instruction; so their dwelling should not be cut off, howsoever I punished them: but (e) they rose early, [and] corrupted all their doings. 
<p>
<p>(e) They were most earnest and ready to do wickedly.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#008">Zephaniah 3:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">zep 3:8</A></FONT></span></p>Therefore (f) wait ye upon me, saith the LORD, until the day that I rise up to the prey: for my determination [is] to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, [even] all my fierce anger: for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy. 
<p>
<p>(f) Seeing that you will not repent, you can expect my vengeance as well as other nations.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#009">Zephaniah 3:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">zep 3:9</A></FONT></span></p>For (g) then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the LORD, to serve him with one consent. 
<p>
<p>(g) Lest any should then think that God's glory should have perished when Judah was destroyed, he shows that he will proclaim his grace through all the world.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#010">Zephaniah 3:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">zep 3:10</A></FONT></span></p>From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, [even] the (h) daughter of my dispersed, shall bring mine offering. 
<p>
<p>(h) That is, the Jews will come as well as the Gentiles: which is to be understood as referring to the time of the Gospel.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#011">Zephaniah 3:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">zep 3:11</A></FONT></span></p>In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for (i) all thy doings, wherein thou hast transgressed against me: for then I will take away out of the midst of thee them that rejoice in thy pride, and thou shalt no more be haughty because of my holy mountain. 
<p>
<p>(i) For they will have full remission of their sins, and the hypocrites who boasted of the temple, which was also your pride in times past, will be taken from you.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#015">Zephaniah 3:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">zep 3:15</A></FONT></span></p>The LORD hath taken away thy (k) judgments, he hath cast out thine (l) enemy: the king of Israel, [even] the LORD, [is] in the midst of (m) thee: thou shalt not see evil any more. 
<p>
<p>(k) That is, the punishment for your sin. 
<p>
<p>(l) As the Assyrians, Chaldaeans, Egyptians, and other nations. 
<p>
<p>(m) To defend you, as by your sins you have put him away, and left yourself naked, as in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#025">Exo 32:25</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#017">Zephaniah 3:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">zep 3:17</A></FONT></span></p>The LORD thy God in the midst of thee [is] mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in (n) his love, he will joy over thee with singing. 
<p>
<p>(n) Signifying, that God delights to show his love and great affection toward his Church.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#018">Zephaniah 3:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">zep 3:18</A></FONT></span></p>I will gather [them that are] sorrowful for the solemn assembly, [who] are of thee, [to whom] the reproach of (o) it [was] a burden. 
<p>
<p>(o) That is, those that were held in hatred and reviled for the Church, and because of their religion.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#019">Zephaniah 3:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">zep 3:19</A></FONT></span></p>Behold, at that time I will undo all that afflict thee: and I will (p) save her that halteth, and gather her that was driven out; and I will get them praise and fame in every (q) land where they have been put to shame. 
<p>
<p>(p) I will deliver the Church, which now is afflicted, as in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#006">Mic 4:6</A>). 
<p>
<p>(q) As among the Assyrians and Chaldaeans, who mocked them and put them to shame.
