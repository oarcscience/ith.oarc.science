### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#001)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 13:1</span></span>

Saul reigned (a) one year; and when he had reigned (b) two years over
Israel,

\(a\) While these things were done.

\(b\) Before he took upon himself the state of a king.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 13:3</span></span>

And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that \[was\] in (c)
Geba, and the Philistines heard \[of it\]. And Saul blew the (d) trumpet
throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.

\(c\) Of Kirjath-jearim, where the ark was, ([Sa1
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#005)).

\(d\) That everyone should prepare themselves to fight.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa1 13:5</span></span>

And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel,
thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the
sand which \[is\] on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and
pitched in Michmash, eastward from (e) Bethaven.

\(e\) Which was also called Beth-el, in the tribe of Benjamin.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa1 13:7</span></span>

And \[some of\] the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of (f) Gad and
Gilead. As for Saul, he \[was\] yet in Gilgal, and all the people
followed him trembling.

\(f\) Where the two tribes and the half remained.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa1 13:8</span></span>

And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel \[had
appointed\]: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were (g)
scattered from him.

\(g\) Thinking that the absence of the prophet was a sign, that they
would lose the victory.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa1 13:11</span></span>

And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that
the people were (h) scattered from me, and \[that\] thou camest not
within the days appointed, and \[that\] the Philistines gathered
themselves together at Michmash;

\(h\) Though these causes seem sufficient in man's judgment: yet because
they had not the word of God, they turned to his destruction.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa1 13:13</span></span>

And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept
the commandment of the LORD thy (i) God, which he commanded thee: for
now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.

\(i\) Who willed you to obey him, and rest on the words spoken by his
prophet.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa1 13:14</span></span>

But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought him a (k)
man after his own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him \[to be\]
captain over his people, because thou hast not kept \[that\] which the
LORD commanded thee.

\(k\) That is, David.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa1 13:15</span></span>

And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto (l) Gibeah of
Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people \[that were\] present with him,
about six hundred men.

\(l\) And went to his city Ramah.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa1 13:18</span></span>

And another company turned the way \[to\] Bethhoron: and (m) another
company turned \[to\] the way of the border that looketh to the valley
of Zeboim toward the wilderness.

\(m\) So that to man's judgment these three armies would have overrun
the whole country.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">sa1 13:22</span></span>

So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither (n)
sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that \[were\]
with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was
there found.

\(n\) To declare that the victory only came from God, and not by their
force.
