### [Luke Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#001)

[Luke 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 19:1</span></span>

And (1) \[Jesus\] entered and passed through Jericho.

\(1\) Christ especially guides by his grace those who seem to be
furthest from it.

[Luke 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">luk 19:2</span></span>

And, behold, \[there was\] a man named Zacchaeus, which was the (a)
chief among the publicans, and he was rich.

\(a\) The overseer and head of the publicans who were there together:
for the publicans were divided into companies, as we may gather from
many places in the orations of Cicero.

[Luke 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">luk 19:7</span></span>

\(2\) And when they saw \[it\], they all murmured, saying, That he was
gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner.

\(2\) The world forsakes the grace of God, and yet is unwilling that it
should be bestowed upon others.

[Luke 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">luk 19:8</span></span>

\(3\) And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord; Behold, Lord, the
half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from
any man by (b) false accusation, I restore \[him\] fourfold.

\(3\) The example of true repentance is known by the effect.

\(b\) By falsely accusing any man: and this agrees most fitly to the
master of the tax gatherers: for commonly they have this practice among
them when they rob and spoil the commonwealth, that they claim to be
concerned for nothing else except the profit of the commonwealth, and
under this pretence they are thieves, and to such an extent that if men
reprove them and try to redress their robbery and thievery, they cry out
that the commonwealth is hindered.

[Luke 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">luk 19:9</span></span>

And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this house,
forsomuch as he also is a (c) son of Abraham.

\(c\) Beloved of God, one that walks in the steps of Abraham's faith:
and we gather that salvation came to that house because they received
the blessing as Abraham had. (Ed.)

[Luke 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">luk 19:11</span></span>

\(4\) And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable,
because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the
kingdom of God should immediately appear.

\(4\) We must patiently wait for the judgment of God which will be
revealed in his time.

[Luke 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">luk 19:13</span></span>

\(5\) And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds, and
said unto them, Occupy till I come.

\(5\) There are three sorts of men in the Church: the one sort fall from
Christ whom they do not see; the other, according to their God given
position, bestow the gifts which they have received from God to his
glory, with great pains and diligence; the third live idly and do no
good. As for the first, the Lord when he comes will justly punish them
in his time; the second he will bless according to the pains which they
have taken; and as for the slothful and idle persons, he will punish
them like the first.

[Luke 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">luk 19:16</span></span>

Then came the first, saying, Lord, (d) thy pound hath gained ten pounds.

\(d\) This was a piece of money which the Greeks used, and was worth
about one hundred pence, which is about ten crowns.

[Luke 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">luk 19:20</span></span>

\(6\) And another came, saying, Lord, behold, \[here is\] thy pound,
which I have kept laid up in a napkin:

\(6\) Against those who idly spend their life in deliberating and in
contemplation.

[Luke 19:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">luk 19:23</span></span>

Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the (e) bank, that at my
coming I might have required mine own with usury?

\(e\) To the bankers and money changers. Usury or loaning money at
interest is strictly forbidden by the Bible, ([Exo
22:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#025); [Deu
23:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#019)). Even a rate as low as one
per cent interest was disallowed, ([Neh
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#011)). This servant had already told
two lies. First he said the master was an austere or harsh man. This is
a lie for the Lord is merciful and gracious. Next he called his master a
thief because he reaped where he did not sow. Finally the master said to
him that why did you not add insult to injury and loan the money out at
interest so you could call your master a "usurer" too! If the servant
had done this, his master would have been responsible for his servant's
actions and guilty of usury. (Ed.)

[Luke 19:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">luk 19:28</span></span>

And when he had thus spoken, (f) he went before, ascending up to
Jerusalem.

\(f\) The disciples were staggered and stopped by what Christ said, but
Christ goes on boldly even though death was before his eyes.

[Luke 19:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">luk 19:29</span></span>

\(7\) And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and
Bethany, at the mount called \[the mount\] of Olives, he sent two of his
disciples,

\(7\) Christ shows in his own person that his kingdom is not of this
world.

[Luke 19:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">luk 19:39</span></span>

\(8\) And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him,
Master, rebuke thy disciples.

\(8\) When those linger who ought to preach and set forth the kingdom of
God the most, he will extraordinarily raise up others in spite of them.

[Luke 19:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">luk 19:41</span></span>

\(9\) And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,

\(9\) Christ is not delighted with destruction, no not even of the
wicked.

[Luke 19:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">luk 19:42</span></span>

\(g\) Saying, (h) If thou hadst known, even thou, (i) at least in this
(k) thy day, the things \[which belong\] unto thy (l) peace! but now
they are hid from thine eyes.

\(g\) Christ stops his speech, which partly shows how moved he was with
compassion over the destruction of the city that was surely to come: and
partly to reprove them for their treachery and stubbornness against him,
such as has not been heard of before.

\(h\) You at the very least, O Jerusalem, to whom the message was
properly sent.

\(i\) If after slaying so many prophets, and so often refusing me, the
Lord of the prophets, if only now, especially in my last coming to you,
you had any concern for yourself.

\(k\) The good and prosperous time is called the day of this city.

\(l\) That is, those things in which your happiness stands.

[Luke 19:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">luk 19:44</span></span>

And shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee;
and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou
knewest not (m) the time of thy visitation.

\(m\) That is, this very instant in which God visited you.

[Luke 19:45](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#045)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">luk 19:45</span></span>

\(10\) And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold
therein, and them that bought;

\(10\) Christ shows after his entry into Jerusalem by a visible sign
that it is his duty, given and admonished unto him by his Father, to
purge the temple.
