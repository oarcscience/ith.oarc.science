<p>
<p>(a) Because of my oath and promise made to Jonathan, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#015">Sa1 20:15</A>). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#003">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 9:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">sa2 9:3</A></FONT></span></p>And the king said, [Is] there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may shew the (b) kindness of God unto him? And Ziba said unto the king, Jonathan hath yet a son, [which is] lame on [his] feet. 
<p>
<p>(b) Such mercy as shall be acceptable to God.

<p>
<p>(c) Who was also called Eliam the father of Bathsheba, David's wife.

<p>
<p>(d) Meaning, a despised person.

Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants. 
<p>
<p>(e) Be ye provident overseers and governors of his lands, that they may be profitable.

(f) As for Mephibosheth, [said the king], he shall eat at my table, as one of the king's sons. 
<p>
<p>(f) That Mephibosheth may have all things at commandment, as becomes a king's son.
