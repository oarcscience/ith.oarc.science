<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#001">Deuteronomy 21:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">deu 21:1</A></FONT></span></p>If [one] be found (a) slain in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it, lying in the field, [and] it be not known who hath slain him: 
<p>
<p>(a) This law declares how horrible murder is, seeing that because of one man a whole country will be punished, unless remedy is found.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#004">Deuteronomy 21:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">deu 21:4</A></FONT></span></p>And the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough (b) valley, which is neither eared nor sown, and shall strike off the heifer's neck there in the valley: 
<p>
<p>(b) That the blood shed of the innocent beasts in a solitary place, might make them abhor the fact.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#008">Deuteronomy 21:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">deu 21:8</A></FONT></span></p>Be merciful, (c) O LORD, unto thy people Israel, whom thou hast redeemed, and lay not innocent blood unto thy people of Israel's charge. And the blood shall be forgiven them. 
<p>
<p>(c) This was the prayer, which the priests made in the audience of the people.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#012">Deuteronomy 21:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">deu 21:12</A></FONT></span></p>Then thou shalt bring her home to thine house; (d) and she shall shave her head, and pare her nails; 
<p>
<p>(d) Signifying that her former life must be changed before she could be joined to the people of God.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#013">Deuteronomy 21:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">deu 21:13</A></FONT></span></p>And she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and shall remain in thine house, (e) and bewail her father and her mother a full month: and after that thou shalt go in unto her, and be her husband, and she shall be thy (f) wife. 
<p>
<p>(e) As having renounced parents and country. 
<p>
<p>(f) This was only allowed in the wars, otherwise the Israelites could not marry strangers.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#015">Deuteronomy 21:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">deu 21:15</A></FONT></span></p>If a man have two wives, one beloved, and another (g) hated, and they have born him children, [both] the beloved and the hated; and [if] the firstborn son be hers that was hated: 
<p>
<p>(g) This declares that the plurality of wives came from a corrupt affection.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#017">Deuteronomy 21:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">deu 21:17</A></FONT></span></p>But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated [for] the firstborn, by giving him a (h) double portion of all that he hath: for he [is] the beginning of his strength; the right of the firstborn [is] (i) his. 
<p>
<p>(h) As much as to two of the others. 
<p>
<p>(i) Unless he is unworthy, as Reuben, Jacob's son, was.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#018">Deuteronomy 21:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">deu 21:18</A></FONT></span></p>If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his (k) mother, and [that], when they have chastened him, will not hearken unto them: 
<p>
<p>(k) For it is the mother's duty also to instruct her children.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#021">Deuteronomy 21:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">deu 21:21</A></FONT></span></p>And all the men of his city shall (l) stone him with stones, that he die: so shalt thou put evil away from among you; and all Israel shall hear, and fear. 
<p>
<p>(l) A death which was also appointed for blasphemers and idolaters: so that to disobey the parents is most horrible.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#023">Deuteronomy 21:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">deu 21:23</A></FONT></span></p>His body shall not remain (m) all night upon the tree, but thou shalt in any wise bury him that day; (for he that is hanged [is] accursed of God;) that thy land be not defiled, which the LORD thy God giveth thee [for] an inheritance. 
<p>
<p>(m) For God's law is satisfied by his death, and nature abhors cruelty.
