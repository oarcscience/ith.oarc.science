<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#001">Psalms 45:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">psa 45:1</A></FONT></span></p>"To the chief Musician upon (a) Shoshannim, for the sons of Korah, Maschil, A Song of (b) loves." My heart is inditing a good matter: I speak of the things which I have made touching the king: my tongue [is] the pen of a ready writer. 
<p>
<p>(a) This was a certain tune of an instrument. 
<p>
<p>(b) Of that perfect love that ought to be between the husband and the wife.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#002">Psalms 45:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">psa 45:2</A></FONT></span></p>Thou art (c) fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever. 
<p>
<p>(c) Solomon's beauty and eloquence to win favour with his people, and his power to overcome his enemies, is here described.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#004">Psalms 45:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">psa 45:4</A></FONT></span></p>And in thy majesty (d) ride prosperously because of truth and meekness [and] righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things. 
<p>
<p>(d) He alludes to them, who ride in chariots in their triumphs, showing that the quiet state of a kingdom stands in truth, meekness and justice, and not in worldly pomp and vanity.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#006">Psalms 45:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">psa 45:6</A></FONT></span></p>Thy (e) throne, O God, [is] for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom [is] a right sceptre. 
<p>
<p>(e) Under this figure of this kingdom of justice is set forth the everlasting kingdom of Christ.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#007">Psalms 45:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">psa 45:7</A></FONT></span></p>Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath (f) anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows. 
<p>
<p>(f) Has established your kingdom as the figure of Christ, which is the peace and joy of the Church.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#008">Psalms 45:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">psa 45:8</A></FONT></span></p>All thy garments [smell] of myrrh, and aloes, [and] cassia, out of the ivory palaces, (g) whereby they have made thee glad. 
<p>
<p>(g) In which the people made you joyful to see them give thanks and rejoice for you.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#009">Psalms 45:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">psa 45:9</A></FONT></span></p>Kings' daughters [were] among thy honourable women: upon thy right hand did stand the (h) queen in gold of Ophir. 
<p>
<p>(h) Though he had many king's daughters among his wives, yet he found Pharaoh's daughter best.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#010">Psalms 45:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">psa 45:10</A></FONT></span></p>(i) Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father's house; 
<p>
<p>(i) Under the figure of Pharaoh's daughter, he shows that the Church must cast off all carnal affections to obey Christ only.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#012">Psalms 45:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">psa 45:12</A></FONT></span></p>And the (k) daughter of Tyre [shall be there] with a gift; [even] the rich among the people shall intreat thy favour. 
<p>
<p>(k) He signifies that many of those who are rich will be benefactors to the Church, although they do not give perfect obedience to the Gospel.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#013">Psalms 45:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">psa 45:13</A></FONT></span></p>The king's daughter [is] all glorious (l) within: her clothing [is] of wrought gold. 
<p>
<p>(l) There is nothing feigned or hypocritical but she is glorious both within and without: and even though the Church has not always had this outward glory, the fault is to be imputed only to their own ingratitude.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#016">Psalms 45:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">psa 45:16</A></FONT></span></p>Instead of thy fathers shall be thy (m) children, whom thou mayest make princes (n) in all the earth. 
<p>
<p>(m) They will have greater graces than their fathers. 
<p>
<p>(n) He signifies the great compass of Christ's kingdom, which will be sufficient to enrich all his members.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#017">Psalms 45:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">psa 45:17</A></FONT></span></p>I will make thy (o) name to be remembered in all generations: therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever. 
<p>
<p>(o) This must only be referred to Christ and not to Solomon.
