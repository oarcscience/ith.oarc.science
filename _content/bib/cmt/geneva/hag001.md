### [Haggai Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#001)

[Haggai 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hag 1:1</span></span>

In the second year of (a) Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the
first day of the month, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet
unto (b) Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to
Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, saying,

The Argument - When the time of the seventy years captivity prophesied
by Jeremiah was expired, God raised up Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi,
to comfort the Jews, and to exhort them to the building of the temple,
which was a figure of the spiritual Temple and Church of God, whose
perfection and excellency depended on Christ. And because all were given
to their own pleasures and benefits, he declares that that plague of
famine, which God then sent among them, was a just reward for their
ingratitude, in that they condemned God's honour, who had delivered
them. Yet he comforts them, if they will return to the Lord, with the
promise of great felicity, since the Lord will finish the work that he
has begun, and send Christ whom he had promised, and by whom they would
attain to perfect joy and glory.

\(a\) Who was the son of Histaspis and the third king of the Persians,
as some think.

\(b\) Because the building of the temple began to cease, by reason that
the people were discouraged by their enemies: and if these two notable
men had need to be stirred up and admonished of their duties, what will
we think of other governors, whose doings are either against God, or
very cold in his cause?

[Haggai 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">hag 1:2</span></span>

Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, This people say, The time is
not come, the time (c) that the LORD'S house should be built.

\(c\) Not that they condemned the building of it, but they preferred
policy and personal profit to religion, being content with small
beginnings.

[Haggai 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hag 1:4</span></span>

\[Is it\] time for you, O ye, to dwell in your (d) cieled houses, and
this house \[lie\] waste?

\(d\) Showing that they sought not only their necessities, but their
very pleasures before God's honour.

[Haggai 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">hag 1:6</span></span>

\(e\) Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have not
enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye clothe you, but
there is none warm; and he that earneth wages earneth wages \[to put
it\] into a bag with holes.

\(e\) Consider the plagues of God upon you for preferring your policies
to his religion, and because you do not seek him above all else.

[Haggai 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">hag 1:8</span></span>

Go (f) up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house; and (g)
I will take pleasure in it, and I will (h) be glorified, saith the LORD.

\(f\) Meaning, that they should leave their own benefits, and go forward
in the building of God's temple, and in the setting forth of his
religion.

\(g\) That is, I will hear your prayers according to my promise; ([Kg1
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#022), [Kg1
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#029)).

\(h\) That is, my glory will be set forth by you.

[Haggai 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">hag 1:9</span></span>

Ye looked for much, and, lo, \[it came\] to little; and when ye brought
\[it\] home, I did blow (i) upon it. Why? saith the LORD of hosts.
Because of mine house that \[is\] waste, and ye run every man unto his
own house.

\(i\) And so bring it to nothing.

[Haggai 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">hag 1:12</span></span>

Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Josedech,
the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the (k)
voice of the LORD their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet, as the
LORD their God had sent him, and the people did fear before the LORD.

\(k\) This declares that God was the author of the doctrine, and that
Haggai was but the minister, as in ([Exo
14:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#031)), ([Jdg
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#020); [Act
15:28](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#028)).

[Haggai 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">hag 1:14</span></span>

And the LORD stirred up (l) the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of
Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of
Josedech, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the
people; and they came and did work in the house of the LORD of hosts,
their God,

\(l\) Which declares that men are unable and dull to serve the Lord,
neither can they obey his word or his messengers, before God reforms
their hearts, and gives them new spirits; ([Joh
6:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#044)).
