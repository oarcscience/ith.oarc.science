<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">sa1 23:1</A></FONT></span></p>Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight against (a) Keilah, and they rob the threshingfloors. 
<p>
<p>(a) Which was a city in the tribe of Judah, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#044">Jos 15:44</A>). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#003">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">sa1 23:3</A></FONT></span></p>And David's men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in (b) Judah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines? 
<p>
<p>(b) That is, in the midst of Judah, much more when we come to the borders against our enemies. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#006">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">sa1 23:6</A></FONT></span></p>And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, [that] he came down [with] an (c) ephod in his hand. 
<p>
<p>(c) By God's providence the ephod was preserved and kept with David the true king. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#009">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">sa1 23:9</A></FONT></span></p>And David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, (d) Bring hither the ephod. 
<p>
<p>(d) To consult with the Lord by Urim and Thummim. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#014">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">sa1 23:14</A></FONT></span></p>And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God (e) delivered him not into his hand. 
<p>
<p>(e) No power nor policy can prevail against God's children, but when he appoints the time. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#017">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">sa1 23:17</A></FONT></span></p>And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee; and thou shalt be (f) king over Israel, and I shall be next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth. 
<p>
<p>(f) Jonathan assured David, that God would accomplish his promise, and that his father warred against his own conscience. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#021">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">sa1 23:21</A></FONT></span></p>And Saul said, (g) Blessed [be] ye of the LORD; for ye have compassion on me. 
<p>
<p>(g) the Lord recompense this friendship. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#023">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">sa1 23:23</A></FONT></span></p>See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be in the (h) land, that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of Judah. 
<p>
<p>(h) In your country of Ziph, which is in Judah. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#025">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:25</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_025">sa1 23:25</A></FONT></span></p>Saul also and his men went to seek [him]. And they told David: wherefore he came down into a rock, and abode in the wilderness of (i) Maon. And when Saul heard [that], he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon. 
<p>
<p>(i) Which was also in the tribe of Judah, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#055">Jos 15:55</A>). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#027">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:27</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_027">sa1 23:27</A></FONT></span></p>But there came a (k) messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and come; for the Philistines have invaded the land. 
<p>
<p>(k) Thus the Lord can pull back the bridle of the tyrants and deliver his out of the lion's mouth. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#028">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:28</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_028">sa1 23:28</A></FONT></span></p>Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place (l) Selahammahlekoth. 
<p>
<p>(l) That is, stone of division, because there they divided themselves one from another. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#029">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:29</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_029">sa1 23:29</A></FONT></span></p>And David went up from thence, and dwelt in (a) strong holds at Engedi. 
<p>
<p>(a) That is, in strong places, which were defended by nature.
