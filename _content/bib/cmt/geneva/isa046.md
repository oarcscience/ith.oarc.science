### [Isaiah Chapter 46](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#001)

[Isaiah 46:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 46:1</span></span>

Bel boweth down, (a) Nebo stoopeth, their idols were upon the (b)
beasts, and upon the cattle: your carriages \[were\] heavily loaded;
\[they were\] a burden to the weary \[beast\].

\(a\) These were the chief idols of Babylon.

\(b\) Because they were of gold and silver, the Medes and Persians
carried them away.

[Isaiah 46:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 46:2</span></span>

\(c\) They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the
burden, but (d) themselves have gone into captivity.

\(c\) The beasts that carried the idols fell down under their burden.

\(d\) He derides the idols, who had neither soul nor sense.

[Isaiah 46:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 46:3</span></span>

Hearken to me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of
Israel, which are (e) borne \[by me\] from the birth, which are carried
from the womb:

\(e\) He shows the difference between the idols and the true God; for
they must be carried by others, but God himself carries his, as in ([Deu
32:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#011)).

[Isaiah 46:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 46:4</span></span>

And \[even\] to \[your\] old age I \[am\] he; and \[even\] to gray hairs
will I carry \[you\]: (f) have made, and I will bear; even I will carry,
and will deliver \[you\].

\(f\) Seeing I have begotten you, I will nourish and preserve you
forever.

[Isaiah 46:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 46:5</span></span>

To whom will ye liken me, and make \[me\] equal, and (g) compare me,
that we may be like?

\(g\) The people of God setting their own calamity, and the flourishing
estate of the Babylonians, would be tempted to think that their God was
not so mighty as the idols of their enemies: therefore he describes the
original of all the idols to make them to be abhorred by all men:
showing that the most that can be spoken in their commendation, is but
to prove them vile.

[Isaiah 46:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 46:8</span></span>

Remember this, and show yourselves men: bring \[it\] again to (h) mind,
O ye transgressors.

\(h\) Become wise, meaning, that all idolaters are without wit or sense,
like mad men.

[Isaiah 46:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 46:11</span></span>

Calling a ravenous (i) bird from the east, the man that executeth my (k)
counsel from a far country: yea, I have spoken \[it\], I will also bring
it to pass; I have purposed \[it\], I will also perform it.

\(i\) That is, Cyrus, who will come as swift as a bird and fight against
Babylon.

\(k\) Him by whom I have appointed to execute that which I have
determined.

[Isaiah 46:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 46:12</span></span>

Hearken to me, ye stubborn in heart, that \[are\] far from (l)
righteousness:

\(l\) Who by your incredulity would prevent the performance of my
promise.

[Isaiah 46:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 46:13</span></span>

I bring (m) near my righteousness; it shall not be far off, and my
salvation shall not delay: and I will place salvation in Zion for Israel
my glory.

\(m\) He shows that man's incredulity cannot abolish the promise of God,
([Rom 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#003)).
