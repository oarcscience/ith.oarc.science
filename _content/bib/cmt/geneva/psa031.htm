<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#004">Psalms 31:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">psa 31:4</A></FONT></span></p>Pull me out of the (b) net that they have laid privily for me: for thou [art] my strength. 
<p>
<p>(b) Preserve me from the crafty counsels and subtle practise of my enemies.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#005">Psalms 31:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">psa 31:5</A></FONT></span></p>Into thine (c) hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O LORD God of truth.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">psa 31:6</A></FONT></span></p>I have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I (d) trust in the LORD. 
<p>
<p>(d) This affection should be in all God's children to hate whatever is not grounded on a sure trust in God, as deceitful and vain.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#008">Psalms 31:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">psa 31:8</A></FONT></span></p>And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: thou hast set my feet in a (e) large room. 
<p>

<p>
<p>(g) My enemies had drawn all men to their part against me, even my chief friends.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#013">Psalms 31:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">psa 31:13</A></FONT></span></p>For I have heard the slander of (i) many: fear [was] on every side: while they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my life. 
<p>
<p>(i) They who were in authority condemned me as a wicked doer.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#014">Psalms 31:14</A></p>

<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#015">Psalms 31:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">psa 31:15</A></FONT></span></p>My (l) times [are] in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me. 
<p>
<p>(l) Whatever changes come, you govern them by your providence.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#017">Psalms 31:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">psa 31:17</A></FONT></span></p>Let me not be ashamed, O LORD; for I have called upon thee: let the wicked be ashamed, [and] let them be (m) silent in the grave. 
<p>
<p>(m) Let death destroy them to the intent that they may hurt no more.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">psa 31:20</A></FONT></span></p>Thou shalt hide them in the (o) secret of thy presence from the pride of man: thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues. 
<p>
<p>(o) That is, in a place where they will have your comfort, and be hid safely from the enemies pride.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#021">Psalms 31:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">psa 31:21</A></FONT></span></p>Blessed [be] the LORD: for he hath shewed me his marvellous kindness in a (p) strong city.
