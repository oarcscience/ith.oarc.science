<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#001">Psalms 72:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">psa 72:1</A></FONT></span></p>"[A Psalm] (a) for Solomon." Give the king thy (b) judgments, O God, and thy righteousness unto the king's (c) son. 
<p>
<p>(a) Composed by David concerning the reign of his son Solomon. 
<p>
<p>(b) Imbue the king with the Spirit of wisdom and justice, that he reign not as the worldly tyrants do. 
<p>
<p>(c) That is, to his posterity.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#003">Psalms 72:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">psa 72:3</A></FONT></span></p>The (d) mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little hills, by righteousness. 
<p>
<p>(d) When justice reigns, even the places most barren will be enriched with your blessings.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#004">Psalms 72:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">psa 72:4</A></FONT></span></p>He shall (e) judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor. 
<p>
<p>(e) He shows why the sword is committed to Kings that is, to defend the innocent, and suppress the wicked.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#005">Psalms 72:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">psa 72:5</A></FONT></span></p>They shall (f) fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure, throughout all generations. 
<p>
<p>(f) The people will embrace your true religion, when you give a king who rules according to your word.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#006">Psalms 72:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">psa 72:6</A></FONT></span></p>He shall come (g) down like rain upon the mown grass: as showers [that] water the earth. 
<p>
<p>(g) As this is true in all godly kings, so it is chiefly verified in Christ, who with his heavenly dew, makes his Church ever to flourish.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#008">Psalms 72:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">psa 72:8</A></FONT></span></p>He shall have dominion also from (h) sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth. 
<p>
<p>(h) That is, from the Red sea to the sea called the Syriacum, and from Euphrates forward, meaning, that Christ's kingdom would be large and universal.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#010">Psalms 72:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">psa 72:10</A></FONT></span></p>The kings of (i) Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents: the kings (k) of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts. 
<p>
<p>(i) Of Cilicia, and of all other countries beyond the sea, which he means by the isles. 
<p>
<p>(k) That is, of Arabia that rich country, of which Sheba was a part bordering on Ethiopia.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#014">Psalms 72:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">psa 72:14</A></FONT></span></p>He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence: and (l) precious shall their blood be in his sight. 
<p>
<p>(l) Though tyrants pause not to shed blood, yet this godly king will preserve his subjects from all kinds of wrong.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#015">Psalms 72:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">psa 72:15</A></FONT></span></p>And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the (m) gold of Sheba: prayer also shall be made for him continually; [and] daily shall he be praised. 
<p>
<p>(m) God will both prosper his life and make the people willing to obey him.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#016">Psalms 72:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">psa 72:16</A></FONT></span></p>There shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains; the (n) fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: and [they] of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth. 
<p>
<p>(n) Under such a king will be great plenty, both of fruit and also of the increase of mankind.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#017">Psalms 72:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">psa 72:17</A></FONT></span></p>His name shall endure for ever: his name shall be continued as long as the sun: and [men] shall be blessed in him: all nations shall call (o) him blessed. 
<p>
<p>(o) They will pray to God for his continuance and know that God prospers them for his sake.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#018">Psalms 72:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">psa 72:18</A></FONT></span></p>Blessed [be] the LORD God, the God of Israel, who only doeth (p) wondrous things. 
<p>
<p>(p) He confesses that unless God miraculously preserves his people neither the king nor the kingdom can continue.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#020">Psalms 72:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">psa 72:20</A></FONT></span></p>The (q) prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended. 
<p>
<p>(q) Concerning his son Solomon.
