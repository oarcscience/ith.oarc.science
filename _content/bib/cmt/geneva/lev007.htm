<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">lev 7:1</A></FONT></span></p>Likewise this [is] the law of the (a) trespass offering: it [is] most holy. 
<p>
<p>(a) Which is for the smaller sins, and such as are committed by ignorance.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#002">Leviticus 7:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">lev 7:2</A></FONT></span></p>In the place (b) where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill the trespass offering: and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle round about upon the altar. 
<p>
<p>(b) At the court gate.

<p>
<p>(c) the high priest.

<p>
<p>(d) The same ceremonies, even though this word trespass signifies less then sin. 
<p>
<p>(e) Meaning, the rest which is left and not burnt.

<p>
<p>(f) Because it had no oil or liquor.

<p>
<p>(g) Peace offerings contain a confession and thanksgiving for a benefit received, and also a vow, and free offering to receive a benefit.

<p>
<p>(h) If he makes a vow to offer: or else the flesh of the peace offerings must be eaten the same day.

<p>
<p>(i) The sin for which he offered shall remain.

<p>(k) After it is sacrificed. 
<p>
<p>(l) Of the peace offering that is clean.
