<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#001">Psalms 58:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">psa 58:1</A></FONT></span></p>"To the chief Musician, Altaschith, Michtam of David." Do ye indeed speak righteousness, O (a) congregation? do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men? 
<p>
<p>(a) You counsellors of Saul, who under pretence of consulting for the common wealth, conspire my death being an innocent.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#002">Psalms 58:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">psa 58:2</A></FONT></span></p>Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of (b) your hands in the earth. 
<p>
<p>(b) You are not ashamed to execute that cruelty publicly, which you have imagined in your hearts.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#003">Psalms 58:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">psa 58:3</A></FONT></span></p>The wicked (c) are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies. 
<p>
<p>(c) That is, enemies to the people of God even from their birth.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#004">Psalms 58:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">psa 58:4</A></FONT></span></p>Their poison [is] like the poison of a serpent: [they are] like the deaf (d) adder [that] stoppeth her ear; 
<p>
<p>(d) They pass in malice and subtilty the crafty serpent who could preserve himself by stopping his ears from the enchanter.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#006">Psalms 58:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">psa 58:6</A></FONT></span></p>Break their (e) teeth, O God, in their mouth: break out the great teeth of the young lions, O LORD. 
<p>
<p>(e) Take away all opportunity and means by which they hurt.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#007">Psalms 58:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">psa 58:7</A></FONT></span></p>Let them (f) melt away as waters [which] run continually: [when] he bendeth [his bow to shoot] his arrows, let them be as cut in pieces. 
<p>
<p>(f) Considering God's divine power, he shows that God in a moment can destroy their force of which they brag.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#009">Psalms 58:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">psa 58:9</A></FONT></span></p>(g) Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in [his] wrath. 
<p>
<p>(g) As flesh is taken raw out of the pot before the water boils: so he desires God to destroy their enterprises before they bring them to pass.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#010">Psalms 58:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">psa 58:10</A></FONT></span></p>The righteous shall (h) rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he shall wash his feet in the (i) blood of the wicked. 
<p>
<p>(h) With a pure affection. 
<p>
<p>(i) Their punishment and slaughter will be so great.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#011">Psalms 58:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">psa 58:11</A></FONT></span></p>So that a man shall say, (k) Verily [there is] a reward for the righteous: verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth. 
<p>
<p>(k) Seeing God governs all by his providence, he must put a difference between the godly and the wicked.
