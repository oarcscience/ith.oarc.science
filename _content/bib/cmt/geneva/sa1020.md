### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#001)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 20:1</span></span>

And David (a) fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before
Jonathan, What have I done? what \[is\] mine iniquity? and what \[is\]
my sin before thy father, that he seeketh my life?

\(a\) For Saul was detained, and prophesied a day and a night by God's
providence, that David might have time to escape.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 20:3</span></span>

And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth that I
have found grace in thine eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan know
this, lest he be grieved: but truly \[as\] the LORD liveth, and \[as\]
thy soul liveth, \[there is\] but a (b) step between me and death.

\(b\) I am in great danger of death.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa1 20:5</span></span>

And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to morrow \[is\] the (c) new moon,
and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go, that
I may hide myself in the field unto the third \[day\] at even.

\(c\) At what time there would be a solemn sacrifice, ([Num
28:11](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#011)), to which they added peace
offerings and feasts.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 20:6</span></span>

If thy father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked \[leave\]
of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city: for \[there is\] a (d)
yearly sacrifice there for all the family.

\(d\) Read ([Sa1 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#021)).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa1 20:9</span></span>

And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee: for if I knew certainly that
evil were (e) determined by my father to come upon thee, then would not
I tell it thee?

\(e\) That he were fully determined.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa1 20:10</span></span>

Then said David to Jonathan, Who (f) shall tell me? or what \[if\] thy
father answer thee roughly?

\(f\) If your father favours me.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 20:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa1 20:13</span></span>

The LORD (g) do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it please my father
\[to do\] thee evil, then I will shew it thee, and send thee away, that
thou mayest go in peace: and the LORD be with thee, as he hath been with
my father.

\(g\) The Lord punish me most grievously.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa1 20:14</span></span>

And thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindness of the
LORD, (h) that I die not:

\(h\) I know that if you were given the kingdom now, you would not
destroy me, but show yourself friendly to my posterity.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 20:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">sa1 20:22</span></span>

But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows \[are\] beyond
thee; go thy way: for the (i) LORD hath sent thee away.

\(i\) The Lord is the author of your departure.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">sa1 20:26</span></span>

Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day: for he thought,
Something hath befallen him, he \[is\] not (k) clean; surely he \[is\]
not clean.

\(k\) Yet he might have some business to let him.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 20:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">sa1 20:27</span></span>

And it came to pass on the morrow, \[which was\] the second \[day\] of
the month, that David's place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan his
son, Wherefore cometh not (l) the son of Jesse to meat, neither
yesterday, nor to day?

\(l\) Thus he speaks contemptuously of David.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 20:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">sa1 20:29</span></span>

And he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in
the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me \[to be there\]: and now,
if I have found favour in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and
see my (n) brethren. Therefore he cometh not unto the king's table.

\(n\) Meaning, all his kinsfolk.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 20:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">sa1 20:30</span></span>

Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him,
Thou (o) son of the perverse rebellious \[woman\], do not I know that
thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion, and unto the
confusion of thy mother's nakedness?

\(o\) You are always contrary to me as your mother is.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 20:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">sa1 20:32</span></span>

And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore
shall he be (p) slain? what hath he done?

\(p\) For it was too great tyranny to put one to death and not to give a
reason why.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 20:35](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">sa1 20:35</span></span>

And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the
field (q) at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.

\(q\) For this was the third day, as it was agreed on in ([Sa1
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#005)).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 20:38](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">sa1 20:38</span></span>

And Jonathan cried after the lad, (r) Make speed, haste, stay not. And
Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.

\(r\) By these words be admonished David what he should do.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 20:41](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">sa1 20:41</span></span>

\[And\] as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of \[a place\]
toward the (s) south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed
himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with
another, until David exceeded.

\(s\) It seems that he shot on the north side of the stone, least the
boy should have seen David.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 20:42](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">sa1 20:42</span></span>

And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have (t) sworn
both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be between me and
thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever. And he arose and
departed: and Jonathan went into the city.

\(t\) Which oath he calls the covenant of the Lord in ([Sa1
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#008)).
