<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">nah 2:1</A></FONT></span></p>(a) He that dasheth in pieces is come up before thy face: keep the munition, watch the way, make [thy] loins strong, fortify [thy] power mightily. 
<p>
<p>(a) That is, Nebuchadnezzar is in readiness to destroy the Assyrians: and the Prophet derides the undertakings of the Assyrians who prepared to resist him.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#002">Nahum 2:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">nah 2:2</A></FONT></span></p>For the LORD hath (b) turned away the excellency of Jacob, as the excellency of Israel: for the emptiers have emptied them out, and (c) marred their vine branches. 
<p>
<p>(b) Seeing God has punished his own people Judah and Israel, he will now punish the enemies by whom he scourged them; read (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#012">Isa 10:12</A>). 
<p>
<p>(c) Signifying that the Israelites were utterly destroyed.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#003">Nahum 2:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">nah 2:3</A></FONT></span></p>The shield of his mighty men is made red, (d) the valiant men [are] in scarlet: the chariots [shall be] with flaming torches in the day of his preparation, and (e) the fir trees shall be terribly shaken. 
<p>
<p>(d) Both to put fear into the enemy, and also that they themselves should not so soon detect blood among one another, to discourage them. 
<p>
<p>(e) Meaning their spears would shake and crash together.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#005">Nahum 2:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">nah 2:5</A></FONT></span></p>(f) He shall recount his worthies: they shall stumble in their walk; they shall make haste to the wall thereof, and the defence shall be prepared. 
<p>
<p>(f) Then the Assyrians will seek by all means to gather their power, but all things will fail them.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#008">Nahum 2:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">nah 2:8</A></FONT></span></p>But Nineveh [is] of (g) old like a pool of water: yet they shall flee away. Stand, stand, [shall they cry]; but none shall look back. 
<p>
<p>(g) The Assyrians will flatter themselves and say that Nineveh is so ancient that it can never perish, and is as a fishpool, whose waters cannot be touched by those that walk on the banks. But they will be scattered, and will not look back, even if men call them.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#009">Nahum 2:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">nah 2:9</A></FONT></span></p>(h) Take ye the spoil of silver, take the spoil of gold: for [there is] none end of the store [and] glory out of all the pleasant furniture. 
<p>
<p>(h) God commands the enemies to spoil Nineveh, and promises them infinite riches and treasures.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#010">Nahum 2:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">nah 2:10</A></FONT></span></p>(i) She is empty, and void, and waste: and the heart melteth, and the knees smite together, and much pain [is] in all loins, and the faces (k) of them all gather blackness. 
<p>
<p>(i) That is, Nineveh, and the men of it will be after this manner. 
<p>
<p>(k) See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#006">Joe 2:6</A>  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#011">Nahum 2:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">nah 2:11</A></FONT></span></p>Where [is] the (l) dwelling of the lions, and the feedingplace of the young lions, where the lion, [even] the old lion, walked, [and] the lion's whelp, and none made [them] afraid? 
<p>
<p>(l) Meaning, Nineveh, whose inhabitants were cruel like the lions, and given to all oppression, and spared no violence or tyranny to provide for their wives and children.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#013">Nahum 2:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">nah 2:13</A></FONT></span></p>Behold, I [am] against thee, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will burn her chariots in the (m) smoke, and the sword shall devour thy young lions: and I will cut off thy prey from the earth, and the voice of thy (n) messengers shall no more be heard. 
<p>
<p>(m) That is, as soon as my wrath begins to burn. 
<p>
<p>(n) Signifying the heralds, who were accustomed to proclaim war. Some read, "of you gum teeth", with which Nineveh was accustomed to bruise the bones of the poor.
