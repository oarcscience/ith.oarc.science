<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#001">Zechariah 10:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">zac 10:1</A></FONT></span></p>Ask ye of the (a) LORD rain in the time of the latter rain; [so] the LORD shall make bright clouds, and give them showers of rain, to every one grass in the field. 
<p>
<p>(a) The Prophet reproves the Jews, because by their own infidelity they turn away God's promised graces, and so famine came by God's just judgment. Therefore to avoid this plague, he exhorts them to turn to God, and to pray in faith to him, and so he will give them abundance.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#002">Zechariah 10:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">zac 10:2</A></FONT></span></p>For the (b) idols have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie, and have told false dreams; they comfort in vain: therefore (c) they went their way as a flock, they were troubled, because [there was] no shepherd. 
<p>
<p>(b) He calls to remembrance God's punishments in times past, because they trusted not in him, but in their idols and sorcerers who always deceived them. 
<p>
<p>(c) That is, the Jews went into captivity.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#003">Zechariah 10:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">zac 10:3</A></FONT></span></p>My anger was kindled against the shepherds, and I punished the (d) goats: for the LORD of hosts hath visited his flock the house of Judah, and hath made them as (e) his majestic horse in the battle. 
<p>
<p>(d) Meaning, the cruel governors who did oppress the poor sheep; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#016">Eze 34:16-17</A>). 
<p>
<p>(e) He will be merciful to his Church, and cherish them as a king or prince does his best horse, which will be for his own use in war.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#004">Zechariah 10:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">zac 10:4</A></FONT></span></p>Out (f) of him came forth the corner, out of him the nail, out of him the battle bow, out of him every (g) oppressor together. 
<p>
<p>(f) Out of Judah will the chief governor proceed, who will be as a corner to uphold the building, and as a nail to fasten it together. 
<p>
<p>(g) Over their enemies.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#006">Zechariah 10:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">zac 10:6</A></FONT></span></p>And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the (h) house of Joseph, and I will bring them again to place them; for I have mercy upon them: and they shall be as though I had not cast them off: for I [am] the LORD their God, and will hear them. 
<p>
<p>(h) That is, the ten tribes, which would be united under Christ to the rest of the Church.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#008">Zechariah 10:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">zac 10:8</A></FONT></span></p>I will (i) hiss for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed them: and they shall increase as they have increased. 
<p>
<p>(i) By which he declares the power of God, who needs no great preparation when he will deliver his own: for with a gesture or hiss he can call them suddenly from all places.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#009">Zechariah 10:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">zac 10:9</A></FONT></span></p>And I will (k) sow them among the people: and they shall remember me in far countries; and they shall live with their children, and (l) turn again. 
<p>
<p>(k) Though they will yet be scattered and seem to be lost, yet it will be profitable to them: for there they will come to the knowledge of my name, which was accomplished under the Gospel, among whom it was first preached. 
<p>
<p>(l) Not that they would return into their country, but be gathered and joined in one faith by the doctrine of the Gospel.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#011">Zechariah 10:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">zac 10:11</A></FONT></span></p>And he (m) shall pass through the sea with affliction, and shall smite the waves in the sea, and all the deeps of the river shall dry up: and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and the sceptre of Egypt shall depart. 
<p>
<p>(m) He alludes to the deliverance of the people out of Egypt, when the angel smote the floods and rivers.
