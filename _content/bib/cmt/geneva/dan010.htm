<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#001">Daniel 10:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">dan 10:1</A></FONT></span></p>In the (a) third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed unto Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing [was] true, but the time appointed [was] (b) long: and he understood the thing, and had understanding of the vision. 
<p>
<p>(a) He notes this third year, because at this time the building of the temple began to be hindered by Cambyses, Cyrus's son, when the father made war in Asia minor against the Scythians, which was discouraging to the godly, and fearful to Daniel. 
<p>
<p>(b) Which is to declare that the godly should not hasten too much, but patiently abide the fulfilment of God's promise.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#004">Daniel 10:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">dan 10:4</A></FONT></span></p>And in the four and twentieth day of the (c) first month, as I (d) was by the side of the great river, which [is] Hiddekel; 
<p>
<p>(c) Called Abib, which contains part of March, and part of April. 
<p>
<p>(d) Being carried by the Spirit of prophecy so that he could see the river Tigris.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#005">Daniel 10:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">dan 10:5</A></FONT></span></p>Then I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a certain man (e) clothed in linen, whose loins [were] girded with fine gold of Uphaz: 
<p>
<p>(e) This was the angel of God, who was sent to assure Daniel in this prophecy that follows.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#008">Daniel 10:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">dan 10:8</A></FONT></span></p>Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me: for (f) my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength. 
<p>
<p>(f) So that because of fear he was like a dead man because of his deformity.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#010">Daniel 10:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">dan 10:10</A></FONT></span></p>And, behold, an (g) hand touched me, which set me upon my knees and [upon] the palms of my hands. 
<p>
<p>(g) Which declares that when we are struck down with the majesty of God we cannot rise, unless he also lifts us up with his hand, which is his power.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#013">Daniel 10:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">dan 10:13</A></FONT></span></p>But the (h) prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days: but, lo, (i) Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia. 
<p>
<p>(h) Meaning Cambyses, who reigned in his father's absence, and did not only for this time hinder the building of the temple, but would have further raged, if God had not sent me to resist him: and therefore I have stayed for the profit of the Church. 
<p>
<p>(i) Even though God could by one angel destroy all the world, yet to assure his children of his love he sends forth double power, even Michael, that is, Christ Jesus the head of angels.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#014">Daniel 10:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">dan 10:14</A></FONT></span></p>Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days: for yet the (k) vision [is] for [many] days. 
<p>
<p>(k) For even though the Prophet Daniel would end and cease, yet his doctrine would continue until the coming of Christ, for the comfort of his Church.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#016">Daniel 10:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">dan 10:16</A></FONT></span></p>And, behold, (l) [one] like the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spake, and said unto him that stood before me, O my lord, (m) by the vision my sorrows are turned upon me, and I have retained no strength. 
<p>
<p>(l) This was the same angel that spoke with him before in the appearance of a man. 
<p>
<p>(m) I was overcome with fear and sorrow, when I saw the vision.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#019">Daniel 10:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">dan 10:19</A></FONT></span></p>And said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: (n) peace [be] unto thee, be strong, yea, be strong. And when he had spoken unto me, I (o) was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me. 
<p>
<p>(n) He declares by this that God would be merciful to the people of Israel. 
<p>
<p>(o) Which declares that when God smites his children down, he does not immediately lift them up at once (for now the Angel had touched him twice), but by little and little.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#020">Daniel 10:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">dan 10:20</A></FONT></span></p>Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I am gone forth, lo, the (p) prince of Grecia shall come. 
<p>
<p>(p) Meaning that he would not only himself bridle the rage of Cambyses, but also the other kings of Persia by Alexander the King of Macedonia.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#021">Daniel 10:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">dan 10:21</A></FONT></span></p>But I will shew thee that which is noted in the scripture of truth: (q) and [there is] none that holdeth with me in these things, but Michael your prince. 
<p>
<p>(q) For this angel was appointed for the defence of the Church under Christ, who is the head of it.
