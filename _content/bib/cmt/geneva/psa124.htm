<p>
<p>(a) He shows that God was ready to help at need and that there was no other way to be saved, but by this means alone.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#003">Psalms 124:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">psa 124:3</A></FONT></span></p>Then they had swallowed us up (b) quick, when their wrath was kindled against us: 
<p>
<p>(b) So unable were we to resist.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">psa 124:4</A></FONT></span></p>Then the (c) waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul: 
<p>
<p>(c) He uses proper similitudes to express the great danger that the Church was in, and out of which God miraculously delivered them.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#007">Psalms 124:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">psa 124:7</A></FONT></span></p>Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the (d) snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are escaped. 
<p>
<p>(d) For the wicked not only furiously rage against the faithful, but craftily imagined to destroy them.
