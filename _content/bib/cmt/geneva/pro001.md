### [Proverbs Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#001)

[Proverbs 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 1:1</span></span>

The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;

The Argument - The wonderful love of God toward his Church is declared
in this book: for as much as the sum and effect of the whole Scriptures
is here set forth in these brief sentences, which partly contain
doctrine, and partly manners, and also exhortations to both: of which
the first nine Chapters are as a preface full of grave sentences and
deep mysteries, to assure the hearts of men to the diligent reading of
the parables that follow: which are left as a precious jewel to the
Church, of those three thousand parables mentioned in ([Kg1
4:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#032)) and were gathered and committed
to writing by Solomon's servants and incited by him.

[Proverbs 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 1:2</span></span>

To know wisdom (a) and instruction; to perceive the words (b) of
understanding;

\(a\) That is, what we ought to know and follow, and what we ought to
refuse.

\(b\) Meaning, the word of God in which is the only true knowledge.

[Proverbs 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 1:3</span></span>

To receive the (c) instruction of wisdom, (d) justice, and judgment, and
equity;

\(c\) To learn to submit ourselves to the correction of those who are
wise.

\(d\) By living justly and rendering to every man that which belongs to
him.

[Proverbs 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 1:4</span></span>

To give subtilty to the (e) simple, to the young man knowledge and
discretion.

\(e\) To such as have no discretion to rule themselves.

[Proverbs 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 1:5</span></span>

A wise \[man\] will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of (f)
understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:

\(f\) As he shows that these parables containing the effect of religion
concerning manners and doctrine, belong to the simple people: so he
declares that the same is also necessary for them who are wise and
learned.

[Proverbs 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 1:8</span></span>

My son, hear the instruction of thy (g) father, and forsake not the law
of thy (h) mother:

\(g\) He speaks this in the Name of God, who is the universal Father of
all creatures, or in the name of the pastor of the Church, who is as a
father.

\(h\) That is, of the Church, in which the faithful are begotten by the
incorruptible seed of God's word.

[Proverbs 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 1:10</span></span>

My son, (i) if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.

\(i\) That is, the wicked who do not have the fear of God.

[Proverbs 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 1:11</span></span>

If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for (k) blood, let us lurk
privily for the innocent without cause:

\(k\) He speaks not only of the shedding of blood with hand, but of all
crafty practises which tend to the detriment of our neighbour.

[Proverbs 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 1:12</span></span>

Let us swallow them up alive as the (l) grave; and whole, as those that
go down into the pit:

\(l\) As the grave is never satisfied, so the malice of the wicked and
their cruelty has no end.

[Proverbs 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 1:14</span></span>

Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one (m) purse:

\(m\) He shows how the wicked are allured to join together, because they
have everyone part of the spoil of the innocent.

[Proverbs 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 1:15</span></span>

My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their
(n) path:

\(n\) That is, have nothing at all to do with them.

[Proverbs 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 1:18</span></span>

And they lay wait for their \[own\] blood; they lurk privily for (o)
their \[own\] lives.

\(o\) He shows that there is no reason to move these wicked to spoil the
innocent, aside from their malice and cruelty.

[Proverbs 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 1:19</span></span>

So \[are\] the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; \[which\]
taketh away (p) the life of the owners thereof.

\(p\) By which he concludes that the covetous man is a murderer.

[Proverbs 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pro 1:20</span></span>

\(q\) Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the (r) streets:

\(q\) This wisdom is the eternal word of God.

\(r\) So that no one can pretend ignorance.

[Proverbs 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 1:22</span></span>

How long, ye (s) simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners
delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?

\(s\) Wisdom reproves three kinds of men, the foolish or simple who err
out of ignorance, the mockers who cannot stand to be taught, and the
fools who are drowned in worldly lusts and hate the knowledge of
godliness.

[Proverbs 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">pro 1:26</span></span>

I also will (t) laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear
cometh;

\(t\) This is spoken according to our capacity signifying that the
wicked, who mock and jest at God's word, will have the just reward of
their mocking.

[Proverbs 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 1:27</span></span>

When (u) your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as
a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.

\(u\) That is, your destruction, which you feared.

[Proverbs 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">pro 1:28</span></span>

Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me
early, but they shall not (x) find me:

\(x\) Because they sought not with an affection to God, but for ease of
their own grief.

[Proverbs 1:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">pro 1:30</span></span>

They would none of my counsel: they (y) despised all my reproof.

\(y\) Showing that without faith and obedience, we cannot call on God
correctly.

[Proverbs 1:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">pro 1:31</span></span>

Therefore shall they eat of the (z) fruit of their own way, and be
filled with their own devices.

\(z\) They will feel what convenience their wicked life will give them.

[Proverbs 1:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">pro 1:32</span></span>

For (a) the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the
prosperity of fools shall destroy them.

\(a\) That is, the prosperity and sensuality in which they delight.
