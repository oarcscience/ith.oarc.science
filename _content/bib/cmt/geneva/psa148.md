### [Psalms Chapter 148](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#001)

[Psalms 148:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 148:2</span></span>

Praise ye him, all (a) his angels: praise ye him, all his hosts.

\(a\) Because they are members of the same body, he sets them before our
eyes, who are most willing and by their prompt obedience teach us to do
our duty.

[Psalms 148:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 148:3</span></span>

Praise ye him, (b) sun and moon: praise him, all ye stars of light.

\(b\) In that God's glory shines in these insensible creatures, this
their beauty is as a continual praising of God.

[Psalms 148:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 148:4</span></span>

Praise him, ye (c) heavens of heavens, and ye (d) waters that \[be\]
above the heavens.

\(c\) Not that there are various heavens, but because of the spheres and
of the situation of the fixed stars and planets, he comprehends by this
word the whole heavens.

\(d\) That is, the rain which is in the middle region of the air, which
he here comprehends under the name of the heavens.

[Psalms 148:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 148:7</span></span>

Praise the LORD from the earth, ye (e) dragons, and all deeps:

\(e\) Meaning the great and monstrous fishes, as whales and such like.

[Psalms 148:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 148:8</span></span>

\(f\) Fire, and hail; snow, and vapour; stormy wind fulfilling his word:

\(f\) Which come not by chance or fortune, but by God's appointed
ordinance.

[Psalms 148:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 148:11</span></span>

\(g\) Kings of the earth, and all people; princes, and all judges of the
earth:

\(g\) For the greater gifts that any has received and the more high that
one is preferred, the more bound is he to praise God for the same: but
neither high nor low condition or degree can be exempted from this duty.

[Psalms 148:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 148:14</span></span>

He also exalteth the (h) horn of his people, the praise of all his
saints; \[even\] of the (i) children of Israel, a people near unto him.
Praise ye the LORD.

\(h\) That is, the dignity, power and glory of his Church.

\(i\) By reason of his covenant made with Abraham.
