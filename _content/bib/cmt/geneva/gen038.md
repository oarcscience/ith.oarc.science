### [Genesis Chapter 38](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#001)

[Genesis 38:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 38:1</span></span>

And it came to pass at that time, that (a) Judah went down from his
brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name \[was\]
Hirah.

\(a\) Moses describes the genealogy of Judah, because the Messiah should
come from him.

[Genesis 38:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 38:2</span></span>

And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name
\[was\] Shuah; (b) and he took her, and went in unto her.

\(b\) A relationship which nonetheless was condemned by God.

[Genesis 38:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 38:8</span></span>

And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and marry her,
and raise (c) up seed to thy brother.

\(c\) This order was for the preservation of the stock, since the child
begotten by the second brother would have the name and inheritance of
the first: a practice which is abolished in the New Testament.

[Genesis 38:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gen 38:11</span></span>

Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, (d) Remain a widow at thy
father's house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest
peradventure he die also, as his brethren \[did\]. And Tamar went and
dwelt in her father's house.

\(d\) For she could not marry in any other family so long as Judah would
retain her in his.

[Genesis 38:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gen 38:16</span></span>

And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me
come in unto thee; (for he (e) knew not that she \[was\] his daughter in
law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in
unto me?

\(e\) God miraculously blinded him so that he could not know her by her
voice.

[Genesis 38:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">gen 38:20</span></span>

And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his (f) friend the Adullamite, to
receive \[his\] pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not.

\(f\) That his wickedness might not be known to others.

[Genesis 38:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">gen 38:23</span></span>

And Judah said, Let her take \[it\] to her, lest we be (g) shamed:
behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.

\(g\) He fears man more than God.

[Genesis 38:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">gen 38:24</span></span>

And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah,
saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also,
behold, she \[is\] with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her
forth, and let her be (h) burnt.

\(h\) We see that the Law, which was written in man's heart, taught them
that adultery should be punished with death, even though no law had been
given yet.

[Genesis 38:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">gen 38:26</span></span>

And Judah acknowledged \[them\], and said, She hath been (i) more
righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he
knew her again (k) no more.

\(i\) That is, she ought rather to accuse me than I her.

\(k\) for the horror of the sin condemned him.

[Genesis 38:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">gen 38:29</span></span>

And it came to pass, as he (l) drew back his hand, that, behold, his
brother came out: and she said, How (m) hast thou broken forth? \[this\]
breach \[be\] upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez.

\(l\) Their heinous sin was signified by this monstrous birth.

\(m\) Or the separation between you and your brother.
