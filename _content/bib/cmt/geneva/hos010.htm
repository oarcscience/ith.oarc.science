<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#001">Hosea 10:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">hos 10:1</A></FONT></span></p>Israel [is] an (a) empty vine, he bringeth forth fruit unto himself: according to the multitude of his fruit he hath increased the altars; according to the (b) goodness of his land they have made goodly images. 
<p>
<p>(a) Of which though the grapes were gathered, yet always as it gathered new strength it increased in new wickedness, so that the correction which should have brought them to obedience, only proclaimed their stubbornness. 
<p>
<p>(b) As they were rich and had abundance.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#002">Hosea 10:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">hos 10:2</A></FONT></span></p>Their heart is (c) divided; now shall they be found faulty: he shall break down their altars, he shall spoil their images. 
<p>
<p>(c) That is, from God, by serving their false gods.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#003">Hosea 10:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">hos 10:3</A></FONT></span></p>For now they shall say, We have no (d) king, because we feared not the LORD; what then should a king do to us? 
<p>
<p>(d) The day will come that God will take away their king, and then they will feel the fruit of their sins, and how they trusted in him in vain; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#006">Kg2 17:6-7</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#004">Hosea 10:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">hos 10:4</A></FONT></span></p>They have spoken words, swearing falsely in making (e) a covenant: thus (f) judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field. 
<p>
<p>(e) In promising to be faithful toward God. 
<p>
<p>(f) In this way their integrity and fidelity which they pretended, was nothing but bitterness and grief.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#005">Hosea 10:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">hos 10:5</A></FONT></span></p>The inhabitants of Samaria shall (g) fear because of the calves of Bethaven: for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the (h) priests thereof [that] rejoiced on it, for the glory thereof, because it is departed from it. 
<p>
<p>(g) When the calf will be carried away. 
<p>
<p>(h) These were certain idolatrous priests, who wore black apparel during their sacrifices, and cried with a loud voice: which superstition Elijah derided, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#027">Kg1 18:27</A>). See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#005">Kg2 23:5</A>  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#008">Hosea 10:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">hos 10:8</A></FONT></span></p>The high places also of (i) Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed: the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us. 
<p>
<p>(i) This he speaks in contempt of Bethel. See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#015">Hos 4:15</A>  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#009">Hosea 10:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">hos 10:9</A></FONT></span></p>O Israel, thou hast (k) sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they (l) stood: the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not (m) overtake them. 
<p>
<p>(k) In those days you were as wicked as the Gibeonites, as God there partly declared: for your zeal could not be good in executing God's judgments, seeing your own deeds were as wicked as theirs. 
<p>
<p>(l) That is, to fight, or, the Israelites remained in that stubbornness from that time. 
<p>
<p>(m) The Israelites were not moved by the example of the Gibeonites to cease from their sins.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#010">Hosea 10:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">hos 10:10</A></FONT></span></p>[It is] in my desire (n) that I should chastise them; and the people shall be gathered against them, when they shall bind themselves in their two (o) furrows. 
<p>
<p>(n) Because they are so desperate, I will delight to destroy them. 
<p>
<p>(o) That is, when they have gathered all their strength together.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#011">Hosea 10:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">hos 10:11</A></FONT></span></p>And Ephraim [is as] an heifer [that is] taught, [and] loveth to (p) tread out [the corn]; but I passed over upon her (q) fair neck: I will make Ephraim to ride; Judah shall plow, [and] Jacob shall break his clods. 
<p>
<p>(p) In which is pleasure, whereas in plowing there is labour and pain. 
<p>
<p>(q) I will lay my yoke upon her fat neck.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#012">Hosea 10:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">hos 10:12</A></FONT></span></p>Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; (r) break up your fallow ground: for [it is] time to seek the LORD, till he come and rain righteousness upon you. 
<p>
<p>(r) See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#003">Jer 4:3</A>  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#014">Hosea 10:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">hos 10:14</A></FONT></span></p>Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy fortresses shall be spoiled, as (s) Shalman spoiled Betharbel in the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces upon [her] children. 
<p>
<p>(s) That is, Shalmaneser in the destruction of that city spared neither type nor age.
