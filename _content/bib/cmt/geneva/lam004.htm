<p>
<p>(a) By the gold he means the princes, as by the stones he understands the priests.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#002">Lamentations 4:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">lam 4:2</A></FONT></span></p>The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are they esteemed as earthen (b) pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter! 
<p>
<p>(b) Which are of small value and have no honour.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#003">Lamentations 4:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">lam 4:3</A></FONT></span></p>Even the sea monsters (c) draw out the breast, they nurse their young ones: the daughter of my people [is become] cruel, like the (d) ostriches in the wilderness. 
<p>
<p>(c) Though the dragons are cruel, yet they pity their young, and nourish them, which Jerusalem does not do. 
<p>
<p>(d) The women forsake their children as the ostrich does her eggs, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#017">Job 39:17</A>).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">lam 4:8</A></FONT></span></p>Their (e) visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the streets: their skin cleaveth to their bones; it is withered, it is become like a stick. 
<p>
<p>(e) They who were before most in God's favour are now in greatest abomination to him.

<p>
<p>(f) For lack of food they pine away and consume.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#013">Lamentations 4:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">lam 4:13</A></FONT></span></p>For the sins of her prophets, [and] the iniquities of her priests, that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of (g) her, 
<p>
<p>(g) He means that these things are come to pass therefore, contrary to all men's expectations.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#014">Lamentations 4:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">lam 4:14</A></FONT></span></p>They have wandered [as] blind [men] (h) in the streets, they have polluted themselves with blood, so that (i) men could not touch their garments. 
<p>
<p>(h) Some refer this to the blind men who as they went, stumbled on the blood, of which the city was full. 
<p>
<p>(i) Meaning the heathen who came to destroy them could not abide them.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#016">Lamentations 4:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">lam 4:16</A></FONT></span></p>The anger of the LORD hath divided them; he will no longer regard them: (k) they respected not the persons of the priests, they favoured not the elders. 
<p>
<p>(k) That is, the enemies.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#017">Lamentations 4:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">lam 4:17</A></FONT></span></p>As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vain help: in our watching we have watched for (l) a nation [that] could not save [us]. 
<p>
<p>(l) He shows two principal causes for their destruction: their cruelty and their vain confidence in man: for they trusted in the help of the Egyptians.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#020">Lamentations 4:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">lam 4:20</A></FONT></span></p>The (m) breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the LORD, was taken in their pits, of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the nations. 
<p>
<p>(m) Our king Josiah, in whom stood our hope of God's favour and on whom depended our state and life was slain, whom he calls anointed, because he was a figure of Christ.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#021">Lamentations 4:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">lam 4:21</A></FONT></span></p>Rejoice and be glad, (n) O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the land of Uz; the cup also shall pass through to thee: thou shalt be drunk, and shalt make thyself naked. 
<p>
<p>(n) This is spoken by derision.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#022">Lamentations 4:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">lam 4:22</A></FONT></span></p>The punishment of thy iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion; he (o) will no more carry thee away into captivity: he will visit thy iniquity, O daughter of Edom; he will disclose thy sins. 
<p>
<p>(o) He comforts the Church because after seventy years their sorrows will have an end while the wicked would be tormented for ever.
