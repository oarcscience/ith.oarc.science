### [Ezekiel Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#001)

[Ezekiel 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 12:2</span></span>

Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house, who have
eyes to see, and see (a) not; they have ears to hear, and hear not: for
they \[are\] a rebellious house.

\(a\) That is, they receive not the fruit of that which they see and
hear.

[Ezekiel 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 12:6</span></span>

In their sight shalt thou bear \[it\] upon \[thy\] shoulders, \[and\]
carry \[it\] forth in the twilight: thou shalt cover thy face, that thou
mayest not see the ground: for I have set thee \[for\] a (b) sign to the
house of Israel.

\(b\) That as you do, so shall they do, and therefore in you they will
see their own plague and punishment.

[Ezekiel 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 12:9</span></span>

Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said to
thee, What (c) doest thou?

\(c\) Do they not deride your doings?

[Ezekiel 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 12:13</span></span>

My net also will I spread upon (d) him, and he shall be taken in my
snare: and I will bring him to Babylon \[to\] the land of the Chaldeans;
yet shall he not see it, though he shall die there.

\(d\) When the king will think to escape by fleeing, I will take him
into my net, as in ([Eze 32:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#003)).

[Ezekiel 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 12:16</span></span>

But I will leave a (e) few men of them from the sword, from the famine,
and from the pestilence; that they may declare all their abominations
among the nations where they come; and they shall know that I \[am\] the
LORD.

\(e\) Who would bear his Name, and would be his Church.

[Ezekiel 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eze 12:22</span></span>

Son of man, what \[is\] that proverb \[that\] ye have in the land of
Israel, saying, The days (f) are prolonged, and every vision faileth?

\(f\) Because they did not immediately see the prophecies accomplished,
they contemned them as though they would never be fulfilled.

[Ezekiel 12:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">eze 12:27</span></span>

Son of man, behold, \[they of\] the house of Israel say, The vision that
he seeth \[is\] for (g) many days \[to come\], and he prophesieth of the
times \[that are\] distant.

\(g\) That is, it will not come to pass in our days, and therefore we
care not for it: thus the wicked ever abuse God's patience and
benignity.
