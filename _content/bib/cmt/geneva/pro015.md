### [Proverbs Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#001)

[Proverbs 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 15:6</span></span>

In the house of the righteous \[is\] much treasure: but in the revenues
of the wicked is (a) trouble.

\(a\) For though they have much yet it is full of trouble and care.

[Proverbs 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 15:8</span></span>

The (b) sacrifice of the wicked \[is\] an abomination to the LORD: but
the prayer of the upright \[is\] his delight.

\(b\) That thing is abominable before God, which the wicked think to be
most excellent, and by which they think most to be accepted.

[Proverbs 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 15:10</span></span>

Correction \[is\] grievous to him that (c) forsaketh the way: \[and\] he
that hateth reproof shall die.

\(c\) He who swears from the word of God, cannot stand to be admonished.

[Proverbs 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 15:11</span></span>

\(d\) Hell and destruction \[are\] before the LORD: how much more then
the hearts of the children of men?

\(d\) There is nothing so deep or secret that can be hid from the eyes
of God, much less man's thoughts.

[Proverbs 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 15:19</span></span>

The way of the slothful \[man is\] as an hedge of (e) thorns: but the
way of the righteous \[is\] made plain.

\(e\) That is, he always finds some hinderance or stay, and dares not go
forward.

[Proverbs 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 15:22</span></span>

Without counsel purposes are disappointed: but (f) in the multitude of
counsellors they are established.

\(f\) Read ([Pro 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#014)).

[Proverbs 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 15:23</span></span>

A man hath joy by the answer of his mouth: and a word \[spoken\] (g) in
due season, how good \[it is\]!

\(g\) If we will that our talk be comfortable, we must wait for time and
season.

[Proverbs 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">pro 15:26</span></span>

The thoughts of the wicked \[are\] an abomination to the LORD: but \[the
words\] of the pure \[are\] (h) pleasant words.

\(h\) That is, wholesome and profitable to the hearers.

[Proverbs 15:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">pro 15:31</span></span>

The ear that heareth the (i) reproof of life abideth among the wise.

\(i\) That suffers himself to be admonished by God's word, which brings
life: and so amends.

[Proverbs 15:33](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">pro 15:33</span></span>

The fear of the LORD \[is\] the instruction of wisdom; and before honour
\[is\] (k) humility.

\(k\) Meaning, that God exalts no one but them that are truly humbled.
