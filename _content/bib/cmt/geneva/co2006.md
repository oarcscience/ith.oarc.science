### [2 Corinthians Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#001)

[2 Corinthians 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co2 6:1</span></span>

We (1) then, \[as\] workers together \[with him\], beseech \[you\] also
that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.

\(1\) Men do not only need the ministry of the Gospel before they have
received grace, in order that they may be partakers of the Gospel, but
also after they have received grace they need to continue in it.

[2 Corinthians 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co2 6:2</span></span>

\(2\) (For he saith, I have heard thee in a time (a) accepted, and in
the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now \[is\] the
accepted time; behold, now \[is\] the day of salvation.)

\(2\) In that grace is offered, it is by the grace of God, who has
appointed times and seasons to all things, that we may take occasion
when it is offered.

\(a\) Which I of my free mercy and love towards you liked and appointed.
And at this time God poured out his marvellous love upon us.

[2 Corinthians 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co2 6:3</span></span>

\(3\) Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed:

\(3\) He shows the Corinthians a pattern of a true minister in his own
example, and in Timothy and Silvanus, to the end that he might procure
authority for himself and his companions like him, as he purposed from
the beginning.

[2 Corinthians 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co2 6:4</span></span>

But in all \[things\] (b) approving ourselves as the ministers of God,
(4) in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,

\(b\) Declare and indeed show. (4) He first of all reckons up those
things which are neither always in the ministers, nor without exception,
unless they are there according to the minister's bodily condition.
Patience, however, is an exception, which also is one of the virtues
which ought to always be in a good minister.

[2 Corinthians 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co2 6:5</span></span>

In stripes, in imprisonments, in (c) tumults, in labours, in watchings,
in fastings;

\(c\) In tossing to and fro, finding no place of rest and quietness.

[2 Corinthians 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co2 6:6</span></span>

\(5\) By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the
Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,

\(5\) Secondly he reckons up such virtues as are necessary, and ought
alway be in them, and by which as by good armour, all pitfalls and
hindrances may be overcome.

[2 Corinthians 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co2 6:7</span></span>

By the (d) word of truth, by the (e) power of God, by the (f) armour of
righteousness on the right hand and on the left,

\(d\) Preaching of the Gospel.

\(e\) Power to work miracles, and to subdue the wicked.

\(f\) Uprightness.

[2 Corinthians 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co2 6:11</span></span>

\(6\) O \[ye\] Corinthians, our mouth is (g) open unto you, our heart is
enlarged.

\(6\) Going about to rebuke them he says first that he deals with them
sincerely and with an open and plain heart, and in addition complains
that they do not do the same in loving their Father.

\(g\) The opening of the mouth and heart signifies a most earnest
affection in him that speaks, as it happens commonly with those that are
in some great joy.

[2 Corinthians 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co2 6:12</span></span>

Ye are not (h) straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own (i)
bowels.

\(h\) You are in my heart as in a house, and that no narrow or confined
house, for I have opened my whole heart to you; but you are inwardly
narrow towards me.

\(i\) After the manner of the Hebrews, he calls those tender affections
which rest in the heart, "bowels".

[2 Corinthians 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co2 6:14</span></span>

\(7\) Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what
fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion
hath light with darkness?

\(7\) Now he rebukes them boldly, because they became fellows with
infidels in outward idolatry, as though it were an indifferent thing.
And this is the fourth part of this epistle, the conclusion of which is,
that those whom the Lord has condescended to in calling them his
children, must keep themselves pure, not only in mind, but also in body,
that they may be completely holy to the Lord.

[2 Corinthians 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co2 6:15</span></span>

And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what (k) part hath he that
believeth with an infidel?

\(k\) What can there be between them?

[2 Corinthians 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co2 6:16</span></span>

And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the
temple of the (l) living God; as God hath said, I will (m) dwell in
them, and walk in \[them\]; and I will be their God, and they shall be
my people.

\(l\) He sets the living God against idols.

\(m\) God dwells with us, because Christ has become God with us.
