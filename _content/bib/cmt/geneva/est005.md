### [Esther Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#001)

[Esther 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">est 5:1</span></span>

Now it came to pass on the third (a) day, that Esther put on \[her\]
royal \[apparel\], and stood in the inner court of the king's house,
over against the king's house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in
the royal house, over against the gate of the house.

\(a\) That is, after the Jews had begun to fast.

[Esther 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">est 5:2</span></span>

And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court,
\[that\] she obtained favour in his sight: and the king (b) held out to
Esther the golden sceptre that \[was\] in his hand. So Esther drew near,
and touched the top of the sceptre.

\(b\) Which was a sign that her coming was agreeable to him, ([Est
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/est004.htm#011)).

[Esther 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">est 5:3</span></span>

Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and what
\[is\] thy request? it shall be even (c) given thee to the half of the
kingdom.

\(c\) Meaning by this that whatever she asked would be granted as in
([Mar 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#023)).

[Esther 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">est 5:6</span></span>

And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of (d) wine, What \[is\]
thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what \[is\] thy request?
even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.

\(d\) Because they used to drink excessively in their banquets they
called the banquet by that which was most in use or esteemed.

[Esther 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">est 5:8</span></span>

If I have found favour in the sight of the king, and if it please the
king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and
Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do
to morrow as the king hath (e) said.

\(e\) I will declare what I demand.

[Esther 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">est 5:11</span></span>

And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his
children, and all \[the things\] wherein the king had (f) promoted him,
and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king.

\(f\) Thus the wicked when they are promoted instead of acknowledging
their charge and humbling themselves, wax ambitious, disdainful and
cruel.

[Esther 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">est 5:14</span></span>

Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a gallows be
made of fifty (g) cubits high, and to morrow speak thou unto the king
that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go thou in merrily with the
king unto the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the
gallows to be made.

\(g\) Meaning, the highest that could be found.
