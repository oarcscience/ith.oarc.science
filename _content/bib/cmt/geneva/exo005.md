### [Exodus Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#001)

[Exodus 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 5:1</span></span>

And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told (a) Pharaoh, Thus saith
the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may (b) hold a feast
unto me in the wilderness.

\(a\) Faith overcomes fear, and makes men bold in their calling. (b) And
offer sacrifice.

[Exodus 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">exo 5:5</span></span>

And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now \[are\] many, and
ye (c) make them rest from their burdens.

\(c\) As though you would rebel.

[Exodus 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">exo 5:6</span></span>

And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and
their (d) officers, saying,

\(d\) Who were of the Israelites, and had charge to see them do their
work.

[Exodus 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">exo 5:9</span></span>

\(e\) Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour
therein; and let them not regard (f) vain words.

\(e\) The more cruelly the tyranny rages, the nearer is God's help.

\(f\) Of Moses and Aaron.

[Exodus 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">exo 5:21</span></span>

And they said unto them, The LORD look upon you, and judge; because ye
have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the
eyes of his servants, to (g) put a sword in their hand to slay us.

\(g\) It is a grievous things for the servants of God to be accused of
evil, especially by their brethren, when they do what their duty
requires.
