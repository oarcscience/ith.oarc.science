<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#001">Leviticus 3:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">lev 3:1</A></FONT></span></p>And if his oblation [be] a sacrifice of (a) peace offering, if he offer [it] of the herd; whether [it be] a male or female, he shall offer it without blemish before the LORD. 
<p>
<p>(a) A sacrifice of thanksgiving offered for peace and prosperity, either generally or particularly.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#003">Leviticus 3:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">lev 3:3</A></FONT></span></p>And he shall (b) offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that [is] upon the inwards, 
<p>
<p>(b) One part was burnt, another was to the priests, and the third to him that offered.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#006">Leviticus 3:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">lev 3:6</A></FONT></span></p>And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offering unto the LORD [be] of the flock; (c) male or female, he shall offer it without blemish. 
<p>
<p>(c) In the peace offering either male or female could be offered, but in the burnt offering only the male: so here no birds can be offered, but in the burnt offering they might: there all was consumed with fire, and in the peace offering divided.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#009">Leviticus 3:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">lev 3:9</A></FONT></span></p>And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering (d) an offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat thereof, [and] the whole rump, it shall he take off hard by the backbone; and the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that [is] upon the inwards, 
<p>
<p>(d) The burnt offering was completely consumed, and of the offering made by fire only the inner parts were burnt: the shoulder and breast, with the two jaws and the stomach were the priests, and the rest his that offered.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#013">Leviticus 3:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">lev 3:13</A></FONT></span></p>And he shall lay his hand upon the head of it, and kill it before (e) the tabernacle of the congregation: and the sons of Aaron shall sprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round about. 
<p>
<p>(e) Meaning, at the north side of the altar, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#001">Lev 1:1</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#017">Leviticus 3:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">lev 3:17</A></FONT></span></p>[It shall be] a perpetual statute for your generations throughout all your dwellings, that ye eat neither (f) fat nor blood. 
<p>
<p>(f) Eating fat was a symbol of carnality, and eating blood signified cruelty.
