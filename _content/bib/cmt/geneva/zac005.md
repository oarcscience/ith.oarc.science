### [Zechariah Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#001)

[Zechariah 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">zac 5:2</span></span>

And he said to me, What seest thou? And I answered, I see a flying (a)
scroll; its length \[is\] twenty cubits, and its breadth ten cubits.

\(a\) Because the Jews had provoked God's plagues by condemning his
word, and casting off all judgment and equity, he shows that God's
curses written in this book had justly happened both to them and their
fathers. But now if they would repent, God would send the same among the
Chaldeans and their former enemies.

[Zechariah 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">zac 5:3</span></span>

Then said he to me, This \[is\] the curse that goeth forth over the face
of the whole earth: for every one that (b) stealeth shall be cut off
\[as\] on this (c) side according to it; and every one that (d) sweareth
shall be cut off \[as\] on that side according to it.

\(b\) That is, does any injury toward his neighbour.

\(c\) Meaning, wherever he is in the world.

\(d\) He that transgresses the first table of the ten commandments, and
does not serve God correctly but abuses his name.

[Zechariah 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">zac 5:6</span></span>

And I said, What \[is\] it? And he said, This \[is\] an (e) ephah that
goeth forth. He said moreover, This \[is\] their (f) resemblance through
all the earth.

\(e\) Which was a measure in dry things, containing about five gallons.

\(f\) That is, all the wickedness of the ungodly is in God's sight,
which he keeps in a measure, and can shut it or open it at his pleasure.

[Zechariah 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">zac 5:7</span></span>

And, behold, there was lifted up a (g) talent of lead: and this \[is\] a
(h) woman that sitteth in the midst of the ephah.

\(g\) To cover the measure.

\(h\) Which represents iniquity, as in the next verse.

[Zechariah 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">zac 5:8</span></span>

And he said, This \[is\] (i) wickedness. And he cast it into the midst
of the ephah; and he cast the weight of lead upon its mouth.

\(i\) Signifying that Satan would not have such power against the Jews
to tempt them, as he had in times past, but that God would shut up
iniquity in a measure as in a prison.

[Zechariah 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">zac 5:9</span></span>

Then I lifted up my eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came out two
(k) women, and the wind \[was\] in their wings; for they had wings like
the wings of a stork: and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and
the heaven.

\(k\) Which declared that God would execute his judgment by the means of
the weak and infirm.

[Zechariah 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">zac 5:11</span></span>

And he said to me, To build for it an house in the land of (l) Shinar:
and it shall be established, and set there upon her own base.

\(l\) To remove the iniquity and affliction that came from Judah because
of the judgment, to place it forever in Babylon.
