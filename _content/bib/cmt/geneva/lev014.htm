<p>
<p>(a) Or, the ceremony which shall be used in his purgation.

<p>
<p>(d) Signifying that he that was made clean was set free, and restored to the company of others.

<p>(e) Which has no imperfection in any part.

<p>(g) Which is an Omer, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#016">Exo 16:16</A>).

<p>
<p>(h) Or, shall offer them as the offering that is shaken to and fro.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#030">Leviticus 14:30</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_030">lev 14:30</A></FONT></span></p>And he shall offer the one of the turtledoves, or of the young pigeons, (i) such as he can get; 
<p>
<p>(i) whether of them he can get.

<p>
<p>(k) This order is appointed for the poor man.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#034">Leviticus 14:34</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_034">lev 14:34</A></FONT></span></p>When ye be come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession, and I (l) put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession; 
<p>
<p>(l) This declares that no plague nor punishment comes to man without God's providence and his sending.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#041">Leviticus 14:41</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_041">lev 14:41</A></FONT></span></p>And he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, and they shall pour out the dust that they scrape off without the city into (m) an unclean place: 
<p>
<p>(m) Where trash was cast, and other filth, that the people might not be infected by them.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#045">Leviticus 14:45</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_045">lev 14:45</A></FONT></span></p>And he shall (n) break down the house, the stones of it, and the timber thereof, and all the morter of the house; and he shall carry [them] forth out of the city into an unclean place. 
<p>
<p>(n) That is, he shall command it to be pulled down, as in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#040">Lev 14:40</A>).

<p>
<p>(o) It seems that this was a lace or string to bind the hyssop to the wood, and so was made a sprinkle: the apostle to the Hebrews calls it scarlet wool, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#019">Heb 9:19</A>).
