### [Jeremiah Chapter 47](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 47:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 47:1</span></span>

The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against the
Philistines, before Pharaoh smote (a) Gaza.

\(a\) Or Azzah, a city of the Philistines.

[Jeremiah 47:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 47:2</span></span>

Thus saith the LORD; Behold, waters rise out of the (b) north, and shall
be an overflowing flood, and shall overflow the land, and all that is in
it; the city, and them that dwell in it: then the men shall cry, and all
the inhabitants of the land shall wail.

\(b\) He means the army of the Chaldeans, ([Isa
8:7,8](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#007)).

[Jeremiah 47:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 47:3</span></span>

At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong \[horses\], at
the rushing of his chariots, \[and at\] the rumbling of his wheels, (c)
the fathers shall not look back to \[their\] children for feebleness of
(d) hands;

\(c\) The great fear will take away their natural affection.

\(d\) Their heart will so fail them.

[Jeremiah 47:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 47:4</span></span>

Because of the day that cometh to lay waste all the Philistines, \[and\]
to cut off from Tyre and Zidon every helper that remaineth: for the LORD
will lay waste the Philistines, the remnant of the country of (e)
Caphtor.

\(e\) For the Caphtorims had destroyed in old time the Philistines, and
dwelt in their land even to Gaza, ([Deu
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#023)).

[Jeremiah 47:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 47:5</span></span>

\(f\) Baldness is come upon Gaza; Ashkelon is cut off \[with\] the
remnant of their valley: how long wilt (g) thou cut thyself?

\(f\) They who shaved their heads for sorrow and heaviness.

\(g\) As the heathen used in their mourning, which the Lord forbade his
people to do, ([Deu 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#001)).

[Jeremiah 47:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 47:7</span></span>

How can it be (h) quiet, seeing the LORD hath given it a charge against
Ashkelon, and against the sea shore? there hath he appointed it.

\(h\) Meaning, that it is not profitable that the wicked should by any
means escape or hinder the Lord when he will take vengeance.
