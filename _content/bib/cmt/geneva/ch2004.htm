<p>
<p>(a) A great vessel of brass, so called because of the great quantity of water which it contained, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#024">Kg1 7:24</A>). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#003">2 Chronicles 4:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">ch2 4:3</A></FONT></span></p>And under (b) it [was] the similitude of oxen, which did compass it round about: (c) ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about. Two rows of oxen [were] cast, when it was cast. 
<p>
<p>(b) Meaning, under the brim of the sea, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#024">Kg1 7:24</A>). 
<p>
<p>(c) In the length of every cubit were ten heads or knops which in all are 300.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">ch2 4:5</A></FONT></span></p>And the thickness of it [was] an handbreadth, and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies; [and] it received and held (d) three thousand baths. 
<p>
<p>(d) In the first book of the kings, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#026">Kg1 7:26</A>), mention is only made of 2000, but the lesser number was taken there, and here according as the measures proved afterwards, is declared.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">ch2 4:7</A></FONT></span></p>And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to (e) their form, and set [them] in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left. 
<p>
<p>(e) Even as they should be made.

<p>
<p>(f) Called also the porch of Solomon, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#011">Act 3:11</A>). It is also taken for the temple where Christ preached, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#023">Mat 21:23</A>). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#016">2 Chronicles 4:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">ch2 4:16</A></FONT></span></p>The pots also, and the shovels, and the fleshhooks, and all their instruments, did Huram (g) his father make to king Solomon for the house of the LORD of bright brass. 
<p>
<p>(g) Whom Solomon reverenced for the gifts that God had given him, as a father; he had the same name as Huram the king of Tyrus, his mother was a Jewess, and his father a Tyrian. Some read, for his father, the author of this work. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#019">2 Chronicles 4:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">ch2 4:19</A></FONT></span></p>And Solomon made all the vessels that [were for] the house of God, the golden altar also, and the tables whereon the (h) shewbread [was set]; 
<p>
<p>(h) In Hebrew, the bread of the faces because they were set before the ark, where the Lord showed his presence.

<p>
<p>(i) That is, covered with plates of gold.
