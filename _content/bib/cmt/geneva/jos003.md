### [Joshua Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#001)

[Joshua 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 3:1</span></span>

And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from Shittim, and
came to (a) Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, and lodged there
before they passed over.

\(a\) Which according to the Hebrews was in March, about 40 days after
Moses' death.

[Joshua 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jos 3:2</span></span>

And it came to pass after (b) three days, that the officers went through
the host;

\(b\) Which was given to prepare food ([Jos
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#011)).

[Joshua 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jos 3:8</span></span>

And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant,
saying, When ye are come to the brink of the water of Jordan, ye shall
stand still (c) in Jordan.

\(c\) Even in the channel where the stream had run, ([Jos
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#017))

[Joshua 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jos 3:10</span></span>

And Joshua said, (d) Hereby ye shall know that the living God \[is\]
among you, and \[that\] he will without fail drive out from before you
the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites,
and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites.

\(d\) By this miracle in dividing the water.

[Joshua 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jos 3:12</span></span>

Now therefore take you (e) twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, out
of every tribe a man.

\(e\) Who would set up twelve stones in remembrance of the benefit.

[Joshua 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jos 3:15</span></span>

And as they that bare the ark were come unto Jordan, and the feet of the
priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brim of the water, (for
Jordan overfloweth all his (f) banks all the time of harvest,)

\(f\) Because the river was accustomed at this time to be full, the
miracle is so much greater.

[Joshua 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jos 3:17</span></span>

And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood (g)
firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the Israelites passed
over on dry ground, until all the people were passed clean over Jordan.

\(g\) Either tarrying till the people were past, or as some read, sure,
as though they had been on dry land.
