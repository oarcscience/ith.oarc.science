people as thy people, \[and\] my horses as thy horses.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg2 3:12</span></span>

And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, (h) What have I to do with
thee? get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy
mother. And the king of Israel said unto him, (i) Nay: for the LORD hath
called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of
Moab.

\(h\) He knew that this wicked king would have but used his counsel to

to prophecy.

And ye shall smite every fenced city, and every choice city, and shall
fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water, and (n) mar every
good piece of land with stones.

\(n\) Though God bestows his benefits for a time on the enemies, yet he
has his seasons, when he will take them away to the intent they might
see his vengeance which is prepared for them.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#023)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg2 3:25</span></span>

And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land cast
every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the wells of
water, and felled all the good trees: only in (q) Kirharaseth left they
the stones thereof; howbeit the slingers went about \[it\], and smote
it.

\(q\) Which was one of the principle cities of the Moabites, in which
they left nothing but the walls.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 3:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg2 3:27</span></span>

Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and
(r) offered him \[for\] a burnt offering upon the wall. And there was
great indignation against Israel: and they departed from him, and
returned to \[their own\] land.

\(r\) Some refer it to the king of Edom's son, whom they say he had
taken in that skirmish: but rather it seemed to be his own son, whom he
offered to his gods to pacify them: which barbarous cruelty moved the
Israelites hearts of pity to depart.
