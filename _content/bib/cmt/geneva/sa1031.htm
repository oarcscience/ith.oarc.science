But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell upon it. 
<p>
<p>(a) So we see that his cruel life has a desperate end, as is commonly seen in those who persecute the children of God.

<p>
<p>(b) Near to Gilboa. 
<p>
<p>(c) The tribes of Reuben and Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh.
