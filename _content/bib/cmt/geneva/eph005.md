### [Ephesians Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#001)

[Ephesians 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eph 5:3</span></span>

\(1\) But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not
be once named among you, as becometh saints;

\(1\) Now he comes to another type of affections, which is in that part
of the mind which men call covetous or desirous: and he reprehends
fornication, covetousness, and jesting very sharply.

[Ephesians 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eph 5:4</span></span>

Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor (a) jesting, which are not
convenient: but rather giving of thanks.

\(a\) Jests which men cast at one another: that no lightness is seen,
nor evil example given, nor any offence made by evil words or
backbiting.

[Ephesians 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eph 5:5</span></span>

\(2\) For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor
covetous man, who is an (b) idolater, hath any inheritance in the
kingdom of Christ and of God.

\(2\) Because these sins are such that the most part of men do not
consider them to be sins, he awakes the godly to the end that they
should so much the more take heed to guard themselves from these sins as
from most harmful plagues.

\(b\) A bondslave to idolatry, for the covetous man thinks that his life
consists in his goods.

[Ephesians 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eph 5:7</span></span>

\(3\) Be not ye therefore partakers with them.

\(3\) Because we are most ready to follow evil examples, therefore the
apostle warns the godly to always remember that the others are but as it
were darkness, and that they themselves are as it were light. And
therefore the others commit all evils (as men are accustomed to do in
the dark), but they ought not to follow their examples, but rather (as
the property of the light is) reprove their darkness, and to walk in
such a way (having Christ that true light going before them) as it
becomes wise men.

[Ephesians 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eph 5:8</span></span>

For ye were sometimes darkness, but now \[are ye\] (c) light in the
Lord: walk as children of light:

\(c\) The faithful are called light, both because they have the true
light in them which enlightens them, and also because they give light to
others, insomuch that their honest conversation reproves the life of
wicked men.

[Ephesians 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eph 5:9</span></span>

(For the fruit of the (d) Spirit \[is\] in all goodness and
righteousness and truth;)

\(d\) By whose power we are made light in the Lord.

[Ephesians 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eph 5:11</span></span>

And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather
(e) reprove \[them\].

\(e\) Make them open to all the world, by your good life.

[Ephesians 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eph 5:14</span></span>

Wherefore (f) he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the (g)
dead, and Christ shall give thee light.

\(f\) The scripture, or God in the scripture.

\(g\) He speaks of the death of sin.

[Ephesians 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eph 5:15</span></span>

\(4\) See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,

\(4\) The worse and more corrupt that the manners of this world are, the
more watchful we ought to be in every situation, and give regard to
nothing but the will of God.

[Ephesians 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eph 5:16</span></span>

\(h\) Redeeming the time, because the (i) days are evil.

\(h\) This is a metaphor taken from the merchants: who prefer the least
profit that may be before any of their pleasures.

\(i\) The times are troublesome and severe.

[Ephesians 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eph 5:18</span></span>

\(5\) And be not drunk with wine, wherein is (k) excess; but be filled
with the Spirit;

\(5\) He sets the sober and holy assemblies of the faithful against the
immoral banquets of the unfaithful, in which the praises of the only
Lord must ring, whether it is it in prosperity or diversity.

\(k\) Every type of disorder, together with every manner of filthiness
and shamefulness.

[Ephesians 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eph 5:19</span></span>

Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing
and making melody in your (l) heart to the Lord;

\(l\) With an earnest affection of the heart, and not with the tongue
only.

[Ephesians 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eph 5:21</span></span>

\(6\) Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.

\(6\) A short repetition of the end to which all things ought to be
referred, to serve one another for God's sake.

[Ephesians 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eph 5:22</span></span>

\(7\) Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, (8) as unto the
Lord.

\(7\) Now he descends to a family, dividing orderly all the parts of a
family. And he says that the duty of wives consists in this, to be
obedient to their husbands. (8) The first argument, for they cannot be
disobedient to their husbands except by also resisting God, who is the
author of this subjection.

[Ephesians 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eph 5:23</span></span>

\(9\) For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the
head of the church: (10) and he is the saviour of the body.

\(9\) A declaration of the former saying: because God has made the man
head of the woman in marriage, as Christ is the head of the Church.

\(10\) Another argument: because the good estate of the wife depends on
the man, so that this submission is not only just, but also very
profitable: as also the salvation of the Church depends on Christ,
although to a far greater degree.

[Ephesians 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">eph 5:24</span></span>

\(11\) Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so \[let\] the
wives \[be\] to their own husbands in every thing.

\(11\) The conclusion of the wives' duties towards their husbands.

[Ephesians 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">eph 5:25</span></span>

\(12\) Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church,
and gave himself for it;

\(12\) The husbands duty towards their wives is to love them as
themselves, of which love the love of Christ towards his Church is a
graphic image.

[Ephesians 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">eph 5:26</span></span>

\(13\) That he might (m) sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of
water by the (n) word,

\(13\) Because many men pretend the infirmities of their wives to excuse
their own hardness and cruelty, the apostle wishes us to mark what
manner of Church Christ received, when he joined it to himself, and how
he does not reject her for all her filth, and uncleanness, but ceases
not to wipe it away with his cleanness, until he wholly purifies it.

\(m\) Make it holy.

\(n\) Through the promise of free justification and sanctification in
Christ, received by faith.

[Ephesians 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">eph 5:27</span></span>

That he might present it to himself a glorious church, (o) not having
spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and
without blemish.

\(o\) The Church as it is considered in itself, will not be without
wrinkle, before it come to the mark it aims at: for while it is in this
life, it runs in a race. But if it is considered in Christ, it is clean
and without wrinkle.

[Ephesians 5:28](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">eph 5:28</span></span>

\(14\) So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that
loveth his wife loveth himself.

\(14\) Another argument: every man loves himself, even by nature:
therefore he strives against nature that does not love his wife. He
proves the conclusion, first by the mystical knitting of Christ and the
Church together, and then by the ordinance of God, who says that man and
wife are as one, that is, not to be divided.

[Ephesians 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">eph 5:29</span></span>

For no man ever yet hated his (p) own flesh; but nourisheth and
cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:

\(p\) His own body.

[Ephesians 5:30](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">eph 5:30</span></span>

For we are members of his body, (q) of his flesh, and of his bones.

\(q\) He alludes to the making of the woman, which signifies our union
with Christ, which is accomplished by faith, but is signified in the
ordinance of the Lord's supper.

[Ephesians 5:31](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">eph 5:31</span></span>

For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall (r) be
joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.

\(r\) See [Mat 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#005)

[Ephesians 5:32](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">eph 5:32</span></span>

\(15\) This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the
church.

\(15\) That no man might dream of natural union or knitting of Christ
and his Church together (such as the husbands and the wives is) he shows
that it is secret, that is, spiritual and such as differs greatly from
the common capacity of man. And it consists by the power of the Spirit,
and not of the flesh, by faith, and by no natural bond.

[Ephesians 5:33](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">eph 5:33</span></span>

\(16\) Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife
even as himself; and the wife \[see\] that she reverence \[her\]
husband.

\(16\) The conclusion both of the husband's duty toward his wife, and of
the wife's toward her husband.
