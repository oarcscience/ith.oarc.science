<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">est 2:1</A></FONT></span></p>After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased, he (a) remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed (b) against her. 
<p>
<p>(a) That is, he brought the matter again into discussion. (b) By the seven wise men of his counsel.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#003">Esther 2:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">est 2:3</A></FONT></span></p>And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, unto the custody of Hege the king's chamberlain, (c) keeper of the women; and let their things (d) for purification be given [them]: 
<p>
<p>(c) The abuse of these countries was so great, that they invented many means to serve the lusts of princes and therefore they ordained wicked laws that the king might have whose daughters he would. They had many houses appointed, one for the virgins, another for the concubines and another for the queen. 
<p>
<p>(d) Read what this purification was in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#012">Est 2:12</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#011">Esther 2:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">est 2:11</A></FONT></span></p>And Mordecai walked (e) every day before the court of the women's house, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her. 
<p>
<p>(e) For though she was taken away by a cruel law, yet he did not cease to have a fatherly care for her, and therefore often sought to hear of her.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#013">Esther 2:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">est 2:13</A></FONT></span></p>Then thus came [every] maiden unto the king; whatsoever she desired was (f) given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king's house. 
<p>
<p>(f) Whatever apparel she asked for, the eunuch was bound to give to her.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#015">Esther 2:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">est 2:15</A></FONT></span></p>Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women, (g) appointed. And Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her. 
<p>
<p>(g) In which her modesty appeared because she did not seek to dress to command her beauty but sought the eunuch's appointment.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#016">Esther 2:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">est 2:16</A></FONT></span></p>So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which [is] the (h) month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign. 
<p>
<p>(h) Which contained part of December and part of January.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#018">Esther 2:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">est 2:18</A></FONT></span></p>Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants, [even] Esther's (i) feast; and he made a release (k) to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the (l) state of the king. 
<p>
<p>(i) That is, made for her sake. 
<p>
<p>(k) He released their tribute. 
<p>
<p>(l) That is, great and magnificent.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#019">Esther 2:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">est 2:19</A></FONT></span></p>And when the virgins were gathered together the (m) second time, then Mordecai sat in the king's gate. 
<p>
<p>(m) That is, at the marriage of Esther, which was the second marriage for the king.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#021">Esther 2:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">est 2:21</A></FONT></span></p>In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king's gate, two of the king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the door, were wroth, and sought to lay (n) hand on the king Ahasuerus. 
<p>
<p>(n) Meaning, to kill him.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">est 2:23</A></FONT></span></p>And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out; therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book of the (o) chronicles before the king. 
<p>
<p>(o) In the chronicles of the Medes and Persians, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/est010.htm#002">Est 10:2</A>).
