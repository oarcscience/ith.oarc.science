<p>
<p>The Argument - This book of psalms is given to us by the Holy Spirit, to be esteemed as a precious treasure in which all things are contained that bring to true happiness in this present life as well as in the life to come. For the riches of true knowledge and heavenly wisdom, are here set open for us, to take of it most abundantly. If we would know the great and high majesty of God, here we may see the brightness of it shine clearly. If we would seek his incomprehensible wisdom, here is the school of the same profession. If we would comprehend his inestimable bounty, and approach near to it, and fill our hands with that treasure, here we may have a most lively and comfortable taste of it. If we would know where our salvation lies and how to attain to everlasting life, here is Christ our Redeemer, and Mediator most evidently described. The rich man may learn the true use of his riches. The poor man may find full contentment. He who will rejoice will know true joy, and how to keep measure in it. They who are afflicted and oppressed will see what their comfort exists in, and how they should praise God when he sends them deliverance. The wicked and the persecutors of the children of God will see how the hand of God is always against them: and though he permits them to prosper for a while, yet he bridles them, so much so that they cannot touch a hair of ones head unless he permits them, and how in the end their destruction is most miserable. Briefly here we have most present remedies against all temptations and troubles of mind and conscience, so that being well practised in this, we may be assured against all dangers in this life, live in the true fear and love of God, and at length attain the incorruptible crown of glory, which is laid up for all who love the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
<p>
<p>(a) When a man has once given place to evil counsel, or to his own sin nature, he begins to forget himself in his sin, and so falls into contempt of God, which is called the seat of the scorners.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#002">Psalms 1:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">psa 1:2</A></FONT></span></p>But his delight [is] in the law of the LORD; and in his (b) law doth he meditate day and night. 
<p>
<p>(b) In the holy scriptures.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#003">Psalms 1:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">psa 1:3</A></FONT></span></p>And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and (c) whatsoever he doeth shall prosper. 
<p>
<p>(c) God's children are so moistened with his grace, that whatever comes to them, tends to their salvation.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#004">Psalms 1:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">psa 1:4</A></FONT></span></p>(d) The ungodly [are] not so: but [are] like the chaff which the wind driveth away. 
<p>
<p>(d) Though the wicked seem to prosper in this world, yet the Lord drives them down that they shall not rise nor stand in the company of the righteous.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#005">Psalms 1:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">psa 1:5</A></FONT></span></p>Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the (e) judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous. 
<p>
<p>(e) But tremble when they see God's wrath.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#006">Psalms 1:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">psa 1:6</A></FONT></span></p>For the LORD (f) knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish. 
<p>
<p>(f) Approves and prospers, in the same way that to not know is to reprove and reject.
