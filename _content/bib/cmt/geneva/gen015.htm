<p>
<p>(a) His fear was not only lest he should not have children, but lest the promise of the blessed seed should not be accomplished in him.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#008">Genesis 15:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">gen 15:8</A></FONT></span></p>And he said, Lord GOD, (b) whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it? 
<p>
<p>(b) This is a particular motion of God's Spirit, which is not lawful for all to follow, in asking signs: but was permitted for some by a peculiar motion, as to Gideon and Ezekiel.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#010">Genesis 15:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">gen 15:10</A></FONT></span></p>And he took unto him all these, and (c) divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not. 
<p>
<p>(c) This was the old custom in making covenants, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#018">Jer 39:18</A>), to which God added these conditions, that Abram's posterity would be as torn in pieces, but after they would be rejoined: also that it would be assaulted, but yet delivered.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#013">Genesis 15:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">gen 15:13</A></FONT></span></p>And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land [that is] not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them (d) four hundred years; 
<p>
<p>(d) Counting from the birth of Isaac to their departure of Egypt: Which declares that God will allow his to be afflicted in this world.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#016">Genesis 15:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">gen 15:16</A></FONT></span></p>But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the (e) iniquity of the Amorites [is] not yet full. 
<p>
<p>(e) Though God tolerates the wicked for a time, yet his vengeance falls on them when the measure of their wickedness is full.
