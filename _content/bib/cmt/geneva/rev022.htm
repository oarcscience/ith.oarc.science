<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#001">Revelation 22:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">rev 22:1</A></FONT></span></p>And (1) he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. 
<p>
<p>(1) Here is absolved and finished the description of the celestial Church (as I showed before) See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#012">Rev 21:12</A> by the effects in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#005">Rev 22:5</A>), and then this book is concluded in the rest of the chapter. The effects proceeding from God, who dwells in the Church, are these: the everlasting grace of God, in this verse, the eternal life of the godly, as in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#007">Rev 2:7</A>) the eternal fruits which the godly bring forth to God, themselves and others, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#002">Rev 22:2</A>), freedom and immunity from all evil, God himself taking pleasure in his servants, and they likewise in their God, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#003">Rev 22:3</A>). The beholding and sight of God, and sealing of the faithful from all eternity, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#004">Rev 22:4</A>) the light of God and an everlasting kingdom and glory, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#005">Rev 22:5</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#006">Revelation 22:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">rev 22:6</A></FONT></span></p>(2) And he said unto me, These sayings [are] faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants the things which must shortly be done. 
<p>
<p>(2) This whole book is concluded and made up by a confirmation, and a salutation. The confirmation has three parts: the words of the angel (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#015">Rev 22:15</A>), the words of Christ, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#016">Rev 22:16-17</A>) and the supplication made by John from divine authority, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#018">Rev 22:18-20</A>). By the speech of the angel this prophecy is confirmed to (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#007">Rev 22:7-8</A>), and then he speaks of the use of this book in the verses following. The prophecy is first confirmed by the angel from the nature of it, that it is faithful and true: Secondly, from the nature of the efficient cause, both principal, which is God, and instrumental, which is the angel in this verse. Thirdly, from the promises of God concerning his coming to effect all these things, and concerning our salvation; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#007">Rev 22:7</A>). Fourthly, from the testification of John himself; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#008">Rev 22:8</A>). The rest of the speech of the angel rending to the same end, John interrupted or broke off by his unadvised act of worshipping him, in the same verse, which the angel forbidding, teaches him that adoration must be given not to him, but only to God, as for himself, that he is of such nature and office, as he may not be adored: which thing also was in like manner done; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#010">Rev 19:10</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#010">Revelation 22:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">rev 22:10</A></FONT></span></p>(3) And he saith unto me, (4) Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand. 
<p>
<p>(3) The angel returns to his former speech: in which he teaches to use of this book both towards ourselves, in this and the next verse: and in respect of God for declaration of his truth, there to the fifteenth verse (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#011">Rev 22:11-15</A>). (4) That is, propound this prophecy openly to all and conceal no part of it. The contrary to that which is commanded in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#016">Isa 8:16</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#026">Dan 8:26</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#011">Revelation 22:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">rev 22:11</A></FONT></span></p>(5) He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still. 
<p>
<p>(5) An objection anticipated, but there will be some that will use this occasion for evil, and will wrest this scripture to their own destruction, as Peter says. What then? says the angel, the mysteries of God must not be concealed, which it has pleased him to communicate to us. Let them be harmful to others, let such be more and more vile in themselves, whom this scripture does not please: yet others will be further conformed to righteousness by this, and true holiness. The care and reformation of these may not be neglected, because of the voluntary and malicious offence of others.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#012">Revelation 22:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">rev 22:12</A></FONT></span></p>(6) And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward [is] with me, to give every man according as his work shall be. 
<p>
<p>(6) The second part belonging to the use of this book, as I said See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#010">Rev 22:10</A>. Also (says God by the angel) though there should be no use of this book to men: yet it shall be of this use to me, that it is a witness of my truth to my glory, who will come shortly, to give and execute just judgment, in this verse; who have taught that all these things have their being in me, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#013">Rev 22:13</A>), and have pronounced blessedness to my servants in the Church, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#014">Rev 22:14</A>) and reprobation to the ungodly (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#015">Rev 22:15</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#014">Revelation 22:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">rev 22:14</A></FONT></span></p>Blessed [are] they that do his commandments, (7) that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city. 
<p>
<p>(7) The blessedness of the godly set down by their title and interest there: and their fruit in the same.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#016">Revelation 22:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">rev 22:16</A></FONT></span></p>(8) I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, [and] the bright and morning star. 
<p>
<p>(8) The second passage of confirmation (as I said) is the speech of Christ ratifying the vocation of John, and the authority of his calling and testimony, both from the condition of his own person being God and man, in whom all the promises of God are Yea and Amen; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#020">Co2 1:20</A>) and also from the testimony of other people, by the acclamation of the Holy Spirit, who here is an honourable assistant of the marriage of the Church as the spouse: and of each of the godly as members; and finally from the thing present, that of their own knowledge and accord, they are called forth to the participation of the good things of God; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#017">Gen 22:17</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#018">Revelation 22:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">rev 22:18</A></FONT></span></p>(9) For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book: 
<p>
<p>(9) The supplication of John (which is the third part of the confirmation) joined with a curse of abhorrence, to preserve the truth of this book entire and uncorrupted in two verses.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#020">Revelation 22:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">rev 22:20</A></FONT></span></p>(10) He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus. 
<p>
<p>(10) A divine confirmation or sealing of the supplication first from Christ affirming the same and denouncing his coming against all those that will put their sacrilegious hands here: then from John himself, who by a most holy prayer calls Christ to take vengeance on them.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#021">Revelation 22:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">rev 22:21</A></FONT></span></p>(11) The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you all. Amen. 
<p>
<p>(11) The apostolic salutation, which is the other part of the conclusion, as I said See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#006">Rev 22:6</A> and is the end of almost every epistle; which we wish to the Church, and to all the holy and elect members of it, in Christ Jesus our Lord, until his coming to judgment "Come Lord Jesus" and do it. Amen, again Amen.  </BODY>
