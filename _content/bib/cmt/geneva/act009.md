### [Acts Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#001)

[Acts 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 9:1</span></span>

And (1) Saul, yet (a) breathing out threatenings and slaughter against
the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest,

\(1\) Saul (who is also Paul), persecuting Christ most cruelly, who did
as it were flee before him, falls into Christ's hands, and is overcome:
and with a singular example of the goodness of God, in place of
punishment which he justly deserved for his cruelty, is not only kindly
received, but is also even by the mouth of God appointed an apostle, and
is confirmed by the ministry and witness of Ananias.

\(a\) This is a sign that Saul's stomach boiled and cast out great
threats to murder the disciples.

[Acts 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 9:2</span></span>

And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he
found any of this (b) way, whether they were men or women, he might
bring them bound unto Jerusalem.

\(b\) Any trade of life which a man take upon himself the Jews call a
"way".

[Acts 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 9:5</span></span>

And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou
persecutest: \[it is\] (c) hard for thee to kick against the pricks.

\(c\) This is a proverb which is spoken of those who through their
stubbornness hurt themselves.

[Acts 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 9:7</span></span>

And the men which journeyed with him (d) stood speechless, hearing a (e)
voice, but seeing no man.

\(d\) Stood still and could not go one step forward, but remained amazed
as stood still like statues.

\(e\) They heard Paul's voice: for afterwards it is plainly said in
([Act 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#009)) that they did not hear the
voice of the one who spoke. Others, however, try to reconcile these
places (which seem to contradict) by saying that the men with Saul heard
the sound of a voice, but did not hear it clearly.

[Acts 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 9:11</span></span>

And the Lord \[said\] unto him, Arise, and go into the street which is
called Straight, and enquire in the house of Judas for \[one\] called
Saul, of (f) Tarsus: for, behold, he prayeth,

\(f\) Tarsus was a city of Cilicia near to Anchiala. It is said that
Sardanapalus built these two cities in one day.

[Acts 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 9:15</span></span>

But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a (g) chosen vessel
unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the
children of Israel:

\(g\) To bear my name in.

[Acts 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">act 9:16</span></span>

For I will (h) shew him how great things he must suffer for my name's
sake.

\(h\) I will plainly show him.

[Acts 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">act 9:17</span></span>

And Ananias went his way, and entered into (i) the house; and putting
his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, \[even\] Jesus, that
appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent me, that thou
mightest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.

\(i\) Into Judas' house.

[Acts 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 9:20</span></span>

\(2\) And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is
the Son of God.

\(2\) Paul begins immediately to execute the office which was given and
commanded to him, never consulting with flesh and blood.

[Acts 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 9:22</span></span>

\(3\) But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews
which dwelt at Damascus, (k) proving that this is very Christ.

\(3\) Paul does not do battle only with his own authority, but also with
the testimonies of the Prophets.

\(k\) By conferring places of the Scripture together, as skilful
craftsman do when they make something, they used to gather all parts
together, to make them agree fitly one with another.

[Acts 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 9:23</span></span>

\(4\) And after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to
kill him:

\(4\) Paul, who was before a persecutor, now has persecution planned
against himself, though it will not happen for a long time.

[Acts 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 9:25</span></span>

\(5\) Then the disciples took him by night, and let \[him\] down by the
wall in a basket.

\(5\) We are not forbidden to avoid and eschew the dangers and
conspiracies that the enemies of God lay for us, but only if we do not
swerve from our vocation.

[Acts 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 9:26</span></span>

\(6\) And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself to
the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he
was a disciple.

\(6\) In ancient times no man was rashly or lightly received into the
members and the sheep of the Church, much less to be a pastor.

[Acts 9:28](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">act 9:28</span></span>

\(7\) And he was (l) with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem.

\(7\) The steadfast servants of God must look out for danger after
danger: yet God watches out for them.

\(l\) With Peter and James, for he says that he saw none of the apostles
but them; ([Gal 1:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#018)).

[Acts 9:29](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">act 9:29</span></span>

And he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and disputed against
the (m) Grecians: but they went about to slay him.

\(m\) See ([Act 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#001)).

[Acts 9:30](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">act 9:30</span></span>

\(8\) \[Which\] when the brethren knew, they brought him down to
Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus.

\(8\) The ministers of the word may change their place with the advice
and counsel of the congregation and church.

[Acts 9:31](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">act 9:31</span></span>

\(9\) Then had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and
Samaria, and were (n) edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and
in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied.

\(9\) The result of persecutions is the building of the Church, so that
we will patiently wait for the Lord.

\(n\) This is a borrowed type of speech which signifies establishment
and increase.

[Acts 9:32](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">act 9:32</span></span>

\(10\) And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all \[quarters\],
he came down also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda.

\(10\) Peter's apostleship is confirmed by the healing of the man who
suffered from paralysis.

[Acts 9:35](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">act 9:35</span></span>

And all that dwelt at (o) Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned to the
Lord.

\(o\) Lydda was a city of Palestine, and Saron a first-class country,
and a place which was excellent for grazing, between Caesarea of
Palestine and Mount Tabor, and the lake of Gennesaret, which goes far
beyond Joppa.

[Acts 9:36](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">act 9:36</span></span>

\(11\) Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by
interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and
almsdeeds which she did.

\(11\) Peter clearly declares, by raising up a dead body through the
name of Christ, that he preaches the glad tidings of life.
