<p>
<p>(a) Which was either a musical instrument or a solemn tune, to which this psalm was sung. 
<p>
<p>(b) In all manner of troubles God shows his speedy mercy and power in defending his.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#002">Psalms 46:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">psa 46:2</A></FONT></span></p>Therefore will not we (c) fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea; 
<p>
<p>(c) That is, we will not be overcome with fear.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#003">Psalms 46:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">psa 46:3</A></FONT></span></p>[Though] the waters thereof (d) roar [and] be troubled, [though] the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah. 
<p>
<p>(d) Though the afflictions rage, yet the rivers of God's mercies bring sufficient comfort to his.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#004">Psalms 46:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">psa 46:4</A></FONT></span></p>[There is] a (e) river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy [place] of the tabernacles of the most High. 
<p>
<p>(e) The river of Shiloh, which passed through Jerusalem: meaning, though the defence seems small, yet if God has appointed it, it is sufficient.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#005">Psalms 46:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">psa 46:5</A></FONT></span></p>God [is] in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her, [and that] (f) right early. 
<p>
<p>(f) Always when need requires.

<p>
<p>(g) They are assured that God can and will defend his Church from all dangers and enemies.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#008">Psalms 46:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">psa 46:8</A></FONT></span></p>Come, behold the works of the LORD, (h) what desolations he hath made in the earth. 
<p>
<p>(h) That is, how often he has destroyed his enemies, and delivered his people.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#010">Psalms 46:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">psa 46:10</A></FONT></span></p>Be (i) still, and know that I [am] God: I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth. 
<p>
<p>(i) He warns them who persecute the Church to cease their cruelty: for also they will feel that God is too strong for them against whom they fight.
