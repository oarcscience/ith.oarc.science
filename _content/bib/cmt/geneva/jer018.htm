<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#004">Jeremiah 18:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">jer 18:4</A></FONT></span></p>And the vessel that he made of (a) clay was marred in the hand of the potter: so he made it again another vessel, as it seemed good to the potter to make [it]. 
<p>
<p>(a) As the potter has power over the clay to make what pot he will, or to break them, when he has made them: so have I power over you to do with you as seems good to me, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#009">Isa 45:9</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#020">Rom 9:20-21</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#008">Jeremiah 18:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">jer 18:8</A></FONT></span></p>If that nation, against which I have pronounced, shall turn from their evil, I will (b) repent of the evil that I thought to do to them. 
<p>
<p>(b) When the Scripture attributes repentance to God, it is not that he does contrary to that which he has ordained in his secret counsel: but when he threatens it is a calling to repentance, and when he gives man grace to repent, the threatening (which ever contains a condition in it) takes no place: and this the scripture calls repentance in God, because it so appears to man's judgment.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#012">Jeremiah 18:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">jer 18:12</A></FONT></span></p>And they said, (c) There is no hope: but we will walk after our own plots, and we will every one do the imagination of his evil heart. 
<p>
<p>(c) As men who had no remorse but were altogether bent to rebellion and to their own selfwill.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#014">Jeremiah 18:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">jer 18:14</A></FONT></span></p>Will [a man] leave the snow of Lebanon [which cometh] from the rock of the field? (d) [or] shall the cold flowing waters that come from another place be forsaken? 
<p>
<p>(d) As no man that has thirst refuses fresh waters which he has at home, to go and seek waters abroad to quench his thirst: so they should not seek help and comfort from strangers and leave God who was present with them.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#015">Jeremiah 18:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">jer 18:15</A></FONT></span></p>Because my people hath forgotten me, they have burned incense to vanity, and they have caused them to stumble in their ways [from] the (e) ancient paths, to walk in paths, [in] a way not cast up; 
<p>
<p>(e) That is, the way of truth which God had taught by his law, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#016">Jer 6:16</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#017">Jeremiah 18:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">jer 18:17</A></FONT></span></p>I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I will show them the back, and (f) not the face, in the day of their calamity. 
<p>
<p>(f) I will show my anger and not my favour toward them.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#018">Jeremiah 18:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">jer 18:18</A></FONT></span></p>Then said they, Come, and let us devise plots against Jeremiah; for the law (g) shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, and let us smite him with the (h) tongue, and let us not give heed to any of his words. 
<p>
<p>(g) This argument the wicked have always used against the servants of God. The church cannot err: we are the Church, and therefore whoever speaks against us, they ought to die, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#024">Kg1 22:24</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#004">Jer 7:4</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#002">Jer 20:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#004">Mal 2:4</A>) and thus the false Church persecutes the true Church, which stands not in outward pomp, and in multitude, but is known by the graces of the Holy Spirit. 
<p>
<p>(h) Let us slander him and accuse him: for we will be believed.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#021">Jeremiah 18:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">jer 18:21</A></FONT></span></p>Therefore (i) deliver their children to the famine, and pour out their [blood] by the force of the sword; and let their wives be bereaved of their children, and [be] widows; and let their men be put to death; [let] their young men [be] slain by the sword in battle. 
<p>
<p>(i) Seeing the obstinate malice of the adversaries, who grew daily more and more, the prophet being moved with God's Spirit, without any carnal affection prays for their destruction because he knew that it would be to God's glory, and profit of his Church.
