### [Hosea Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#001)

[Hosea 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hos 3:1</span></span>

Then said the LORD unto me, (a) Go yet, love a woman beloved of \[her\]
friend, yet an adulteress, according to the love of the LORD toward the
children of Israel, who look to other gods, and (b) love flagons of
wine.

\(a\) In this the Prophet represents the person of God, who loved his
Church before he called her, and did not withdraw his love when she gave
herself to idols.

\(b\) That is, gave themselves wholly to pleasure, and could not stop,
as those that are given to drunkenness.

[Hosea 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">hos 3:2</span></span>

So (c) I bought her to me for fifteen \[pieces\] of silver, and \[for\]
an homer of barley, and an half homer of barley:

\(c\) Yet I loved her and paid a small portion for her, lest she would
have perceived the greatness of my love, and abused me, and not been
under duty: for fifteen pieces of silver was but half the price of a
slave; ([Exo 21:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#032)).

[Hosea 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">hos 3:3</span></span>

And I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for (d) me many days; thou shalt
not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be for \[another\] man: so
\[will\] I also \[be\] for thee.

\(d\) I will try you a long time as in your widowhood, whether you will
be mine or not.

[Hosea 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hos 3:4</span></span>

For the children of Israel shall (e) abide many days without a king, and
without a (f) prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and
without an ephod, and \[without\] teraphim:

\(e\) Meaning not only all the time of their captivity, but also until
Christ.

\(f\) That is, they would neither have administration nor religion, and
their idols also in which they put their confidence, would be destroyed.

[Hosea 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">hos 3:5</span></span>

Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the LORD their
God, and (g) David their king; and shall fear the LORD and his goodness
in the latter days.

\(g\) This is meant of Christ's kingdom, which was promised to David to
be eternal; ([Psa 72:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#017)).
