### [Job Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#001)

[Job 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 6:2</span></span>

Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the (a)
balances together!

(a To know whether I complain without just cause.

[Job 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 6:3</span></span>

For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words
are (b) swallowed up.

\(b\) My grief is so great that I lack words to express it.

[Job 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 6:4</span></span>

For the arrows of the Almighty \[are\] within me, the poison whereof
drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do (c) set themselves in array
against me.

\(c\) Which declares that he was not only afflicted in body, but wounded
in conscience, which is the greatest battle that the faithful can have.

[Job 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 6:5</span></span>

Doth the (d) wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his
fodder?

\(d\) Do you think that I cry without cause, seeing the brute beasts do
not complain when they have what they want.

[Job 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 6:6</span></span>

Can that which is (e) unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there
\[any\] taste in the white of an egg?

\(e\) Can a man's taste delight in that, which has no savour? meaning
that no one takes pleasure in affliction seeing they cannot do away with
things that are unsavoury to the mouth.

[Job 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 6:8</span></span>

Oh that I might have my (f) request; and that God would grant \[me\] the
thing that I long for!

\(f\) In this he sins double, both in wishing through impatience to die,
and also in desiring of God a thing which was not agreeable to his will.

[Job 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 6:10</span></span>

Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow:
let him not spare; (g) for I have not concealed the words of the Holy
One.

\(g\) That is, let me die at once before I come to distrust God's
promise through my impatience.

[Job 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 6:11</span></span>

What \[is\] my strength, that I should hope? and what \[is\] mine (h)
end, that I should prolong my life?

\(h\) He fears lest he should be brought to inconveniences, if his
sorrows should continue.

[Job 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 6:13</span></span>

\[Is\] not my (i) help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?

\(i\) Have I not sought to help myself as much as was possible?

[Job 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 6:15</span></span>

My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a (k) brook, \[and\] as the stream
of brooks they pass away;

\(k\) He compares friends who do not comfort us in our misery to a brook
which in summer when we need water is dry, in winter is hard frozen and
in the time of rain when we have no need overflows with water.

[Job 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 6:19</span></span>

The troops of Tema (l) looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them.

\(l\) They who pass by it to go into the hot countries of Arabia, think
to find water there to quench their thirst but they are deceived.

[Job 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 6:21</span></span>

For now ye are (m) nothing; ye see \[my\] casting down, and are afraid.

\(m\) That is, like this brook which deceives them who think to have
water there in their need, as I looked for consolation from you.

[Job 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 6:22</span></span>

Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your (n)
substance?

\(n\) He touches the worldlings who for need will give part of their
goods, and much more these men, who would not give him comfortable
words.

[Job 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">job 6:24</span></span>

Teach me, and I will (o) hold my tongue: and cause me to understand
wherein I have erred.

\(o\) Show me where I have erred, and I will confess my sin.

[Job 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">job 6:25</span></span>

How (p) forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove?

\(p\) He who has a good conscience does not shrink at the sharp words or
reasonings of others, unless they are able to persuade him by reason.

[Job 6:26](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">job 6:26</span></span>

Do ye imagine to reprove (q) words, and the speeches of one that is
desperate, \[which are\] as wind?

\(q\) Do you object to my words because I would be thought to speak
foolishly, and am now in misery?

[Job 6:28](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">job 6:28</span></span>

Now therefore be content, (r) look upon me; for \[it is\] evident unto
you if I lie.

\(r\) Consider whether I speak as one who is driven to this impatience
through sorrow, or as a hypocrite as you condemn me.
