<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">sa1 8:1</A></FONT></span></p>And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he (a) made his sons judges over Israel. 
<p>
<p>(a) Because he was not able to bear the charge. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#002">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 8:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">sa1 8:2</A></FONT></span></p>Now the name of his firstborn was (b) Joel; and the name of his second, Abiah: [they were] judges in Beersheba. 
<p>
<p>(b) Who was also called Vashni, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#028">Ch1 6:28</A>). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#004">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 8:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">sa1 8:4</A></FONT></span></p>Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto (c) Ramah, 
<p>
<p>(c) For there his house was, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#017">Sa1 7:17</A>). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#006">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 8:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">sa1 8:6</A></FONT></span></p>But the thing (d) displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the LORD. 
<p>
<p>(d) Because they were not content with the order that God had appointed, but would be governed as the Gentiles were. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#009">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 8:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">sa1 8:9</A></FONT></span></p>Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet (e) protest solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them. 
<p>
<p>(e) To prove if they will forsake their wicked purpose. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#011">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 8:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">sa1 8:11</A></FONT></span></p>And he said, This will be the (f) manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint [them] for himself, for his chariots, and [to be] his horsemen; and [some] shall run before his chariots. 
<p>
<p>(f) Not that kings have this authority by their office, but that such as reign in God's wrath would usurp this over their brethren, contrary to the law, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#020">Deu 17:20</A>). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#018">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 8:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">sa1 8:18</A></FONT></span></p>And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you; and the LORD will not (g) hear you in that day. 
<p>
<p>(g) Because you do not repent for your sins, but because you long for your afflictions, into which you cast yourselves willingly.
