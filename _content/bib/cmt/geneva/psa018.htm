<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#002">Psalms 18:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">psa 18:2</A></FONT></span></p>(a) The LORD [is] my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, [and] my high tower. 
<p>
<p>(a) He uses this diversity of names to show that as the wicked have many means to hurt, so God has many ways to help.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#003">Psalms 18:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">psa 18:3</A></FONT></span></p>I will call upon the LORD, [who is worthy] to be (b) praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies. 
<p>
<p>(b) For no one can obtain their request from God if they do not join his glory with their petition.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#004">Psalms 18:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">psa 18:4</A></FONT></span></p>(c) The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid. 
<p>
<p>(c) He speaks of the dangers and malice of his enemies from which God had delivered him.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#007">Psalms 18:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">psa 18:7</A></FONT></span></p>(d) Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth. 
<p>
<p>(d) A description of the wrath of God against his enemies, after he had heard his prayer.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#008">Psalms 18:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">psa 18:8</A></FONT></span></p>There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and (e) fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it. 
<p>
<p>(e) He shows how horrible God's judgments will be to the wicked.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#009">Psalms 18:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">psa 18:9</A></FONT></span></p>He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and (f) darkness [was] under his feet. 
<p>
<p>(f) Darkness signifies the wrath of God as the clear light signifies God's favour.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#010">Psalms 18:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">psa 18:10</A></FONT></span></p>And he rode upon a (g) cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind. 
<p>
<p>(g) This is described at large in (Psa. 104:1-35).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#011">Psalms 18:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">psa 18:11</A></FONT></span></p>He made darkness his (h) secret place; his pavilion round about him [were] dark waters [and] thick clouds of the skies. 
<p>
<p>(h) As a king angry with the people, will not show himself to them.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#013">Psalms 18:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">psa 18:13</A></FONT></span></p>The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave (i) his voice; hail [stones] and coals of fire. 
<p>
<p>(i) Thunders, lightnings and hail.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#014">Psalms 18:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">psa 18:14</A></FONT></span></p>Yea, he sent out (k) his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them. 
<p>
<p>(k) His lightening.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#015">Psalms 18:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">psa 18:15</A></FONT></span></p>Then the channels of waters were seen, and the (l) foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils. 
<p>
<p>(l) That is, the deep bottoms were seen when the Red sea was divided.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#016">Psalms 18:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">psa 18:16</A></FONT></span></p>He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many (m) waters. 
<p>
<p>(m) Out of many great dangers.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#017">Psalms 18:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">psa 18:17</A></FONT></span></p>He delivered me from my (n) strong enemy, and from them which hated me: for they were (o) too strong for me. 
<p>
<p>(n) That is, Saul. 
<p>
<p>(o) Therefore God sent me help.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#019">Psalms 18:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">psa 18:19</A></FONT></span></p>He brought me forth also into a large place; (p) he delivered me, because he delighted in me. 
<p>
<p>(p) The cause of God's deliverance is his favour and love for us.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#020">Psalms 18:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">psa 18:20</A></FONT></span></p>The LORD rewarded me according to my (q) righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me. 
<p>
<p>(q) David was sure of his righteous cause and good behaviour toward Saul and his enemies and therefore was assured of God's favour and deliverance.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#022">Psalms 18:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">psa 18:22</A></FONT></span></p>For all his judgments [were] before me, and I did not put away his (r) statutes from me. 
<p>
<p>(r) For all his dangers he exercised himself in the law of God.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#023">Psalms 18:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">psa 18:23</A></FONT></span></p>I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine (f) iniquity. 
<p>
<p>(f) I neither gave place to their wicked temptations nor to my own desires.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#025">Psalms 18:25</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_025">psa 18:25</A></FONT></span></p>With the (t) merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright; 
<p>
<p>(t) Here he speaks of God according to our capacity, who shows mercy to his and punishes the wicked, as is also said in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#021">Lev 26:21</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#024">Lev 26:24</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#027">Psalms 18:27</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_027">psa 18:27</A></FONT></span></p>For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt (u) bring down high looks. 
<p>
<p>(u) When their sin is come to the full measure.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#029">Psalms 18:29</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_029">psa 18:29</A></FONT></span></p>For by thee I have (x) run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall. 
<p>
<p>(x) He attributes it to God that he both got the victory in the field and also destroyed the cities of his enemies.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#030">Psalms 18:30</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_030">psa 18:30</A></FONT></span></p>[As for] God, his way [is] perfect: the (y) word of the LORD is tried: he [is] a buckler to all those that trust in him. 
<p>
<p>(y) No matter how great or many the dangers may be, yet God's promise must take effect.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#032">Psalms 18:32</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_032">psa 18:32</A></FONT></span></p>[It is] God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my (z) way perfect. 
<p>
<p>(z) He gives good success to all my enterprises.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#033">Psalms 18:33</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_033">psa 18:33</A></FONT></span></p>He maketh my feet like hinds' [feet], and setteth me upon my (a) high places. 
<p>
<p>(a) As towers and forts, which he took out of the hands of God's enemies.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#035">Psalms 18:35</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_035">psa 18:35</A></FONT></span></p>Thou hast also given me the (b) shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy (c) gentleness hath made me great. 
<p>
<p>(b) To defend me from dangers. 
<p>
<p>(c) He attributed the beginning, continuance and increase in well doing only to God's favour.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#037">Psalms 18:37</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_037">psa 18:37</A></FONT></span></p>(d) I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed. 
<p>
<p>(d) David declares that he did nothing besides his calling, but was stirred up by God's Spirit to execute his judgments.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#040">Psalms 18:40</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_040">psa 18:40</A></FONT></span></p>Thou hast also (e) given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me. 
<p>
<p>(e) You have given them to my hands to be slain.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#041">Psalms 18:41</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_041">psa 18:41</A></FONT></span></p>They (f) cried, but [there was] none to save [them: even] unto the LORD, but he answered them not. 
<p>
<p>(f) They who reject the cry of the afflicted, God will also reject them when they cry for help, for either pain or fear causes those hypocrites to cry.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#043">Psalms 18:43</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_043">psa 18:43</A></FONT></span></p>Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; [and] thou hast made me the head of the (g) heathen: a people [whom] I have not (h) known shall serve me. 
<p>
<p>(g) Who dwell round about me. 
<p>
<p>(h) The kingdom of Christ is prefigured in David's kingdom, who by the preaching of his word brings all to his subjection.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#044">Psalms 18:44</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_044">psa 18:44</A></FONT></span></p>As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall (i) submit themselves unto me. 
<p>
<p>(i) Or lie: signifying a subjection constrained and not voluntary.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#045">Psalms 18:45</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_045">psa 18:45</A></FONT></span></p>The strangers shall (k) fade away, and be afraid out of their close places. 
<p>
<p>(k) Fear will cause them to be afraid and come forth from their secret holes and holds to seek pardon.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#048">Psalms 18:48</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_048">psa 18:48</A></FONT></span></p>He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the (l) violent man. 
<p>
<p>(l) That is, Saul who out of malice persecuted him.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#049">Psalms 18:49</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_049">psa 18:49</A></FONT></span></p>Therefore will (m) I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and sing praises unto thy name. 
<p>
<p>(m) This prophecy belongs to the kingdom of Christ and calling of the Gentiles, as in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#009">Rom 15:9</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#050">Psalms 18:50</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_050">psa 18:50</A></FONT></span></p>Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his (n) seed for evermore. 
<p>
<p>(n) This did not properly belong to Solomon, but to Jesus Christ.
