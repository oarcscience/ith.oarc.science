[Joshua 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 11:1</span></span>

And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard \[those
things\], that he (a) sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of
Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,

\(a\) The more God's power appears, the more the wicked rage against it.

[Joshua 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jos 11:2</span></span>

And to the kings that \[were\] on the north of the mountains, and of the
plains south of (b) Chinneroth, and in the valley, and in the borders of
Dor on the west,

\(b\) Which the evangelists call the lake of Gennesaret, or Tiberias.

[Joshua 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jos 11:3</span></span>

\[And to\] the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and \[to\] the
Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the
mountains, and \[to\] the Hivite under (c) Hermon in the land of Mizpeh.

\(c\) Which was mount Sion, as in ([Deu
4:48](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#048)).

[Joshua 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jos 11:6</span></span>

And the LORD said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them: for to
morrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel:
thou shalt (d) hough their horses, and burn their chariots with fire.

\(d\) That neither they should serve to the use of war, nor the
Israelites should put their trust in them.

[Joshua 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jos 11:8</span></span>

And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote them, and
chased them unto great Zidon, and unto (e) Misrephothmaim, and unto the
valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they left them
none remaining.

\(e\) Which signifies hot waters, or according to some, brine pits.

[Joshua 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jos 11:11</span></span>

And they smote all the (f) souls that \[were\] therein with the edge of
the sword, utterly destroying \[them\]: there was not any left to
breathe: and he burnt Hazor with fire.

\(f\) Both men, women and children.

[Joshua 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jos 11:13</span></span>

But \[as for\] the cities that stood still in their (g) strength, Israel
burned none of them, save Hazor only; \[that\] did Joshua burn.

\(g\) Which were strong by situation and not hurt by war.

[Joshua 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jos 11:14</span></span>

And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of
Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every (h) man they smote
with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left
they any to breathe.

\(h\) All mankind.

[Joshua 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jos 11:16</span></span>

So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south country, and
all the land of Goshen, and the valley, and the plain, and the (i)
mountain of Israel, and the valley of the same;

\(i\) That is, Samaria.

[Joshua 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jos 11:17</span></span>

\[Even\] from the mount (k) Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even unto
Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all their kings
he took, and smote them, and slew them.

\(k\) So called, because it was bare and without trees.

[Joshua 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jos 11:20</span></span>

For it was of the LORD to (l) harden their hearts, that they should come
against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them utterly, \[and\]
that they might have no favour, but that he might destroy them, as the
LORD commanded Moses.

\(l\) That is, to give them over to themselves: and therefore they could
not but rebel against God and seek their own destruction.

[Joshua 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jos 11:22</span></span>

There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children of
Israel: only in Gaza, (m) in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained.

\(m\) Out of which came Goliath, ([Sa1
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#004)).
