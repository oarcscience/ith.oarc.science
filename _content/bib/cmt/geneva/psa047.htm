<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#001">Psalms 47:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">psa 47:1</A></FONT></span></p>"To the chief Musician, A Psalm for the sons of Korah." O (a) clap your hands, all ye people; shout unto God with the voice of triumph. 
<p>
<p>(a) Here is figured Christ to whom all his should give willing obedience, and who would show himself terrible to the wicked.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#003">Psalms 47:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">psa 47:3</A></FONT></span></p>He shall (b) subdue the people under us, and the nations under our feet. 
<p>
<p>(b) He has made the Jews who were the keepers of the law and prophets, schoolmasters to the Gentiles, that they would with gladness obey them.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#004">Psalms 47:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">psa 47:4</A></FONT></span></p>He shall choose (c) our inheritance for us, the excellency of Jacob whom he loved. Selah. 
<p>
<p>(c) God has chosen us above all other nations, to enjoy a most glorious inheritance.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#005">Psalms 47:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">psa 47:5</A></FONT></span></p>God is gone up with a shout, the LORD with the (d) sound of a trumpet. 
<p>
<p>(d) He alludes to the trumpets that were blown at solemn feasts: but he further signifies the triumph of Christ and his glorious ascension into the heavens.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#007">Psalms 47:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">psa 47:7</A></FONT></span></p>For God [is] the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with (e) understanding. 
<p>
<p>(e) He requires that understanding be joined with singing, lest the Name of God be profaned with vain crying.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#009">Psalms 47:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">psa 47:9</A></FONT></span></p>The princes of the people are gathered together, [even] the people of the God of Abraham: for the shields of the earth [belong] unto God: he (f) is greatly exalted. 
<p>
<p>(f) He praises God's highness, for that he joins the great princes of the world (whom he calls shields) to the fellowship of his Church.
