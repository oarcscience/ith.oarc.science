<p>(a) Which contains part of April and part of May.

<p>(b) By which is meant the temple and the oracle. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#003">3 Kings (1 Kings) 6:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">kg1 6:3</A></FONT></span></p>And the (c) porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits [was] the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; [and] ten cubits [was] the breadth thereof before the house. 
<p>
<p>(c) Or the court where the people prayed which was before the place where the altar of burnt offerings stood. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#005">3 Kings (1 Kings) 6:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">kg1 6:5</A></FONT></span></p>And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about, [against] the walls of the house round about, [both] of the temple and of (d) the oracle: and he made chambers round about: 
<p>
<p>(d) When God spoke between the Cherubim, called also the most holy place. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#006">3 Kings (1 Kings) 6:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">kg1 6:6</A></FONT></span></p>The nethermost chamber [was] five cubits broad, and the middle [was] six cubits broad, and the third [was] seven cubits broad: for without [in the wall] of the house he made narrowed (e) rests round about, that [the beams] should not be fastened in the walls of the house. 
<p>
<p>(e) Which were certain stones coming out of the wall, as stays for the beams to rest upon.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">kg1 6:9</A></FONT></span></p>So he built the (f) house, and finished it; and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar. 
<p>
<p>(f) In Exodus it is called the tabernacle, and the temple is here called the sanctuary and the oracle the most holy place. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#013">3 Kings (1 Kings) 6:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">kg1 6:13</A></FONT></span></p>And I will (g) dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel. 
<p>
<p>(g) According as he promised to Moses, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#022">Exo 25:22</A>).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">kg1 6:15</A></FONT></span></p>And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, both the floor of the house, and (h) the walls of the cieling: [and] he covered [them] on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir. 
<p>

<p>
<p>(i) For when he spoke of the house in the first verse, he meant both the oracle and the temple. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#019">3 Kings (1 Kings) 6:19</A></p>

<p>
<p>(k) That is, in the most inward place of the house.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">kg1 6:22</A></FONT></span></p>And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house: also the (l) whole altar that [was] by the oracle he overlaid with gold.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_028">kg1 6:28</A></FONT></span></p>And he (m) overlaid the cherubims with gold. 
<p>
<p>(m) For the others which Moses made of beaten gold were taken away with the other jewels by their enemies, whom God permitted at various times to overcome them for their great sins. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#032">3 Kings (1 Kings) 6:32</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_032">kg1 6:32</A></FONT></span></p>The two doors also [were of] olive tree; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid [them] with gold, and (n) spread gold upon the cherubims, and upon the palm trees. 
<p>
<p>(n) So that the fashion of the carved work might still appear.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_036">kg1 6:36</A></FONT></span></p>And he built the inner (o) court with three rows of hewed stone, and a row of cedar beams. 
<p>
<p>(o) Where the priests were, and was thus called in respect to the great court, which is called the porch of Solomon in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#011">Act 3:11</A>) where the people used to pray.
