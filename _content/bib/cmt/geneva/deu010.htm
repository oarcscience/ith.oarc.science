<p>
<p>(a) Which is a wood of long endurance.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#004">Deuteronomy 10:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">deu 10:4</A></FONT></span></p>And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which the LORD spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the (b) assembly: and the LORD gave them unto me. 
<p>
<p>(b) When you were assembled to receive the Law.

<p>
<p>(c) This mountain was also called Hor, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#028">Num 20:28</A>).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">deu 10:8</A></FONT></span></p>At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to (d) minister unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day. 
<p>
<p>(d) That is, to offer sacrifice, and to declare the Law to the people.

<p>(e) So God turned the curse of Jacob to a blessing (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#007">Gen 49:7</A>).

<p>
<p>(f) For all our sins and transgressions God requires nothing but to turn to him and obey him.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">deu 10:15</A></FONT></span></p>(g) Only the LORD had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he chose their seed after them, [even] you above all people, as [it is] this day. 
<p>
<p>(g) Although he was Lord of heaven and earth, he chose no one but you.
