### [Jeremiah Chapter 34](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 34:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 34:1</span></span>

The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, when (a) Nebuchadnezzar
king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth of
his dominion, and all the people, fought against Jerusalem, and against
all its cities, saying,

\(a\) Who commonly by Jeremiah was called Nebuchadrezzar and by others
Nebuchadnezzar.

[Jeremiah 34:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 34:5</span></span>

\[But\] thou shalt die in (b) peace: and with the burnings of thy
fathers, the former kings who were before thee, so shall they burn
\[incense\] for thee; and they will lament thee, \[saying\], Ah (c)
lord! for I have pronounced the word, saith the LORD.

\(b\) Not of any violent death.

\(c\) The Jews will lament for you their lord and king.

[Jeremiah 34:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 34:8</span></span>

\[This is\] the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after king
Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people who \[were\] at
Jerusalem, (d) to proclaim liberty to them;

\(d\) When the enemy was at hand and they saw themselves in danger, they
would seem holy, and so began some kind of reformation: but soon after
they uttered their hypocrisy.

[Jeremiah 34:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 34:9</span></span>

That every man should release his male (e) servant, and every man his
female servant, \[being\] a Hebrew man or woman; that none should retain
them in service, \[that is\], a Jew his brother.

\(e\) According to the law, ([Exo
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#002); [Deu
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#012)).

[Jeremiah 34:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 34:15</span></span>

And ye had now turned, and had done right in my sight, in proclaiming
liberty every man to his neighbour; and ye had made a covenant before me
in (f) the house which is called by my name:

\(f\) Meaning in the temple to declare that it was a most solemn and
straight covenant made in the name of the Lord.

[Jeremiah 34:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 34:17</span></span>

Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ye have not hearkened to me, in
proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother, and every man to his
neighbour: behold, I proclaim a liberty for you, saith the LORD, to (g)
the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine; and I will make you to
be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth.

\(g\) That is, I give the sword liberty to destroy you.

[Jeremiah 34:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 34:18</span></span>

And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant, who have not
performed the words of the covenant which they had made before me, when
they (h) cut the calf in two, and passed between the parts of it,

\(h\) Concerning the manner of solemn covenant which the ancients used
by passing between the two parts of a beast, to signify that the
transgressor of the same covenant should be so divided in pieces, read
([Gen 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#010)).

[Jeremiah 34:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 34:21</span></span>

And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes I will give into the hand of
their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life, and into
the hand of the king of Babylon's army, which (i) are gone up from you.

\(i\) To fight against the Egyptians, as in ([Jer
37:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#011)).
