<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#001">1 Thessalonians 5:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">th1 5:1</A></FONT></span></p>But (1) of the times and the (a) seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you. 
<p>
<p>(1) The day that God has appointed for this judgment we do not know. But this is sure, that it will come upon men when they are not expecting it. 
<p>
<p>(a) See (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#007">Act 1:7</A>). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#004">1 Thessalonians 5:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">th1 5:4</A></FONT></span></p>(2) But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief. 
<p>
<p>(2) Returning to exhortations, he warns us who are enlightened with the knowledge of God, that it is our duty not to live securely in pleasures, lest we be suddenly taken in a dead sleep in pleasures. But contrary to this we are to have an eye to the Lord, and not allow ourselves to be oppressed with the cares of this world, for pleasures are fitting for the darkness of the night, and having an eye to the Lord is fitting for the light. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#008">1 Thessalonians 5:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">th1 5:8</A></FONT></span></p>(3) But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation. 
<p>
<p>(3) We must fight with faith and hope, and therefore we should certainly not lie snoring. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#009">1 Thessalonians 5:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">th1 5:9</A></FONT></span></p>(4) For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ, 
<p>
<p>(4) He urges us forward by setting a most certain hope of victory before us. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#010">1 Thessalonians 5:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">th1 5:10</A></FONT></span></p>(5) Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him. 
<p>
<p>(5) The death of Christ is a pledge of our victory, for he died so that we might be partakers of his life of power, indeed even while we live here. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#011">1 Thessalonians 5:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">th1 5:11</A></FONT></span></p>(6) Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do. 
<p>
<p>(6) We must not only watch ourselves, but we are also bound to stir up, and to strengthen and encourage one another. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#012">1 Thessalonians 5:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">th1 5:12</A></FONT></span></p>(7) And we beseech you, brethren, to (b) know them which labour among you, and are over you in the (c) Lord, and admonish you; 
<p>
<p>(7) We must have consideration of those who are appointed to the ministry of the word, and the government of the church of God, and who do their duty. 
<p>
<p>(b) That you acknowledge and take them for such as they are, that is to say, men worthy to be greatly esteemed of among you. 
<p>
<p>(c) In those things which pertain to God's service: so is the ecclesiastical function distinguished from civil authority, and true shepherds from wolves. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#013">1 Thessalonians 5:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">th1 5:13</A></FONT></span></p>And to esteem them very highly in love for (d) their work's sake. (8) [And] be at peace among yourselves. 
<p>
<p>(d) So then, when this reason ceases, then must the honour cease. (8) The maintenance of mutual harmony, is to be especially guarded. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#014">1 Thessalonians 5:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">th1 5:14</A></FONT></span></p>(9) Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are (e) unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all [men]. 
<p>
<p>(9) We must have consideration of every man, and the remedy must be applied according to the disease. 
<p>
<p>(e) That keep not their rank or standing. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#015">1 Thessalonians 5:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">th1 5:15</A></FONT></span></p>(10) See that none render evil for evil unto any [man]; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all [men]. 
<p>
<p>(10) Charity ought not to be overcome by any injuries. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#016">1 Thessalonians 5:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">th1 5:16</A></FONT></span></p>(11) Rejoice evermore. 
<p>
<p>(11) A quiet and appeased mind is nourished with continual prayers, giving regard to the will of God. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#018">1 Thessalonians 5:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">th1 5:18</A></FONT></span></p>In every thing give thanks: for this is the (f) will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you. 
<p>
<p>(f) An acceptable thing to God, and such as he approves well of. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#019">1 Thessalonians 5:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">th1 5:19</A></FONT></span></p>(12) Quench not the Spirit. 
<p>
<p>(12) The sparks of the Spirit of God that are kindled in us, are nourished by daily hearing the word of God: but true doctrine must be diligently distinguished from false. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#020">1 Thessalonians 5:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">th1 5:20</A></FONT></span></p>Despise not (g) prophesyings. 
<p>
<p>(g) The explaining and interpreting of the word of God. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#022">1 Thessalonians 5:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">th1 5:22</A></FONT></span></p>(13) Abstain from all (h) appearance of evil. 
<p>
<p>(13) A general conclusion, that we waiting for the coming of Christ, do give ourselves to pureness in mind, will, and body, through the grace and strength of the Spirit of God. 
<p>
<p>(h) Whatever has but the very show of evil, abstain from it. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#023">1 Thessalonians 5:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">th1 5:23</A></FONT></span></p>And the very God of peace (i) sanctify you wholly; and [I pray God] your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
<p>
<p>(i) Separate you from the world, and make you holy to himself through his Spirit, in Christ, in whom alone you will attain to that true peace. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#024">1 Thessalonians 5:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">th1 5:24</A></FONT></span></p>(14) (k) Faithful [is] he that calleth you, who also will (l) do [it]. 
<p>
<p>(14) The good will and power of God is a sure strengthening and encouragement against all difficulties, of which we have a sure witness in our calling. 
<p>
<p>(k) Always one, and ever like himself, who indeed performs whatever he promises. And an effectual calling is nothing else but a right declaring and true setting forth of God's will: and therefore the salvation of the elect, is safe and sure. 
<p>
<p>(l) Who will also make you perfect. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#025">1 Thessalonians 5:25</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_025">th1 5:25</A></FONT></span></p>(15) Brethren, pray for us. 
<p>
<p>(15) The last part of the epistle, in which with most authoritative charge he commends both himself and this epistle to them.
