### [Proverbs Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#001)

[Proverbs 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 14:1</span></span>

Every wise woman (a) buildeth her house: but the foolish plucketh it
down with her hands.

\(a\) That is, takes pains to profit her family, and to do that which
concerns her duty in her house.

[Proverbs 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 14:2</span></span>

He that walketh in his (b) uprightness feareth the LORD: but \[he that
is\] perverse in his ways despiseth him.

\(b\) That is, in uprightness of heart, and without hypocrisy.

[Proverbs 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 14:3</span></span>

In the mouth of the foolish \[is\] a (c) rod of pride: but the lips of
the wise shall preserve them.

\(c\) His proud tongue will cause him to be punished.

[Proverbs 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 14:4</span></span>

Where no (d) oxen \[are\], the crib \[is\] clean: but much increase
\[is\] by the strength of the ox.

\(d\) By the ox is meant labour, and by the crib the barn, meaning,
without labour there is no profit.

[Proverbs 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 14:5</span></span>

A faithful witness will not lie: but (e) a false witness will utter
lies.

\(e\) For the maintenance of his own ambition, and not for God's glory,
as Simon Magus.

[Proverbs 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 14:9</span></span>

Fools make a mock at (f) sin: but among the righteous \[there is\]
favour.

\(f\) Does not know the grievousness of it, nor God's judgments against
the same.

[Proverbs 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 14:10</span></span>

The heart knoweth its own (g) bitterness; and a stranger doth not
intermeddle with its joy.

\(g\) As a man's conscience is witness to his own grief, so another
cannot feel the joy and comfort which a man feels in himself.

[Proverbs 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 14:13</span></span>

Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; (h) and the end of that mirth
\[is\] heaviness.

\(h\) He shows the allurement to sin, that it seems sweet, but the end
of it is destruction.

[Proverbs 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 14:14</span></span>

The backslider in heart (i) shall be filled with his own ways: and a
good man \[shall be satisfied\] from himself.

\(i\) He who forsakes God will be punished, and made weary of his sins,
in which he delighted.

[Proverbs 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 14:19</span></span>

The evil bow before the good; and the wicked (k) at the gates of the
righteous.

\(k\) If this come not daily to pass, we must consider that it is
because of our sins, which hinder God's workings.

[Proverbs 14:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">pro 14:28</span></span>

In the multitude of (l) people \[is\] the king's honour: but in the lack
of people \[is\] the destruction of the prince.

\(l\) That is, the strength of a king stands in many people.

[Proverbs 14:33](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">pro 14:33</span></span>

Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding: but \[that
which is\] (m) in the midst of fools is made known.

\(m\) Forasmuch as they are convicted by it, and silenced.
