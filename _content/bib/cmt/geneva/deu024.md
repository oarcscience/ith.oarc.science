### [Deuteronomy Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#001)

[Deuteronomy 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 24:1</span></span>

When a man hath taken a wife, and married her, and it come to pass that
she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath found some uncleanness
in her: (a) then let him write her a bill of divorcement, and give
\[it\] in her hand, and send her out of his house.

\(a\) By this God does not approve light divorcement, but permits it to
avoid further inconvenience; ([Mat
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#007)).

[Deuteronomy 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">deu 24:4</span></span>

Her former husband, which sent her away, may not take her again to be
his wife, after that she is (b) defiled; for that \[is\] abomination
before the LORD: and thou shalt not cause the land to sin, which the
LORD thy God giveth thee \[for\] an inheritance.

\(b\) Seeing that by divorcing her he judged her to be unclean and
defiled.

[Deuteronomy 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">deu 24:5</span></span>

When a man hath taken a new wife, he shall not go out to war, (c)
neither shall he be charged with any business: \[but\] he shall be free
at home one year, and shall cheer up his wife which he hath taken.

\(c\) That they might learn to know one another's conditions, and so
afterward live in godly peace.

[Deuteronomy 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">deu 24:6</span></span>

No man shall take the nether or the upper (d) millstone to pledge: for
he taketh \[a man's\] life to pledge.

\(d\) Not anything by which a man gets his living.

[Deuteronomy 24:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">deu 24:10</span></span>

When thou dost lend thy brother any thing, thou shalt not go (e) into
his house to fetch his pledge.

\(e\) As though you would appoint what to have, but shall receive what
be may spare.

[Deuteronomy 24:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">deu 24:13</span></span>

In any case thou shalt deliver him the pledge again when the sun goeth
down, that he may sleep in his own raiment, and bless thee: and it shall
be righteousness unto thee (f) before the LORD thy God.

\(f\) Though he would be unthankful, yet God will not forget it.

[Deuteronomy 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">deu 24:17</span></span>

Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the (g) stranger, \[nor\] of the
fatherless; nor take a widow's raiment to pledge:

\(g\) Because the world valued these people least, therefore God has
most care over them.

[Deuteronomy 24:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">deu 24:22</span></span>

And thou shalt remember that thou wast (h) a bondman in the land of
Egypt: therefore I command thee to do this thing.

\(h\) God judged them not mindful of his beasts, unless they were
beneficial to others.
