<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#001">Isaiah 49:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">isa 49:1</A></FONT></span></p>Listen, to me O isles; and hearken, ye people, from far; The LORD hath called (a) me from (b) the womb; from the body of my mother hath he made mention of my name. 
<p>
<p>(a) This is spoken in the person of Christ, to assure the faithful that these promises should come to pass: for they were all made in him and in him would be performed. 
<p>
<p>(b) This is meant of the time that Christ would be manifested to the world, as in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#007">Psa 2:7</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#002">Isaiah 49:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">isa 49:2</A></FONT></span></p>And he hath made my mouth like a sharp (c) sword; in the shadow of his hand hath he (d) hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his quiver hath he hid me; 
<p>
<p>(c) By the sword and shaft, he signifies the virtue and efficacy of Christ's doctrine. 
<p>
<p>(d) God has taken me to his protection and defence: this chiefly is meant of Christ, and may also be applied to the ministers of his word.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#003">Isaiah 49:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">isa 49:3</A></FONT></span></p>And said to me, Thou [art] my servant, O (e) Israel, in whom I will be glorified. 
<p>
<p>(e) By Israel is meant Christ, and all the body of the faithful, as the members and their head.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#004">Isaiah 49:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">isa 49:4</A></FONT></span></p>Then I said, I have (f) laboured in vain, I have spent my strength for nothing, and in vain: [yet] surely my judgment [is] with the LORD, and my work with my God. 
<p>
<p>(f) Thus Christ in his members complains that his labour and preaching take no effect, yet he is contented that his doings are approved by God.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#005">Isaiah 49:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">isa 49:5</A></FONT></span></p>And now, saith the LORD that formed me from the womb [to be] his servant, to bring Jacob again to him, Though Israel be not gathered, (g) yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the LORD, and my God shall be my strength. 
<p>
<p>(g) Though the Jews refuse my doctrine, yet God will approve my ministry.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#006">Isaiah 49:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">isa 49:6</A></FONT></span></p>And he said, It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give (h) thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation to the end of the earth. 
<p>
<p>(h) To declare my gospel to the Gentiles, as in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#006">Isa 42:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#047">Act 13:47</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#032">Luk 2:32</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#007">Isaiah 49:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">isa 49:7</A></FONT></span></p>Thus saith the LORD, the Redeemer of Israel, [and] his Holy One, to him whom man despiseth, to him whom the nation abhorreth, to a (i) servant of rulers, Kings shall see and (k) arise, princes also shall worship, because of the LORD that is faithful, [and] the Holy One of Israel, and he shall choose thee. 
<p>
<p>(i) Meaning, the Jews whom tyrants kept in bondage. 
<p>
<p>(k) The benefit of their deliverance will be so great, that great and small will acknowledge it, and revere God for it.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#008">Isaiah 49:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">isa 49:8</A></FONT></span></p>Thus saith the LORD, (l) In an acceptable time have I heard thee, and in a day of salvation have I helped thee: and I will preserve thee, and give (m) thee for a covenant of the people, to establish the (n) earth, to cause to inherit the desolate heritages; 
<p>
<p>(l) Thus he speaks of his Church when he would show his mercy toward it, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#002">Co2 6:2</A>). 
<p>
<p>(m) Meaning, Christ alone. 
<p>
<p>(n) Signifying that before Christ renewed the earth by his word, there is nothing but confusion and disorder.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#009">Isaiah 49:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">isa 49:9</A></FONT></span></p>That thou mayest say to the (o) prisoners, Go forth; to them that [are] in darkness, Show yourselves. They shall feed in the ways, and their (p) pastures [shall be] in all high places. 
<p>
<p>(o) To them who are in the prison of sin and death. 
<p>
<p>(p) Being in Christ's protection, they will be safe against all dangers, and free from fear of the enemies.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#010">Isaiah 49:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">isa 49:10</A></FONT></span></p>They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun smite them: for he that hath mercy (q) on them shall lead them, even by the springs of water shall he guide them. 
<p>
<p>(q) Meaning, that there would be nothing in their way from Babylon that would hinder or hurt them: but this is accomplished spiritually.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#012">Isaiah 49:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">isa 49:12</A></FONT></span></p>Behold, these shall come from far: and, lo, these from the north and from the west; and these from the land of (r) Sinim. 
<p>
<p>(r) Meaning, the south country, so that Christ will deliver his from all the parts of the world.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#013">Isaiah 49:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">isa 49:13</A></FONT></span></p>Sing, O (s) heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into singing, O mountains: for the LORD hath comforted his people, and will have mercy upon his afflicted. 
<p>
<p>(s) Read (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#023">Isa 44:23</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#014">Isaiah 49:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">isa 49:14</A></FONT></span></p>But Zion said, The LORD hath (t) forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me. 
<p>
<p>(t) He objects what the faithful might say in their long affliction and answers to comfort them with a most proper comparison and full of consolation.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#016">Isaiah 49:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">isa 49:16</A></FONT></span></p>Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of [my] (u) hands; thy (x) walls [are] continually before me. 
<p>
<p>(u) Because I would not forget you. 
<p>
<p>(x) Meaning, the good order of policy and discipline.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#017">Isaiah 49:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">isa 49:17</A></FONT></span></p>Thy children shall make (y) haste; thy destroyers and they that made thee waste shall go forth from thee. 
<p>
<p>(y) I have continual care to build you up again and to destroy your enemies.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#018">Isaiah 49:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">isa 49:18</A></FONT></span></p>Lift up thy eyes around, and behold: all these gather themselves together, [and] come to thee. [As] I live, saith the LORD, thou shalt surely (z) clothe thee with them all, as with an ornament, and bind them [on thee], as a bride [doeth]. 
<p>
<p>(z) He shows what are the ornaments of the Church: to have many children, who are assembled by the word of God, and governed by his Spirit.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#022">Isaiah 49:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">isa 49:22</A></FONT></span></p>Thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I will lift up my hand to the (a) Gentiles, and set up my standard to the people: and they shall bring thy sons in [their] arms, and thy daughters shall be carried upon [their] shoulders. 
<p>
<p>(a) He shows that Christ will not only gather this great number from the Jews but also from the Gentiles.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#023">Isaiah 49:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">isa 49:23</A></FONT></span></p>And kings (b) shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy nursing mothers: they shall bow to thee with [their] face toward the earth, and lick up the (c) dust of thy feet; and thou shalt know that I [am] the LORD: for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me. 
<p>
<p>(b) Meaning, that kings will be converted to the gospel, and bestow their power and authority for the preservation of the Church. 
<p>
<p>(c) Being joined with the Church, they will humble themselves to Christ their head, and give him all honour.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#024">Isaiah 49:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">isa 49:24</A></FONT></span></p>Shall the prey be (d) taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive delivered? 
<p>
<p>(d) He makes this as an objection as though the Chaldeans were strong, and had them in just possession.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#025">Isaiah 49:25</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_025">isa 49:25</A></FONT></span></p>But thus saith the LORD, (e) Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered: for I will contend with him that contendeth with thee, and I will save thy children. 
<p>
<p>(e) This is the answer to their objection, that no one is stronger than the Lord, neither has a more just title to them.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#026">Isaiah 49:26</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_026">isa 49:26</A></FONT></span></p>And I will feed them that oppress thee with (f) their own flesh; and they shall be drunk with their own blood, as with sweet wine: and all flesh shall know that I the LORD [am] thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob. 
<p>
<p>(f) I will cause them to destroy one another as in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#022">Jdg 7:22</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#022">Ch2 20:22</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#002">Isa 19:2</A>).
