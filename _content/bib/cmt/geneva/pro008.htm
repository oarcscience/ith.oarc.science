<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#001">Proverbs 8:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">pro 8:1</A></FONT></span></p>Doth not (a) wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice? 
<p>
<p>(a) Solomon declares that man is the cause of his own perdition and that he cannot pretend ignorance, for God calls all men by his word and his works to follow virtue and flee from vice.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#003">Proverbs 8:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">pro 8:3</A></FONT></span></p>She crieth at (b) the gates, at the entry of the city, at the entrance of the doors. 
<p>
<p>(b) Where the people resorted most and which was the place of justice.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#009">Proverbs 8:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">pro 8:9</A></FONT></span></p>They [are] all (c) plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge. 
<p>
<p>(c) Meaning that the word of God is easy to all that have a desire for it and are not blinded by the prince of this world.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#012">Proverbs 8:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">pro 8:12</A></FONT></span></p>I wisdom dwell with (d) prudence, and find out knowledge and discretion. 
<p>
<p>(d) That is, unless a man has wisdom, which is the true knowledge of God, he can be neither a prudent nor good counsellor.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#013">Proverbs 8:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">pro 8:13</A></FONT></span></p>The fear of the LORD [is] to hate (e) evil: pride, and arrogance, and the evil way, and the perverse mouth, do I hate. 
<p>
<p>(e) So that he who does not hate evil, does not fear God.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#015">Proverbs 8:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">pro 8:15</A></FONT></span></p>By me (f) kings reign, and princes decree justice. 
<p>
<p>(f) By which he declares that honours, dignities or riches do not come from man's wisdom or industry, but by the providence of God.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">pro 8:17</A></FONT></span></p>I love them that love me; and those that seek me (g) early shall find me. 
<p>
<p>(g) That is, study the word of God diligently, and with a desire to profit.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#018">Proverbs 8:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">pro 8:18</A></FONT></span></p>Riches and honour [are] with me; (h) durable riches and righteousness. 
<p>
<p>(h) Signifying that he chiefly means the spiritual treasures and heavenly riches.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#020">Proverbs 8:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">pro 8:20</A></FONT></span></p>I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of (i) judgment: 
<p>
<p>(i) For there can be no true justice or judgment, which is not rejected by this wisdom.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#022">Proverbs 8:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">pro 8:22</A></FONT></span></p>The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, (k) before his works of old. 
<p>
<p>(k) He declares by this the divinity and eternity of this wisdom, which he magnifies and praises through this book: meaning by this the eternal Son of God, Jesus Christ our Saviour, whom John calls the Word that was in the beginning (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001">Joh 1:1</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#023">Proverbs 8:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">pro 8:23</A></FONT></span></p>(l) I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was. 
<p>
<p>(l) He declares the eternity of the Son of God, who was before all time, and ever present with the father.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#030">Proverbs 8:30</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_030">pro 8:30</A></FONT></span></p>Then I was by him, (m) [as] one brought up [with him]: and I was daily [his] delight, rejoicing always before him; 
<p>
<p>(m) Some read, a chief worker signifying that this wisdom, Christ Jesus, was equal with God his father, and created, preserves and still works with him, as in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#017">Joh 5:17</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#031">Proverbs 8:31</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_031">pro 8:31</A></FONT></span></p>(n) Rejoicing in the habitable part of (o) his earth; and my delights [were] with the sons of men. 
<p>
<p>(n) By which is declared that the work of the creation was no pain, but a solace to the wisdom of God. 
<p>
<p>(o) By earth he means men, which is the work of God in whom wisdom took pleasure: in that as for man's sake the divine wisdom took man's nature, and dwelt among us, and filled us with unspeakable treasures, and this is the solace and pastime of which is here spoken.
