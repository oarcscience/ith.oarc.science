### [Psalms Chapter 36](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#001)

[Psalms 36:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 36:1</span></span>

"To the chief Musician, \[A Psalm\] of David the servant of the LORD."
The transgression of the wicked saith (a) within my heart, \[that there
is\] no fear of God before his eyes.

\(a\) I see evidently by his deeds, that sin pushes forward the
reprobate from wickedness to wickedness, even though he goes about to
cover his impiety.

[Psalms 36:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 36:2</span></span>

For he (b) flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity be
found to be hateful.

\(b\) Though all others detest his vile sin, yet he himself sees it not.

[Psalms 36:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 36:3</span></span>

The words of his mouth \[are\] iniquity and (c) deceit: he hath left off
to be wise, \[and\] to do good.

\(c\) The reprobates mock wholesome doctrine, and put no difference
between good and evil.

[Psalms 36:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 36:4</span></span>

He (d) deviseth mischief upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way
\[that is\] not good; he abhorreth not evil.

\(d\) By describing at large the nature of the reprobate, he admonishes
the godly to beware of these vices.

[Psalms 36:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 36:5</span></span>

Thy (e) mercy, O LORD, \[is\] in the heavens; \[and\] thy faithfulness
\[reacheth\] unto the clouds.

\(e\) Though wickedness seems to overflow all the world, yet by your
heavenly providence you govern heaven and earth.

[Psalms 36:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 36:6</span></span>

Thy righteousness \[is\] like the great mountains; thy judgments \[are\]
a great (f) deep: O LORD, thou preservest man and beast.

\(f\) The depth of your providence governs all things, and disposes
them, even though the wicked seem to overwhelm the world.

[Psalms 36:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 36:8</span></span>

They shall be abundantly (g) satisfied with the fatness of thy house;
and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures.

\(g\) Only God's children have enough of all things both concerning this
life and the life to come.

[Psalms 36:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 36:10</span></span>

O continue thy lovingkindness unto them that (h) know thee; and thy
righteousness to the upright in heart.

\(h\) He shows who God's children are, that is, they who know him, and
live their lives uprightly.

[Psalms 36:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 36:11</span></span>

Let not the (i) foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand of
the wicked remove me.

\(i\) Let not the proud advance himself against me, or the power of the
wicked drive me away.

[Psalms 36:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 36:12</span></span>

\(k\) There are the workers of iniquity fallen: they are cast down, and
shall not be able to rise.

\(k\) That is, in their pride in which they flatter themselves.
