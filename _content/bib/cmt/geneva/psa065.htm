<p>
<p>(a) You daily give new opportunities to your Church to praise you.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#002">Psalms 65:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">psa 65:2</A></FONT></span></p>O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all (b) flesh come. 
<p>
<p>(b) Not only the Jews but also the Gentiles in the kingdom of Christ.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#003">Psalms 65:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">psa 65:3</A></FONT></span></p>Iniquities (c) prevail against me: [as for] our transgressions, thou shalt purge them away. 
<p>
<p>(c) He imputes it to his sins and to the sins of the people that God who was accustomed to afflict them withdraws his help from them.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#005">Psalms 65:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">psa 65:5</A></FONT></span></p>[By] terrible things in righteousness wilt thou (d) answer us, O God of our salvation; [who art] the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of them that are afar off [upon] the (e) sea: 
<p>
<p>(d) You will declare yourself to be the preserver of your Church in destroying your enemies, as you did in the Red Sea. 
<p>
<p>(e) As of all barbarous nations, and far off.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#007">Psalms 65:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">psa 65:7</A></FONT></span></p>Which stilleth the (f) noise of the seas, the noise of their waves, and the tumult of the people. 
<p>
<p>(f) He shows that there is no part or creature in the world which is not governed by God's power and providence.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#009">Psalms 65:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">psa 65:9</A></FONT></span></p>Thou (g) visitest the earth, and waterest it: thou greatly enrichest it with the (h) river of God, [which] is full of water: thou preparest them corn, when thou hast so provided for (i) it. 
<p>
<p>(g) That is, with rain. 
<p>
<p>(h) That is, Shiloh or the rain. 
<p>
<p>(i) You have appointed the earth to bring forth food to man's use.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#010">Psalms 65:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">psa 65:10</A></FONT></span></p>Thou (k) waterest the ridges thereof abundantly: thou settlest the furrows thereof: thou makest it soft with showers: thou blessest the springing thereof. 
<p>
<p>(k) By this description he shows that all the order of nature is a testimony of God's love toward us, who causes all creatures to serve our need.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#013">Psalms 65:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">psa 65:13</A></FONT></span></p>The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are covered over with corn; they shout for joy, (l) they also sing. 
<p>
<p>(l) That is, the dumb creatures will not only rejoice for a time for God's benefits, but will continually sing.
