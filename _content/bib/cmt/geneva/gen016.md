### [Genesis Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#001)

[Genesis 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 16:1</span></span>

Now (a) Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children: and she had an
handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name \[was\] Hagar.

\(a\) It seems that she had respect for God's promise, which could not
be accomplished without issue.

[Genesis 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 16:2</span></span>

And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath (b) restrained me
from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may
obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.

\(b\) She fails by limiting God's power to the common order of nature,
as though God could not give her children in her old age.

[Genesis 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 16:4</span></span>

And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she
had conceived, her mistress was (c) despised in her eyes.

\(c\) This punishment declares what they gain if they attempt any thing
against the word of God.

[Genesis 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 16:7</span></span>

And the (d) angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the
wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.

\(d\) Which was Christ, as appears in ([Gen
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#013), [Gen
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#017)).

[Genesis 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 16:9</span></span>

And the angel of the LORD said unto her, (e) Return to thy mistress, and
submit thyself under her hands.

\(e\) God rejects no estate of people in their misery, but sends them
comfort.

[Genesis 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gen 16:12</span></span>

And he will be a wild man; his hand \[will be\] against every man, and
every man's hand against him; and (f) he shall dwell in the presence of
all his brethren.

\(f\) That is, the Ishmaelites will be a separate people by themselves
and not part of another people.

[Genesis 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gen 16:13</span></span>

And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou God seest
me: for she said, (g) Have I also here looked after him that seeth me?

\(g\) She rebukes her own dullness and acknowledges God's graces, who
was present with her everywhere.
