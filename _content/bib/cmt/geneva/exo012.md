<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">exo 12:2</span></span>

This (a) month \[shall be\] unto you the beginning of months: it \[shall
be\] the first (b) month of the year to you.

\(a\) Called Nisan, containing part of March and part of April.

\(b\) Concerning the observation of feasts: as for other policies, they
reckoned from September.

[Exodus 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">exo 12:3</span></span>

Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth
\[day\] of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb,
according to the house of \[their\] (c) fathers, a lamb for an house:

\(c\) As the fathers of the household had great or small families.

[Exodus 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">exo 12:4</span></span>

And if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his
neighbour next unto his house take \[it\] according to the number of the
souls; every man according to his (d) eating shall make your count for
the lamb.

\(d\) He will take as many as are needed to eat the lamb.

[Exodus 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">exo 12:6</span></span>

And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and
the (e) whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in
the evening.

\(e\) Every one his house.

[Exodus 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">exo 12:9</span></span>

Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast \[with\]
fire; his (f) head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof.

\(f\) That is, all that may be eaten.

[Exodus 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">exo 12:11</span></span>

And thus shall ye eat it; \[with\] your loins girded, your shoes on your
feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: (g) it
\[is\] the LORD'S passover.

\(g\) The lamb was not the Passover, but signified it, as ordinances are
not the thing itself which they represent, but rather they signify it.

[Exodus 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">exo 12:14</span></span>

feast by an ordinance (i) for ever.

\(i\) That is, until Christ's coming: for then ceremonies will end.

In the first \[month\], on the fourteenth day of the month at (k) even,
ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the
month at even.

\(k\) For in ancient times they counted in this way, beginning the day
at sunset till the next day at the same time.

[Exodus 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">exo 12:23</span></span>

For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth
the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the LORD will pass
over the door, and will not suffer the (l) destroyer to come in unto
your houses to smite \[you\].

\(l\) The angel sent by God to kill the first born.

[Exodus 12:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#025)

LORD will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep
this service.

Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for \[there was\] (o) not
a house where \[there was\] not one dead.

beasts.

(p) bless me also.

\(p\) Pray for me.

[Exodus 12:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#037)

the children of Israel from Egypt are 430 years.
