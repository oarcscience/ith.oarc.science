<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#001">2 Chronicles 22:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">ch2 22:1</A></FONT></span></p>And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his stead: for the band of men that came with the (a) Arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned. 
<p>
<p>(a) Meaning the Philistines. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#002">2 Chronicles 22:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">ch2 22:2</A></FONT></span></p>(b) Forty and two years old [was] Ahaziah when he began to reign, and he reigned (c) one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name also [was] Athaliah the daughter (d) of Omri. 
<p>
<p>(b) Read (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#020">Ch2 21:20</A>). 
<p>
<p>(c) That is, after the death of his father. 
<p>
<p>(d) She was Ahab's daughter, who was the son of Omri. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#004">2 Chronicles 22:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">ch2 22:4</A></FONT></span></p>Wherefore he did evil in the sight of the LORD like the house of Ahab: for they were his (e) counsellors after the death of his father to his destruction. 
<p>
<p>(e) He shows that it follows that the rulers are as their counsellors are and that there cannot be a good king who allows wicked counsellors. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#007">2 Chronicles 22:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">ch2 22:7</A></FONT></span></p>And the destruction of Ahaziah (f) was of God by coming to Joram: for when he was come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab. 
<p>
<p>(f) By this we see that nothing can come to any but by God's providence and as he has appointed, and therefore he causes everything to serve his purposes. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#009">2 Chronicles 22:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">ch2 22:9</A></FONT></span></p>And he sought Ahaziah: and they caught him, (for he was hid in Samaria,) and brought him to Jehu: and when they had slain him, they buried him: Because, said they, he [is] the son of (g) Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart. So the house of Ahaziah had no power to keep still the kingdom. 
<p>
<p>(g) This was the just plague of God because he joined himself with God's enemies: yet God to declare the worthiness of Jehoshaphat his grandfather moved them to give him the honour of burial. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#010">2 Chronicles 22:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">ch2 22:10</A></FONT></span></p>But when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and (h) destroyed all the seed royal of the house of Judah. 
<p>
<p>(h) So that there would be no one to claim the crown and so she might usurp the government. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#012">2 Chronicles 22:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">ch2 22:12</A></FONT></span></p>And he was with them hid in the (i) house of God six years: and Athaliah reigned over the (k) land. 
<p>
<p>(i) Meaning, in the chamber where the priests and Levites slept, who kept their courses weekly in the temple. 
<p>
<p>(k) That is, of Judah.
