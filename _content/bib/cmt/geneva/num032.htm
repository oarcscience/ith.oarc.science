<p>
<p>(a) Reuben came from Leah, and Gad from Zilpah her handmaid. 
<p>
<p>(b) Which was named for the heap of stones that Jacob made as a sign of the covenant between him and Laban in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#047">Gen 31:47</A>).

<p>
<p>(c) Because they complained and would not believe their report, which told the truth concerning the land.

<p>(h) The Lord will grant you this land which you request, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#015">Jos 1:15</A>).
