### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#001)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 26:2</span></span>

Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three
thousand (a) chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the
wilderness of Ziph.

\(a\) That is, of the most skilful and valiant soldiers.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 26:6</span></span>

Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the (b) Hittite, and to
Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to (c) Joab, saying, Who will go
down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with
thee.

\(b\) Who was a stranger, and not an Israelite.

\(c\) Who afterward was David's chief captain.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 26:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa1 26:8</span></span>

Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thine enemy into thine
hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the
spear even to the earth at once, and I will not \[smite\] him the (d)
second time.

\(d\) Meaning, he would make him sure at one stroke.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 26:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa1 26:9</span></span>

And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can stretch forth
his hand (e) against the LORD'S anointed, and be guiltless?

\(e\) That is, in his own private cause: for Jehu slew two kings at
God's appointment, ([Kg2 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#024)).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 26:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa1 26:15</span></span>

And David said to Abner, \[Art\] not thou a \[valiant\] (f) man? and who
\[is\] like to thee in Israel? wherefore then hast thou not kept thy
lord the king? for there came one of the people in to destroy the king
thy lord.

\(f\) Esteemed most valiant and fit to save the king?

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 26:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa1 26:17</span></span>

And Saul knew David's voice, and said, \[Is\] this thy voice, (g) my son
David? And David said, \[It is\] my voice, my lord, O king.

\(g\) By this it appears, that the hypocrite persecuted David against
his own conscience and contrary to his promise.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa1 26:19</span></span>

Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his
servant. If the LORD have stirred thee up against me, let him (h) accept
an offering: but if \[they be\] the children of men, cursed \[be\] they
before the LORD; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in
the inheritance of the LORD, saying, Go, serve (i) other gods.

\(h\) Let his anger toward us be pacified by a sacrifice.

\(i\) As much as lay in them, they compelled him to idolatry because
they forced him to flee to the idolaters.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 26:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa1 26:21</span></span>

Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for I will no more
do thee harm, because my soul was (k) precious in thine eyes this day:
behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.

\(k\) Because you saved my life this day.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 26:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">sa1 26:23</span></span>

The LORD render to every man his (l) righteousness and his faithfulness:
for the LORD delivered thee into \[my\] hand to day, but I would not
stretch forth mine hand against the LORD'S anointed.

\(l\) Thus he protests his innocency toward Saul, not defending his
justice in the sight of God, in whose presence none is righteous, ([Psa
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#003), [Psa
130:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#003)).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 26:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">sa1 26:25</span></span>

Then Saul said to David, Blessed \[be\] thou, my son David: thou shalt
both do great \[things\], and also shalt still prevail. So David went on
his way, and Saul returned to his (m) place.

\(m\) To Gibeah of Benjamin.
