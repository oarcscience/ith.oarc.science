<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#001">Matthew 10:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">mat 10:1</A></FONT></span></p>And (1) when he had called unto [him] his twelve disciples, he gave them power [against] unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease. 
<p>
<p>(1) The apostles are sent to preach the gospel in Israel.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#002">Matthew 10:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">mat 10:2</A></FONT></span></p>Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The (a) first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James [the son] of Zebedee, and John his brother; 
<p>
<p>(a) Theophylact says that Peter and Andrew are called the first, because they were first called.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#004">Matthew 10:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">mat 10:4</A></FONT></span></p>Simon the Canaanite, and Judas (b) Iscariot, who also betrayed him. 
<p>
<p>(b) A man of Kerioth. Now Kerioth was in the tribe of Judah; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#025">Jos 15:25</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#007">Matthew 10:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">mat 10:7</A></FONT></span></p>(2) And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand. 
<p>
<p>(2) The sum of the gospel, or preaching of the apostles.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#008">Matthew 10:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">mat 10:8</A></FONT></span></p>(3) Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give. 
<p>
<p>(3) Miracles are signs verifying the word.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#009">Matthew 10:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">mat 10:9</A></FONT></span></p>(4) Provide (c) neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses, 
<p>
<p>(4) The ministers of the word must cast away all cares that might hinder them, even the least of them. 
<p>
<p>(c) For this journey, namely, both that nothing might hinder them, and also that they might feel some taste of God's providence: for at their return back, the Lord asked of them whether they lacked anything by the way, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#035">Luk 22:35</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#010">Matthew 10:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">mat 10:10</A></FONT></span></p>Nor scrip for [your] journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his (d) meat. 
<p>
<p>(d) God will provide you with food.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#011">Matthew 10:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">mat 10:11</A></FONT></span></p>(5) And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, enquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence. 
<p>
<p>(5) Happy are they that receive the preaching of the gospel: and unhappy are they that refuse it.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#013">Matthew 10:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">mat 10:13</A></FONT></span></p>And if the house be worthy, let your (e) peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you. 
<p>
<p>(e) It is an idiom taken from the Hebrews, by which they meant every type of happiness.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#016">Matthew 10:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">mat 10:16</A></FONT></span></p>(6) Behold, I send you forth as (f) sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and (g) harmless as doves. 
<p>
<p>(6) Christ shows how the ministers must behave themselves under the cross. 
<p>
<p>(f) You will be in great danger. 
<p>
<p>(g) You will not so much as take revenge for an injury: and by the mixing of these beast's natures together, he will not have our wisdom to be malicious, nor our simplicity mad, but a certain form of good nature which is composed exquisitely of both of them.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#017">Matthew 10:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">mat 10:17</A></FONT></span></p>But beware of (h) men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues; 
<p>
<p>(h) For in the cause of religion men are wolves to each other.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#023">Matthew 10:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">mat 10:23</A></FONT></span></p>But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have (i) gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come. 
<p>
<p>(i) Bring to an end, that is, you will not have gone through all the cities of Israel and preached in them.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#025">Matthew 10:25</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_025">mat 10:25</A></FONT></span></p>It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house (k) Beelzebub, how much more [shall they call] them of his household? 
<p>
<p>(k) It was the idol of the Acronites, which we call the god of flies.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#026">Matthew 10:26</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_026">mat 10:26</A></FONT></span></p>(l) Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known. 
<p>
<p>(l) Truth will not always be hidden.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#027">Matthew 10:27</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_027">mat 10:27</A></FONT></span></p>What I tell you in darkness, [that] speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, [that] preach ye upon the (m) housetops. 
<p>
<p>(m) Openly, and in the highest places. For the tops of their houses were made in such a way that they might walk upon them; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#009">Act 10:9</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#028">Matthew 10:28</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_028">mat 10:28</A></FONT></span></p>And (n) fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. 
<p>
<p>(n) Though tyrants rage and are cruel, yet we must not fear them.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#029">Matthew 10:29</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_029">mat 10:29</A></FONT></span></p>Are not two sparrows sold for a (o) farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father. 
<p>
<p>(o) The fourth part of an ounce or seven grams.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#032">Matthew 10:32</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_032">mat 10:32</A></FONT></span></p>(7) Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven. 
<p>
<p>(7) The necessity and reward of openly confessing Christ.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#034">Matthew 10:34</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_034">mat 10:34</A></FONT></span></p>(8) Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword. 
<p>
<p>(8) Civil dissentions follow the preaching of the gospel.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#037">Matthew 10:37</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_037">mat 10:37</A></FONT></span></p>(9) He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. 
<p>
<p>(9) Without exception, nothing is to be preferred before our duty to God.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#039">Matthew 10:39</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_039">mat 10:39</A></FONT></span></p>He that (p) findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it. 
<p>
<p>(p) They are said to find their life, who deliver it out of danger: and this is spoken against the opinion of the people, who think those that die are certainly lost, because they think not of the life to come.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#040">Matthew 10:40</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_040">mat 10:40</A></FONT></span></p>(10) He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me. 
<p>
<p>(10) God is both author and revenger of his holy ministry.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#041">Matthew 10:41</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_041">mat 10:41</A></FONT></span></p>(11) He that receiveth a prophet in (q) the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward. 
<p>
<p>(11) We will lose nothing that is bestowed on Christ. 
<p>
<p>(q) As a Prophet.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#042">Matthew 10:42</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_042">mat 10:42</A></FONT></span></p>And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these (r) little ones a cup of cold [water] only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward. 
<p>
<p>(r) Who in the sight of the world are vile and abject.
