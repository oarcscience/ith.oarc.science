<p>
<p>(b) As their conscience is upright, so will they be able to speak for themselves against their accusers.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#009">Proverbs 12:9</A></p>

<p>(e) Continually imagines ways to harm others. 
<p>
<p>(f) Meaning, their heart within, which is upright, and does good to all.

<p>
<p>(g) He stands in his own conceit, and condemns all others in respect to himself.

<p>
<p>(h) Who bridles his affections.

<p>(i) Which seek nothing more then to provoke others to anger.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_025">pro 12:25</A></FONT></span></p>Heaviness in the heart of man weigheth it down: but a (k) good word maketh it glad. 
<p>
<p>(k) That is, words of comfort, or a cheerful mind which is declared by his words, rejoices a man, as a covetous mind kills him.

<p>
<p>(m) Although he gets much by unlawful means, yet he will not spend it on himself.
