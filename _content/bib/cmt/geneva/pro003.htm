<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#002">Proverbs 3:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">pro 3:2</A></FONT></span></p>For length of (a) days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee. 
<p>
<p>(a) Long life is the blessing of God which he gives to his, so far as it is expedient for them.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#003">Proverbs 3:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">pro 3:3</A></FONT></span></p>Let not (b) mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy (c) neck; write them upon the table of thine (d) heart: 
<p>
<p>(b) By mercy and truth he means the commandments of the first and second table, or else the mercy and faithfulness that we ought to use toward our neighbours. 
<p>
<p>(c) Keep them as a precious jewel. 
<p>
<p>(d) Have them ever in remembrance.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#008">Proverbs 3:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">pro 3:8</A></FONT></span></p>It shall be health to thy (e) navel, and marrow to thy bones. 
<p>
<p>(e) By this part he comprehends the whole body, as by health he means all the benefits promised in the law both corporal and spiritual.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#009">Proverbs 3:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">pro 3:9</A></FONT></span></p>(f) Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase: 
<p>
<p>(f) As was commanded in the law, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#019">Exo 23:19</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#002">Deu 26:2</A>) and by this they acknowledged that God was the giver of all things, and that they were ready to bestow all at his commandment.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#010">Proverbs 3:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">pro 3:10</A></FONT></span></p>So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall (g) burst out with new wine. 
<p>
<p>(g) For the faithful distributor God gives in greater abundance.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#016">Proverbs 3:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">pro 3:16</A></FONT></span></p>Length of days [is] in her right hand; (h) [and] in her left hand riches and honour. 
<p>
<p>(h) Meaning, that he seeks wisdom, that is, suffers himself to be governed by the Word of God, will have all prosperity both corporal and spiritual.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#018">Proverbs 3:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">pro 3:18</A></FONT></span></p>She [is] a tree (i) of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy [is every one] that retaineth her. 
<p>
<p>(i) Which brings forth such fruit that they who eat of it have life and he alludes to the tree of life in paradise.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#019">Proverbs 3:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">pro 3:19</A></FONT></span></p>The LORD by wisdom hath (k) founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens. 
<p>
<p>(k) By this he shows that this wisdom of which he speaks is everlasting, because it was before all creatures and that all things even the whole world were made by it.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#025">Proverbs 3:25</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_025">pro 3:25</A></FONT></span></p>(l) Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh. 
<p>
<p>(l) For when God destroys the wicked he will save his as he did Lot in Sodom.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#027">Proverbs 3:27</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_027">pro 3:27</A></FONT></span></p>Withhold not good from (m) them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do [it]. 
<p>
<p>(m) Not only from them to whom the possession belongs but also you shall not keep it from them who have need of the use of it.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#029">Proverbs 3:29</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_029">pro 3:29</A></FONT></span></p>Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth (n) securely by thee. 
<p>
<p>(n) That is, puts his trust in you.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#031">Proverbs 3:31</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_031">pro 3:31</A></FONT></span></p>(o) Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways. 
<p>
<p>(o) Do not wish to be like him.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#032">Proverbs 3:32</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_032">pro 3:32</A></FONT></span></p>For the froward [is] abomination to the LORD: but his (p) secret [is] with the righteous. 
<p>
<p>(p) That is, his covenant and fatherly affection which is hid and secret from the world.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#034">Proverbs 3:34</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_034">pro 3:34</A></FONT></span></p>Surely (q) he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the lowly. 
<p>
<p>(q) He will show by his plagues that their scorn will turn to their own destruction, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#026">Pro 1:26</A>).
