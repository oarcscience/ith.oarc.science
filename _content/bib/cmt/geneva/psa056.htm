<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">psa 56:1</A></FONT></span></p>"To the chief Musician upon Jonathelemrechokim, Michtam of David, (a) when the Philistines took him in Gath." Be merciful unto me, O God: for (b) man would swallow me up; he fighting daily oppresseth me. 
<p>
<p>(a) Being chased by the fury of his enemies into a strange country, he was a dumb dove not seeking vengeance. 
<p>
<p>(b) He shows that if God will help him, it must be now or never for all the world is against him and ready to devour him.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#004">Psalms 56:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">psa 56:4</A></FONT></span></p>In God I will praise his (c) word, in God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do unto me. 
<p>
<p>(c) He stays his conscience on God's promise though he sees no present help.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#005">Psalms 56:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">psa 56:5</A></FONT></span></p>Every day they wrest my (d) words: all their thoughts [are] against me for evil. 
<p>
<p>(d) All my counsels have evil success, and turn to my own sorrow.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#006">Psalms 56:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">psa 56:6</A></FONT></span></p>(e) They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they mark my steps, when they wait for my soul. 
<p>
<p>(e) As all the world against one man, and cannot be satisfied unless they have my life.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#007">Psalms 56:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">psa 56:7</A></FONT></span></p>Shall (f) they escape by iniquity? in [thine] anger cast down the people, O God. 
<p>
<p>(f) They not only think to escape punishment, but the more wicked they are, the more impudent they grow.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#008">Psalms 56:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">psa 56:8</A></FONT></span></p>Thou tellest my wanderings: put thou my (g) tears into thy bottle: [are they] not in thy book? 
<p>
<p>(g) If God stores the tears of his saints, much more will he remember their blood, to avenge it: and though tyrants burn the bones, yet they cannot blot the tears and blood out of God's register.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#012">Psalms 56:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">psa 56:12</A></FONT></span></p>(h) Thy vows [are] upon me, O God: I will render praises unto thee. 
<p>
<p>(h) Having received that which I required, I am bound to pay my vows of thanksgiving as I promised.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#013">Psalms 56:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">psa 56:13</A></FONT></span></p>For thou hast delivered my soul from death: [wilt] not [thou deliver] my feet from falling, that I may (i) walk before God in the (k) light of the living? 
<p>
<p>(i) As mindful of his great mercies, and giving thanks for the same. 
<p>
<p>(k) That is, in the life and light of the sun.
