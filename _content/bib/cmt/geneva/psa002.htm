<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#001">Psalms 2:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">psa 2:1</A></FONT></span></p>Why do the (a) heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing? 
<p>
<p>(a) The conspiracy of the Gentiles, the murmuring of the Jews and power of kings cannot prevail against Christ.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#003">Psalms 2:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">psa 2:3</A></FONT></span></p>(b) Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us. 
<p>
<p>(b) Thus the wicked say that they will cast off the yoke of God and of his Christ.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#005">Psalms 2:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">psa 2:5</A></FONT></span></p>(c) Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure. 
<p>
<p>(c) God's plagues will declare that in resisting his Christ, they fought against him.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#007">Psalms 2:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">psa 2:7</A></FONT></span></p>I will declare the (d) decree: the LORD hath said unto me, Thou [art] my Son; this (e) day have I begotten thee. 
<p>
<p>(d) To show that my calling to the kingdom is from God. 
<p>
<p>(e) That is to say, concerning man's knowledge, because it was the first time that David appeared to be elected by God. So it is applied to Christ in his first coming and manifestation to the world.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#008">Psalms 2:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">psa 2:8</A></FONT></span></p>Ask of me, and I shall give [thee] the heathen [for] thine inheritance, and the (f) uttermost parts of the earth [for] thy possession. 
<p>
<p>(f) Not only the Jews but the Gentiles also.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#010">Psalms 2:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">psa 2:10</A></FONT></span></p>(g) Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth. 
<p>
<p>(g) He exhorts all rulers to repent in time.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#012">Psalms 2:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">psa 2:12</A></FONT></span></p>(h) Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye (i) perish [from] the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed [are] all they that put their trust in him. 
<p>
<p>(h) In a sign of homage. 
<p>
<p>(i) When the wicked will say, Peace and rest, then will destruction suddenly come, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#003">Th1 5:3</A>).
