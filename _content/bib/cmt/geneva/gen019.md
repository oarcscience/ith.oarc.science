### [Genesis Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#001)

[Genesis 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 19:1</span></span>

And there came two (a) angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate
of Sodom: and Lot seeing \[them\] rose up to meet them; and he bowed
himself with his face toward the ground;

\(a\) In which we see God's provident care in preserving his: even
though he does not reveal himself to all alike: for Lot had but two
angels, and Abraham three.

[Genesis 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 19:3</span></span>

And (b) he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and
entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake
unleavened bread, and they (c) did eat.

\(b\) That is, he begged them so insistently.

\(c\) Not because they had need, but because the time was not yet come
for them to reveal themselves.

[Genesis 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 19:4</span></span>

But before they lay down, the men of the city, \[even\] the men of
Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, (d) all the people
from every quarter:

\(d\) Nothing is more dangerous than to live where sin reigns: for it
corrupts all.

[Genesis 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 19:8</span></span>

Behold now, I have two (e) daughters which have not known man; let me, I
pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as \[is\] good in
your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; (f) for therefore came they
under the shadow of my roof.

\(e\) He deserves praise for defending his guests, but he is to be
blamed for seeking unlawful means.

\(f\) That I should preserve them from all injury.

[Genesis 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gen 19:13</span></span>

For (g) we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen
great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy
it.

\(g\) This proves that the angels are ministers, both to execute God's
wrath and to declare his favour.

[Genesis 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gen 19:16</span></span>

And while he (h) lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the
hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD being
merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the
city.

\(h\) The mercy of God strives to overcome man's slowness in following
God's calling.

[Genesis 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">gen 19:17</span></span>

And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he
said, Escape for thy life; (i) look not behind thee, neither stay thou
in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.

\(i\) He willed him to flee God's judgments and not to be sorry to leave
that rich country, full of vain pleasures.

[Genesis 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">gen 19:20</span></span>

Behold now, this city \[is\] near to flee unto, and it \[is\] a little
one: Oh, let me escape thither, (\[is\] it not a (k) little one?) and my
soul shall live.

\(k\) Though it is little, yet it is great enough to save my life: in
which he errs by choosing another place than the angel had appointed
him.

[Genesis 19:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">gen 19:22</span></span>

Haste thee, escape thither; for I (l) cannot do any thing till thou be
come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called (m) Zoar.

\(l\) Because God's commandment was to destroy the city and to save Lot.

\(m\) Which before was called Belah, in ([Gen
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#002)).

[Genesis 19:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">gen 19:26</span></span>

But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a (n) pillar of
salt.

\(n\) Concerning the body only: this was a notable monument of God's
vengeance to all who passed that way.

[Genesis 19:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">gen 19:30</span></span>

And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two
daughters with him; for he (o) feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in
a cave, he and his two daughters.

\(o\) Having felt God's mercy, he did not dare provoke him again by
continuing among the wicked.

[Genesis 19:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">gen 19:31</span></span>

And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father \[is\] old, and
\[there is\] not a man in the (p) earth to come in unto us after the
manner of all the earth:

\(p\) Meaning in the country which the Lord had now destroyed.

[Genesis 19:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">gen 19:32</span></span>

Come, let us make our father (q) drink wine, and we will lie with him,
that we may preserve seed of our father.

\(q\) For unless he had been drunk, he would never have done that
abominable act.

[Genesis 19:36](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">gen 19:36</span></span>

Thus were (r) both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.

\(r\) Thus God permitted him to fall most horribly in the solitary
mountains, whom the wickedness of Sodom could not overcome.

[Genesis 19:37](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">gen 19:37</span></span>

And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same \[is\]
the father of the (s) Moabites unto this day.

\(s\) Who as they were born in most horrible incest, so were they and
their posterity vile and wicked.

[Genesis 19:38](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">gen 19:38</span></span>

And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name (t) Benammi:
the same \[is\] the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.

\(t\) That is, son of my people: signifying that they rejoiced in their
sin, rather than repenting of it.
