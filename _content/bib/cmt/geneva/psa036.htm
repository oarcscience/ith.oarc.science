<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#001">Psalms 36:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">psa 36:1</A></FONT></span></p>"To the chief Musician, [A Psalm] of David the servant of the LORD." The transgression of the wicked saith (a) within my heart, [that there is] no fear of God before his eyes. 
<p>
<p>(a) I see evidently by his deeds, that sin pushes forward the reprobate from wickedness to wickedness, even though he goes about to cover his impiety.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#002">Psalms 36:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">psa 36:2</A></FONT></span></p>For he (b) flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity be found to be hateful. 
<p>
<p>(b) Though all others detest his vile sin, yet he himself sees it not.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#003">Psalms 36:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">psa 36:3</A></FONT></span></p>The words of his mouth [are] iniquity and (c) deceit: he hath left off to be wise, [and] to do good. 
<p>
<p>(c) The reprobates mock wholesome doctrine, and put no difference between good and evil.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#004">Psalms 36:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">psa 36:4</A></FONT></span></p>He (d) deviseth mischief upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way [that is] not good; he abhorreth not evil. 
<p>
<p>(d) By describing at large the nature of the reprobate, he admonishes the godly to beware of these vices.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#005">Psalms 36:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">psa 36:5</A></FONT></span></p>Thy (e) mercy, O LORD, [is] in the heavens; [and] thy faithfulness [reacheth] unto the clouds. 
<p>
<p>(e) Though wickedness seems to overflow all the world, yet by your heavenly providence you govern heaven and earth.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#006">Psalms 36:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">psa 36:6</A></FONT></span></p>Thy righteousness [is] like the great mountains; thy judgments [are] a great (f) deep: O LORD, thou preservest man and beast. 
<p>
<p>(f) The depth of your providence governs all things, and disposes them, even though the wicked seem to overwhelm the world.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#008">Psalms 36:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">psa 36:8</A></FONT></span></p>They shall be abundantly (g) satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures. 
<p>
<p>(g) Only God's children have enough of all things both concerning this life and the life to come.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#010">Psalms 36:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">psa 36:10</A></FONT></span></p>O continue thy lovingkindness unto them that (h) know thee; and thy righteousness to the upright in heart. 
<p>
<p>(h) He shows who God's children are, that is, they who know him, and live their lives uprightly.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#011">Psalms 36:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">psa 36:11</A></FONT></span></p>Let not the (i) foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand of the wicked remove me. 
<p>
<p>(i) Let not the proud advance himself against me, or the power of the wicked drive me away.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#012">Psalms 36:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">psa 36:12</A></FONT></span></p>(k) There are the workers of iniquity fallen: they are cast down, and shall not be able to rise. 
<p>
<p>(k) That is, in their pride in which they flatter themselves.
