<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">eze 35:2</A></FONT></span></p>Son of man, set thy face against mount (a) Seir, and prophesy against it, 
<p>
<p>(a) Where the Idumeans dwelt.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#005">Ezekiel 35:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">eze 35:5</A></FONT></span></p>Because thou hast had a perpetual hatred, and hast shed [the blood of] the children of Israel by the force of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time [that their] (b) iniquity [had] an end: 
<p>
<p>(b) When by their punishment I called them from their iniquity.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#006">Ezekiel 35:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">eze 35:6</A></FONT></span></p>Therefore, [as] I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will prepare thee to blood, and blood shall pursue thee: since thou hast not (c) hated blood, even blood shall pursue thee. 
<p>
<p>(c) Except you repent your former cruelty.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#009">Ezekiel 35:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">eze 35:9</A></FONT></span></p>I will make thee perpetual desolations, and thy cities shall not (d) return: and ye shall know that I [am] the LORD. 
<p>
<p>(d) That is, to their former estate.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#010">Ezekiel 35:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">eze 35:10</A></FONT></span></p>Because thou hast said, (e) These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will possess it; though the LORD was (f) there: 
<p>
<p>(e) Meaning, Israel and Judah. 
<p>
<p>(f) And so by fighting against God's people they should go about to put him out of his own possession.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#011">Ezekiel 35:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">eze 35:11</A></FONT></span></p>Therefore, [as] I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will even do according to thy (g) anger, and according to thy envy which thou hast used out of thy hatred against them; and I will make myself known among (h) them, when I have judged thee. 
<p>
<p>(g) As you have done cruelly, so will you be cruelly handled. 
<p>
<p>(h) Showing that when God punishes the enemies, the godly ought to consider that he has a care over them and so praise his name: and also that the wicked rage as though there were no God, till they feel his hand to their destruction.
