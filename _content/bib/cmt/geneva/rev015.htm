<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#001">Revelation 15:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">rev 15:1</A></FONT></span></p>And (1) I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven (2) angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God. 
<p>
<p>(1) This is that other passage of the acts of Christ, as I noted before See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#014">Rev 14:14</A>. Now therefore is shown a singular work of the judgment of God belonging to the overthrow of Antichrist and his forces, of which divine work the preparation is described in this chapter: and the execution in the next. The preparation is first set down generally and in type in this verse: and is after particularly set forth in the rest of the chapter. (2) Of which (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#009">Rev 8:9</A>) in sending forth the plagues of the world: for even these plagues do for the most part agree with those.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#002">Revelation 15:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">rev 15:2</A></FONT></span></p>(3) And I saw (4) as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and (5) them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, [and] over the number of his name, (6) stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God. 
<p>
<p>(3) There are two parts of the narration: one, the confession of the saints glorifying God, when they saw that preparation of the judgments of God, to (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#003">Rev 15:3-4</A>), another the vocation, instruction, and confirmation of those instruments which God has ordained for the execution of his judgments, in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#005">Rev 15:5-8</A>). (4) This part of the vision alludes to the sea or large vessel or brass, in which the priests washed themselves in the entrance of the temple: for in the entrance of the heavenly temple (as it is called) in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#005">Rev 15:5</A>), is said to have been a sea of glass, most luminous and clear to the commodity of choice mixed with fire, that is, as containing the treasury of the judgments of God, which he brings forth and dispenses according to his own pleasure: for out of the former, the priests were cleansed of old: and out of this the ungodly are destroyed now in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#006">Rev 4:6</A>). (5) That is, the godly martyrs of Christ, who shall remain faithful even in miracles to that beast; see (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#017">Rev 13:17</A>; ) (6) Glorifying God, from the particular observation of the weapons and instruments of God's wrath, floating in the sea of glass.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#003">Revelation 15:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">rev 15:3</A></FONT></span></p>And they sing (7) the song of Moses the (a) servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, (8) Great and marvellous [are] thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true [are] thy (b) ways, thou King of saints. 
<p>
<p>(7) That song of triumph, which is (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#002">Exo 15:2</A>). 
<p>
<p>(a) So is Moses called for honour's sake, as it is set forth in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#010">Deu 34:10</A>). (8) This song has two parts: one a confession, both particular, in this verse, and general, in the beginning of the next verse (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#004">Rev 15:4</A>), another, a narration of causes belonging to the confession, of which one kind is eternal in itself, and most present to the godly, in that God is both holy and alone God: another kind is future and to come, in that the elect taken out of the Gentiles (that is, out of the wicked ones and unbelieving: as in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#002">Rev 11:2</A>) were to be brought to the same state of happiness, by the magnificence of the judgment of God, in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#004">Rev 15:4</A>). 
<p>
<p>(b) Thy doings.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#005">Revelation 15:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">rev 15:5</A></FONT></span></p>(9) And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened: 
<p>
<p>(9) The second part of the narration (as was noted in) See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#002">Rev 15:2</A> in which first the authority of the whole argument and matter is figured by a forerunning type of a temple opened in heaven, as in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#019">Rev 11:19</A>) namely that all those things are divine and of God, that proceed from thence in this verse. Secondly, the administers or executors, come out of the Temple in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#006">Rev 15:6</A>). Thirdly, they are furnished with instruments of the judgments of God, and weapons fit for the manner of the same judgments; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#007">Rev 15:7</A>). Finally, they are confirmed by testimony of the visible glory of God, in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#008">Rev 15:8</A>). A similar testimony to which was exhibited of old in the law; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#034">Exo 40:34</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#006">Revelation 15:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">rev 15:6</A></FONT></span></p>And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the (10) seven plagues, clothed in (11) pure and white linen, and having their breasts (12) girded with golden girdles. 
<p>
<p>(10) That is, commandments to inflict those seven plagues, by way of metonymy. 
<p>
<p>(11) Which was in old time a sign of the kingly or princely dignity. 
<p>
<p>(12) This girding was a sign of diligence, and the girdle of gold was a sign of sincerity and trustworthiness in taking in charge the commandments of God.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#007">Revelation 15:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">rev 15:7</A></FONT></span></p>And one of the (13) four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever. 
<p>
<p>(13) Of these before (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#007">Rev 4:7</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#008">Revelation 15:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">rev 15:8</A></FONT></span></p>And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; (14) and no man was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled. 
<p>
<p>(14) None of those seven angels could return, till he had performed fully the charge committed to him, according to the decree of God.
