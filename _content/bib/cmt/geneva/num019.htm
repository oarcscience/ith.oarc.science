<p>
<p>(a) According to this law and ceremony you shall sacrifice the red cow.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#003">Numbers 19:3</A></p>

<p>(b) Another priest.

<p>
<p>(e) Or, the water of separation because they that were separate due to their uncleanness, were sprinkled with it and made clean, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#007">Num 8:7</A>). It is also called holy water, because it was ordained for a holy use, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#017">Num 1:17</A>).

<p>(f) With the sprinkling of water.

<p>
<p>(g) So that he should not be esteemed to be of the holy people, but as a polluted and excommunicated person.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#017">Numbers 19:17</A></p>

<p>(h) Of the red cow burnt for sin.

<p>(i) Water of the fountain or river.

<p>
<p>(l) Because he had been among them that were unclean: or else had touched the water as in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#021">Num 19:21</A>).
