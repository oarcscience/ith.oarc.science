<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#001">Hosea 5:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">hos 5:1</A></FONT></span></p>Hear ye this, O priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; and give ye ear, O house of the king; for judgment [is] toward you, because ye have been a (a) snare on Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor. 
<p>
<p>(a) The priests and princes caught the poor people in their snares, as the fowlers did the birds, in these two high mountains.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#002">Hosea 5:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">hos 5:2</A></FONT></span></p>And the revolters are profound to make (b) slaughter, though I [have been] a (c) rebuker of them all. 
<p>
<p>(b) Even though they seemed to be given altogether to holiness, and to sacrifices which here he calls slaughter in contempt. 
<p>
<p>(c) Though I had admonished them continually by my Prophets.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#003">Hosea 5:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">hos 5:3</A></FONT></span></p>I know (d) Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now, O Ephraim, thou committest whoredom, [and] Israel is defiled. 
<p>
<p>(d) They boasted themselves not only to be Israelites, but also Ephraimites, because their King Jeroboam came from that tribe.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#005">Hosea 5:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">hos 5:5</A></FONT></span></p>And the (e) pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity; Judah also shall fall with them. 
<p>
<p>(e) Meaning their condemning of all admonitions.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#007">Hosea 5:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">hos 5:7</A></FONT></span></p>They have dealt treacherously against the LORD: for they have begotten (f) strange children: now shall (g) a month devour them with their portions. 
<p>
<p>(f) That is, their children are degenerate, so that there is no hope in them. 
<p>
<p>(g) Their destruction is not far off.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#008">Hosea 5:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">hos 5:8</A></FONT></span></p>Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, [and] the trumpet in Ramah: cry aloud [at] Bethaven, after thee, O (h) Benjamin. 
<p>
<p>(h) That is, all of Israel that was included under this tribe, signifying that the Lord's plagues would pursue them from place to place until they were destroyed.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#009">Hosea 5:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">hos 5:9</A></FONT></span></p>Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel have I made (i) known that which shall surely be. 
<p>
<p>(i) By the success they will know that I have surely determined this.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#010">Hosea 5:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">hos 5:10</A></FONT></span></p>The princes of Judah were like them that (k) remove the bound: [therefore] I will pour out my wrath upon them like water. 
<p>
<p>(k) They have turned upside down all political order and all manner of religion.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#011">Hosea 5:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">hos 5:11</A></FONT></span></p>Ephraim [is] oppressed [and] broken in judgment, because he willingly walked after the (l) commandment. 
<p>
<p>(l) That is, after King Jeroboam's commandment, and did not rather follow God.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#013">Hosea 5:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">hos 5:13</A></FONT></span></p>When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah [saw] his wound, then went Ephraim to (m) the Assyrian, and sent to king (n) Jareb: yet could he not heal you, nor cure you of your wound. 
<p>
<p>(m) Instead of seeking for remedy from God's hand. 
<p>
<p>(n) Who was king of the Assyrians.
