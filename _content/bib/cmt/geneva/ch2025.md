### [2 Chronicles Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 25:2</span></span>

And he did \[that which was\] (a) right in the sight of the LORD, but
not with a perfect heart.

\(a\) Meaning, in respect to his predecessors, though he had his
imperfections.

[2 Chronicles 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch2 25:4</span></span>

But he slew not their children, but \[did\] as \[it is\] written in the
law in the book of Moses, where the LORD commanded, saying, The fathers
shall not die for the (b) children, neither shall the children die for
the fathers, but every man shall die for his own sin.

\(b\) That is, for the fault the child is punished for unless he is
guilty of the same.

[2 Chronicles 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 25:5</span></span>

Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and made them captains over
thousands, and captains over hundreds, according to the houses of
\[their\] fathers, throughout all Judah and Benjamin: and he numbered
them from (c) twenty years old and above, and found them three hundred
thousand choice \[men, able\] to go forth to war, that could handle
spear and shield.

\(c\) So many as were able to bear weapons and go to war.

[2 Chronicles 25:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 25:6</span></span>

He hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour (d) out of Israel
for an hundred talents of silver.

\(d\) That is, out of the ten tribes who had separated themselves before
both from God and their true king.

[2 Chronicles 25:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 25:7</span></span>

But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the army of
Israel go with thee; for the LORD \[is\] not (e) with Israel, \[to wit,
with\] all the children of Ephraim.

\(e\) Therefore to think to have help from them, whom the Lord does not
favour, is to cast off the help of the Lord.

[2 Chronicles 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch2 25:8</span></span>

But (f) if thou wilt go, do \[it\], be strong for the battle: God shall
make thee fall before the enemy: for God hath power to help, and to cast
down.

\(f\) If you will not give credit to my words.

[2 Chronicles 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch2 25:9</span></span>

And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the hundred
talents which I have given to the army of Israel? And the man of God
answered, The LORD is able to (g) give thee much more than this.

\(g\) He shows that if we depend only on God, we will not need to be
troubled by these worldly things, for he will give at all times that
which will be necessary if we obey his word.

[2 Chronicles 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 25:11</span></span>

And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people, and went to
the valley of salt, and smote of the children of (h) Seir ten thousand.

\(h\) For the Idumeans whom David had brought to subjection rebelled
under Jehoram Jehoshaphat's son.

[2 Chronicles 25:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch2 25:12</span></span>

And \[other\] ten thousand \[left\] alive did the children of Judah
carry away captive, and brought them unto the top of the (i) rock, and
cast them down from the top of the rock, that they all were broken in
pieces.

\(i\) In ([Kg2 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#007)) this rock is
called the city Sela.

[2 Chronicles 25:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch2 25:13</span></span>

But the soldiers of the (k) army which Amaziah sent back, that they
should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah, from
Samaria even unto Bethhoron, and smote three thousand of them, and took
much spoil.

\(k\) That is, the 100,000 of Israel.

[2 Chronicles 25:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 25:14</span></span>

Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of
the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set
them up \[to be\] his gods, and (l) bowed down himself before them, and
burned incense unto them.

\(l\) That where he should have praised God for his benefits and great
victory, he fell from God and most vilely dishonoured him.

[2 Chronicles 25:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch2 25:15</span></span>

Wherefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah, and he sent
unto him a prophet, which said unto him, Why hast thou sought after the
gods of the people, which could not (m) deliver their own people out of
thine hand?

\(m\) He proves that whatever cannot save himself nor his worshipper is
no god but an idol.

[2 Chronicles 25:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch2 25:16</span></span>

And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that (n) \[the king\] said
unto him, Art thou made of the king's counsel? forbear; why shouldest
thou be (o) smitten? Then the prophet forbare, and said, I know that God
hath determined to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast
not hearkened unto my counsel.

\(n\) Meaning the king.

\(o\) So hard it is, for the carnal man to be admonished for his fault,
that he condemns, mocks and threatens him who warns him: yea, imprisons
him and puts him to death, ([Ch2
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#010), [Ch2
18:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#026), [Ch2
24:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#021)).

[2 Chronicles 25:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch2 25:17</span></span>

Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the son of
Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, (p) let us see
one another in the face.

\(p\) That is, let us try the matter hand to hand: for he was offended,
that the army of the Israelites whom he had in wages and dismissed by
the counsel of the prophet, had destroyed certain of the cities of
Judah.

[2 Chronicles 25:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch2 25:20</span></span>

But Amaziah would not hear; for (q) it \[came\] of God, that he might
deliver them into the hand \[of their enemies\], because they sought
after the gods of Edom.

\(q\) Thus God often plagues by those means on which men must rely, to
teach them to seek help only from him, and to show his judgments, he
moves their hearts to follow that which will lead to their destruction.

[2 Chronicles 25:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ch2 25:24</span></span>

And \[he took\] all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels that
were found in the house of God with (r) Obededom, and the treasures of
the king's house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.

\(r\) Meaning, the successors of Obededom: for the house bore the name
of the chief father.
