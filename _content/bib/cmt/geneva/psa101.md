### [Psalms Chapter 101](../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#001)

[Psalms 101:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 101:1</span></span>

"A Psalm of David." I will (a) sing of mercy and judgment: unto thee, O
LORD, will I sing.

\(a\) David considers what manner of King he would be, when God would
place him in the throne, promising openly, that he would be merciful and
just.

[Psalms 101:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 101:2</span></span>

I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. (b) O when wilt thou come
unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.

\(b\) Though as yet you deferred to place me in the kingly dignity, yet
I will give myself to wisdom and uprightness being a private man.

[Psalms 101:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 101:3</span></span>

I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate (c) the work of them
that turn aside; \[it\] shall not cleave to me.

\(c\) He shows that magistrates do not do their duties, unless they are
enemies to all vice.

[Psalms 101:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 101:5</span></span>

Whoso privily (d) slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off: him that
hath an high look and a proud heart will not I suffer.

\(d\) In promising to punish these vices, which are most pernicious in
them that are about Kings, he declares that he will punish all.

[Psalms 101:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 101:6</span></span>

Mine eyes \[shall be\] upon the (e) faithful of the land, that they may
dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me.

\(e\) He shows what the true use of the sword is, to punish the wicked
and to maintain the good.

[Psalms 101:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 101:8</span></span>

\(f\) I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may cut
off all wicked doers from the city of the LORD.

\(f\) Magistrates must immediately punish vice, lest it grow to further
inconvenience; and if heathen magistrates are bound to do this, how much
more they who have the charge of the Church of God?
