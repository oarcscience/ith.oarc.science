<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#003">Job 20:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">job 20:3</A></FONT></span></p>I have heard (a) the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer. 
<p>
<p>(a) He declares that two things moved him to speak: that is, because Job seemed to touch him, and because he thought he had knowledge sufficient to confute him.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#006">Job 20:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">job 20:6</A></FONT></span></p>Though (b) his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds; 
<p>
<p>(b) His purpose is to prove Job to be a wicked man, and a hypocrite, because God punished him, and changed his prosperity into adversity.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#010">Job 20:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">job 20:10</A></FONT></span></p>His children shall (c) seek to please the poor, and his hands shall (d) restore their goods. 
<p>
<p>(c) While the father through ambition and tyranny oppressed the poor, the children through poverty and misery will seek favour from the poor. 
<p>
<p>(d) So that the thing which he has taken away by violence will be restored again by force.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#011">Job 20:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">job 20:11</A></FONT></span></p>His bones are full [of the sin] of his youth, which (e) shall lie down with him in the dust. 
<p>
<p>(e) Meaning that he will carry nothing away with him but his sin.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#012">Job 20:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">job 20:12</A></FONT></span></p>Though wickedness be (f) sweet in his mouth, [though] he hide it under his tongue; 
<p>
<p>(f) As poison that is sweet in the mouth brings destruction when it comes into the body: so all vice at the first is pleasant, but God later turns it to destruction.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#016">Job 20:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">job 20:16</A></FONT></span></p>He shall suck the (g) poison of asps: the viper's tongue shall slay him. 
<p>
<p>(g) He compares ill-gotten goods to the venom of asps, which is a dangerous serpent, noting that Jobs great riches were not truly come by and therefore God plagues him justly for the same.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#017">Job 20:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">job 20:17</A></FONT></span></p>He shall not see the (h) rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and butter. 
<p>
<p>(h) Though God gives all other abundance from his blessings yet he will have no part of it.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#018">Job 20:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">job 20:18</A></FONT></span></p>That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not swallow [it] down: according to [his] substance [shall] the restitution [be], (i) and he shall not rejoice [therein]. 
<p>
<p>(i) That is these raveners and spoilers of the poor will enjoy their theft but for a time for after God will take it from them, and cause them to make restitution so that it is only an exchange.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#021">Job 20:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">job 20:21</A></FONT></span></p>There shall none of his (k) meat be left; therefore shall no man look for his goods. 
<p>
<p>(k) He will leave nothing to his posterity.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#022">Job 20:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">job 20:22</A></FONT></span></p>In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: every hand (l) of the wicked shall come upon him. 
<p>
<p>(l) The wicked will never be in rest: for one wicked man will seek to destroy another.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#023">Job 20:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">job 20:23</A></FONT></span></p>[When] he is about to fill his belly, [God] shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him, (m) and shall rain [it] upon him while he is eating. 
<p>
<p>(m) Some read, upon his flesh, alluding to Job, whose flesh was smitten with a scab.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#025">Job 20:25</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_025">job 20:25</A></FONT></span></p>It is drawn, and cometh out of the (n) body; yea, the glittering sword cometh out of his gall: terrors [are] upon him. 
<p>
<p>(n) Some read, of the quiver.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#026">Job 20:26</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_026">job 20:26</A></FONT></span></p>(o) All darkness [shall be] hid in his secret places: a fire not (p) blown shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle. 
<p>
<p>(o) All fear and sorrow will light on him when he thinks to escape. 
<p>
<p>(p) That is, fire from heaven, or the fire of God's wrath.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#028">Job 20:28</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_028">job 20:28</A></FONT></span></p>The (q) increase of his house shall depart, [and his goods] shall flow away in the day of his wrath. 
<p>
<p>(q) Meaning, the children of the wicked will flow away like rivers and be dispersed in various places.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#029">Job 20:29</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_029">job 20:29</A></FONT></span></p>This [is] the portion of a wicked man from (r) God, and the heritage appointed unto him by (s) God. 
<p>
<p>(r) Thus God will plague the wicked. 
<p>
<p>(s) Against God, thinking to excuse himself, and to escape God's hand.
