<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#001">Joshua 6:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">jos 6:1</A></FONT></span></p>Now Jericho was straitly (a) (b) shut up (c) because of the children of Israel: none went out, and none came in. 
<p>
<p>(a) That none could go out. 
<p>
<p>(b) That none could go in. 
<p>
<p>(c) for fear of the Israelites.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#003">Joshua 6:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">jos 6:3</A></FONT></span></p>And ye shall compass the city, all [ye] men of war, [and] go round about the city (d) once. Thus shalt thou do six days. 
<p>
<p>(d) Every day one.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#004">Joshua 6:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">jos 6:4</A></FONT></span></p>And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of (e) rams' horns: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets. 
<p>
<p>(e) That the conquest might not be assigned to man's power, but to the mercy of God, which with most weak things can overcome that which seems most strong.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#007">Joshua 6:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">jos 6:7</A></FONT></span></p>And he said unto the people, (f) Pass on, and compass the city, and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the LORD. 
<p>
<p>(f) This is chiefly meant by the Reubenites, Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#009">Joshua 6:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">jos 6:9</A></FONT></span></p>And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets, and the (g) rereward came after the ark, [the priests] going on, and blowing with the trumpets. 
<p>
<p>(g) Meaning, the gathering host, in which was the standard of the tribe of Dan, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#025">Num 10:25</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#011">Joshua 6:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">jos 6:11</A></FONT></span></p>So the ark of the LORD compassed the city, going about [it] (h) once: and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp. 
<p>
<p>(h) For that day.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#013">Joshua 6:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">jos 6:13</A></FONT></span></p>And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew with the trumpets: and the armed men went before them; but the (i) rereward came after the ark of the LORD, [the priests] going on, and blowing with the trumpets. 
<p>
<p>(i) The tribe of Dan was so called, because it marched last and gathered up whatever was left of others.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#015">Joshua 6:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">jos 6:15</A></FONT></span></p>And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner (k) seven times: only on that day they compassed the city seven times. 
<p>
<p>(k) Beside every day once for the space of six days.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#017">Joshua 6:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">jos 6:17</A></FONT></span></p>And the city shall be (l) accursed, [even] it, and all that [are] therein, to the LORD: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that [are] with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent. 
<p>
<p>(l) That is appointed wholly to be destroyed.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#019">Joshua 6:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">jos 6:19</A></FONT></span></p>But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, [are] (m) consecrated unto the LORD: they shall come into the treasury of the LORD. 
<p>
<p>(m) And therefore cannot be put to any private use, but must be first molten, and then serve for the Tabernacle.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#023">Joshua 6:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">jos 6:23</A></FONT></span></p>And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred, and left them (n) without the camp of Israel. 
<p>
<p>(n) For it was not lawful for strangers to dwell among the Israelites, till they were purged.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#024">Joshua 6:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">jos 6:24</A></FONT></span></p>And they burnt the city with fire, and all that [was] therein: only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the (o) house of the LORD. 
<p>
<p>(o) Meaning, the tabernacle.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#025">Joshua 6:25</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_025">jos 6:25</A></FONT></span></p>And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father's household, and all that she had; and she (p) dwelleth in Israel [even] unto this day; because she hid the messengers, which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho. 
<p>
<p>(p) For she was married to Salmon prince of the tribe of Judah, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#005">Mat 1:5</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#026">Joshua 6:26</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_026">jos 6:26</A></FONT></span></p>And Joshua adjured [them] at that time, saying, Cursed [be] the man before the LORD, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho: (q) he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn, and in his youngest [son] shall he set up the gates of it. 
<p>
<p>(q) He will build it to the destruction of all his stock, which was fulfilled in Hiel of Beth-el, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#034">Kg1 16:34</A>).
