### [Exodus Chapter 40](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#001)

[Exodus 40:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">exo 40:2</span></span>

On the (a) first day of the first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle
of the tent of the congregation.

\(a\) After that Moses had been 40 days and 40 nights in the mountain,
that is, from the beginning of August to the tenth of September, he came
down, and caused this work to be done: which when finished, was set up
in Abib, half March and half April.

[Exodus 40:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">exo 40:5</span></span>

And thou shalt set the altar (b) of gold for the incense before the ark
of the testimony, and put the (c) hanging of the door to the tabernacle.

\(b\) That is, the altar of perfume, or to burn incense on.

\(c\) This hanging or veil was between the sanctuary and the court.

[Exodus 40:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">exo 40:15</span></span>

And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they
may minister unto me in the priest's office: for their anointing (d)
shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.

\(d\) Till both the priesthood and the ceremonies should end, which is
at Christ's coming.

[Exodus 40:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">exo 40:17</span></span>

And it came to pass in the first month in (e) the second year, on the
first \[day\] of the month, \[that\] the tabernacle was reared up.

\(e\) After they came out of Egypt, ([Num
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#001)).

[Exodus 40:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">exo 40:20</span></span>

And he took and put the (f) testimony into the ark, and set the staves
on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark:

\(f\) That is, the tables of the law; ([Exo
31:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#018), [Exo
34:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#029)).

[Exodus 40:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">exo 40:28</span></span>

And he set up the hanging \[at\] the (g) door of the tabernacle.

\(g\) Between the sanctuary and the court.

[Exodus 40:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">exo 40:38</span></span>

For (h) the cloud of the LORD \[was\] upon the tabernacle by day, and
fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel,
throughout all their journeys.

\(h\) Thus the presence of God preserved and guided them night and day,
till they came to the land promised.
