### [Proverbs Chapter 28](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#001)

[Proverbs 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 28:1</span></span>

The wicked (a) flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are bold as
a lion.

\(a\) Because their own conscience accuses them.

[Proverbs 28:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 28:2</span></span>

For the transgression of a land (b) many \[are\] its princes: but by a
man of understanding \[and\] knowledge \[its\] state shall be prolonged.

\(b\) The state of the commonwealth is often changed.

[Proverbs 28:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 28:8</span></span>

He that by interest and unjust gain increaseth his substance, he shall
gather (c) it for him that will pity the poor.

\(c\) For God will take away the wicked usurer, and give his goods to
him that will bestow them well.

[Proverbs 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 28:9</span></span>

He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer
\[shall be\] (d) abomination.

\(d\) Because it is not of faith which is grounded on God's word or law
which the wicked contemn.

[Proverbs 28:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 28:11</span></span>

The rich man \[is\] wise in his own conceit; but the poor man that hath
understanding searcheth (e) him out.

\(e\) And judge that he is not wise.

[Proverbs 28:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 28:12</span></span>

When righteous \[men\] rejoice, \[there is\] great glory: but when the
wicked rise, a man (f) is hidden.

\(f\) He is known by his doings to be wicked.

[Proverbs 28:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 28:14</span></span>

Happy \[is\] the man that (g) feareth always: but he that hardeneth his
heart shall fall into mischief.

\(g\) Which stands in awe of God, and is afraid to offend him.

[Proverbs 28:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 28:15</span></span>

\[As\] a roaring lion, and a ranging bear; \[so is\] (h) a wicked ruler
over the poor people.

\(h\) For he can never be satisfied but always oppresses and spoils.

[Proverbs 28:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 28:17</span></span>

A man that doeth violence to the blood of \[any\] person shall flee to
the pit; let no man (i) sustain him.

\(i\) No one will be able to deliver him.

[Proverbs 28:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 28:21</span></span>

To have respect of persons \[is\] not good: for for a piece of (k) bread
\[that\] man will transgress.

\(k\) He will be abused for nothing.

[Proverbs 28:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 28:22</span></span>

He that hasteneth to be rich \[hath\] an evil (l) eye, and considereth
not that poverty shall come upon him.

\(l\) Meaning, he that is covetous.

[Proverbs 28:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">pro 28:25</span></span>

He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife: but he that putteth his
trust in the LORD shall be made (m) fat.

\(m\) Will have all things in abundance.
