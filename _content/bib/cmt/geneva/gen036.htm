<p>
<p>(a) This genealogy declares that Esau was blessed physically and that his father's blessing took place in worldly things.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#002">Genesis 36:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">gen 36:2</A></FONT></span></p>Esau took his wives of the (b) daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite; 
<p>
<p>(b) Besides those wives spoken of in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#034">Gen 26:34</A>).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">gen 36:6</A></FONT></span></p>And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his substance, which he had got in the land of Canaan; and (c) went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob. 
<p>
<p>(c) In this, God's providence appears, which causes the wicked to give place to the godly, that Jacob might enjoy Canaan according to God's promise.

<p>
<p>(d) If God's promises are so sure towards those who are not of his household, how much more will he perform the same for us?

<p>
<p>(f) Who not contented with those kinds of beasts, which God had created, discovered the monstrous generation of mules between the ass and the mare.

<p>
<p>(g) The wicked rise up suddenly to honour and perish as quickly: but the inheritance of the children of God continues forever, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#028">Psa 102:28</A>).
