### [Jeremiah Chapter 33](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 33:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 33:1</span></span>

Moreover the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the second time, while he
was yet shut up in the (a) court of the prison, saying,

\(a\) Which was in the king's house at Jerusalem, as in ([Jer
32:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#001)).

[Jeremiah 33:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 33:2</span></span>

Thus saith the LORD the (b) maker of this, the LORD that formed it, to
establish it; the LORD \[is\] his name;

\(b\) That is, of Jerusalem, who as he made it, so will he preserve it,
read ([Isa 37:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#026)).

[Jeremiah 33:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 33:4</span></span>

For thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of
this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are
thrown down by the (c) mounts, and by the sword;

\(c\) Read ([Jer 32:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#024)).

[Jeremiah 33:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 33:5</span></span>

They come to (d) fight with the Chaldeans, but \[it is\] to fill them
with the dead bodies of men, whom I have slain in my anger and in my
fury, and for all whose wickedness I have hid my (e) face from this
city.

\(d\) The Jews think to overcome the Chaldeans, but they seek their own
destruction.

\(e\) He shows that God's favour is cause of all prosperity, as his
anger is of all adversity.

[Jeremiah 33:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 33:6</span></span>

Behold, I (f) will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them, and
will reveal to them the abundance of peace and truth.

\(f\) In the midst of his threatenings God remembers his, and comforts
them.

[Jeremiah 33:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 33:8</span></span>

And I will (g) cleanse them from all their iniquity, by which they have
sinned against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities, by which they
have sinned, and by which they have transgressed against me.

\(g\) Declaring that there is no deliverance nor joy, but where we feel
remission of sins.

[Jeremiah 33:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 33:9</span></span>

And it shall be to me a name of (h) joy, a praise and an honour before
all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that I do to
them: and they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all
the prosperity that I procure to it.

\(h\) By which he shows that the Church in which is remission of sins,
is God's honour and glory, so that whoever is enemy to it, labours to
dishonour God.

[Jeremiah 33:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 33:11</span></span>

The voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the
bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that shall
say, (i) Praise the LORD of hosts: for the LORD \[is\] good; for his
mercy \[endureth\] for ever: \[and\] of them that shall bring the
sacrifice of praise into the house of the LORD. For I will cause to
return the captives of the land, as at the first, saith the LORD.

\(i\) Which was a song appointed for the Levites to praise God by, ([Ch1
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#008); [Psa
105:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#001); [Psa
106:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#001); [Psa
107:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#001); [Psa
118:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#001); [Psa
136:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#001); [Isa
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#004))

[Jeremiah 33:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 33:13</span></span>

In the cities of the (k) mountains, in the cities of the vale, and in
the cities of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places
about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks pass again
under the hands of him that counteth \[them\], saith the LORD.

\(k\) Meaning that all the country of Judah will be inhabited again.

[Jeremiah 33:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 33:15</span></span>

In those days, and at that time, will I cause (l) the Branch of
righteousness to grow up to David; and he shall execute judgment and
righteousness in the land.

\(l\) That is, I will send the Messiah, who will come of the house of
David, of whom this prophecy is meant, as testify all the Jews and that
which is written, ([Jer 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005)).

[Jeremiah 33:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 33:16</span></span>

In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell in safety:
and this \[is the name\] by which (m) she shall be called, The LORD our
(n) righteousness.

\(m\) That is, Christ that will call his Church.

\(n\) That is, Christ is our Lord God, our righteousness, sanctification
and redemption, ([Co1 1:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#030)).

[Jeremiah 33:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 33:18</span></span>

Neither shall the priests the Levites lack a man before me to offer (o)
burnt offerings, and to kindle meat offerings, and to do sacrifice
continually.

\(o\) That is, chiefly meant of the spiritual sacrifice of thanksgiving
which is left to the Church in the time of Christ, who was the
everlasting priest and the everlasting sacrifice figured by the
sacrifices of the law.

[Jeremiah 33:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 33:20</span></span>

Thus saith the LORD; If ye can break my covenant of the (p) day, and my
covenant of the night, so that there should not be day and night in
their season;

\(p\) Read ([Jer 31:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#035)).

[Jeremiah 33:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jer 33:24</span></span>

Considerest thou not what (q) this people have spoken, saying, The two
families which the LORD hath chosen, he hath even cast them off? thus
they have despised my people, that they should be no more a nation
before them.

\(q\) Meaning, the Chaldeans and other infidels who thought God had
utterly cast off Judah and Israel or Benjamin, because he corrected them
for a time for their amendment.
