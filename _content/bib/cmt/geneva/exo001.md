### [Exodus Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001)

[Exodus 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 1:1</span></span>

Now (a)these \[are\] the names of the children of Israel, which came
into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.

The Argument - After Jacob by God's commandment in ([Gen
46:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#003)) had brought his family into
Egypt, where they remained for four hundred years, and from seventy
people grew to an infinite number so that the king and the country
endeavoured both by tyranny and cruel slavery to suppress them: the Lord
according to his promise in ([Gen
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#014)) had compassion on his Church,
and delivered them, but plagued their enemies in most strange and varied
ways. The more the tyranny of the wicked raged against his Church, the
more his heavy judgments increased against them, till Pharaoh and his
army were drowned in the sea, which gave an entry and passage to the
children of God. As the ingratitude of man is great, so they immediately
forgot God's wonderful benefits and although he had given them the
Passover as a sign and memorial of the same, yet they fell to distrust,
and tempted God with various complaining and grudging against him and
his ministers: sometimes out of ambition, sometimes lack of drink or
meat to satisfy their lusts, sometimes idolatry, or such like. For this
reason, God punished them with severe rods and plagues, that by his
correction they might turn to him for help against his scourges, and
earnestly repent for their rebellion and wickedness. Because God loves
them to the end, whom he has once begun to love, he punished them not as
they deserved, but dealt with them mercifully, and with new benefits
laboured to overcome their malice: for he still governed them and gave
them his word and Law, both concerning the way to serve him, and also
the form of judgments and civil policy: with the intent that they would
not serve God after as they pleased, but according to the order, that
his heavenly wisdom had appointed.

\(a\) Moses describes the wonderful order that God observes in
performing his promise to Abraham; ([Gen
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#014)).

[Exodus 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">exo 1:7</span></span>

And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and
multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the (b) land was filled with
them.

\(b\) He means the country of Goshen.

[Exodus 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">exo 1:8</span></span>

Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which (c) knew not Joseph.

\(c\) He did not consider how God had preserved Egypt for the sake of
Joseph.

[Exodus 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">exo 1:10</span></span>

Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come
to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our
enemies, and fight against us, and \[so\] (d) get them up out of the
land.

\(d\) Into Canaan, and so we shall lose our conveniences.

[Exodus 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">exo 1:12</span></span>

But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And
(e) they were grieved because of the children of Israel.

\(e\) The more God blesses his own, the more the wicked envy them.

[Exodus 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">exo 1:15</span></span>

And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of
the one \[was\] (f) Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:

\(f\) These seem to have been the main of the rest.

[Exodus 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">exo 1:19</span></span>

And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew (g) women \[are\]
not as the Egyptian women; for they \[are\] lively, and are delivered
ere the midwives come in unto them.

\(g\) Their disobedience in this was lawful, but their deception is
evil.

[Exodus 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">exo 1:21</span></span>

And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he (h) made
them houses.

\(h\) That is, God increased the families of the Israelites by their
means.

[Exodus 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">exo 1:22</span></span>

And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye
shall (i) cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.

\(i\) When tyrants cannot prevail by deceit, they burst into open rage.
