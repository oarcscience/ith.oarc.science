### [2 Chronicles Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 1:1</span></span>

And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the
LORD his God \[was\] with him, and magnified him exceedingly.

The Argument - This second book contains in brief the contents of the
two books of the kings: that is, from the reign of Solomon to the
destruction of Jerusalem and the Babylonian captivity. In this story
some things are told in more detail than in the books of the kings and
therefore help greatly in the understanding of the prophets. Three
things are chiefly to be considered here: First, that when the godly
kings saw the plagues of God prepared against their country for sin,
they turned to the Lord and by earnest prayer were heard, and the
plagues removed. Secondly, while the good rulers always loved the
prophets of God and were zealous to set forth his religion throughout
their dominions, it offended God greatly that the wicked hated his
ministers, deposed them and set up idolatry and attempted served God
according to the fantasy of men. Thus we have the chief acts from the
beginning of the world to the rebuilding of Jerusalem in the 32nd year
of Darius, in total 3568 years and six months.

congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the
wilderness.

[2 Chronicles 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#005)

before this people: for who can judge this thy people, \[that is so\]
great?

27:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#001); [Kg1
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#007)).

[2 Chronicles 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#011)

And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thine heart, and thou hast
not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the (g) life of thine enemies,
neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom and knowledge
for thyself, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made
thee king:

\(g\) That is, to be avenged on your enemies.
