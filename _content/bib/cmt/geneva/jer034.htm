<p>
<p>(a) Who commonly by Jeremiah was called Nebuchadrezzar and by others Nebuchadnezzar.

<p>
<p>(b) Not of any violent death. 
<p>
<p>(c) The Jews will lament for you their lord and king.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">jer 34:8</A></FONT></span></p>[This is] the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people who [were] at Jerusalem, (d) to proclaim liberty to them; 
<p>
<p>(d) When the enemy was at hand and they saw themselves in danger, they would seem holy, and so began some kind of reformation: but soon after they uttered their hypocrisy.

<p>
<p>(e) According to the law, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#002">Exo 21:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#012">Deu 15:12</A>).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">jer 34:15</A></FONT></span></p>And ye had now turned, and had done right in my sight, in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour; and ye had made a covenant before me in (f) the house which is called by my name: 
<p>
<p>(f) Meaning in the temple to declare that it was a most solemn and straight covenant made in the name of the Lord.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#017">Jeremiah 34:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">jer 34:17</A></FONT></span></p>Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ye have not hearkened to me, in proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother, and every man to his neighbour: behold, I proclaim a liberty for you, saith the LORD, to (g) the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine; and I will make you to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth. 
<p>
<p>(g) That is, I give the sword liberty to destroy you.

<p>
<p>(h) Concerning the manner of solemn covenant which the ancients used by passing between the two parts of a beast, to signify that the transgressor of the same covenant should be so divided in pieces, read (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#010">Gen 15:10</A>).

<p>(i) To fight against the Egyptians, as in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#011">Jer 37:11</A>).
