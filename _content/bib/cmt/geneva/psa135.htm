<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#002">Psalms 135:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">psa 135:2</A></FONT></span></p>Ye that (a) stand in the house of the LORD, in the (b) courts of the house of our God, 
<p>
<p>(a) You Levites who are in his sanctuary. 
<p>
<p>(b) Meaning, the people: for the people and Levites had their courts, which were separate places of the temple.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#004">Psalms 135:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">psa 135:4</A></FONT></span></p>For the LORD hath (c) chosen Jacob unto himself, [and] Israel for his peculiar treasure. 
<p>
<p>(c) That is, has freely loved the posterity of Abraham.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#006">Psalms 135:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">psa 135:6</A></FONT></span></p>Whatsoever the LORD pleased, [that] (d) did he in heaven, and in earth, in the seas, and all deep places. 
<p>
<p>(d) He joined God's power with his will, to the intent that we should not separate them and by this he wills God's people to depend on his power which he confirms by examples.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#012">Psalms 135:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">psa 135:12</A></FONT></span></p>And (e) gave their land [for] an heritage, an heritage unto Israel his people. 
<p>
<p>(e) He shows what fruit the godly conceive of God's power, by which they see how he destroys his enemies, and delivers his people.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#014">Psalms 135:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">psa 135:14</A></FONT></span></p>For the LORD will (f) judge his people, and he will repent himself concerning his servants. 
<p>
<p>(f) That is, govern and defend his people.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#015">Psalms 135:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">psa 135:15</A></FONT></span></p>The (g) idols of the heathen [are] silver and gold, the work of men's hands. 
<p>
<p>(g) By showing the punishment God appoints for the heathen idolaters, he warns his people to beware of the same offences, seeing that idols have neither power nor life, and that their deliverance came not by idols, but by the mighty power of God, see (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#004">Psa 115:4-14</A>).
