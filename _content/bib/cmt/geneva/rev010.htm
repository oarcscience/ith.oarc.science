<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">rev 10:1</A></FONT></span></p>And (1) I saw (2) another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow [was] upon his head, and his face [was] as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire: 
<p>
<p>(1) Now John passes to the other prophetical history, which is of the Church of God, as I showed that this book should be distinguished (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#001">Rev 4:1</A>). This story goes from here to (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#001">Rev 22:1</A>). This whole chapter is a transition from the common history of the world to that which is particular of the Church. There are in this transition or passage, two preparatives as it were, to this Church story comprised in this whole chapter. One is the authority of Christ revealing his mysteries and calling his servant, to (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#007">Rev 10:7</A>). The other is John, his calling proper to this place, and repeated from before to the end of this chapter. Authority is given to this revelation, by these things: first, by the appearing from heaven in this habit and countenance, strong, ready glorious surveying all things by his providence, and governing them by his omnipotence (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#001">Rev 10:1</A>). Secondly, that he brought not by chance, but out of a book, this open revelation, set forth to the eye, to signify the same to the sea and land, as the Lord over all (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#002">Rev 10:2</A>). Thirdly that he offered the same not whispering or muttering in a corner (as false prophets do) but crying out with a loud voice to those who sleep, and with a lionish and terrible noise roused the secure: the very thunders themselves giving testimony to it (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#003">Rev 10:3</A>). Lastly, for that he confirmed all by another (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#005">Rev 10:5-7</A>). 
<p>
<p>(2) Christ Jesus, see (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#002">Rev 7:2</A>)

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">rev 10:2</A></FONT></span></p>And he had in his hand a (3) little book open: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and [his] left [foot] on the earth, 
<p>
<p>(3) Namely, a special book of the affairs of God's Church: For the book that contains things belonging to the whole world, is said to be kept with the Creator (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#001">Rev 5:1</A>) but the book of the Church, with the Redeemer: and out of this book is taken the rest of the history of this Apocalypse.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#004">Revelation 10:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">rev 10:4</A></FONT></span></p>(4) And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, (a) Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not. 
<p>
<p>(4) A godly care is laudable, but must be married with knowledge. Therefore nothing is to be done but by the calling of God, which must be expected and waited for by the godly. 
<p>
<p>(a) Keep them secret.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#005">Revelation 10:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">rev 10:5</A></FONT></span></p>And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth (b) lifted up his hand to heaven, 
<p>
<p>(b) This was a gesture used of one that swears, which men do now use.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#006">Revelation 10:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">rev 10:6</A></FONT></span></p>And sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created heaven, and the things that therein are, and the earth, and the things that therein are, and the sea, and the things which are therein, (5) that there should be (c) time no longer: 
<p>
<p>(5) Neither time itself, nor the things that are in time: but that the world to come is at hand, which is altogether of eternity, and beyond all times. 
<p>
<p>(c) There shall never be any more time.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#007">Revelation 10:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">rev 10:7</A></FONT></span></p>But in the days of the (6) voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets. 
<p>
<p>(6) See (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#015">Rev 11:15</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#017">Rev 16:17</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#008">Revelation 10:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">rev 10:8</A></FONT></span></p>(7) And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again, and said, Go [and] take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth. 
<p>
<p>(7) The other part of this chapter concerning the particular calling of John to the receiving of the following prophecy, which is enjoined him, first by sign, in three verses, then in plain words in the last verse (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#009">Rev 10:9-11</A>). To the setting forth of the sign belong these things: That John is taught from heaven to ask for the book of the prophecy in this verse: for these motions and desires God inspires that asking for the book, he is charged to take it in a figurative manner, the use of which is expounded in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#009">Rev 10:9</A>) (as in) (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#009">Eze 2:9</A>) whence this similitude is borrowed: lastly that John at the commandment of Christ took the book, and found by experience that the same as proceeding from Christ, was most sweet, but in that it foretells the afflictions of the Church, it was most bitter to his spirit.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#011">Revelation 10:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">rev 10:11</A></FONT></span></p>(8) And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings. 
<p>
<p>(8) A simple and plain declaration of the sign before, witnessing the divine calling of John, and laying on him the necessity of it.
