<p>
<p>(a) He prophecies of the full restoration of the Church both of the Jews and Gentiles under Christ, which will be fully accomplished at the last day: although as yet it is compared to a desert and wilderness.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#002">Isaiah 35:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">isa 35:2</A></FONT></span></p>It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing: the glory of Lebanon shall be given to it, the excellence of (b) Carmel and Sharon, they shall (c) see the glory of the LORD, [and] the excellence of our God. 
<p>
<p>(b) The Church which was before compared to a barren wilderness will by Christ be made most plenteous and beautiful. 
<p>
<p>(c) He shows that the presence of God is the reason that the Church brings forth fruit and flourishes.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#003">Isaiah 35:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">isa 35:3</A></FONT></span></p>(d) Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees. 
<p>
<p>(d) He wills all to encourage one another, and especially the ministers to exhort and strengthen the weak, that they may patiently abide the coming of God, which is at hand.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#004">Isaiah 35:4</A></p>

<p>
<p>(e) To destroy your enemies.

<p>
<p>(g) They who were barren and destitute of the graces of God, will have them given by Christ.

<p>
<p>(h) It will be for the saints of God and not for the wicked. 
<p>
<p>(i) God will lead and guide them, alluding to the bringing forth of Egypt.
