### [Genesis Chapter 48](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#001)

[Genesis 48:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 48:1</span></span>

And it came to pass after these things, that \[one\] told Joseph,
Behold, thy father \[is\] sick: and he took with him his (a) two sons,
Manasseh and Ephraim.

\(a\) Joseph valued his children being received into Jacob's family,
which was the Church of God, more than enjoying all the treasures of
Egypt.

[Genesis 48:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 48:4</span></span>

And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee,
and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land
to thy seed after thee \[for\] an (b) everlasting possession.

\(b\) Which is true in the carnal Israel until the coming of Christ, and
in the spiritual forever.

[Genesis 48:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 48:9</span></span>

And Joseph said unto his father, They \[are\] my sons, whom (c) God hath
given me in this \[place\]. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto
me, and I will bless them.

\(c\) The faithful acknowledge all benefits come from God's free mercy.

[Genesis 48:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gen 48:14</span></span>

And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid \[it\] upon (d)
Ephraim's head, who \[was\] the younger, and his left hand upon
Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh \[was\] the
firstborn.

\(d\) God's judgments are often contrary to man's and he prefers what
man despises.

[Genesis 48:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gen 48:16</span></span>

The (e) Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let
my (f) name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and
Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.

\(e\) This angel must be understood to be Christ, as in ([Gen
31:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#013), [Gen
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#001)).

\(f\) Let them be taken as my children.

[Genesis 48:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">gen 48:17</span></span>

And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of
Ephraim, it (g) displeased him: and he held up his father's hand, to
remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head.

\(g\) Joseph fails by binding God's grace to the order of nature.

[Genesis 48:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">gen 48:20</span></span>

And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless,
saying, God make thee as (h) Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim
before Manasseh.

\(h\) In whom God's graces should manifestly appear.

[Genesis 48:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">gen 48:21</span></span>

And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you,
and bring you again unto the land of (i) your fathers.

\(i\) Which they had by faith in the promise.

[Genesis 48:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">gen 48:22</span></span>

Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which (k)
I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.

\(k\) By my children whom God spared for my sake.
