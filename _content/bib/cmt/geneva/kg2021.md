<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg2 21:6</span></span>

And he made his son (a) pass through the fire, and observed times, and
used enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards: he

anger.

\(a\) Read ([Kg2 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#003)).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 21:8</span></span>

Neither will I make the feet of Israel move any more out of the land
which I gave their fathers; only if they will (b) observe to do
according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the
law that my servant Moses commanded them.

\(b\) Therefore seeing they did not obey the commandment of God, they
were justly cast from the land which they had only on condition.

Therefore thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Behold, I \[am\] bringing
\[such\] evil upon Jerusalem and Judah, that whosoever heareth of it,
both his ears shall (c) tingle.

\(c\) Meaning, that whoever hears of this great plague, will be
astonished.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg2 21:13</span></span>

And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line (d) of Samaria, and the
plummet of the house of Ahab: and I will wipe Jerusalem as \[a man\]
wipeth a dish, wiping \[it\], and turning \[it\] upside down.

\(d\) As I have destroyed Samaria and the house of Ahab so will I
destroy Judah.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg2 21:14</span></span>

And I will forsake the (e) remnant of mine inheritance, and deliver them
into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become a prey and a spoil
to all their enemies;

\(e\) Meaning, Judah and Benjamin, which were the only ones left of the
rest of the tribes.

Moreover Manasseh shed (s) innocent blood very much, till he had filled
Jerusalem from one end to another; beside his sin wherewith he made
Judah to sin, in doing \[that which was\] evil in the sight of the LORD.

\(s\) The Hebrews write that he slew Isaiah the prophet, who was his
father-in-law.

way of the LORD.
