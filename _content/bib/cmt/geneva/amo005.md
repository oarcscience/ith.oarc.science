### [Amos Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#001)

[Amos 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">amo 5:2</span></span>

The (a) virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise: she is
forsaken upon her land; \[there is\] none to raise her up.

\(a\) He so calls them, because they so boasted of themselves, or
because they were given to lustfulness and daintiness.

[Amos 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">amo 5:3</span></span>

For thus saith the Lord GOD; The city that went out \[by\] a thousand
shall leave (b) an hundred, and that which went forth \[by\] an hundred
shall leave ten, to the house of Israel.

\(b\) Meaning, that the tenth part would hardly be saved.

[Amos 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">amo 5:5</span></span>

But seek not Bethel, nor enter into (c) Gilgal, and pass not to
Beersheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Bethel shall
come to nought.

\(c\) In those places they worshipped new idols, which before served for
the true honour of God: therefore he says that these will not save them.

[Amos 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">amo 5:7</span></span>

Ye who turn (d) judgment to wormwood, and leave off righteousness in the
earth,

\(d\) Instead of judgment and fairness they execute cruelty and
oppression.

[Amos 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">amo 5:8</span></span>

\[Seek him\] that (e) maketh the seven stars and Orion, and turneth the
shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark with night:
that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the
face of the earth: The LORD \[is\] his name:

\(e\) He describes the power of God; ([Job
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#009)).

[Amos 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">amo 5:10</span></span>

They hate him (f) that rebuketh in the gate, and they abhor him that
speaketh uprightly.

\(f\) They hate the Prophets, who reprove them in the open assemblies.

[Amos 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">amo 5:11</span></span>

Forasmuch therefore as your treading \[is\] upon the poor, and (g) ye
take from him burdens of wheat: ye have built houses of hewn stone, but
ye shall not dwell in them; ye have planted pleasant vineyards, but ye
shall not drink wine of them.

\(g\) You take both his money and also his food, with which he should
live.

[Amos 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">amo 5:13</span></span>

Therefore (h) the prudent shall keep silence in that time; for it \[is\]
an evil time.

\(h\) God will so plague them that they will not allow the godly to open
their mouths once to admonish them of their faults.

[Amos 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">amo 5:16</span></span>

Therefore the LORD, the God of hosts, the Lord, saith thus; Wailing
\[shall be\] in all streets; and they shall say in all the highways,
Alas! alas! and they shall call the (i) husbandman to mourning, and such
as are skilful of lamentation to wailing.

\(i\) So that people of all types will have reason to lament because of
the great plagues.

[Amos 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">amo 5:18</span></span>

Woe unto you that (k) desire the day of the LORD! to what end \[is\] it
for you? the day of the LORD \[is\] darkness, and not light.

\(k\) He speaks in this way because the wicked and hypocrites said they
were content to endure God's judgments, whereas the godly tremble and
fear; ([Jer 30:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#007); [Joe
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#002), [Joe
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#011)), ([Zep
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#015)).

[Amos 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">amo 5:22</span></span>

Though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, (l) I will
not accept \[them\]: neither will I regard the peace offerings of your
fat beasts.

\(l\) Because you have corrupted my true service, and remain obstinate
in your vices; ([Isa 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#011); [Jer
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#010)).

[Amos 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">amo 5:24</span></span>

But let judgment run down as (m) waters, and righteousness as a mighty
stream.

\(m\) Do your duty to God, and to your neighbour, and so you will
plentifully feel his grace, if you show your abundant affections
according to God's word.

[Amos 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">amo 5:26</span></span>

But ye have borne the tabernacle of your (n) Moloch and Chiun your
images, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves.

\(n\) That idol which you esteemed as your king, and carried about as
you did Chiun, in which images you thought that there was a certain
divinity.
