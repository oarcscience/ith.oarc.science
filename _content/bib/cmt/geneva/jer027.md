### [Jeremiah Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 27:1</span></span>

In the beginning of the reign of (a) Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of
Judah came this word to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,

\(a\) Concerning the disposition of these prophecies, they who gathered
them into a book, did not altogether observe the order of times, but saw
some before, which should be after, and contrary wise which if the
reader mark well it will avoid many doubts and make the reading much
easier.

[Jeremiah 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 27:2</span></span>

Thus saith the LORD to me; Make for thee (b) bonds and yokes, and put
them upon thy neck,

\(b\) By such signs the prophets used sometimes to confirm their
prophecies which they could not do of themselves but in as much as they
had a revelation for the same, ([Isa
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#002)) and therefore the false prophets
to get more credit, used also such visible signs but they had no
revelation, ([Kg1 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#012)).

[Jeremiah 27:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 27:6</span></span>

And now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the
king of Babylon, my (c) servant; and the beasts of the field have I
given him also to serve him.

\(c\) Read ([Jer 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#009)).

[Jeremiah 27:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 27:7</span></span>

And all nations shall serve him, and his (d) son, and his son's son,
until the very time of his land shall come: and then many nations and
great kings shall (e) bring him into subjection.

\(d\) Meaning, Evilmerodach and his son Belshazzar.

\(e\) They will bring him and his kingdom in subjection as in ([Jer
25:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#014)).

[Jeremiah 27:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 27:16</span></span>

Also I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus saith
the LORD; Hearken not to the words of your prophets that prophesy to
you, saying, Behold, the vessels of the LORD'S house shall now shortly
be (f) brought again from Babylon: for they prophesy a lie to you.

\(f\) Which were taken when Jeconiah was led captive into Babel.

[Jeremiah 27:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 27:18</span></span>

But if they are prophets, and if the word of the LORD is with them, let
them now (g) make intercession to the LORD of hosts, that the vessels
which are left in the house of the LORD, and \[in\] the house of the
king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, go not to Babylon.

\(g\) For it was not only the prophet's office to show the word of God,
but also to pray for the sins of the people, ([Gen
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#007)) which these could not do because
they had no express word: for God had pronounced the contrary.

[Jeremiah 27:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 27:22</span></span>

They shall be carried to Babylon, and there shall they be until the day
that I visit (h) them, saith the LORD; then will I bring them up, and
restore them to this place.

\(h\) That is, for the space of seventy years till I have caused the
Medes and Persians to overcome the Chaldeans.
