### [Isaiah Chapter 50](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#001)

[Isaiah 50:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 50:1</span></span>

Thus saith the LORD, Where \[is\] the (a) bill of your mother's
divorcement, (b) whom I have put away? or which of my creditors \[is
it\] (c) to whom I have sold you? Behold, for your iniquities have ye
sold yourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother put away.

\(a\) Meaning, that he has not forsaken her, but through her own
opportunity as in ([Hos 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#002)).

\(b\) Who would declare that I have cut her off: meaning, that they
could show no one.

\(c\) Signifying, that he sold them not for any debt or poverty, but
that they sold themselves to sins to buy their own lusts and pleasures.

[Isaiah 50:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 50:2</span></span>

\(d\) Why, when I came, \[was there\] no man? when I called, \[was
there\] none to answer? Is my hand (e) shortened at all, that it cannot
redeem? or have I no power to deliver? behold, at my rebuke I dry up the
sea, I make the rivers a wilderness: their fish smelleth rotten, because
\[there is\] no water, and dieth for thirst.

\(d\) He came by his prophets and ministers, but they would not believe
their doctrine and convert.

\(e\) Am I not able to help you, as I have helped your fathers of old,
when I dried up the Red sea, and killed the fish in the rivers, and also
afterward in Jordan?

[Isaiah 50:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 50:3</span></span>

I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make (f) sackcloth their
covering.

\(f\) As I did in Egypt in token of my displeasure, ([Exo
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#021)).

[Isaiah 50:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 50:4</span></span>

The Lord GOD hath given (g) me the tongue of the learned, that I should
know how to speak a word in season to \[him that is\] (h) weary: he
awakeneth morning by morning, he awakeneth my ear to hear (i) as the
learned.

\(g\) The prophet represents here the person and charge of them that are
justly called to the ministry by God's word.

\(h\) To him that is oppressed by affliction and misery.

\(i\) As they who are taught, and made meet by him.

[Isaiah 50:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 50:6</span></span>

I gave my back to the (k) smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked
off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and spitting.

\(k\) I did not shrink from God for any persecution or calamity. By
which he shows that the true ministers of God can look for no other
recompense of the wicked, but after this sort, and also that is their
comfort.

[Isaiah 50:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 50:10</span></span>

\(l\) Who \[is\] among you that feareth the LORD, that obeyeth the voice
of his servant, that walketh \[in\] darkness, and hath no light? let him
trust in the name of the LORD, and rely upon his God.

\(l\) Showing that it is a rare thing that any should obey correctly
God's true ministers, though they labour to bring them from hell to
heaven.

[Isaiah 50:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 50:11</span></span>

Behold, all ye that kindle (m) a fire, that surround \[yourselves\] with
sparks: walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks \[that\] ye
have kindled. This shall ye have of my hand; ye shall lie down in
sorrow.

\(m\) You have sought consolation by your own devises, and have refused
the light and consolation which God has offered: therefore you will
remain in sorrow and not be comforted.
