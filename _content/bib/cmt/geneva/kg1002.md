### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#001)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg1 2:2</span></span>

I go the (a) way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and shew
thyself a man;

\(a\) I am ready to die as all men must.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg1 2:3</span></span>

And keep the (b) charge of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, to
keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his
testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest
prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself:

\(b\) He shows how hard it is to govern and that no one can do it well
except he obey God.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg1 2:4</span></span>

That the LORD may continue his word which he spake concerning me,
saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in (c)
truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail
thee (said he) a man on the throne of Israel.

\(c\) Without hypocrisy.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg1 2:5</span></span>

Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me,
\[and\] what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto
Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew,
and (d) shed the blood of war in peace, and (e) put the blood of war
upon his girdle that \[was\] about his loins, and in his shoes that
\[were\] on his feet.

\(d\) He shed his blood in time of peace, as if there had been war.

\(e\) He put the bloody sword into his sheath.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg1 2:7</span></span>

But shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them
be of those that eat at thy table: (f) for so they came to me when I
fled because of Absalom thy brother.

\(f\) That is, they dealt mercifully with me.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg1 2:9</span></span>

Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou \[art\] a wise man, and
knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar head bring thou
down to the grave with (g) blood.

\(g\) Let him be punished with death, see ([Kg1
2:46](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#046)).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg1 2:13</span></span>

And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon.
And she said, (h) Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.

\(h\) For she was afraid lest he would work treason against the king.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg1 2:15</span></span>

And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and \[that\] all
Israel (i) set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the
kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother's: for it was his from
the LORD.

\(i\) In sign of their favour and consent.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg1 2:19</span></span>

Bathsheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for
Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and (k) bowed himself unto
her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the
king's mother; and she sat on his right hand.

\(k\) In token of reverence, and that others by his example might have
her in greater honour.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg1 2:22</span></span>

And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou
ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the (l) kingdom
also; for he \[is\] mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar
the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.

\(l\) Meaning, that if he would have granted Abishag, who was so dear to
his father, he would later have aspired for the kingdom.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg1 2:26</span></span>

And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth, unto
thine own fields; for thou \[art\] worthy of death: but I will not at
this time put thee to death, because thou (m) barest the ark of the Lord
GOD before David my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in all
wherein my father was afflicted.

\(m\) When he fled before Absalom, ([Sa2
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#024)).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">kg1 2:28</span></span>

Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had (n) turned after Adonijah,
though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of
the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.

\(n\) He took Adonijah's part when he would have usurped the kingdom
([Kg1 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#007)).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg1 2:29</span></span>

And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle of
the LORD; and, behold, \[he is\] by the (o) altar. Then Solomon sent
Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.

\(o\) Thinking to be saved by the holiness of the place.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">kg1 2:31</span></span>

And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and (p) fall upon him,
and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood, which Joab
shed, from me, and from the house of my father.

\(p\) For it was lawful to take the wilful murderer from the altar,
([Exo 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#014)).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">kg1 2:33</span></span>

Their blood shall therefore return upon the (q) head of Joab, and upon
the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon his seed, and
upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace for ever from
the LORD.

\(q\) Joab will be justly punished for the blood that he has cruelly
shed.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">kg1 2:35</span></span>

And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host:
and Zadok the (r) priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.

\(r\) And so took the office of high priest from the house of Eli, and
restored it to the house of Phinehas.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:39](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">kg1 2:39</span></span>

And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the (s)
servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath. And
they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants \[be\] in Gath.

\(s\) Thus God appoints the ways and means to bring his just judgments
on the wicked.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:40](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">kg1 2:40</span></span>

And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish to
seek his servants: and (t) Shimei went, and brought his servants from
Gath.

\(t\) His covetous mind moved him to risk his life, rather than to lose
the worldly profit he had by his servants.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:44](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">kg1 2:44</span></span>

The king said moreover to Shimei, (u) Thou knowest all the wickedness
which thine heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father:
therefore the LORD shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head;

\(u\) For though you would deny it, your own conscience accuses you for
reviling and doing wrong to my father, ([Sa2
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#005)).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:46](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#046)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">kg1 2:46</span></span>

So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went out, and
fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was (x) established in the
hand of Solomon.

\(x\) Because all his enemies were destroyed.
