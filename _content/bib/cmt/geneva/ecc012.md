[Ecclesiastes 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ecc 12:2</span></span>

While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, are not
darkened, nor the (a) clouds return after the rain:

\(a\) Before you come to a continual misery: for when the clouds remain
after the rain, man's grief is increased.

[Ecclesiastes 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ecc 12:3</span></span>

In the day when the (b) keepers of the house shall tremble, and the (c)
strong men shall bow themselves, and the (d) grinders cease because they
are few, and those that (e) look out of the windows shall be darkened,

\(b\) The hands which keep the body.

\(c\) The legs.

\(d\) The teeth.

\(e\) The eyes.

[Ecclesiastes 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ecc 12:4</span></span>

And the (f) doors shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of the
(g) grinding shall be low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the (h)
bird, and all the (i) daughters of music shall be brought low;

\(f\) The lips or mouth.

\(g\) When the jaws will scarce open and not be able to chew any more.

\(h\) He will not be able to sleep.

\(i\) That is the wind pipes or the ears will be deaf and not able to
hear singing.

[Ecclesiastes 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ecc 12:5</span></span>

Also \[when\] they shall be afraid of \[that which is\] (k) high, and
fears \[shall be\] in the (l) way, and the almond tree shall (m)
flourish, and the (n) grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall
fail: because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about the
streets:

\(k\) To climb high because of their weakness, or they stoop down as
though they were afraid lest anything should hide them.

\(l\) They will tremble as they go, as though they were afraid.

\(m\) Their head will be as white as the blossoms of an almond tree.

\(n\) They will be able to bear nothing.

[Ecclesiastes 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ecc 12:6</span></span>

Or ever the (o) silver cord shall be loosed, or the golden (p) bowl be
broken, or the (q) pitcher be broken at the (r) fountain, or the (s)
wheel broken at the (t) cistern.

\(o\) Meaning, the marrow of the backbone and the sinews.

\(p\) The little skin that covers the brain, which is in colour like
gold.

\(q\) That is, the veins.

\(r\) Meaning the liver.

\(s\) Which is the head.

\(t\) That is, the heart out of which the head draws the powers of life.

[Ecclesiastes 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ecc 12:7</span></span>

Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the (u) spirit
shall return to God who gave it.

\(u\) The soul unconsciously goes either to joy or torment, and sleeps
not as the wicked imagine.

[Ecclesiastes 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ecc 12:11</span></span>

The words of the wise \[are\] as goads, and as nails (x) fastened \[by\]
the masters of assemblies, \[which\] are given from one (y) shepherd.

\(x\) Which are well applied by the ministers, whom he calls masters.

\(y\) That is by God.

[Ecclesiastes 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ecc 12:12</span></span>

And further, by these, my son, be admonished: of making many (z) books
\[there is\] no end; and much study \[is\] a weariness of the flesh.

\(z\) These things cannot be comprehended in books or learned by study,
but God must instruct your heart that you may only know that wisdom is
the true happiness and the way to it is to fear God.
