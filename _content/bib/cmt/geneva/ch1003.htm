<p>
<p>(a) He returns to the genealogy of David, to show that Christ came from his stock. 
<p>
<p>(b) Who in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#003">Sa2 3:3</A>) is called Chileab, born of her that was Nabal's wife the Carmelite.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">ch1 3:5</A></FONT></span></p>And these were born unto him in Jerusalem; Shimea, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon, four, of (c) Bathshua the daughter of Ammiel: 
<p>
<p>(c) Called also Bathsheba the daughter of Eliam: for they gave them various names.

<p>(d) Elishama, or Elishua, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#015">Sa2 5:15</A>) and Eliphelet died, and David named those sons who were born next by the same names; in the book of kings his living children are mentioned and here both they that were alive and dead.

<p>
<p>(e) So called because he was preferred for the royal dignity before his brother Jehoiakim who was the elder.

<p>(f) Matthew says that Zerubbabel was the son of Shealtiel, meaning that he was his nephew according to the Hebrew speech: for he was Pedaiah's son.
