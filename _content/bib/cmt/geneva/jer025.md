### [Jeremiah Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 25:1</span></span>

The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the
(a) fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that
\[was\] the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon;

\(a\) That is, in the third year accomplished and in the beginning of
the fourth: for though Nebuchadnezzar began to reign in the end of the
third year of Jehoiakim's reign yet that year is not counted here
because it was almost over, ([Dan
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#001)).

[Jeremiah 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 25:3</span></span>

From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, even
to (b) this day, that \[is\] the three and twentieth year, the word of
the LORD hath come to me, and I have spoken to you, (c) rising early and
speaking; but ye have not hearkened.

\(b\) Which was the fifth year and the ninth month of Jehoiakim's reign.

\(c\) That is, I have spared no diligence or labour, ([Jer
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#013)).

[Jeremiah 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 25:5</span></span>

They (d) said, Turn ye again now every one from his evil way, and from
the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that the LORD hath given
to you and to your fathers for ever and ever:

\(d\) He shows that the prophets, wholly with one consent laboured to
pull the people from those vices, which then reigned, that is, from
idolatry and the vain confidence of men: for under these two all others
were contained, ([Kg2 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#013); [Jer
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#011), [Jer
35:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#015); [Jon
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#008)).

[Jeremiah 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 25:9</span></span>

Behold, I will send and take all the (e) families of the north, saith
the LORD, and Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my (f) servant, and
will bring them against this land, and against its inhabitants, and
against all these nations (g) around, and will utterly destroy them, and
make them an horror, and an hissing, and perpetual desolations.

\(e\) The Chaldeans and all their power.

\(f\) So the wicked and Satan himself are God's servants, because he
makes them serve him by constraint and turns that which they do out of
malice to his honour and glory.

\(g\) As the Philistines, Ammonites, Egyptians and others.

[Jeremiah 25:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 25:10</span></span>

Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth, and the voice of
gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the
sound of the (h) millstones, and the light of the candle.

\(h\) Meaning that bread and all things that would serve to their feasts
would be taken away.

[Jeremiah 25:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 25:12</span></span>

And it shall come to pass, when (i) seventy years are accomplished,
\[that\] I will punish (k) the king of Babylon, and that nation, saith
the LORD, for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans, and will
make it perpetual desolations.

\(i\) This revelation was for the confirmation of his prophecy because
he told them of the time that they would enter and remain in captivity,
([Ch2 36:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#022); [Ezr
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001); [Jer
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#010); [Dan
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#002)).

\(k\) For seeing the judgment began at his own house, the enemies must
be punished most grievously, ([Eze
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#006); [Pe1
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#017)).

[Jeremiah 25:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 25:14</span></span>

For many nations and great kings shall be (l) served by them also: and I
will recompense them according to their deeds, and according to the
works of their own hands.

\(l\) That is of the Babylonians as in ([Jer
27:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#007)).

[Jeremiah 25:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 25:15</span></span>

For thus saith the LORD God of Israel to me; (m) Take the wine cup of
this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send thee, to
drink it.

\(m\) Signifying the extreme affliction that God had appointed for
everyone, ([Psa 75:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#008); [Isa
51:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#017)) and this cup which the wicked
drink, is more bitter than that which he gives to his children, for he
measures the one by mercy, and the other by justice.

[Jeremiah 25:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 25:18</span></span>

\[That is\], Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, and her kings, and her
princes, to make them a desolation, an horror, an hissing, and a curse;
(n) as \[it is\] this day;

\(n\) For now it begins and will so continue till it is accomplished.

[Jeremiah 25:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 25:20</span></span>

And all the mixed people, and all the kings of the land (o) of Uz, and
all the kings of the land of the Philistines, and (p) Ashkelon, and
Azzah, and Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod,

\(o\) Read ([Job 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001)).

\(p\) Which were cities of the Philistines.

[Jeremiah 25:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 25:21</span></span>

\(q\) Edom, and Moab, and the children of Ammon,

\(q\) Edom is here taken for the whole country and Uz for a part of it.

[Jeremiah 25:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 25:22</span></span>

And all the kings of Tyre, and all the kings of Zidon, and the kings of
the (r) isles which \[are\] beyond the sea,

\(r\) As Greece, Italy and the rest of those countries.

[Jeremiah 25:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 25:23</span></span>

\(s\) Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all \[that are\] in the utmost
corners,

\(s\) These were people of Arabia which came of Dedan the son of Abraham
and Keturah.

[Jeremiah 25:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jer 25:24</span></span>

And all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the mixed people that
dwell in the (t) desert,

\(t\) For there were two countries so named, the one called plentiful
and the other barren, or desert.

[Jeremiah 25:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jer 25:26</span></span>

And all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another, and all
the kingdoms of the world, which \[are\] upon the face of the earth: and
the king of (u) Sheshach shall drink after them.

\(u\) That is of Babylon, as in ([Jer
51:41](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#041)).

[Jeremiah 25:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jer 25:29</span></span>

For, lo, (x) I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my
name, and should ye be utterly unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished:
for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, saith
the LORD of hosts.

\(x\) That is Jerusalem, read ([Jer
25:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#012)).

[Jeremiah 25:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">jer 25:33</span></span>

And (y) the slain of the LORD shall be at that day from \[one\] end of
the earth even to the \[other\] end of the earth: they shall not be
lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be refuse upon the
ground.

\(y\) They who are slain at the Lord's appointment.

[Jeremiah 25:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">jer 25:34</span></span>

Howl, (z) ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves \[in the ashes\],
ye chief of the flock: for the days of your slaughter and of your
dispersions are accomplished; and ye shall fall like a (a) pleasant
vessel.

\(z\) You that are chief rulers, and governors.

\(a\) Which are most easily broken.

[Jeremiah 25:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">jer 25:35</span></span>

And the (b) shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the chief of the
flock to escape.

\(b\) It will not help them to seek to flee.
