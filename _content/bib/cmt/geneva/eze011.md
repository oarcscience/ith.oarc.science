### [Ezekiel Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#001)

[Ezekiel 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 11:3</span></span>

Who say, (a) \[It is\] not near; let us build houses: this \[city is\]
the (b) caldron, and we \[are\] the flesh.

\(a\) Thus the wicked derided the prophets as though they preached only
errors, and therefore gave themselves still to their pleasures.

\(b\) We will not be pulled out of Jerusalem, till the hour of our death
comes, as the flesh is not taken out of the caldron until it is boiled.

[Ezekiel 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 11:7</span></span>

Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Your slain whom ye have laid in the
midst of it, they \[are\] (c) the flesh, and this \[city is\] the
caldron: but I will bring you forth out of the midst of it.

\(c\) Contrary to their vain confidence he shows in what sense the city
is the caldron: that is, because of the dead bodies that have been
murdered in it, and so lit as flesh in the caldron.

[Ezekiel 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 11:9</span></span>

And I will bring you out of the midst of it, and deliver you into (d)
the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you.

\(d\) That is, of the Chaldeans.

[Ezekiel 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 11:10</span></span>

Ye shall fall by the sword; I will judge you in the border of (e)
Israel; and ye shall know that I \[am\] the LORD.

\(e\) That is, in Riblah, read ([Kg2
25:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#006)).

[Ezekiel 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 11:13</span></span>

And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of (f)
Benaiah died. Then I fell down upon my face, and cried with a loud
voice, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant
of Israel?

\(f\) It seems that this noble man died of some terrible death, and
therefore the prophet feared some strange judgment of God toward the
rest of the people.

[Ezekiel 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 11:15</span></span>

Son of man, thy (g) brethren, \[even\] thy brethren, the men of thy
kindred, and all the house of Israel wholly, \[are\] they to whom the
inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Retire far from the LORD: to us is
this land given in possession.

\(g\) They that remained at Jerusalem thus reproached them that were
gone into captivity as though they were cast off and forsaken by God.

[Ezekiel 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 11:16</span></span>

Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Although I have cast them far
off among the nations, and although I have scattered them among the
countries, yet will I be to them as a little (h) sanctuary in the
countries where they shall come.

\(h\) They will be yet a little church: showing that the Lord will ever
have some to call on his Name, whom he will preserve and restore, though
they are for a time afflicted.

[Ezekiel 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eze 11:19</span></span>

And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you;
and I will take the (i) stony heart out of their flesh, and will give
them an heart of flesh:

\(i\) Meaning, the heart to which nothing can enter and regenerate them
anew, so that their heart may be soft and ready to receive my graces.

[Ezekiel 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">eze 11:25</span></span>

Then I spoke to them of the (k) captivity all the things that the LORD
had shown me.

\(k\) When Jeconiah was led away captive.
