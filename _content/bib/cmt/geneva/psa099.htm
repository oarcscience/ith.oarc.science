<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#001">Psalms 99:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">psa 99:1</A></FONT></span></p>The LORD reigneth; let the (a) people tremble: he sitteth [between] the cherubims; let the earth be moved. 
<p>
<p>(a) When God delivers his Church all the enemies will have reason to tremble.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#003">Psalms 99:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">psa 99:3</A></FONT></span></p>Let them (b) praise thy great and terrible name; [for] it [is] holy. 
<p>
<p>(b) Though the wicked rage against God, the godly will praise his Name and mighty power.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#005">Psalms 99:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">psa 99:5</A></FONT></span></p>Exalt ye the LORD our God, and worship at his (c) footstool; [for] he [is] holy. 
<p>
<p>(c) That is, before his temple or ark, where he promised to hear when they worshipped him, as now he promises his spiritual presence, wherever his Church is assembled.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#006">Psalms 99:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">psa 99:6</A></FONT></span></p>Moses and Aaron among his priests, (d) and Samuel among them that call upon his name; they called upon the LORD, and he answered them. 
<p>
<p>(d) Under these three he comprehends the whole people of Israel, with whom God made his promise.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#008">Psalms 99:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">psa 99:8</A></FONT></span></p>Thou answeredst them, O LORD our God: thou wast a God that forgavest them, though thou tookest vengeance of (e) their inventions. 
<p>
<p>(e) The more liberally God deals with his people, the more he punishes them who abuse his benefits.
