<p>
<p>(a) Who subscribed to keep the promise.

<p>
<p>(b) Read (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#043">Ezr 2:43</A>). 
<p>
<p>(c) Who being idolaters forsook their wickedness and gave themselves to serve God.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#029">Nehemiah 10:29</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_029">neh 10:29</A></FONT></span></p>They (d) clave to their brethren, their nobles, and entered into a (e) curse, and into an oath, to walk in God's law, which was given by Moses the servant of God, and to observe and do all the commandments of the LORD our Lord, and his judgments and his statutes; 
<p>
<p>(d) They made the oath in the name of the whole multitude. 
<p>
<p>(e) To which they gave themselves if they broke the law, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#015">Deu 28:15</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#031">Nehemiah 10:31</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_031">neh 10:31</A></FONT></span></p>And [if] the people of the land bring ware or any victuals on the sabbath day to sell, (f) [that] we would not buy it of them on the sabbath, or on the holy day: and [that] we would leave the seventh year, and the exaction of every debt. 
<p>
<p>(f) Which nonetheless they broke soon after, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#015">Neh 13:15</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#033">Nehemiah 10:33</A></p>

<p>
<p>(g) This states why they gave this third part of the shekel which was beyond the half shekel that they were required to pay, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#013">Exo 30:13</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#036">Nehemiah 10:36</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_036">neh 10:36</A></FONT></span></p>Also the firstborn of our sons, and of our cattle, as [it is] (h) written in the law, and the firstlings of our herds and of our flocks, to bring to the house of our God, unto the priests that minister in the house of our God: 
<p>
<p>(h) This rehearsal shows that there was no part or ceremony in the Law, to which they did not bind themselves by covenant.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#037">Nehemiah 10:37</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_037">neh 10:37</A></FONT></span></p>And [that] we should bring the firstfruits of our dough, and our offerings, and the fruit of all manner of trees, of wine and of oil, unto the priests, to the chambers of the house of our God; and the tithes of our ground unto the Levites, that the same Levites might have the tithes in all the cities of our (i) tillage. 
<p>
<p>(i) Wherever we laboured or worked, there the tithes were due to the Lord both by the law, and according to the oath and covenant that we made.

<p>
<p>(k) We will not leave it destitute of that which is needed for it.
