<p>
<p>(a) Because they might declare them to the Israelites.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#004">Numbers 30:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">num 30:4</A></FONT></span></p>And her father hear her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her father shall hold his (b) peace at her: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand. 
<p>
<p>(b) For in so doing he approves her.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#005">Numbers 30:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">num 30:5</A></FONT></span></p>But if her (c) father disallow her in the day that he heareth; not any of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand: and the LORD shall forgive her, because her father disallowed her. 
<p>
<p>(c) By not approving or consenting to her vow.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">num 30:6</A></FONT></span></p>And if she had at all an husband, when she vowed, or (d) uttered ought out of her lips, wherewith she bound her soul; 
<p>
<p>(d) Either by oath, or solemn promise.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#008">Numbers 30:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">num 30:8</A></FONT></span></p>But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard [it]; then he shall make her vow which she vowed, and that which she uttered with her lips, wherewith she bound her (e) soul, of none effect: and the LORD shall forgive her. 
<p>
<p>(e) For she is in subjection to her husband, and can perform nothing without his consent.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">num 30:9</A></FONT></span></p>But every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced, wherewith they have bound their souls, shall stand (f) against her. 
<p>
<p>(f) For they are not under the authority of the man.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">num 30:10</A></FONT></span></p>And if she vowed in her husband's (h) house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath; 
<p>
<p>(h) Her husband being alive.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#013">Numbers 30:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">num 30:13</A></FONT></span></p>Every vow, and every binding oath to (h) afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void. 
<p>
<p>(h) To mortify herself by abstinence or other bodily exercise.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#014">Numbers 30:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">num 30:14</A></FONT></span></p>But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from (i) day to day; then he establisheth all her vows, or all her bonds, which [are] upon her: he confirmeth them, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard [them]. 
<p>
<p>(i) And warn her not the same day that he hears it, as in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#008">Num 30:8</A>).

<p>
<p>(k) Not the same day he heard them, but some day after, the sin will be imputed to him and not to her.
