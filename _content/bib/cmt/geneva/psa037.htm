<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#001">Psalms 37:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">psa 37:1</A></FONT></span></p>"[A Psalm] of David." Fret not (a) thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity. 
<p>
<p>(a) He admonishes us neither to vex ourselves for the prosperous estate of the wicked, or to desire to be like them to make our estate better.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#002">Psalms 37:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">psa 37:2</A></FONT></span></p>For they shall soon be (b) cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb. 
<p>
<p>(b) For God's judgment cuts down their state in a moment.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#003">Psalms 37:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">psa 37:3</A></FONT></span></p>(c) Trust in the LORD, and do good; [so] shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed. 
<p>
<p>(c) To trust in God and do according to his will are sure signs that his providence will never fail us.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#005">Psalms 37:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">psa 37:5</A></FONT></span></p>(d) Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall bring [it] to pass. 
<p>
<p>(d) Do not be led by your own wisdom, but obey God and he will finish his work in you.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#006">Psalms 37:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">psa 37:6</A></FONT></span></p>And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy (e) judgment as the noonday. 
<p>
<p>(e) As the hope of daylight causes us not to be offended with the darkness of the night so ought we patiently to trust that God will clear our cause and restore us to our right.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#007">Psalms 37:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">psa 37:7</A></FONT></span></p>Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him (f) who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass. 
<p>
<p>(f) When God allows the wicked to prosper, it seems to the flesh that he favours their doings, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#007">Job 21:7</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#008">Psalms 37:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">psa 37:8</A></FONT></span></p>Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: (g) fret not thyself in any wise to do evil. 
<p>
<p>(g) Meaning, unless he moderates his affection, he will be led to do as they do.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#010">Psalms 37:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">psa 37:10</A></FONT></span></p>(h) For yet a little while, and the wicked [shall] not [be]: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it [shall] not [be]. 
<p>
<p>(y) He corrects the impatience of our nature, which cannot abide till the fulness of God's time is come.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#012">Psalms 37:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">psa 37:12</A></FONT></span></p>(i) The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth. 
<p>
<p>(i) The godly are assured that the power and craft of the wicked will not prevail against them, but fall on their own necks and therefore should patiently abide God's time, and in the meanwhile bewail their sins, and offer up their tears as a sacrifice of their obedience.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#016">Psalms 37:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">psa 37:16</A></FONT></span></p>(k) A little that a righteous man hath [is] better than the riches of many wicked. 
<p>
<p>(k) For they are daily fed as with manna from heaven and have sufficient, while the wicked never have enough, but always hunger.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#018">Psalms 37:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">psa 37:18</A></FONT></span></p>The LORD (l) knoweth the days of the upright: and their inheritance shall be for ever. 
<p>
<p>(l) God knows what dangers hang over his, and by what means to deliver them.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#019">Psalms 37:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">psa 37:19</A></FONT></span></p>They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of famine they shall (m) be satisfied. 
<p>
<p>(m) For God will give them contented minds, and that which will be necessary.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#020">Psalms 37:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">psa 37:20</A></FONT></span></p>But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD [shall be] as the (n) fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away. 
<p>
<p>(n) They will vanish away suddenly for they are fed for the day of slaughter.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#021">Psalms 37:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">psa 37:21</A></FONT></span></p>The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous sheweth mercy, and (o) giveth. 
<p>
<p>(o) God so furnishes him with high blessings, that he is able to help others.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#023">Psalms 37:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">psa 37:23</A></FONT></span></p>(p) The steps of a [good] man are ordered by the LORD: and he delighteth in his way. 
<p>
<p>(p) God prospers the faithful because they walk in his ways with an upright conscience.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#024">Psalms 37:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">psa 37:24</A></FONT></span></p>Though he (q) fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the LORD upholdeth [him with] his hand. 
<p>
<p>(q) When God exercises his faith with various temptations.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#025">Psalms 37:25</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_025">psa 37:25</A></FONT></span></p>I have been young, and [now] am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his (r) seed begging bread. 
<p>
<p>(r) Though the just man die, yet God's blessings are extended to his posterity and though God suffer some just man to lack temporal benefits, yet he recompenses him with spiritual treasures.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#029">Psalms 37:29</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_029">psa 37:29</A></FONT></span></p>The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein (s) for ever. 
<p>
<p>(s) They will continually be preserved under God's wings, and have at least inward rest.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#030">Psalms 37:30</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_030">psa 37:30</A></FONT></span></p>The (t) mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue talketh of judgment. 
<p>
<p>(t) These three points are required from the faithful, that their talk is godly, that God's law is in their heart, and that their life is upright.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#033">Psalms 37:33</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_033">psa 37:33</A></FONT></span></p>The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is (u) judged. 
<p>
<p>(u) For though it is sometimes so expedient both for God's glory and their salvation, yet he will approve their cause and avenge their wrong.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#036">Psalms 37:36</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_036">psa 37:36</A></FONT></span></p>Yet he (x) passed away, and, lo, he [was] not: yea, I sought him, but he could not be found. 
<p>
<p>(x) So that the prosperity of the wicked is but as a cloud, which vanishes away in a moment.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#037">Psalms 37:37</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_037">psa 37:37</A></FONT></span></p>(y) Mark the perfect [man], and behold the upright: for the end of [that] man [is] peace. 
<p>
<p>(y) He exhorts the faithful to mark diligently the examples both of God's mercies, and also of his judgments.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#039">Psalms 37:39</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_039">psa 37:39</A></FONT></span></p>But the (z) salvation of the righteous [is] of the LORD: [he is] their strength in the time of trouble. 
<p>
<p>(z) He shows that the patient hope of the godly is never in vain, but in the end has good success, though for a time God proves them by various temptations.
