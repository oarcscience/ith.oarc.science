<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#001">Jeremiah 15:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">jer 15:1</A></FONT></span></p>Then said the LORD to me, (a) Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, [yet] my mind [could] not [be] toward this people: cast [them] out of my sight, and let them go forth. 
<p>
<p>(a) Meaning that if there were any man living moved with so great zeal toward the people as were these two, yet he would not grant this request, as he had determined the contrary, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#014">Eze 14:14</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#003">Jeremiah 15:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">jer 15:3</A></FONT></span></p>And I will appoint over them four kinds, saith the LORD: the sword to slay, and the (b) dogs to tear, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the earth, to devour and destroy. 
<p>
<p>(b) The dogs, birds and beasts would devour them that were slain.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#004">Jeremiah 15:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">jer 15:4</A></FONT></span></p>And I will (c) cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the earth, (d) because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah king of Judah, for [that] which he did in Jerusalem. 
<p>
<p>(c) The word signifies to run to and fro for fear and unquietness of conscience as Cain did. 
<p>
<p>(d) Not that the people were punished for the king's sin only, but for their own sins also, because they consented to his wickedness.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#006">Jeremiah 15:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">jer 15:6</A></FONT></span></p>Thou hast forsaken me, saith the LORD, thou art gone backward: therefore will I stretch out my hand against thee, and destroy thee; I am (e) weary with repenting. 
<p>
<p>(e) That is, I will not call back my plagues or spare you any more.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#007">Jeremiah 15:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">jer 15:7</A></FONT></span></p>And I will fan them with a fan (f) in the gates of the land; I will bereave [them] of children, I will destroy my people, [since] they return not from their ways. 
<p>
<p>(f) Meaning, the cities.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#008">Jeremiah 15:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">jer 15:8</A></FONT></span></p>Their widows (g) are multiplied to me above the sand of the seas: I have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a spoiler at noonday: I have caused [him] to fall upon it suddenly, and terrors upon the city. 
<p>
<p>(g) Because I had slain their husbands.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#009">Jeremiah 15:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">jer 15:9</A></FONT></span></p>She that hath borne (h) seven languisheth: she hath breathed her last; her sun is (i) gone down while [it was] yet day: she hath been ashamed and confounded: and the remnant of them will I deliver to the sword before their enemies, saith the LORD. 
<p>
<p>(h) She who had many lost all her children. 
<p>
<p>(i) She was destroyed in the midst of her prosperity.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#010">Jeremiah 15:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">jer 15:10</A></FONT></span></p>(k) Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have neither (l) lent on interest, nor have men lent to me on interest; [yet] every one of them doth curse me. 
<p>
<p>(k) By these are the prophet's words, complaining of the obstinacy of the people and that he was reserved to so wicked a time: in which also he shows what is the condition of God's ministers, that is, to have all the world against them, though they give no opportunity. 
<p>
<p>(l) Which is an opportunity for contention and hatred.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#011">Jeremiah 15:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">jer 15:11</A></FONT></span></p>The LORD said, (m) Verily it shall be well with thy remnant; verily I will cause the enemy to entreat thee [well] in the time of evil and in the time of affliction. 
<p>
<p>(m) In this perplexity the Lord comforted me, and said that my last days would be quiet: and by the enemy he means here Nebuzaradan the captain of Nebuchadnezzar, who gave Jeremiah the choice either to remain in his country or to go where he would; or by the enemy he means the Jews, who would later know Jeremiah's faithfulness, and therefore favour him.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#012">Jeremiah 15:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">jer 15:12</A></FONT></span></p>Shall (n) iron break the northern iron and the steel? 
<p>
<p>(n) As for the people, though they seemed strong as iron, yet they would not be able to resist the hard iron of Babylon, but would be led captives.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#015">Jeremiah 15:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">jer 15:15</A></FONT></span></p>O LORD, thou knowest: remember me, and visit me, and avenge me of my (o) persecutors; take me not away in thy longsuffering: know that for thy sake I have suffered rebuke. 
<p>
<p>(o) He does not speak this out of a desire for revenge, but wishing that God would deliver his Church from them who he knew to be hardened and incorrigible.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#016">Jeremiah 15:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">jer 15:16</A></FONT></span></p>Thy words were found, and I (p) ate them; and thy word was to me the joy and rejoicing of my heart: for I am called by thy name, O LORD God of hosts. 
<p>
<p>(p) I received them with a great joy, as he that is famished eats meat.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#017">Jeremiah 15:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">jer 15:17</A></FONT></span></p>I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, nor rejoiced; I sat alone (q) because of thy hand: for thou hast filled me with indignation. 
<p>
<p>(q) I had nothing to do with the wicked contemners of your word, but lamented bitterly for your plagues: showing what the faithful should do when they see tokens of God's anger.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#018">Jeremiah 15:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">jer 15:18</A></FONT></span></p>Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, [which] refuseth to be healed? wilt thou be altogether to me (r) as a liar, [and as] waters [that] fail? 
<p>
<p>(r) And have not assisted me according to the promise? In which it appears that in the saints of God is imperfection of faith, which through impatience is often assailed as in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#007">Jer 20:7</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#019">Jeremiah 15:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">jer 15:19</A></FONT></span></p>Therefore thus saith the LORD, If thou shalt (s) return, then will I bring thee again, [and] thou shalt stand before me: and if thou shalt separate the (t) precious from the vile, thou shalt be (u) as my mouth: let them return (x) to thee; but return not thou to them. 
<p>
<p>(s) If you forget these carnal considerations and faithfully execute your charge. 
<p>
<p>(t) That is, seek to win the good from the bad. 
<p>
<p>(u) That is, as my mouth has pronounced, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#018">Jer 1:18</A>) and as here follows in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#020">Jer 15:20</A>). 
<p>
<p>(x) Do not conform yourself to their wickedness, but let them follow your godly example.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#020">Jeremiah 15:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">jer 15:20</A></FONT></span></p>And I will make thee to this people a fortified brasen wall: and they shall fight against thee, but they shall not (y) prevail against thee: for I [am] with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, saith the LORD. 
<p>
<p>(y) I will teach you with an invincible strength and constancy, so that all the powers of the world will not overcome you.
