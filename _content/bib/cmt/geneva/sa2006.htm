<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#002">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">sa2 6:2</A></FONT></span></p>And David arose, and went with all the people that [were] with him from (a) Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, whose name is called by the name of the LORD of hosts that dwelleth [between] the cherubims. 
<p>
<p>(a) This was a city in Judah called also Kirjathjearim, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#009">Jos 15:9</A>). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#003">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">sa2 6:3</A></FONT></span></p>And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that [was] in (b) Gibeah: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drave the new cart. 
<p>
<p>(b) which was a high place in the city of Baale. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#005">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">sa2 6:5</A></FONT></span></p>And David and all the house of Israel (c) played before the LORD on all manner of [instruments made of] fir wood, even on harps, and on psalteries, and on timbrels, and on cornets, and on cymbals. 
<p>
<p>(c) Praised God, and sang Psalms. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#007">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">sa2 6:7</A></FONT></span></p>And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah; and God (d) smote him there for [his] error; and there he died by the ark of God. 
<p>
<p>(d) Here we see the danger it is to follow good intentions, or to do anything in God's service without his express word. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#010">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">sa2 6:10</A></FONT></span></p>So David would not remove the ark of the LORD unto him into the city of David: but David carried it aside into the house of Obededom (e) the Gittite. 
<p>
<p>(e) Who was a Levite, and had dwelt in Gittaim, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#021">Ch1 15:21</A>). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#012">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">sa2 6:12</A></FONT></span></p>And it was told king David, saying, The LORD hath blessed the house of Obededom, and all that [pertaineth] unto him, because of the ark of God. So David went and (f) brought up the ark of God from the house of Obededom into the city of David with gladness. 
<p>
<p>(f) Meaning, he caused the Levites to bear it according to the law. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#014">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">sa2 6:14</A></FONT></span></p>And David danced before the LORD with all [his] might; and David [was] girded with a linen (g) ephod. 
<p>
<p>(g) With a garment like the priest's garment. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#016">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">sa2 6:16</A></FONT></span></p>And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal Saul's daughter looked through a window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she (h) despised him in her heart. 
<p>
<p>(h) The worldlings are not able to comprehend the emotions that move the children of God to praise God in all kinds of ways. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#020">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">sa2 6:20</A></FONT></span></p>Then David returned to (i) bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel to day, who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself! 
<p>
<p>(i) That is, to pray for his house, as he had done for the people. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#021">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">sa2 6:21</A></FONT></span></p>And David said unto Michal, (k) [It was] before the LORD, which chose me before thy father, and before all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD, over Israel: therefore will I play before the LORD. 
<p>
<p>(k) It was for no worldly affection, but only for that zeal that I bore to God's glory. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#023">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">sa2 6:23</A></FONT></span></p>Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had (l) no child unto the day of her death. 
<p>
<p>(l) Which was a punishment because she mocked the servant of God.
