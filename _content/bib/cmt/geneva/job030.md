<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 30:1</span></span>

But now \[they that are\] younger than I (a) have me in derision, whose
fathers I would have disdained to have set with the (b) dogs of my
flock.

\(a\) That is, my estate is changed and while before the ancient men
were glad to revere me, the young men now contemn me.

\(b\) Meaning to be my shepherds or to keep my dogs.

Yea, whereto \[might\] the strength of their hands \[profit\] me, in
whom old age was (c) perished?

[Job 30:11](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 30:11</span></span>

Because he hath loosed my (f) cord, and afflicted me, (g) they have also
let loose the bridle before me.

\(f\) God has taken from me the force, credit, and authority with which
I kept them in subjection.

\(g\) He said that the young men when they saw him, hid themselves as in
([Job 29:8](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#008)), and now in his misery
they were impudent and licentious.

[Job 30:12](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 30:12</span></span>

Upon \[my\] right \[hand\] rise the youth; they push away my feet, and
they raise up against me the (h) ways of their destruction.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 30:14</span></span>

They came \[upon me\] as a wide breaking in \[of waters\]: in the (k)
desolation they rolled themselves \[upon me\].

[Job 30:16](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 30:16</span></span>

And now my soul is (l) poured out upon me; the days of affliction have
taken hold upon me.

\(l\) My life fails me, and I am as half dead.

[Job 30:17](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 30:17</span></span>

\(m\) My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take
no rest.

\(m\) Meaning sorrow.

[Job 30:19](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 30:19</span></span>

\(n\) He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and
ashes.

\(n\) That is, God has brought me into contempt.

[Job 30:21](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 30:21</span></span>

Thou art become (o) cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest
thyself against me.

vehemency of his affliction, by which he was carried beside himself.

[Job 30:22](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 30:22</span></span>

Thou liftest me up to the (p) wind; thou causest me to ride \[upon it\],
and dissolvest my substance.

[Job 30:24](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">job 30:24</span></span>

they cry in his destruction.

[Job 30:26](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">job 30:26</span></span>

of the sun.

them.
