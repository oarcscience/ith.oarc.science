<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#001">Revelation 19:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">rev 19:1</A></FONT></span></p>And (1) after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, (a) (2) Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, unto the Lord our God: 
<p>
<p>(1) This chapter has in summary two parts, one transitory or of passage to the things that follow, to the tenth verse, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#002">Rev 19:2-10</A>), another historical of the victory of Christ over both the beasts, to the end of the chapter (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#011">Rev 19:11-21</A>), which I said was the second history of this argument, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#001">Rev 17:1</A>). The transition has two places, one of praising God for the overthrow done to Babylon in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#004">Rev 19:4</A>): and another likewise of praise and prophecy, for the coming of Christ to his kingdom, and his most royal marriage with his Church, thence to the tenth verse (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#005">Rev 19:5-10</A>). The former praise has three parts, distinguished after the ancient manner of those that sing: an invitation in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#001">Rev 19:1-2</A>), a response or answer in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#003">Rev 19:3</A>), and a close or joining together in harmony in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#004">Rev 19:4</A>), all which I thought good of purpose to distinguish in this place, lest any man should with Porphyrius, or other like dogs, object to John, or the heavenly Church, a childish and idle repetition of speech. 
<p>
<p>(a) Praise the Lord. (2) The proposition of praise with exhortation in this verse, and the cause of it in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#002">Rev 19:2</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#003">Revelation 19:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">rev 19:3</A></FONT></span></p>And again they said, (3) Alleluia. And her smoke rose up for ever and ever. 
<p>
<p>(3) The song of the Antiphony or response, containing an amplification of the praise of God, from the continuous and certain testimony of his divine judgment as was done at Sodom and Gomorrah, (Gen. 19:1-38).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#005">Revelation 19:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">rev 19:5</A></FONT></span></p>(4) And a voice came out of the (5) throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and great. 
<p>
<p>(4) The second place of praise, as I said See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#001">Rev 19:1</A> which first is commanded by God in this verse: and then is in most ample manner pronounced by the creatures, both because they see that kingdom of Christ to come, which they desire, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#006">Rev 19:6</A>) and also because they see the Church is called forth to be brought home to the house of her husband by holy marriage, to the fellowship of his kingdom, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#007">Rev 19:7-8</A>). Therefore John is commanded to write in a book the acclamation together with a divine testimony, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#009">Rev 19:9</A>). (5) Out of the temple from God as in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#019">Rev 11:19</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#006">Revelation 19:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">rev 19:6</A></FONT></span></p>And I heard (6) as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth. 
<p>
<p>(6) Outside the temple in heaven.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#007">Revelation 19:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">rev 19:7</A></FONT></span></p>Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath (7) made herself ready. 
<p>
<p>(7) Namely, to that holy marriage, both herself in person in this verse, and also provided by her spouse with marriage gifts princely and divine, is adorned and prepared in the next verse.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#008">Revelation 19:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">rev 19:8</A></FONT></span></p>And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in (8) fine linen, clean and white: for the fine (9) linen is the (b) righteousness of saints. 
<p>
<p>(8) As an ensign of kingly and priestly dignity, which Christ bestows on us in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006">Rev 1:6</A>). (9) This is a gift given by the husband for marriage sake, and a most choice ornament which Christ gave to us, as to his spouse. 
<p>
<p>(b) Good works which are lively testimonies of faith.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#009">Revelation 19:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">rev 19:9</A></FONT></span></p>(10) And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed [are] they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto me, These are the true sayings of God. 
<p>
<p>(10) Namely the angel, as it appears by the next verse.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#010">Revelation 19:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">rev 19:10</A></FONT></span></p>(11) And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me, See [thou do it] not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren that have the (c)testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of (d) Jesus is the spirit of prophecy. 
<p>
<p>(11) The particular history of this verse is brought in by occasion, and as it were besides the purpose that John might make a public example of his own infirmity and of the modest sanctimony of the angel, who both renounced for himself the divine honours, and recalled all the servants of God, to the worship of him alone: as also (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#008">Rev 22:8</A>). 
<p>
<p>(c) Who are commanded to bear witness of Jesus. 
<p>
<p>(d) For Jesus is the mark that all the prophecies shoot at.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#011">Revelation 19:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">rev 19:11</A></FONT></span></p>(12) And I saw (13) heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him [was] called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war. 
<p>
<p>(12) The second part of this chapter (as I said in) See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#001">Rev 19:1</A> is of the victory gained by Christ against both the beasts: in which first Christ is described as one ready to fight, to the sixteenth verse (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#012">Rev 19:12-16</A>), then the battle is shown to begin, there to the eighteenth verse (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#017">Rev 19:17-18</A>), lastly is set forth the victory, to the end the chapter (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#019">Rev 19:19-21</A>). In this place the most excellent properties of Christ as our heavenly judge and avenger shine forth, according to his person, company, effects and names. 
<p>
<p>(13) Properties belonging to his person, that he is heavenly, judge, faithful, true, just, in this verse, knowing all things, ruling over all, to be known by no one, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#012">Rev 19:12</A>), the triumpher and in essence, the Word of God, in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#013">Rev 19:13</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#014">Revelation 19:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">rev 19:14</A></FONT></span></p>(14) And the armies [which were] in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean. 
<p>
<p>(14) The company or retinue of Christ, holy, innumerable, heavenly, judicial, royal and pure.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#015">Revelation 19:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">rev 19:15</A></FONT></span></p>(15) And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. 
<p>
<p>(15) The effects of Christ prepared to fight, that with his mouth he strikes the Gentiles, rules and destroys.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#016">Revelation 19:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">rev 19:16</A></FONT></span></p>(16) And he hath on [his] vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS. 
<p>
<p>(16) The name agreeing to Christ according to the former qualities, expressed after the manner of the Hebrews.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#017">Revelation 19:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">rev 19:17</A></FONT></span></p>(17) And I saw an angel standing in the (18) sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the (19) midst of heaven, Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God; 
<p>
<p>(17) The second part, as I said in See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#011">Rev 19:11</A>. A reproachful calling forth of his enemies into battle: in which not themselves (for why should they be called forth by the king of the world, or provoked being his subjects? for that is not comely) but in their hearing, the birds of the air are called to eat their carcasses. 
<p>
<p>(18) That is, openly, and in sight of all, as in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#004">Num 25:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#011">Sa2 12:11</A>). 
<p>
<p>(19) That is, through this inferior heaven, and which is nearer to us: a Hebrew phrase.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#019">Revelation 19:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">rev 19:19</A></FONT></span></p>(20) And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army. 
<p>
<p>(20) The third part (as was said in) (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#011">Rev 19:11</A>) by the victory obtained by Christ. Two things pertain to this: his fighting with the beast and his forces, in this verse: and the event most magnificent, described after the manner of men, in the verses following. All these things are plain.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#020">Revelation 19:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">rev 19:20</A></FONT></span></p>And the beast (21) was taken, and with him (22) the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone. 
<p>
<p>(21) Namely, that beast with seven heads; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#001">Rev 13:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#003">Rev 17:3</A>). 
<p>
<p>(22) That is, that beast with two heads; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#011">Rev 13:11</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#014">Rev 16:14</A>).
