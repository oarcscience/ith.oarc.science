<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">psa 108:1</A></FONT></span></p>"A Song [or] Psalm of David." O God, my heart is (a) fixed; I will sing and give praise, even with my glory. 
<p>
<p>(a) This earnest affection declares that he is free from hypocrisy and that sluggishness does not stop him.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#003">Psalms 108:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">psa 108:3</A></FONT></span></p>I will praise thee, O LORD, among the (b) people: and I will sing praises unto thee among the nations. 
<p>
<p>(b) He prophecies of the calling of the Gentiles: for unless they were called, they could not hear the goodness of God.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#005">Psalms 108:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">psa 108:5</A></FONT></span></p>(c) Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth; 
<p>
<p>(c) Let all the world see your judgments in that you are God over all, and so confess that you are glorious.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#006">Psalms 108:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">psa 108:6</A></FONT></span></p>That thy beloved may be delivered: (d) save [with] thy right hand, and answer me. 
<p>
<p>(d) When God by his benefits makes us partakers of his mercies, he admonishes us to be earnest in prayer, to desire him to continue and finish his graces.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#007">Psalms 108:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">psa 108:7</A></FONT></span></p>God hath spoken in his (e) holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth. 
<p>
<p>(e) As he has spoken to Samuel concerning me, so will he show himself constant and holy in his promise, so that these nations following will be subject to me.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#011">Psalms 108:11</A></p>
