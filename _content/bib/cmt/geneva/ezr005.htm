<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">ezr 5:2</A></FONT></span></p>Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which [is] at Jerusalem: and with them [were] the prophets of God (a) helping them. 
<p>
<p>(a) Who encouraged them to go forward, and cursed them because they were more careful to build their own houses, than zealous to build the temple of God.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#004">Ezra 5:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">ezr 5:4</A></FONT></span></p>(b) Then said we unto them after this manner, What are the names of the men that make this building? 
<p>
<p>(b) That is, the enemies asked this, as in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#010">Ezr 5:10</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#005">Ezra 5:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">ezr 5:5</A></FONT></span></p>But the (c) eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, that they could not cause them to cease, till the matter came to Darius: and then they returned answer by letter concerning this [matter]. 
<p>
<p>(c) His favour and the spirit of strength.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#011">Ezra 5:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">ezr 5:11</A></FONT></span></p>And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and build the house that was builded these many years ago, which a (d) great king of Israel builded and set up. 
<p>
<p>(d) That is, Solomon.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#013">Ezra 5:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">ezr 5:13</A></FONT></span></p>But in the (e) first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon [the same] king Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God. 
<p>
<p>(e) Read (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001">Ezr 1:1,2</A>).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">ezr 5:14</A></FONT></span></p>And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that [was] in Jerusalem, and brought them into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered unto [one], whose name [was] (f) Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor; 
<p>
<p>(f) Read (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#008">Ezr 1:8</A>).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">ezr 5:17</A></FONT></span></p>Now therefore, if [it seem] good to the king, let there be search made in the king's (g) treasure house, which [is] there at Babylon, whether it be [so], that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.
