<p>
<p>(a) In respect to the rest of the world, and because he had a desire to serve God and live uprightly.

<p>
<p>(c) God compelled them to present themselves to Noah, as they did before to Adam, when he gave them names, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#019">Gen 2:19</A>).

<p>
<p>(e) Both the waters in the earth overflowed and also the clouds poured down.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">gen 7:15</A></FONT></span></p>And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two (f) of all flesh, wherein [is] the breath of life.

<p>
<p>(g) So that God's secret power defended him against the rage of the mighty waters.

<p>
<p>(h) That is, by God.
