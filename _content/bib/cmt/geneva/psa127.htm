<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">psa 127:1</A></FONT></span></p>"A Song of degrees for Solomon." Except the LORD (a) build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the LORD keep the (b) city, the watchman waketh [but] in vain. 
<p>
<p>(a) That is, govern and dispose all things pertaining to the family. 
<p>
<p>(b) The public estate of the commonwealth.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#002">Psalms 127:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">psa 127:2</A></FONT></span></p>[It is] vain for (c) you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread (d) of sorrows: [for] so he giveth his beloved (e) sleep. 
<p>
<p>(c) Who watch and ward and are also magistrates and rulers of the city. 
<p>
<p>(d) Either that which is gained by hard labour, or eaten with grief of mind. 
<p>
<p>(e) Not exempting them from labour, but making their labours comfortable and as it were a rest.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#004">Psalms 127:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">psa 127:4</A></FONT></span></p>As arrows [are] in the hand of a mighty man; so [are] (f) children of the youth. 
<p>
<p>(f) That is, endued with strength and virtues from God: for these are signs of God's blessings, and not the number.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#005">Psalms 127:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">psa 127:5</A></FONT></span></p>Happy [is] the man that hath his quiver full of them: they (g) shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate. 
<p>
<p>(g) Such children will be able to stop their adversaries mouths, when their godly life is maliciously accused before judges.
