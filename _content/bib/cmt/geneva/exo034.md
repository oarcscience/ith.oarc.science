And the LORD passed by before him, and (a) proclaimed, The LORD, The

God that he would always be present with his Spirit.

\(c\) If you follow their wickedness, and pollute yourself with their
idolatry.

[Exodus 34:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">exo 34:17</span></span>

Thou shalt make thee no (e) molten gods.

\(e\) As gold, silver, brass, or anything that is molten: in this is
condemned all types idols, no matter what they are made of.

[Exodus 34:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">exo 34:20</span></span>

But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and if thou

thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before me (f) empty.

\(f\) Without offering something.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">exo 34:22</span></span>

And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the firstfruits of wheat
harvest, and the feast of ingathering (g) at the year's end.

[Exodus 34:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">exo 34:24</span></span>

For I will cast out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders:
neither shall any man (h) desire thy land, when thou shalt go up to
appear before the LORD thy God thrice in the year.

\(h\) God promises to defend them and theirs, who obey his commandment.

[Exodus 34:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">exo 34:26</span></span>

The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house
of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not (i) seethe a kid in his mother's
milk.

\(i\) See ([Exo 23:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#019); [Deu
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#021)).

[Exodus 34:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#028)

And he was there with the LORD (k) forty days and forty nights; he did
neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables the
words of the covenant, the ten commandments.

\(k\) This miracle was to confirm the authority of the law, and should
not be followed any more than other miracles.

[Exodus 34:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#034)

\(m\) Which was in the tabernacle of the congregation.
