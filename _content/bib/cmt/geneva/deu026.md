<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">deu 26:2</span></span>

\(a\) That thou shalt take of the first of all the fruit of the earth,
which thou shalt bring of thy land that the LORD thy God giveth thee,
and shalt put \[it\] in a basket, and shalt go unto the place which the
LORD thy God shall choose to (b) place his name there.

\(a\) By this ceremony they acknowledged that they received the land of
Canaan as a free gift from God.

\(b\) To be called upon, served and worshipped spiritually, ([Deu

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">deu 26:5</span></span>

And thou shalt speak and say before the LORD thy God, A (c) Syrian ready
to perish \[was\] my father, and he went down into Egypt, and sojourned
there with a few, and became there a nation, great, mighty, (d) and
populous:

\(c\) Meaning, Jacob, who served 20 years in Syria.

\(d\) Only by God's mercy, and not by their father's deserving.

[Deuteronomy 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">deu 26:7</span></span>

And when we (e) cried unto the LORD God of our fathers, the LORD heard
our voice, and looked on our affliction, and our labour, and our
oppression:

\(e\) Alleging the promises made to our fathers, Abraham, Isaac and
Jacob.

[Deuteronomy 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">deu 26:10</span></span>

And now, behold, I have (f) brought the firstfruits of the land, which
thou, O LORD, hast given me. And thou shalt set it before the LORD thy
God, and worship before the LORD thy God:

\(f\) In token of a thankful heart, and mindful of this benefit.

[Deuteronomy 26:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">deu 26:11</span></span>

And thou shalt rejoice in every good \[thing\] which the LORD thy God
hath given unto thee, and unto thine (g) house, thou, and the Levite,
and the stranger that \[is\] among you.

\(g\) Signifying that God does not give us goods for ourselves only, but
to be used also by those who are committed to our charge.

[Deuteronomy 26:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">deu 26:13</span></span>

Then thou shalt (h) say before the LORD thy God, I have brought away the
hallowed things out of \[mine\] house, and also have given them unto the
Levite, and unto the stranger, to the fatherless, and to the widow,
according to all thy commandments which thou hast commanded me: I have
not (i) transgressed thy commandments, neither have I forgotten
\[them\]:

\(h\) Without hypocrisy.

\(i\) Of malice and contempt.

[Deuteronomy 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">deu 26:14</span></span>

I have not eaten thereof in my mourning, neither have I taken away
\[ought\] thereof for \[any\] unclean \[use\], nor given \[ought\]
thereof for the dead: \[but\] I have hearkened to the voice of the LORD
my God, \[and\] have done (m) according to all that thou hast commanded
me.

\(m\) As far as my sinful nature would allow: or else as David and Paul
say, there is not one just, ([Psa
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#003); [Rom
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#010)).

[Deuteronomy 26:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">deu 26:16</span></span>

This day the LORD thy God hath commanded thee to do these statutes and
judgments: thou shalt therefore keep and do them with (n) all thine
heart, and with all thy soul.

\(n\) With a good and simple conscience.

[Deuteronomy 26:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#018)

\(o\) And the LORD hath avouched thee this day to be his peculiar
people, as he hath promised thee, and that \[thou\] shouldest keep all
his commandments;
