### [Psalms Chapter 129](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#001)

[Psalms 129:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 129:1</span></span>

"A Song of degrees." Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth,
may (a) Israel now say:

\(a\) The Church now afflicted should remember how her condition has
always been such from the beginning to be molested most grievously by
the wicked, yet in time it has always been delivered.

[Psalms 129:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 129:4</span></span>

The LORD \[is\] (b) righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the
wicked.

\(b\) Because God is righteous, he cannot but plague his adversary, and
deliver his as oxen out of the plough.

[Psalms 129:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 129:6</span></span>

\(c\) Let them be as the grass \[upon\] the housetops, which withereth
afore it groweth up:

\(c\) The enemies who lift themselves high, and as it were approach the
Sun, are consumed with the heat of God's wrath, because they are not
grounded in godly humility.

[Psalms 129:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 129:8</span></span>

\(d\) Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the LORD \[be\]
upon you: we bless you in the name of the LORD.

\(d\) That is, the wicked will perish, and none will pass for them.
