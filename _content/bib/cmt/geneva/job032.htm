<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#002">Job 32:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">job 32:2</A></FONT></span></p>Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the (a) Buzite, of the kindred of (b) Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself (c) rather than God. 
<p>
<p>(a) Which came from Buz, the son of Nahor, Abraham's brother. 
<p>
<p>(b) Or, as the Chaldee translation reads, Abram. 
<p>
<p>(c) By making himself innocent, and by charging God of rigour.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#004">Job 32:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">job 32:4</A></FONT></span></p>Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because (d) they [were] elder than he. 
<p>
<p>(d) That is, the three mentioned before.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#007">Job 32:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">job 32:7</A></FONT></span></p>I said, Days (e) should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom. 
<p>
<p>(e) Meaning, the ancient, who have experience.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#008">Job 32:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">job 32:8</A></FONT></span></p>But [there is] a spirit in man: (f) and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding. 
<p>
<p>(f) It is a special gift of God that man has understanding and comes neither from nature nor by age.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#011">Job 32:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">job 32:11</A></FONT></span></p>Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out (g) what to say. 
<p>
<p>(g) To prove that Job's affliction came for his sins.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#013">Job 32:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">job 32:13</A></FONT></span></p>Lest ye should say, We have (h) found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man. 
<p>
<p>(h) Flatter yourselves as though you had overcome him.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#014">Job 32:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">job 32:14</A></FONT></span></p>Now (i) he hath not directed [his] words against me: neither will I answer (k) him with your speeches. 
<p>
<p>(i) That is, Job. 
<p>
<p>(k) He uses almost the same arguments but without taunting and reproaches.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#018">Job 32:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">job 32:18</A></FONT></span></p>For I am full of (l) matter, the spirit within me constraineth me. 
<p>
<p>(l) I have conceived in my mind a great store of reasons.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#021">Job 32:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">job 32:21</A></FONT></span></p>Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, (m) neither let me give flattering titles unto man. 
<p>
<p>(m) I will neither have regard for riches, credit, nor authority but will speak the very truth.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#022">Job 32:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">job 32:22</A></FONT></span></p>For I know not to give flattering (n) titles; [in so doing] my maker would soon take me away. 
<p>
<p>(n) The Hebrew word signifies to change the name as to call a fool a wise man: meaning, that he would not cloak the truth to flatter men.
