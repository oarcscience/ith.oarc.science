<p>
<p>(a) To have comfort from them.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#008">Proverbs 19:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">pro 19:8</A></FONT></span></p>He that getteth wisdom (b) loveth his own soul: he that keepeth understanding shall find good. 
<p>
<p>(b) He that is upright in judgment finds favour from God.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">pro 19:10</A></FONT></span></p>(c) Delight is not proper for a fool; much less for a servant to have rule over princes. 
<p>
<p>(c) The free use of things are not to be permitted to him who cannot use them correctly.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#011">Proverbs 19:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">pro 19:11</A></FONT></span></p>The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; and [it is] his glory (d) to pass over a transgression. 
<p>
<p>(d) That is, to cover it by charity, and to do in it as may most serve to God's glory.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#013">Proverbs 19:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">pro 19:13</A></FONT></span></p>A foolish son [is] the calamity of his father: and the contentions of a wife [are] a continual (e) dropping. 
<p>
<p>(e) As rain that drops and rots the house.

<p>
<p>(f) Though for a time he gives place to counsel, yet soon after will he give place to his raging affections.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#021">Proverbs 19:21</A></p>

<p>
<p>(g) Man's device will not have success, unless God governs it, whose purpose is unchangeable.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">pro 19:22</A></FONT></span></p>The desire of a man [is] his (h) kindness: and a poor man [is] better than a liar. 
<p>
<p>(h) That is, that he be honest: for the poor man who is honest is to be esteemed above the rich who is not virtuous.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#025">Proverbs 19:25</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_025">pro 19:25</A></FONT></span></p>Smite a scorner, and the (i) simple will beware: and reprove one that hath understanding, [and] he will understand knowledge. 
<p>
<p>(i) That is, the simple and ignorant men learn when they see the wicked punished.
