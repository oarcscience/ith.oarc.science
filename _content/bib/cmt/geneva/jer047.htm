<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">jer 47:1</A></FONT></span></p>The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Philistines, before Pharaoh smote (a) Gaza. 
<p>
<p>(a) Or Azzah, a city of the Philistines.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#002">Jeremiah 47:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">jer 47:2</A></FONT></span></p>Thus saith the LORD; Behold, waters rise out of the (b) north, and shall be an overflowing flood, and shall overflow the land, and all that is in it; the city, and them that dwell in it: then the men shall cry, and all the inhabitants of the land shall wail. 
<p>
<p>(b) He means the army of the Chaldeans, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#007">Isa 8:7,8</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#003">Jeremiah 47:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">jer 47:3</A></FONT></span></p>At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong [horses], at the rushing of his chariots, [and at] the rumbling of his wheels, (c) the fathers shall not look back to [their] children for feebleness of (d) hands; 
<p>
<p>(c) The great fear will take away their natural affection. 
<p>
<p>(d) Their heart will so fail them.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#004">Jeremiah 47:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">jer 47:4</A></FONT></span></p>Because of the day that cometh to lay waste all the Philistines, [and] to cut off from Tyre and Zidon every helper that remaineth: for the LORD will lay waste the Philistines, the remnant of the country of (e) Caphtor. 
<p>
<p>(e) For the Caphtorims had destroyed in old time the Philistines, and dwelt in their land even to Gaza, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#023">Deu 2:23</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#005">Jeremiah 47:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">jer 47:5</A></FONT></span></p>(f) Baldness is come upon Gaza; Ashkelon is cut off [with] the remnant of their valley: how long wilt (g) thou cut thyself? 
<p>
<p>(f) They who shaved their heads for sorrow and heaviness. 
<p>
<p>(g) As the heathen used in their mourning, which the Lord forbade his people to do, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#001">Deu 14:1</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#007">Jeremiah 47:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">jer 47:7</A></FONT></span></p>How can it be (h) quiet, seeing the LORD hath given it a charge against Ashkelon, and against the sea shore? there hath he appointed it. 
<p>
<p>(h) Meaning, that it is not profitable that the wicked should by any means escape or hinder the Lord when he will take vengeance.
