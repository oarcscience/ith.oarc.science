<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001">Isaiah 53:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">isa 53:1</A></FONT></span></p>Who (a) hath believed our report? and to whom is the (b) arm of the LORD revealed? 
<p>
<p>(a) The prophet shows that very few will receive their preaching from Christ, and from their deliverance by him, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#038">Joh 12:38</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#016">Rom 10:16</A>). 
<p>
<p>(b) Meaning, that no one can believe but whose hearts God touches with the virtue of his Holy Spirit.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#002">Isaiah 53:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">isa 53:2</A></FONT></span></p>For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a (c) root out of a dry (d) ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, [there is] no beauty that we should desire him. 
<p>
<p>(c) The beginning of Christ's kingdom will be small and contemptible in the sight of man, but it will grow wonderfully and flourish before God. 
<p>
<p>(d) Read (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001">Isa 11:1</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#003">Isaiah 53:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">isa 53:3</A></FONT></span></p>He is despised and rejected by men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with (e) grief: and we hid as it were [our] faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not. 
<p>
<p>(e) Which was by God's singular providence for the comfort of sinners, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#015">Heb 4:15</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#004">Isaiah 53:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">isa 53:4</A></FONT></span></p>Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried (f) our sorrows: yet we did esteem him (g) stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted. 
<p>
<p>(f) That is, the punishment due to our sins, for which he has both suffered and made satisfaction, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#017">Mat 8:17</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#024">Pe1 2:24</A>). 
<p>
<p>(g) We judge evil, thinking that he was punished for his own sins, and not for ours.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#005">Isaiah 53:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">isa 53:5</A></FONT></span></p>But he [was] wounded for our transgressions, [he was] bruised for our iniquities: the (h) chastisement for our peace [was] upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. 
<p>
<p>(h) He was chastised for our reconciliation, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#003">Co1 15:3</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#006">Isaiah 53:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">isa 53:6</A></FONT></span></p>All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the (i) iniquity of us all. 
<p>
<p>(i) Meaning, the punishment of our iniquity, and not the fault itself.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#007">Isaiah 53:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">isa 53:7</A></FONT></span></p>He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he (k) opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he opened not his mouth. 
<p>
<p>(k) But willingly and patiently obeyed his father's appointment, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#063">Mat 26:63</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#032">Act 8:32</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#008">Isaiah 53:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">isa 53:8</A></FONT></span></p>He was taken from (l) prison and from judgment: (m) and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off from the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken. 
<p>
<p>(l) From the cross and grave, after that he was condemned. 
<p>
<p>(m) Though he died for sin, yet after his resurrection he will live forever and this his death is to restore life to his members, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#009">Rom 6:9</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#009">Isaiah 53:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">isa 53:9</A></FONT></span></p>(n) And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither [was any] deceit in his mouth. 
<p>
<p>(n) God the Father delivered him into the hands of the wicked, and to the powers of the world to do with him what they would.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#010">Isaiah 53:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">isa 53:10</A></FONT></span></p>Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put [him] to grief: when (o) thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see [his] seed, he shall prolong [his] days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand. 
<p>
<p>(o) Christ by offering up himself will give life to his Church, and so cause them to live with him forever.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#011">Isaiah 53:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">isa 53:11</A></FONT></span></p>He shall see of the (p) travail of his soul, [and] shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my (q) righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities. 
<p>
<p>(p) That is, the fruit and effect of his labour, which is the salvation of his Church. 
<p>
<p>(q) Christ will justify by faith through his word, while Moses could not justify by the law.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#012">Isaiah 53:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">isa 53:12</A></FONT></span></p>Therefore I will divide to him [a portion] with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because (r) he hath poured out his soul to death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bore the sin (s) of many, and made intercession for the transgressors. 
<p>
<p>(r) Because he humbled himself, therefore he will be extolled to glory, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007">Phi 2:7-12</A>). 
<p>
<p>(s) That is, of all that believe in him.
