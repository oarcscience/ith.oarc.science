### [Micah Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#001)

[Micah 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mic 6:1</span></span>

Hear ye now what the LORD saith; Arise, contend thou before the (a)
mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice.

\(a\) He took the high mountains and hard rocks as witnesses against the
obstinacy of his people.

[Micah 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mic 6:4</span></span>

For I (b) brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee
out of the house of servants; and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and
Miriam.

\(b\) I have not hurt you, but bestowed infinite benefits upon you.

[Micah 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mic 6:5</span></span>

O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted, and what
Balaam the son of Beor answered him from (c) Shittim unto Gilgal; that
ye may know the (d) righteousness of the LORD.

\(c\) That is, remember my benefits from the beginning, how I delivered
you from Balaam's curse, and also spared you from Shittim which was in
the plain of Moab, until I brought you into the promised land.

\(d\) That is, the truth of his promise and his manifold benefits toward
you.

[Micah 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mic 6:6</span></span>

Wherewith (e) shall I come before the LORD, \[and\] bow myself before
the high God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves
of a year old?

\(e\) Thus the people by hypocrisy ask how to please God, and are
content to offer sacrifices, but will not change their lives.

[Micah 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mic 6:7</span></span>

Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, \[or\] with ten
thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my (f) firstborn \[for\] my
transgression, the fruit of my body \[for\] the sin of my soul?

\(f\) There is nothing so dear to man, but the hypocrites will offer it
to God, if they think by this to avoid his anger. But they will never by
brought to mortify their own affections, and to give themselves
willingly to serve God as he commands.

[Micah 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mic 6:8</span></span>

He hath shewed thee, O man, what \[is\] good; and what doth the LORD
require of thee, (g) but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk
humbly with thy God?

\(g\) The Prophet in few words calls them to the observation of the
second table of the ten commandments, to know if they will obey God
correctly or not, saying that God has commanded them to do this.

[Micah 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mic 6:9</span></span>

The LORD'S voice crieth unto the (h) city, and \[the man of\] wisdom
shall see thy name: hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it.

\(h\) Meaning, that when God speaks to any city or nation, the godly
will acknowledge his majesty and not consider the mortal man that brings
the threatening, but God that sends it.

[Micah 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mic 6:12</span></span>

For the rich men thereof (i) are full of violence, and the inhabitants
thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue \[is\] deceitful in their
mouth.

\(i\) That is, of Jerusalem.

[Micah 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mic 6:14</span></span>

Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and (k) thy casting down \[shall
be\] in the midst of thee; and thou (l) shalt take hold, but shalt not
deliver; and \[that\] which thou deliverest will I give up to the sword.

\(k\) You will be consumed with inward grief and evils.

\(l\) Meaning that the city would go about to save her men, as they that
lay hold of that which they would preserve.

[Micah 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mic 6:16</span></span>

For the (m) statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of
Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels; that I should make thee a
desolation, and the inhabitants thereof an hissing: therefore ye shall
bear the reproach of my people.

\(m\) You have received all the corruption and idolatry with which the
ten tribes were infected under Omri and Ahab his son: and to excuse your
doings, you allege the King's authority by his statutes, and also wisdom
and policy in so doing, but you will not escape punishment. But as I
have shown you great favour, and taken you for my people, so will your
plagues be according as your sins; ([Luk
12:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#047)).
