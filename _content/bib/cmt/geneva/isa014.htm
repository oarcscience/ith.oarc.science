<p>
<p>(c) Signifying that the Jews would be superior to the Gentiles and that they would be brought under the service of Christ by the preaching of the Apostles, by which all are brought to the subjection of Christ, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#005">Co2 10:5</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#006">Isaiah 14:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">isa 14:6</A></FONT></span></p>He who smote the people in wrath with a continual stroke, he that ruled the nations in anger, is persecuted, [and] (d) none hindereth.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">isa 14:7</A></FONT></span></p>The whole earth is at (e) rest, [and] is quiet: they break forth into singing. 
<p>
<p>(e) Meaning that where tyrants reign, there can be no rest or quietness and also how detestable a thing tyranny is, seeing the insensible creatures have opportunity to rejoice at their destruction.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">isa 14:9</A></FONT></span></p>Hell from beneath is moved for thee to (f) meet [thee] at thy coming: it stirreth up the dead for thee, [even] all the chief ones of the earth; it hath raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations. 
<p>
<p>(f) As though they feared, lest you should trouble the dead, as you did the living and here he derides the proud tyranny of the wicked, who know not that all creatures wish their destruction, that they may rejoice.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#011">Isaiah 14:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">isa 14:11</A></FONT></span></p>Thy pomp is brought down to the grave, [and] the noise of thy viols: the worm (g) is spread under thee, and the worms cover thee. 
<p>
<p>(g) Instead of your costly carpets and coverings.

<p>
<p>(h) You who thought yourself most glorious and as it were placed in the heaven for the morning star that goes before the sun, is called Lucifer, to whom Nebuchadnezzar is compared.
