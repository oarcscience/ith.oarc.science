### [Genesis Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#001)

[Genesis 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 9:1</span></span>

And God (a) blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful,
and multiply, and replenish the earth.

\(a\) God increased them with fruit, and declared to them his counsel as
concerning the replenishing of the earth.

[Genesis 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 9:2</span></span>

And the (b) fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast
of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth
\[upon\] the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand
are they delivered.

\(b\) By the virtue of this commandment, beasts do not rage as much
against man as they would, yea and many serve his purposes by it.

[Genesis 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 9:3</span></span>

Every (c) moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the
green herb have I given you all things.

\(c\) By this permission man may with a good conscience use the
creatures of God for his needs.

[Genesis 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 9:4</span></span>

\(d\) But flesh with the life thereof, \[which is\] the blood thereof,
shall ye not eat.

\(d\) That is, living creatures, and the flesh of beasts that are
strangled: and by this all cruelty is forbidden.

[Genesis 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 9:5</span></span>

\(e\) And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of
every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of
every man's brother will I require the life of man.

\(e\) That is, I will take vengeance for your blood.

[Genesis 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gen 9:6</span></span>

Whoso sheddeth man's blood, (f) by man shall his blood be shed: for in
the (g) image of God made he man.

\(f\) Not only by the magistrate, but often God raises up one murderer
to kill another.

\(g\) Therefore to kill man is to deface God's image, and so injury is
not only done to man, but also to God.

[Genesis 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 9:9</span></span>

And I, behold, I establish my (h) covenant with you, and with your (i)
seed after you;

\(h\) To assure you that the world will never again be destroyed by a
flood.

\(i\) The children which are not yet born, are comprehended in God's
covenant with their fathers.

[Genesis 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gen 9:13</span></span>

I do set my (k) bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a
covenant between me and the earth.

\(k\) By this we see that signs or ordinances should not be separate
from the word.

[Genesis 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gen 9:15</span></span>

And I will remember my (l) covenant, which \[is\] between me and you and
every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become
a flood to destroy all flesh.

\(l\) When men see my bow in the sky, they will know that I have not
forgotten my covenant with them.

[Genesis 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">gen 9:17</span></span>

And God said unto Noah, (m) This \[is\] the token of the covenant, which
I have established between me and all flesh that \[is\] upon the earth.

\(m\) God repeats this often to confirm Noah's faith even more.

[Genesis 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">gen 9:19</span></span>

These \[are\] the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth
(n) overspread.

\(n\) This declares what the virtue of God's blessing was, when he said,
increase and bring forth in ([Gen
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#028)).

[Genesis 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">gen 9:21</span></span>

And he drank of the wine, and was (o) drunken; and he was uncovered
within his tent.

\(o\) This is set before us to show what a horrible thing drunkenness
is.

[Genesis 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">gen 9:22</span></span>

And Ham, the father of (p) Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and
(q) told his two brethren without.

\(p\) Of whom came the Canaanites that wicked nation, who were also
cursed by God.

\(q\) In derision and contempt of his father.

[Genesis 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">gen 9:25</span></span>

And he said, (r) Cursed \[be\] Canaan; a (s) servant of servants shall
he be unto his brethren.

\(r\) He pronounces as a prophet the curse of God against all those who
do not honour their parents: for Ham and his posterity were cursed.

\(s\) That is, a most vile slave.

[Genesis 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">gen 9:27</span></span>

God shall (t) enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem;
and Canaan shall be his servant.

\(t\) He declares that the Gentiles, who came from Japheth, and were
separated from the Church, should be joined to the same by the
persuasion of God's Spirit, and preaching of the gospel.
