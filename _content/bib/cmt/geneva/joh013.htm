<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#001">John 13:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">joh 13:1</A></FONT></span></p>Now (1) before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his (a) own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end. 
<p>
<p>(1) Christ is as sure of the victory as he is of the combat which was at hand, and by using the sign of washing the feet, gives by this an example in part of singular modesty, and his great love toward his apostles in this notable act, being likely to depart very shortly from them: and he partly witnesses unto them that it is he alone who washes away the filth of his people, and sanctifies them little by little in their time and season. 
<p>
<p>(a) Those of his household, that is, his saints.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#003">John 13:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">joh 13:3</A></FONT></span></p>Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his (b) hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God; 
<p>
<p>(b) Into his power.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#004">John 13:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">joh 13:4</A></FONT></span></p>He (c) riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself. 
<p>
<p>(c) In that he is said to rise, it argues that there was a space of time between the ceremony of the passover and this washing of feet, at which time it seems that the Lord's supper was instituted.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#008">John 13:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">joh 13:8</A></FONT></span></p>Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast (d) no part with me. 
<p>
<p>(d) Unless you allow me to wash you, you will have no part in the kingdom of heaven.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#018">John 13:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">joh 13:18</A></FONT></span></p>(2) I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me. 
<p>
<p>(2) The betraying of Christ was not accidental, or a thing that happened by chance, but it was the Father who ordained the cause of our salvation, to reconcile us unto himself in his Son, and the Son willingly and voluntarily obeyed the Father.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#021">John 13:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">joh 13:21</A></FONT></span></p>When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and (e) testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me. 
<p>
<p>(e) He affirmed it openly and sealed it.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#023">John 13:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">joh 13:23</A></FONT></span></p>Now there was (f) leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved. 
<p>
<p>(f) John's leaning was such that sitting down on his mat his head was toward the head of Jesus: for it is certain that in ancient times men used to not sit at the table, but to lie down on one of their sides.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#031">John 13:31</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_031">joh 13:31</A></FONT></span></p>(3) Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, (g) Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him. 
<p>
<p>(3) We have to see the glorifying of Christ in his dishonour. 
<p>
<p>(g) This verse and the one following are a most plain and evident testimony to the divinity of Christ.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#033">John 13:33</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_033">joh 13:33</A></FONT></span></p>(4) Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say to you. 
<p>
<p>(4) The eternal glory will flow little by little from the head into the members. But meanwhile, we must take good heed that we run the race of this life in brotherly love.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#036">John 13:36</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_036">joh 13:36</A></FONT></span></p>(5) Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterwards. 
<p>
<p>(5) A weighty example of rash trust and confidence.
