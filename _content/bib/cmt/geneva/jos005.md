### [Joshua Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#001)

[Joshua 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 5:1</span></span>

And it came to pass, when all the kings of the (a) Amorites, which
\[were\] on the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the
Canaanites, which \[were\] by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up
the waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we were
passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them
any more, because of the children of Israel.

\(a\) The Amorites were on both sides of Jordan, of which two kings were
slain already on the side toward Moab.

[Joshua 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jos 5:2</span></span>

At that time the LORD said unto Joshua, Make thee sharp knives, (b) and
circumcise again the children of Israel the second time.

\(b\) For now they had left it off, about 40 years.

[Joshua 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jos 5:3</span></span>

And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children of Israel
at (c) the hill of the foreskins.

\(c\) Gilgal was so called, because they were there circumcised.

[Joshua 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jos 5:5</span></span>

Now all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the people
\[that were\] born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out
of Egypt, \[them\] they had (d) not circumcised.

\(d\) For they looked daily to move at the Lord's command, which they
who were newly circumcised could not do without great danger.

[Joshua 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jos 5:8</span></span>

And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the people,
that they abode in their places in the camp, till they (e) were whole.

\(e\) For their sore was so grievous, that they were not able to move.

[Joshua 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jos 5:9</span></span>

And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the (f)
reproach of Egypt from off you. Wherefore the name of the place is
called Gilgal unto this day.

\(f\) By bringing you into this promised land, contrary to the wicked
opinion of the Egyptians or the foreskin by which you were like the
Egyptians.

[Joshua 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jos 5:14</span></span>

And he said, Nay; but \[as\] captain of the host of the LORD am I now
come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and (g) did worship, and
said unto him, What saith my lord unto his servant?

\(g\) In that Joshua worships him, he acknowledges him to be God: and in
that he calls himself the Lord's captain he declares himself to be
Christ.
