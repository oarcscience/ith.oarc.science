### [Isaiah Chapter 37](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#001)

[Isaiah 37:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 37:1</span></span>

And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard \[it\], that he (a) tore
his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house
of the LORD.

\(a\) In sign of grief and repentance.

[Isaiah 37:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 37:2</span></span>

And he sent Eliakim, who \[was\] over the household, and Shebna the
scribe, and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth, to (b)
Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.

\(b\) To have comfort from him by the word of God, that his faith might
be confirmed and so his prayer be more earnest: teaching by it that in
all dangers these two are the only remedies to seek to God and his
ministers.

[Isaiah 37:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 37:3</span></span>

And they said to him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day \[is\] a day of
trouble, and of rebuke, and of blasphemy: for the children are come to
the (c) birth, and \[there is\] not strength to bring forth.

\(c\) We are in as great sorrow as a woman in labour who cannot be
delivered.

[Isaiah 37:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 37:4</span></span>

It may be the LORD thy God will (d) hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom
the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God, and
will reprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard: wherefore (e)
lift up \[thy\] prayer for the remnant that is left.

\(d\) That is, will declare by effect that he has heard it: for when God
defers to punish, it seems to the flesh, that he knows not the sin, or
hears not the cause.

\(e\) Declaring that the ministers office stands not only in comforting
by the word, but also in praying for the people.

[Isaiah 37:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 37:7</span></span>

Behold, I will send a wind upon him, and he shall hear a (f) rumour, and
return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his
own land.

\(f\) Of the Egyptians and Ethiopians, who will come and fight against
him.

[Isaiah 37:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 37:8</span></span>

So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against (g)
Libnah: for he had heard that he had departed from Lachish.

\(g\) Which was a city toward Egypt, thinking by it to have stayed the
force of his enemies.

[Isaiah 37:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 37:10</span></span>

Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God,
in whom thou trustest, (h) deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be
given into the hand of the king of Assyria.

\(h\) Thus God would have him utter a most horrible blasphemy before his
destruction: as to call the author of all truth a deceiver: some gather
by this that Shebna had disclosed to Sennacherib the answer that Isaiah
sent to the king.

[Isaiah 37:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 37:12</span></span>

Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have
destroyed, \[as\] (i) Gozan, and (k) Haran, and Rezeph, and the children
of Eden who \[were\] in Telassar?

\(i\) Which was a city of the Medes.

\(k\) Called also Charre a city in Mesopotamia, from which Abraham came
after his fathers death.

[Isaiah 37:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 37:16</span></span>

O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, that (l) dwellest \[between\] the
cherubim, thou \[art\] the God, \[even\] thou alone, of all the kingdoms
of the earth: thou hast made heaven and earth.

\(l\) He grounds his prayer on God's promise, who promised to hear them
from between the Cherubims.

[Isaiah 37:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 37:18</span></span>

Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations,
and (m) their countries,

\(m\) Meaning, the ten tribes.

[Isaiah 37:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 37:20</span></span>

Now therefore, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, that (n) all the
kingdoms of the earth may know that thou \[art\] the LORD, \[even\] thou
only.

\(n\) He declares for what cause he prayed, that they might be glorified
by it through all the world.

[Isaiah 37:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 37:22</span></span>

This \[is\] the word which the LORD hath spoken concerning him; The (o)
virgin, the daughter of Zion, hath despised, \[and\] derided thee; the
daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.

\(o\) Whom God had chosen to himself as a chaste virgin, and over whom
he had care to preserve her from the lusts of the tyrant, as a father
would have over his daughter.

[Isaiah 37:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">isa 37:23</span></span>

Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou
exalted \[thy\] voice, and lifted thy eyes on high? \[even\] against the
(p) Holy One of Israel.

\(p\) Declaring by this that they who are enemies to God's Church fight
against him whose quarrel his Church only maintains.

[Isaiah 37:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">isa 37:25</span></span>

I have dug, (q) and drank water; and with the sole of my feet have I
dried up all the rivers of the besieged places.

\(q\) He boasts of his policy in that he can find means to nourish his
army: and of his power in that his army is so great, that it is able to
dry up whole rivers, and to destroy the waters which the Jews had closed
in.

[Isaiah 37:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">isa 37:26</span></span>

Hast thou not heard long ago, \[how\] I have done it; \[and\] of ancient
times, (r) that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that
thou shouldest be to lay waste fortified cities \[into\] ruinous heaps.

\(r\) Signifying that God did not make his Church to destroy it, but to
preserve it: and therefore he says that he formed it of old, even in his
eternal counsel which cannot be changed.

[Isaiah 37:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">isa 37:27</span></span>

Therefore their inhabitants \[were\] of small power, they were dismayed
and confounded: they were \[as\] the grass of the field, and \[as\] the
green herb, \[as\] the grass on the housetops, and \[as grain\] blighted
(s) before it is grown up.

\(s\) He shows that the state and power of most flourishing cities
endures but a moment in respect to the Church, which will remain
forever, because God is the maintainer of it.

[Isaiah 37:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">isa 37:28</span></span>

But I know thy abode, and thy (t) going out, and thy coming in, and thy
rage against me.

\(t\) Meaning, his counsels and enterprises.

[Isaiah 37:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">isa 37:29</span></span>

Because thy rage against me, and thy tumult, is come up into my ears,
therefore I will put my (u) hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips,
and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou (x) camest.

\(u\) Because Sennacherib showed himself as a devouring fish and furious
beast, he uses these similarities to teach how he will take him and
guide him.

\(x\) You will lose your labour.

[Isaiah 37:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">isa 37:30</span></span>

And this \[shall be\] a (y) sign to thee, Ye shall eat

\[this\] year such as groweth of itself; and the (z) second year that
which springeth of the same: and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and
plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.

\(y\) God gives signs after two sorts: some go before the thing as the
signs that Moses worked in Egypt, which were for the confirmation of
their faith, and some go after the thing, as the sacrifice, which they
were commanded to make three days after their departure: and these
latter are to keep the blessings of God in our remembrance, of which
sort this here is.

\(z\) He promises that for two years the ground would feed them of
itself.

[Isaiah 37:31](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">isa 37:31</span></span>

And (a) the remnant that hath escaped of the house of Judah shall again
take root downward, and bear fruit upward:

\(a\) They whom God has delivered out of the hands of the Assyrians will
prosper: and this properly belongs to the Church.

[Isaiah 37:35](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">isa 37:35</span></span>

For I will defend this city to save it for my own sake, and for my
servant (b) David's sake.

\(b\) For my promise sake made to David.

[Isaiah 37:37](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">isa 37:37</span></span>

So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and
dwelt at (c) Nineveh.

\(c\) Which was the chiefest city of the Assyrians.

[Isaiah 37:38](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">isa 37:38</span></span>

And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his
god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword;
and they escaped into the land of Armenia: and (d) Esarhaddon his son
reigned in his stead.

\(d\) Who was also called Sardanapalus, in whose days ten years after
Sennacherib's death the Chaldeans overcame the Assyrians by Merodach
their king.
