<p>
<p>(b) Though God used these wicked tyrants to execute his just judgments, they are not to be excused, for they proceeded from ambition and malice.

<p>(c) Not that he was buried with his fathers, but he died in the way, as they let him prisoner toward Babylon, see (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#019">Jer 22:19</A>).

<p>(d) That is, yielded himself to him by the counsel of Jeremiah.

<p>(e) In the reign of the king of Babylon.
