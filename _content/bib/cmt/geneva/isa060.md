Arise, shine; for thy (a) light is come, and the glory of the LORD is

For, behold, the darkness shall cover the (b) earth, and gross darkness
the people: but the LORD shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be
seen upon thee.

light of his Spirit, and that this light shines to no one, but to those
that are in his Church.

[Isaiah 60:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 60:3</span></span>

And the Gentiles shall come to (c) thy light, and kings to the
brightness of thy rising.

\(c\) Meaning, that Judea would be as the morning star, and that the
Gentiles would receive light from her.

[Isaiah 60:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 60:4</span></span>

Lift up thy eyes around, and see: all (d) they gather themselves
together, they come to thee: thy sons shall come from far, and thy
daughters shall be nursed at \[thy\] side.

\(d\) An infinite number from all countries as in ([Isa
49:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#018)).

[Isaiah 60:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 60:5</span></span>

Then thou shalt see, and flow together, and thy heart shall fear, (e)
and be enlarged; because the abundance of the sea shall be converted to
thee, the forces of the Gentiles shall come to thee.

\(e\) For joy, as the heart is drawn in for sorrow.

[Isaiah 60:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 60:6</span></span>

The (f) multitude of camels shall cover thee, the dromedaries of Midian
and Ephah; all they from Sheba shall come: they shall bring gold and
incense; and they shall show forth the praises of the LORD.

\(f\) Meaning, that everyone will honour the Lord with that with which
he is able: Signifying that it is no true serving of God unless we offer

of Nebaioth shall minister to thee: they shall come up with acceptance
on my (h) altar, and I will glorify the house of my glory.

\(g\) That is the Arabians, that have great abundance of cattle.

\(h\) Because the altar was a figure of Christ, ([Heb
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#010)), he shows that nothing can be
acceptable to him, which is not offered to him by this altar, who was
both the offering and the altar itself.

Zion of the Holy One of Israel.
