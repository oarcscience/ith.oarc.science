<p>
<p>(h) It was so called, because the high priest could not give sentence in judgment without that on his breast.

<p>(n) Urim signifies light, and thummim perfection: declaring that the stones of the breastplate were most clear, and of perfect beauty: by urim also is meant knowledge, and thummim holiness, showing what virtues are required in the priests.

<p>
<p>(o) Holiness belongs to the Lord: for he is most holy, and nothing unholy may appear before him.
