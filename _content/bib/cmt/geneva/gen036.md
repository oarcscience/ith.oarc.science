### [Genesis Chapter 36](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#001)

[Genesis 36:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 36:1</span></span>

Now these \[are\] (a) the generations of Esau, who \[is\] Edom.

\(a\) This genealogy declares that Esau was blessed physically and that
his father's blessing took place in worldly things.

[Genesis 36:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 36:2</span></span>

Esau took his wives of the (b) daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of
Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of
Zibeon the Hivite;

\(b\) Besides those wives spoken of in ([Gen
26:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#034)).

[Genesis 36:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gen 36:6</span></span>

And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the
persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his
substance, which he had got in the land of Canaan; and (c) went into the
country from the face of his brother Jacob.

\(c\) In this, God's providence appears, which causes the wicked to give
place to the godly, that Jacob might enjoy Canaan according to God's
promise.

[Genesis 36:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gen 36:15</span></span>

These \[were\] (d) dukes of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the
firstborn \[son\] of Esau; duke Teman, duke Omar, duke Zepho, duke
Kenaz,

\(d\) If God's promises are so sure towards those who are not of his
household, how much more will he perform the same for us?

[Genesis 36:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">gen 36:20</span></span>

These \[are\] the sons of Seir the Horite, who (e) inhabited the land;
Lotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah,

\(e\) Esau lived there before that.

[Genesis 36:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">gen 36:24</span></span>

And these \[are\] the children of Zibeon; both Ajah, and Anah: this
\[was that\] Anah that found the (f) mules in the wilderness, as he fed
the asses of Zibeon his father.

\(f\) Who not contented with those kinds of beasts, which God had
created, discovered the monstrous generation of mules between the ass
and the mare.

[Genesis 36:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">gen 36:31</span></span>

And these \[are\] the (g) kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before
there reigned any king over the children of Israel.

\(g\) The wicked rise up suddenly to honour and perish as quickly: but
the inheritance of the children of God continues forever, ([Psa
102:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#028)).

[Genesis 36:37](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">gen 36:37</span></span>

And Samlah died, and Saul of (h) Rehoboth \[by\] the river reigned in
his stead.

\(h\) Which is by the river Euphrates.

[Genesis 36:43](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">gen 36:43</span></span>

Duke Magdiel, duke Iram: these \[be\] the dukes of Edom, according to
their habitations in the land of their possession: he \[is\] Esau the
father of the (i) Edomites.

\(i\) Of Edom came the Idumeans.
