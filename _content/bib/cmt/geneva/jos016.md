### [Joshua Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#001)

[Joshua 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 16:1</span></span>

And the lot of the (a) children of Joseph fell from Jordan by Jericho,
unto the water of Jericho on the east, to the wilderness that goeth up
from Jericho throughout mount Bethel,

\(a\) That is, to Ephraim and his children: for Manasseh's portion
follows.

[Joshua 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jos 16:3</span></span>

And goeth down westward to the coast of Japhleti, unto the coast of
Bethhoron the nether, and to Gezer: and the goings out (b) thereof are
at the sea.

\(b\) Of their inheritance.

[Joshua 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jos 16:4</span></span>

So the children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, (c) took their
inheritance.

\(c\) Severally, first Ephraim, and then Manasseh.

[Joshua 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jos 16:7</span></span>

And it went down from Janohah to Ataroth, and to Naarath, and came to
Jericho, (d) and went out at Jordan.

\(d\) For so far the coasts reach.

[Joshua 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jos 16:9</span></span>

And the (e) separate cities for the children of Ephraim \[were\] among
the inheritance of the children of Manasseh, all the cities with their
villages.

\(e\) Because Ephraim's tribe was far greater than Manasseh, therefore
he had more cities.
