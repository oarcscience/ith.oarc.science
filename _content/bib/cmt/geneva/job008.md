### [Job Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#001)

[Job 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 8:18</span></span>

If he destroy him from his place, then \[it\] shall (k) deny him,
\[saying\], I have not seen thee.

\(k\) That is, so that there remains nothing there to prove whether the
tree had grown there or not.

[Job 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 8:19</span></span>

Behold, this \[is\] the joy (l) of his way, and out of the earth shall
others grow.

\(l\) To be planted in another place, where it may grow as it pleases.

[Job 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 8:21</span></span>

Till he fill thy mouth with (m) laughing, and thy lips with rejoicing.

\(m\) If you are godly, he will give you opportunity to rejoice and if
not your affliction will increase.

[Job 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 8:2</span></span>

How long wilt thou speak these \[things\]? and \[how long shall\] the
words of thy mouth (a) \[be like\] a strong wind?

\(a\) He declares that their words which would diminish anything from
the justice of God, are but as a puff of wind that vanishes away.

[Job 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 8:4</span></span>

If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for
their (b) transgression;

\(b\) That is, has rewarded them according to their iniquity, meaning
that Job should be warned by the example of his children, that he not
offend God.

[Job 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 8:5</span></span>

If thou (c) wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy supplication to
the Almighty;

\(c\) That is, if you turn while God calls you to repentance.

[Job 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 8:7</span></span>

Though thy beginning (d) was small, yet thy latter end should greatly
increase.

\(d\) Though the beginning is not as pleasant as you would like, yet in
the end you will have sufficient opportunity to please yourself.

[Job 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 8:8</span></span>

For (e) enquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself to
the search of their fathers:

\(e\) He wills Job to examine all antiquity and he will find it true
which he here says.

[Job 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 8:9</span></span>

(For we \[are but of\] (f) yesterday, and know nothing, because our days
upon earth \[are\] a shadow:)

\(f\) Meaning, that it is not enough to have the experience of
ourselves, but to be confirmed by the examples of those who went before
us.

[Job 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 8:11</span></span>

Can the rush (g) grow up without mire? can the flag grow without water?

\(g\) As a rush cannot grow without moisture, so the hypocrite because
he does not have faith which is watered with God's Spirit.

[Job 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 8:14</span></span>

Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust \[shall be\] a (h) spider's
web.

\(h\) Which is today and tomorrow swept away.

[Job 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 8:16</span></span>

He \[is\] (i) green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in his
garden.

\(i\) He compares the just to a tree, which although it is moved from
one place to another, yet flourishes: so the affliction of the godly
turns to their profit.
