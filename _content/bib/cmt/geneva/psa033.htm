<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#001">Psalms 33:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">psa 33:1</A></FONT></span></p>Rejoice in the LORD, O ye righteous: [for] praise is (a) comely for the upright. 
<p>
<p>(a) It is the duty of the godly to set forth the praises of God for his mercy and power showed to them.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#002">Psalms 33:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">psa 33:2</A></FONT></span></p>Praise the LORD with harp: sing unto him with the psaltery [and] an (b) instrument of ten strings. 
<p>
<p>(b) To sing on instruments, was a part of the ceremonial service of the temple, which does not belong to us any more than the sacrifices, censors and light.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#004">Psalms 33:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">psa 33:4</A></FONT></span></p>For the (c) word of the LORD [is] right; and all his (d) works [are done] in truth. 
<p>
<p>(c) That is, counsel or command in governing the world. 
<p>
<p>(d) That is, the effect and execution.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#005">Psalms 33:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">psa 33:5</A></FONT></span></p>He (e) loveth righteousness and judgment: the earth is full of the goodness of the LORD. 
<p>
<p>(e) However the world judges God's works, yet he does all things according to justice and mercy.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#007">Psalms 33:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">psa 33:7</A></FONT></span></p>He (f) gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap: he layeth up the depth in storehouses. 
<p>
<p>(f) By the creation of the heavens and beautiful ornament with the gathering also of the waters, he sets forth the power of God, that all creatures might fear him.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#010">Psalms 33:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">psa 33:10</A></FONT></span></p>The LORD bringeth the (g) counsel of the heathen to nought: he maketh the devices of the people of none effect. 
<p>
<p>(g) No counsel can prevail against God, but he deserves it, and it will have evil success.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#012">Psalms 33:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">psa 33:12</A></FONT></span></p>Blessed [is] the nation whose (h) God [is] the LORD; [and] the people [whom] he hath chosen for his own inheritance. 
<p>
<p>(h) He shows that all our happiness stands in this, that the Lord is our God.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#013">Psalms 33:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">psa 33:13</A></FONT></span></p>The LORD (i) looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of men. 
<p>
<p>(i) He proves that all things are governed by God's providence and not by fortune.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#015">Psalms 33:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">psa 33:15</A></FONT></span></p>He (k) fashioneth their hearts alike; he considereth all their works. 
<p>
<p>(k) Therefore he knows their wicked enterprises.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#016">Psalms 33:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">psa 33:16</A></FONT></span></p>There is no (l) king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty man is not delivered by much strength. 
<p>
<p>(l) If kings and the mighty of the world cannot be saved by worldly means, but only by God's providence, what do others have to trust in, who have not similar means?  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#018">Psalms 33:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">psa 33:18</A></FONT></span></p>Behold, (m) the eye of the LORD [is] upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy; 
<p>
<p>(m) God shows his mercy toward his, which man by no means is able to compass.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#020">Psalms 33:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">psa 33:20</A></FONT></span></p>(n) Our soul waiteth for the LORD: he [is] our help and our shield. 
<p>
<p>(n) Thus he speaks in the name of the whole Church which only depends on God's providence.
