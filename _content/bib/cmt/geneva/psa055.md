### [Psalms Chapter 55](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#001)

[Psalms 55:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 55:1</span></span>

"To the chief Musician on Neginoth, Maschil, \[A Psalm\] of David." Give
ear to (a) my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my supplication.

\(a\) The earnestness of his prayer declares the vehemency of his grief
in so much as he is compelled to burst out into cries.

[Psalms 55:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 55:3</span></span>

Because of the (b) voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the
wicked: for (c) they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me.

\(b\) For the threatenings of Saul and his adherents.

\(c\) They have defamed me as a wicked person, or they have imagined my
destruction.

[Psalms 55:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 55:5</span></span>

Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath (d)
overwhelmed me.

\(d\) There was no part of him that was not astonished with extreme
fear.

[Psalms 55:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 55:6</span></span>

And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! \[for then\] would I (e)
fly away, and be at rest.

\(e\) Fear had driven him to so great distress, that he wished to be hid
in some wilderness, and to be banished from that kingdom which God had
promised that he should enjoy.

[Psalms 55:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 55:8</span></span>

I would hasten my escape (f) from the windy storm \[and\] tempest.

\(f\) From the cruel rage and tyranny of Saul.

[Psalms 55:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 55:9</span></span>

Destroy, O Lord, \[and\] (g) divide their tongues: for I have seen
violence and strife in the city.

\(g\) As in the confusion of Babylon when the wicked conspired against
God.

[Psalms 55:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 55:10</span></span>

Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: (h) mischief also
and sorrow \[are\] in the midst of it.

\(h\) All laws and good orders are broken and only vice and dissolution
reigns under Saul.

[Psalms 55:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 55:12</span></span>

For \[it was\] not an (i) enemy \[that\] reproached me; then I could
have borne \[it\]: neither \[was it\] he that hated me \[that\] did
magnify \[himself\] against me; then I would have hid myself from him:

\(i\) If my open enemy had sought by hurt, I could better have avoided
him.

[Psalms 55:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 55:13</span></span>

But \[it was\] thou, a man mine (k) equal, my guide, and mine
acquaintance.

\(k\) Who was not only joined to me in friendship and counsel in worldly
matters, but also in religion.

[Psalms 55:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 55:15</span></span>

Let death seize upon them, \[and\] let them (l) go down quick into hell:
for wickedness \[is\] in their dwellings, \[and\] among them.

\(l\) As Korah, Dathan and Abiram.

[Psalms 55:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 55:17</span></span>

Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, (m) and cry aloud: and
he shall hear my voice.

\(m\) Which signifies a servants mind and sure trust to obtain his
portion, which made him earnest at all times in prayer.

[Psalms 55:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 55:18</span></span>

He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle \[that was\] against
me: for there were (n) many with me.

\(n\) Even the angels of God fought on my side against my enemies, ([Kg2
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#016)).

[Psalms 55:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 55:19</span></span>

God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old. Selah.
Because they (o) have no changes, therefore they fear not God.

\(o\) But their prosperous estate still continues.

[Psalms 55:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 55:20</span></span>

He (p) hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him: he
hath broken his covenant.

\(p\) I did not provoke him but was as at peace with him, yet he made
war against me.

[Psalms 55:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">psa 55:22</span></span>

Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: he shall (q)
never suffer the righteous to be moved.

\(q\) Though for their bettering and trial, he permits them to slip for
a time.

[Psalms 55:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">psa 55:23</span></span>

But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction:
bloody and deceitful men shall not live out (r) half their days; but I
will trust in thee.

\(r\) Though they sometimes live longer, yet their life is cursed by
God, unquiet, and worse than any death.
