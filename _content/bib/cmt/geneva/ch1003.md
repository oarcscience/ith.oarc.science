### [1 Chronicles Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#001)

[1 Chronicles 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 3:1</span></span>

Now these were the sons of (a) David, which were born unto him in
Hebron; the firstborn Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess; the second (b)
Daniel, of Abigail the Carmelitess:

\(a\) He returns to the genealogy of David, to show that Christ came
from his stock.

\(b\) Who in ([Sa2 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#003)) is called
Chileab, born of her that was Nabal's wife the Carmelite.

[1 Chronicles 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch1 3:5</span></span>

And these were born unto him in Jerusalem; Shimea, and Shobab, and
Nathan, and Solomon, four, of (c) Bathshua the daughter of Ammiel:

\(c\) Called also Bathsheba the daughter of Eliam: for they gave them
various names.

[1 Chronicles 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 3:6</span></span>

Ibhar also, and (d) Elishama, and Eliphelet,

\(d\) Elishama, or Elishua, ([Sa2
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#015)) and Eliphelet died, and David
named those sons who were born next by the same names; in the book of
kings his living children are mentioned and here both they that were
alive and dead.

[1 Chronicles 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch1 3:15</span></span>

And the sons of Josiah \[were\], the (e) firstborn Johanan, the second
Jehoiakim, the third Zedekiah, the fourth Shallum.

\(e\) So called because he was preferred for the royal dignity before
his brother Jehoiakim who was the elder.

[1 Chronicles 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch1 3:19</span></span>

And the sons of Pedaiah \[were\], (f) Zerubbabel, and Shimei: and the
sons of Zerubbabel; Meshullam, and Hananiah, and Shelomith their sister:

\(f\) Matthew says that Zerubbabel was the son of Shealtiel, meaning
that he was his nephew according to the Hebrew speech: for he was
Pedaiah's son.

[1 Chronicles 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch1 3:22</span></span>

And the sons of Shechaniah; Shemaiah: and the sons of Shemaiah; Hattush,
and Igeal, and Bariah, and Neariah, and Shaphat, (g) six.

\(g\) So that Shemaiah was Shechaniah's natural son, and the other five
his nephews and in all there were six.
