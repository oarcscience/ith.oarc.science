So she turned, and went away to her own land, she and her servants. 
<p>
<p>(f) That is, which the king gave her for recompense of the treasure which she brought. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#015">2 Chronicles 9:15</A></p>

<p>
<p>(n) The abundance of those temporal treasures in Solomon's kingdom is a figure of the spiritual treasures which the elect will enjoy in the heavens under the true Solomon, Christ.
