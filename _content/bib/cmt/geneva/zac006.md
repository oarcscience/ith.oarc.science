### [Zechariah Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#001)

[Zechariah 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">zac 6:1</span></span>

And I turned, and lifted up my eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came
four (a) chariots out from between (b) two mountains; and the mountains
\[were\] mountains of brass.

\(a\) By chariots here, as by horses before, he means the swift
messengers of God to execute and declare his will.

\(b\) By the mountains he means the external counsel and providence of
God, by which he has from before all eternity declared what will come to
pass, and that which neither Satan nor all the world can alter.

[Zechariah 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">zac 6:2</span></span>

In the first chariot \[were\] (c) red horses; and in the second chariot
(d) black horses;

\(c\) Which signifies the great cruelty and persecution that the Church
had endured under different enemies.

\(d\) Signifying that they had endured great afflictions under the
Babylonians.

[Zechariah 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">zac 6:3</span></span>

And in the third chariot (e) white horses; and in the fourth chariot (f)
spotted and bay horses.

\(e\) These represented their state under the Persians, who restored
them to their liberty.

\(f\) Which signified that God would sometimes give his Church rest, and
pour his plagues upon their enemies, as he did in destroying Nineveh and
Babylon, and other of their enemies.

[Zechariah 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">zac 6:5</span></span>

And the angel answered and said to me, These \[are\] the four (g)
spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of
all the earth.

\(g\) Meaning, all the actions and motions of God's Spirit, whom
according to his unchangeable counsel he causes to appear through all
the world.

[Zechariah 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">zac 6:6</span></span>

The black horses which \[are\] in it go forth into the north country;
and the white go forth after them; and the spotted go forth toward the
(h) south country.

\(h\) That is, towards Egypt, and other countries there about.

[Zechariah 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">zac 6:7</span></span>

And the (i) bay went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and
fro through the earth: and he said, Go from here, walk to and fro
through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth.

\(i\) That is, those of different colours, which ask permission, to
signify that Satan has no power to hurt or afflict, until God gives it
to him; ([Job 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#012)).

[Zechariah 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">zac 6:8</span></span>

Then he cried upon me, and spoke to me, saying, Behold, these that go
toward the north country have quieted my (k) spirit in the north
country.

\(k\) By punishing the Chaldeans my anger ceased, and you were
delivered.

[Zechariah 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">zac 6:10</span></span>

Take of \[them of\] the captivity, \[even\] of Heldai, of Tobijah, and
of Jedaiah, who are come from Babylon, and come thou the same day, and
go into the house of (l) Josiah the son of Zephaniah;

\(l\) To receive from him and the other three, money to make the two
crowns: who were men of great authority among the Jews, and doubted of
the restitution of the kingdom, and of the priesthood, and hurt others
by their example.

[Zechariah 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">zac 6:11</span></span>

Then take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set \[them\] upon the
(m) head of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest;

\(m\) Because this could not be attributed to any one according to the
Law, therefore it follows that Joshua must represent the Messiah, who
was both Priest and King.

[Zechariah 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">zac 6:12</span></span>

And speak to him, saying, Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying,
Behold the man whose name \[is\] The (n) BRANCH; and he shall grow (o)
up out of his place, and he shall (p) build the temple of the LORD:

\(n\) Meaning Christ, of whom Joshua was the figure: for in Greek they
were both called Jesus.

\(o\) That is, of himself without the help of man.

\(p\) Which declares that no one could build this temple of which Haggai
speaks, but only Christ: and therefore it was spiritual, and not
material; ([Hag 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#009)).

[Zechariah 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">zac 6:13</span></span>

Even he shall build the temple of the LORD; and he shall bear the (q)
glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he shall be a priest
upon his throne: and the counsel of peace shall be between (r) them
both.

\(q\) Of which Joshua had but a shadow.

\(r\) The two offices of the kingdom and priesthood, will be joined
together in such a way, that they will no longer be separated.

[Zechariah 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">zac 6:14</span></span>

And the crowns shall be to (s) Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah,
and to (t) Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a (u) memorial in the temple of
the LORD.

\(s\) Who was also called Heldai.

\(t\) He was also called Joshias.

\(u\) That they may acknowledge their infirmity, who thought that all
things would be restored immediately: and of this their infidelity these
two crowns will remain as tokens; ([Act
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#006)).

[Zechariah 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">zac 6:15</span></span>

And they \[that are\] (x) far off shall come and build in the temple of
the LORD, and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me to you.
And \[this\] shall come to pass, if ye will diligently (y) obey the
voice of the LORD your God.

\(x\) That is, the Gentiles by the preaching of the Gospel, will help
toward the building of the spiritual temple.

\(y\) If you will believe and remain in the obedience of faith.
