<p>
<p>(a) By this God declared that he was pleased with Solomon's prayer. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#008">2 Chronicles 7:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">ch2 7:8</A></FONT></span></p>Also at the same time Solomon kept (b) the feast seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt. 
<p>
<p>(b) The feast of the tabernacles which was kept in the seventh month.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">ch2 7:9</A></FONT></span></p>And in the eighth day they (c) made a solemn assembly: for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days. 
<p>
<p>(c) They assembled to hear the word of God, after they had remained seven days in the booths or tabernacles. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#010">2 Chronicles 7:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">ch2 7:10</A></FONT></span></p>And on the (d) three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away into their tents, glad and merry in heart for the goodness that the LORD had shewed unto David, and to Solomon, and to Israel his people. 
<p>
<p>(d) They had permission to depart on the 22nd day, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#066">Kg1 8:66</A>) but they did not leave till the next day.

<p>
<p>(e) I will cause the pestilence to cease and destroy the beasts that hurt the fruit of the earth, and send rain in due season.

<p>
<p>(f) Declaring that God had more concern for their salvation than for the advancement of his own glory: and where men abuse those things which God has appointed to set forth his praise, he withdraws his graces.
