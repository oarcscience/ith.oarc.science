<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">sa1 19:1</A></FONT></span></p>And Saul spake to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they should (a) kill David. 
<p>
<p>(a) Before Saul sought David's life secretly, but now his hypocrisy grows to open cruelty. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#003">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 19:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">sa1 19:3</A></FONT></span></p>And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou (b) [art], and I will commune with my father of thee; and what I see, that I will tell thee. 
<p>
<p>(b) That I may warn you what to do. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#006">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 19:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">sa1 19:6</A></FONT></span></p>And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan: and Saul (c) sware, [As] the LORD liveth, he shall not be slain. 
<p>
<p>(c) Whatever he pretended outwardly, yet his heart was full of malice. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#009">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 19:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">sa1 19:9</A></FONT></span></p>And the evil spirit from the LORD was upon Saul, as he sat in his house with his javelin in his hand: and David (d) played with [his] hand. 
<p>
<p>(d) He played on his harp to appease the rage of the evil spirit, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#023">Sa1 16:23</A>). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#012">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 19:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">sa1 19:12</A></FONT></span></p>So Michal (e) let David down through a window: and he went, and fled, and escaped. 
<p>
<p>(e) Thus God moved both the son and daughter of this tyrant to favour David against their father. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#015">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 19:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">sa1 19:15</A></FONT></span></p>And Saul sent the messengers [again] to see David, saying, Bring him up to me in the (f) bed, that I may slay him. 
<p>
<p>(f) Behold, how the tyrants to accomplish their rage, neither regard oath nor friendship, God nor man.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">sa1 19:18</A></FONT></span></p>So David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in (g) Naioth. 
<p>
<p>(g) Naioth was a school where the word of God was studied, near Ramah. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#020">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 19:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">sa1 19:20</A></FONT></span></p>And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing (h) [as] appointed over them, the Spirit of God was upon the messengers of Saul, and they also (i) prophesied. 
<p>
<p>(h) Being their chief instructor. 
<p>
<p>(i) Changed their minds and praised God.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">sa1 19:23</A></FONT></span></p>And he (k) went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God was upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah. 
<p>
<p>(k) With a mind to persecute them.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">sa1 19:24</A></FONT></span></p>And he stripped off his (l) clothes also, and prophesied before Samuel in like manner, and lay (m) down naked all that day and all that night. Wherefore they say, [Is] Saul also among the prophets? 
<p>
<p>(l) His kingly apparel. 
<p>
<p>(m) He humbled himself as others did.
