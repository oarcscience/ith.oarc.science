### [Revelation Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#001)

[Revelation 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 15:1</span></span>

And (1) I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven (2)
angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath
of God.

\(1\) This is that other passage of the acts of Christ, as I noted
before See [Rev 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#014). Now therefore
is shown a singular work of the judgment of God belonging to the
overthrow of Antichrist and his forces, of which divine work the
preparation is described in this chapter: and the execution in the next.
The preparation is first set down generally and in type in this verse:
and is after particularly set forth in the rest of the chapter. (2) Of
which ([Rev 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#009)) in sending forth the
plagues of the world: for even these plagues do for the most part agree
with those.

[Revelation 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rev 15:2</span></span>

\(3\) And I saw (4) as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and (5)
them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and
over his mark, \[and\] over the number of his name, (6) stand on the sea
of glass, having the harps of God.

\(3\) There are two parts of the narration: one, the confession of the
saints glorifying God, when they saw that preparation of the judgments
of God, to ([Rev 15:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#003)), another the
vocation, instruction, and confirmation of those instruments which God
has ordained for the execution of his judgments, in ([Rev
15:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#005)). (4) This part of the vision
alludes to the sea or large vessel or brass, in which the priests washed
themselves in the entrance of the temple: for in the entrance of the
heavenly temple (as it is called) in ([Rev
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#005)), is said to have been a sea of
glass, most luminous and clear to the commodity of choice mixed with
fire, that is, as containing the treasury of the judgments of God, which
he brings forth and dispenses according to his own pleasure: for out of
the former, the priests were cleansed of old: and out of this the
ungodly are destroyed now in ([Rev
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#006)). (5) That is, the godly martyrs
of Christ, who shall remain faithful even in miracles to that beast; see
([Rev 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#017); ) (6) Glorifying God,
from the particular observation of the weapons and instruments of God's
wrath, floating in the sea of glass.

[Revelation 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rev 15:3</span></span>

And they sing (7) the song of Moses the (a) servant of God, and the song
of the Lamb, saying, (8) Great and marvellous \[are\] thy works, Lord
God Almighty; just and true \[are\] thy (b) ways, thou King of saints.

\(7\) That song of triumph, which is ([Exo
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#002)).

\(a\) So is Moses called for honour's sake, as it is set forth in ([Deu
34:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#010)). (8) This song has two parts:
one a confession, both particular, in this verse, and general, in the
beginning of the next verse ([Rev
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#004)), another, a narration of causes
belonging to the confession, of which one kind is eternal in itself, and
most present to the godly, in that God is both holy and alone God:
another kind is future and to come, in that the elect taken out of the
Gentiles (that is, out of the wicked ones and unbelieving: as in ([Rev
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#002)) were to be brought to the same
state of happiness, by the magnificence of the judgment of God, in ([Rev
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#004)).

\(b\) Thy doings.

[Revelation 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rev 15:5</span></span>

\(9\) And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple of the tabernacle
of the testimony in heaven was opened:

\(9\) The second part of the narration (as was noted in) See [Rev
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#002) in which first the authority of
the whole argument and matter is figured by a forerunning type of a
temple opened in heaven, as in ([Rev
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#019)) namely that all those things
are divine and of God, that proceed from thence in this verse. Secondly,
the administers or executors, come out of the Temple in ([Rev
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#006)). Thirdly, they are furnished
with instruments of the judgments of God, and weapons fit for the manner
of the same judgments; ([Rev 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#007)).
Finally, they are confirmed by testimony of the visible glory of God, in
([Rev 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#008)). A similar testimony to
which was exhibited of old in the law; ([Exo
40:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#034)).

[Revelation 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rev 15:6</span></span>

And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the (10) seven
plagues, clothed in (11) pure and white linen, and having their breasts
(12) girded with golden girdles.

\(10\) That is, commandments to inflict those seven plagues, by way of
metonymy.

\(11\) Which was in old time a sign of the kingly or princely dignity.

\(12\) This girding was a sign of diligence, and the girdle of gold was
a sign of sincerity and trustworthiness in taking in charge the
commandments of God.

[Revelation 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rev 15:7</span></span>

And one of the (13) four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden
vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever.

\(13\) Of these before ([Rev 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#007)).

[Revelation 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rev 15:8</span></span>

And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his
power; (14) and no man was able to enter into the temple, till the seven
plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled.

\(14\) None of those seven angels could return, till he had performed
fully the charge committed to him, according to the decree of God.
