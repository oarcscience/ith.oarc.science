<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">eze 12:2</A></FONT></span></p>Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house, who have eyes to see, and see (a) not; they have ears to hear, and hear not: for they [are] a rebellious house. 
<p>
<p>(a) That is, they receive not the fruit of that which they see and hear.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#006">Ezekiel 12:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">eze 12:6</A></FONT></span></p>In their sight shalt thou bear [it] upon [thy] shoulders, [and] carry [it] forth in the twilight: thou shalt cover thy face, that thou mayest not see the ground: for I have set thee [for] a (b) sign to the house of Israel. 
<p>
<p>(b) That as you do, so shall they do, and therefore in you they will see their own plague and punishment.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#009">Ezekiel 12:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">eze 12:9</A></FONT></span></p>Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said to thee, What (c) doest thou? 
<p>
<p>(c) Do they not deride your doings?  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#013">Ezekiel 12:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">eze 12:13</A></FONT></span></p>My net also will I spread upon (d) him, and he shall be taken in my snare: and I will bring him to Babylon [to] the land of the Chaldeans; yet shall he not see it, though he shall die there. 
<p>
<p>(d) When the king will think to escape by fleeing, I will take him into my net, as in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#003">Eze 32:3</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#016">Ezekiel 12:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">eze 12:16</A></FONT></span></p>But I will leave a (e) few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence; that they may declare all their abominations among the nations where they come; and they shall know that I [am] the LORD. 
<p>
<p>(e) Who would bear his Name, and would be his Church.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">eze 12:22</A></FONT></span></p>Son of man, what [is] that proverb [that] ye have in the land of Israel, saying, The days (f) are prolonged, and every vision faileth? 
<p>
<p>(f) Because they did not immediately see the prophecies accomplished, they contemned them as though they would never be fulfilled.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#027">Ezekiel 12:27</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_027">eze 12:27</A></FONT></span></p>Son of man, behold, [they of] the house of Israel say, The vision that he seeth [is] for (g) many days [to come], and he prophesieth of the times [that are] distant. 
<p>
<p>(g) That is, it will not come to pass in our days, and therefore we care not for it: thus the wicked ever abuse God's patience and benignity.
