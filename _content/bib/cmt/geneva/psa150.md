### [Psalms Chapter 150](../../../bib/kjv/psa150.htm#001)

[Psalms 150:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa150.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 150:1</span></span>

Praise ye the LORD. Praise God in his (a) sanctuary: praise him in the
(b) firmament of his power.

\(a\) That is, in the heaven.

\(b\) For his wonderful power appears in the firmament, which in Hebrew
is called a stretching out, or spreading abroad, in which the mighty
work of God shines.

[Psalms 150:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa150.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 150:3</span></span>

Praise him with the sound of the (c) trumpet: praise him with the
psaltery and harp.

\(c\) Exhorting the people only to rejoice in praising God, he makes
mention of those instruments which by God's commandment were appointed
in the old law. (Ed.)

[Psalms 150:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa150.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 150:6</span></span>

Let every thing that hath (d) breath praise the LORD. Praise ye the
LORD.

\(d\) He shows that all the order of nature is bound to this duty, and
much more God's children, who ought never to cease to praise him, till
they are gathered into that kingdom, which he has prepared for his,
where they will sing everlasting praise.
