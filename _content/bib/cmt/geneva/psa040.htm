<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#001">Psalms 40:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">psa 40:1</A></FONT></span></p>"To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David." I waited (a) patiently for the LORD; and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry. 
<p>
<p>(a) Though God deferred his help, yet he patiently abode till he was heard.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#002">Psalms 40:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">psa 40:2</A></FONT></span></p>He brought me up also out of an (b) horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, [and] established my goings. 
<p>
<p>(b) He has delivered me from great dangers.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#003">Psalms 40:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">psa 40:3</A></FONT></span></p>And he hath put (c) a new song in my mouth, [even] praise unto our God: many shall see [it], and fear, and shall trust in the LORD. 
<p>
<p>(c) That is, a special opportunity to praise him, for God's benefits are so many opportunities for us to praise his Name.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#004">Psalms 40:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">psa 40:4</A></FONT></span></p>Blessed [is] that man that maketh the LORD his trust, and respecteth (d) not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies. 
<p>
<p>(d) To follow their example, which he must do who trusts not only in the Lord.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#005">Psalms 40:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">psa 40:5</A></FONT></span></p>Many, (e) O LORD my God, [are] thy wonderful works [which] thou hast done, and thy thoughts [which are] to us-ward: they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee: [if] I would declare and speak [of them], they are more than can be numbered. 
<p>
<p>(e) David goes from one king of God's favour to the contemplation of his providence over all, and confesses that his counsels toward us are far above our capacities, we cannot so much as tell them in order.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006">Psalms 40:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">psa 40:6</A></FONT></span></p>Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; (f) mine ears hast thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required. 
<p>
<p>(f) You have opened my ears to understand the spiritual meaning of the sacrifices: and here David esteems the ceremonies of the law as nothing in respect to the spiritual service.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#007">Psalms 40:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">psa 40:7</A></FONT></span></p>(g) Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book [it is] written of me, 
<p>
<p>(g) When you had opened my ears and heart, I was ready to obey you, being assured that I was written in the book of your elect for this end.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#009">Psalms 40:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">psa 40:9</A></FONT></span></p>I have preached righteousness in the (h) great congregation: lo, I have not refrained my lips, O LORD, thou knowest. 
<p>
<p>(h) In the Church assembled in the sanctuary.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#010">Psalms 40:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">psa 40:10</A></FONT></span></p>I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy (i) faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation. 
<p>
<p>(i) David here numbers three degrees of our salvation: God's mercy, by which he pities us, his righteousness which signifies his continual protection and his truth, by which appears his constant favour, so that from this our salvation proceeds.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#012">Psalms 40:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">psa 40:12</A></FONT></span></p>For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of mine head: therefore my heart (k) faileth me. 
<p>
<p>(k) Concerning the judgment of the flesh, I was utterly destitute of all counsel, yet faith inwardly moved my heart to pray.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#014">Psalms 40:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">psa 40:14</A></FONT></span></p>Let them be (l) ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil. 
<p>
<p>(l) He desires that God's mercy may contend for him against the rage of his enemies.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#015">Psalms 40:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">psa 40:15</A></FONT></span></p>Let them be (m) desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto me, Aha, aha. 
<p>
<p>(m) Let the same shame and confusion come on them, which they intended to have brought on me.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#016">Psalms 40:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">psa 40:16</A></FONT></span></p>Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let such as love thy salvation say continually, (n) The LORD be magnified. 
<p>
<p>(n) As the faithful always praise God for his benefits, so the wicked mocked God's children in their afflictions.
