<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">job 28:1</A></FONT></span></p>Surely there is a vein for the silver, (a) and a place for gold [where] they fine [it]. 
<p>
<p>(a) His purpose is to declare that man may attain in this world to various secrets of nature, but man is never able to comprehend the wisdom of God.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#003">Job 28:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">job 28:3</A></FONT></span></p>He setteth an end to darkness, (b) and searcheth out all perfection: the stones of darkness, and the shadow of death. 
<p>
<p>(b) There is nothing but it is compassed within certain limits, and has an end, but God's wisdom.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#004">Job 28:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">job 28:4</A></FONT></span></p>The flood breaketh out from the (c) inhabitant; [even the waters] (d) forgotten of the foot: they are dried up, they are gone away from men. 
<p>
<p>(c) Meaning, him that dwells by it.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#005">Job 28:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">job 28:5</A></FONT></span></p>[As for] the earth, out of it cometh (e) bread: and under it is turned up as it were fire. 
<p>
<p>(e) That is, come and underneath is brimstone or coal, which easily conceives fire.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#006">Job 28:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">job 28:6</A></FONT></span></p>The stones of it [are] the place (f) of sapphires: and it hath dust of gold. 
<p>
<p>(f) He alludes to the mines and secrets of nature, which are under the earth, into which neither souls nor beasts can enter.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#009">Job 28:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">job 28:9</A></FONT></span></p>He putteth forth his hand upon the (g) rock; he overturneth the mountains by the roots. 
<p>
<p>(g) After he has declared the wisdom of God in the secrets of nature he describes his power.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#012">Job 28:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">job 28:12</A></FONT></span></p>But where shall wisdom be found? (h) and where [is] the place of understanding? 
<p>
<p>(h) Though God's power and wisdom may be understood in earthly things, yet his heavenly wisdom cannot be attained to.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#013">Job 28:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">job 28:13</A></FONT></span></p>Man knoweth not (i) the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living. 
<p>
<p>(i) It is too high a thing for man to attain to in this world.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#015">Job 28:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">job 28:15</A></FONT></span></p>It cannot be gotten for (k) gold, neither shall silver be weighed [for] the price thereof. 
<p>
<p>(k) It can neither be bought for gold nor precious stones, but is only the gift of God.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#018">Job 28:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">job 28:18</A></FONT></span></p>No mention shall be made of coral, or of (l) pearls: for the price of wisdom [is] above rubies. 
<p>
<p>(l) Which was thought to be a king of precious stone.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#021">Job 28:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">job 28:21</A></FONT></span></p>Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the (m) fowls of the air. 
<p>
<p>(m) Meaning that there is no natural means by which man can attain heavenly wisdom: which he means by the souls, that fly high.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#023">Job 28:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">job 28:23</A></FONT></span></p>God understandeth the (n) way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof.
