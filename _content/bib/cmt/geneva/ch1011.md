<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 11:1</span></span>

Then all Israel (a) gathered themselves to David unto Hebron, saying,
Behold, we \[are\] thy bone and thy flesh.

And this \[is\] the number of the mighty men whom David had; Jashobeam,
an Hachmonite, the (b) chief of the captains: he lifted up his spear
against three hundred slain \[by him\] at one time.

And they set themselves in the midst of \[that\] parcel, (c) and

great deliverance.

the valley of Rephaim.

And said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing: shall I
drink the (e) blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy?
for with \[the jeopardy of\] their lives they brought it. Therefore he
would not drink it. These things did these three mightiest.

\(e\) That is, this water, for which they risked their lives.

[1 Chronicles 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#025)

\[first\] three: and David set him over his guard.
