### [Isaiah Chapter 49](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#001)

[Isaiah 49:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 49:1</span></span>

Listen, to me O isles; and hearken, ye people, from far; The LORD hath
called (a) me from (b) the womb; from the body of my mother hath he made
mention of my name.

\(a\) This is spoken in the person of Christ, to assure the faithful
that these promises should come to pass: for they were all made in him
and in him would be performed.

\(b\) This is meant of the time that Christ would be manifested to the
world, as in ([Psa 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#007)).

[Isaiah 49:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 49:2</span></span>

And he hath made my mouth like a sharp (c) sword; in the shadow of his
hand hath he (d) hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his quiver
hath he hid me;

\(c\) By the sword and shaft, he signifies the virtue and efficacy of
Christ's doctrine.

\(d\) God has taken me to his protection and defence: this chiefly is
meant of Christ, and may also be applied to the ministers of his word.

[Isaiah 49:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 49:3</span></span>

And said to me, Thou \[art\] my servant, O (e) Israel, in whom I will be
glorified.

\(e\) By Israel is meant Christ, and all the body of the faithful, as
the members and their head.

[Isaiah 49:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 49:4</span></span>

Then I said, I have (f) laboured in vain, I have spent my strength for
nothing, and in vain: \[yet\] surely my judgment \[is\] with the LORD,
and my work with my God.

\(f\) Thus Christ in his members complains that his labour and preaching
take no effect, yet he is contented that his doings are approved by God.

[Isaiah 49:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 49:5</span></span>

And now, saith the LORD that formed me from the womb \[to be\] his
servant, to bring Jacob again to him, Though Israel be not gathered, (g)
yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the LORD, and my God shall be my
strength.

\(g\) Though the Jews refuse my doctrine, yet God will approve my
ministry.

[Isaiah 49:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 49:6</span></span>

And he said, It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to
raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I
will also give (h) thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be
my salvation to the end of the earth.

\(h\) To declare my gospel to the Gentiles, as in ([Isa
42:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#006); [Act
13:47](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#047); [Luk
2:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#032)).

[Isaiah 49:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 49:7</span></span>

Thus saith the LORD, the Redeemer of Israel, \[and\] his Holy One, to
him whom man despiseth, to him whom the nation abhorreth, to a (i)
servant of rulers, Kings shall see and (k) arise, princes also shall
worship, because of the LORD that is faithful, \[and\] the Holy One of
Israel, and he shall choose thee.

\(i\) Meaning, the Jews whom tyrants kept in bondage.

\(k\) The benefit of their deliverance will be so great, that great and
small will acknowledge it, and revere God for it.

[Isaiah 49:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 49:8</span></span>

Thus saith the LORD, (l) In an acceptable time have I heard thee, and in
a day of salvation have I helped thee: and I will preserve thee, and
give (m) thee for a covenant of the people, to establish the (n) earth,
to cause to inherit the desolate heritages;

\(l\) Thus he speaks of his Church when he would show his mercy toward
it, ([Co2 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#002)).

\(m\) Meaning, Christ alone.

\(n\) Signifying that before Christ renewed the earth by his word, there
is nothing but confusion and disorder.

[Isaiah 49:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 49:9</span></span>

That thou mayest say to the (o) prisoners, Go forth; to them that
\[are\] in darkness, Show yourselves. They shall feed in the ways, and
their (p) pastures \[shall be\] in all high places.

\(o\) To them who are in the prison of sin and death.

\(p\) Being in Christ's protection, they will be safe against all
dangers, and free from fear of the enemies.

[Isaiah 49:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 49:10</span></span>

They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun smite
them: for he that hath mercy (q) on them shall lead them, even by the
springs of water shall he guide them.

\(q\) Meaning, that there would be nothing in their way from Babylon
that would hinder or hurt them: but this is accomplished spiritually.

[Isaiah 49:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 49:12</span></span>

Behold, these shall come from far: and, lo, these from the north and
from the west; and these from the land of (r) Sinim.

\(r\) Meaning, the south country, so that Christ will deliver his from
all the parts of the world.

[Isaiah 49:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 49:13</span></span>

Sing, O (s) heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into
singing, O mountains: for the LORD hath comforted his people, and will
have mercy upon his afflicted.

\(s\) Read ([Isa 44:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#023)).

[Isaiah 49:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 49:14</span></span>

But Zion said, The LORD hath (t) forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten
me.

\(t\) He objects what the faithful might say in their long affliction
and answers to comfort them with a most proper comparison and full of
consolation.

[Isaiah 49:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 49:16</span></span>

Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of \[my\] (u) hands; thy (x)
walls \[are\] continually before me.

\(u\) Because I would not forget you.

\(x\) Meaning, the good order of policy and discipline.

[Isaiah 49:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 49:17</span></span>

Thy children shall make (y) haste; thy destroyers and they that made
thee waste shall go forth from thee.

\(y\) I have continual care to build you up again and to destroy your
enemies.

[Isaiah 49:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 49:18</span></span>

Lift up thy eyes around, and behold: all these gather themselves
together, \[and\] come to thee. \[As\] I live, saith the LORD, thou
shalt surely (z) clothe thee with them all, as with an ornament, and
bind them \[on thee\], as a bride \[doeth\].

\(z\) He shows what are the ornaments of the Church: to have many
children, who are assembled by the word of God, and governed by his
Spirit.

[Isaiah 49:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 49:22</span></span>

Thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I will lift up my hand to the (a)
Gentiles, and set up my standard to the people: and they shall bring thy
sons in \[their\] arms, and thy daughters shall be carried upon
\[their\] shoulders.

\(a\) He shows that Christ will not only gather this great number from
the Jews but also from the Gentiles.

[Isaiah 49:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">isa 49:23</span></span>

And kings (b) shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy nursing
mothers: they shall bow to thee with \[their\] face toward the earth,
and lick up the (c) dust of thy feet; and thou shalt know that I \[am\]
the LORD: for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me.

\(b\) Meaning, that kings will be converted to the gospel, and bestow
their power and authority for the preservation of the Church.

\(c\) Being joined with the Church, they will humble themselves to
Christ their head, and give him all honour.

[Isaiah 49:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">isa 49:24</span></span>

Shall the prey be (d) taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive
delivered?

\(d\) He makes this as an objection as though the Chaldeans were strong,
and had them in just possession.

[Isaiah 49:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">isa 49:25</span></span>

But thus saith the LORD, (e) Even the captives of the mighty shall be
taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered: for I will
contend with him that contendeth with thee, and I will save thy
children.

\(e\) This is the answer to their objection, that no one is stronger
than the Lord, neither has a more just title to them.

[Isaiah 49:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">isa 49:26</span></span>

And I will feed them that oppress thee with (f) their own flesh; and
they shall be drunk with their own blood, as with sweet wine: and all
flesh shall know that I the LORD \[am\] thy Saviour and thy Redeemer,
the mighty One of Jacob.

\(f\) I will cause them to destroy one another as in ([Jdg
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#022); [Ch2
20:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#022); [Isa
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#002)).
