<p>
<p>(a) To that part which is in the forefront of the candlestick, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#037">Exo 25:37</A>).

<p>
<p>(b) And not set together of various pieces.

<p>
<p>(c) In Hebrew it is called the water of sin, because it is made to purge sin, as in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#009">Num 19:9</A>).

<p>
<p>(d) That you may do this in the presence of them all.

<p>
<p>(g) Which the Israelites should do. 
<p>
<p>(h) Because the levites go into the sanctuary in their name.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">num 8:22</A></FONT></span></p>And after that went the Levites in to do their service in the tabernacle of the congregation (i) before Aaron, and before his sons: as the LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did they unto them. 
<p>
<p>(i) In their presence to serve them.

<p>
<p>(k) Such office as was painful, as to bear burdens and such like.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#026">Numbers 8:26</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_026">num 8:26</A></FONT></span></p>But shall minister (l) with their brethren in the tabernacle of the congregation, to keep the charge, and shall do no service. Thus shalt thou do unto the Levites touching their charge. 
<p>
<p>(l) In singing Psalms, instructing, counselling and keeping the things in order.
