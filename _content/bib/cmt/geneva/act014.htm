<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#001">Acts 14:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">act 14:1</A></FONT></span></p>And (1) it came to pass in (a) Iconium, that they went both together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake, that a great multitude both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed. 
<p>
<p>(1) We should be no less constant in the preaching of the Gospel than the perversity of the wicked is obstinate in persecuting it. 
<p>
<p>(a) Iconium was a city of Lycaonia.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#002">Acts 14:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">act 14:2</A></FONT></span></p>But the (b) unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their minds evil affected against the brethren. 
<p>
<p>(b) Who did not obey the doctrine.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#003">Acts 14:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">act 14:3</A></FONT></span></p>(2) Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord, which gave testimony unto the word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands. 
<p>
<p>(2) We should not leave our places and give in to threatenings, or to open rage, but only when there is no other remedy, and that not for our own peace and quiet, but only so that the Gospel may be spread further abroad.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#006">Acts 14:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">act 14:6</A></FONT></span></p>They were ware of [it], and (c) fled unto Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and unto the region that lieth round about: 
<p>
<p>(c) It is sometimes proper to flee dangers, at the appropriate times.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#008">Acts 14:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">act 14:8</A></FONT></span></p>(3) And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet, being a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked: 
<p>
<p>(3) It is an old subtlety of the devil, either to cause the faithful servants of God to be immediately banished, or to be worshipped as idols: and he does this by taking occasion of miracles which they have done.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#013">Acts 14:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">act 14:13</A></FONT></span></p>Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city, brought oxen and garlands unto the (d) gates, and would have done sacrifice with the people. 
<p>
<p>(d) Of the house where Paul and Barnabas were.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#015">Acts 14:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">act 14:15</A></FONT></span></p>(4) And saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of (e) like passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn from these (f) vanities unto the living God, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein: 
<p>
<p>(4) That is also called idolatry which gives to creatures, be they ever so holy and excellent, that which is proper to the only One God, that is, invocation, or calling upon. 
<p>
<p>(e) Men, as you are, and partakers of the very same nature of man as you are. 
<p>
<p>(f) He calls idols "vanities", after the manner of the Hebrews.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#016">Acts 14:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">act 14:16</A></FONT></span></p>(5) Who in times past (g) suffered all nations to walk in their own ways. 
<p>
<p>(5) Custom, be it ever so old, does not excuse the idolaters. 
<p>
<p>(g) Allowed them to live as they wished, prescribing and appointing them no type of religion.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#019">Acts 14:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">act 14:19</A></FONT></span></p>(6) And there came thither [certain] Jews from Antioch and Iconium, who persuaded the people, and, having stoned Paul, drew [him] out of the city, supposing he had been dead. 
<p>
<p>(6) The devil, when he is brought to his last chance, at length rages openly, but in vain, even at that time when he seems to have the upper hand.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#021">Acts 14:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">act 14:21</A></FONT></span></p>(7) And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and [to] Iconium, and Antioch, 
<p>
<p>(7) We must go forward in our calling through a thousand deaths.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#022">Acts 14:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">act 14:22</A></FONT></span></p>(8) Confirming the souls of the disciples, [and] exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God. 
<p>
<p>(8) It is the office of the ministers, not only to teach, but also to confirm those that are taught, and prepare them for the cross.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#023">Acts 14:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">act 14:23</A></FONT></span></p>(9) And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed. 
<p>
<p>(9) The apostles committed the churches which they had planted to proper and special pastors, who they appointed not rashly, but with prayers and fastings preceding their choice: neither did they thrust them upon churches through bribery, or lordly superiority, but chose and placed them by the voice of the congregation.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#024">Acts 14:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">act 14:24</A></FONT></span></p>(10) And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia. 
<p>
<p>(10) Paul and Barnabas, having completed their journey, and having returned to Antioch, give an account of their journey to the congregation or church.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#025">Acts 14:25</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_025">act 14:25</A></FONT></span></p>And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down into (h) Attalia: 
<p>
<p>(h) Attalia was a sea city of Pamphylia, near to Lycia.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#026">Acts 14:26</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_026">act 14:26</A></FONT></span></p>And thence sailed to (i) Antioch, from whence they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled. 
<p>
<p>(i) Antioch of Syria.
