<p>
<p>(h) That is, more extremely.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#019">Leviticus 26:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">lev 26:19</A></FONT></span></p>And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as (i) iron, and your earth as brass:

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_036">lev 26:36</A></FONT></span></p>And upon them that are left [alive] of you I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall (s) flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth. 
<p>
<p>(s) As if their enemies chased them.

<p>
<p>(t) In that, as they are blameworthy of their fathers faults, they shall be punished as well as their fathers.

<p>
<p>(u) While they are captives, and without repentance.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#045">Leviticus 26:45</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_045">lev 26:45</A></FONT></span></p>But I will for their sakes remember the (x) covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God: I [am] the LORD. 
<p>
<p>(x) Made to their forefathers.
