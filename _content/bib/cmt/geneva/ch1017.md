Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the
LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, (g) \[even\] from

cease.

[1 Chronicles 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch1 17:13</span></span>

I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my
