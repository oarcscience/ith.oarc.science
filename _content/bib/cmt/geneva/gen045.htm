<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">gen 45:1</A></FONT></span></p>Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him; and he cried, (a) Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren. 
<p>
<p>(a) Not because he was ashamed of his kindred, but rather because he wanted to cover his brother's sin.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#005">Genesis 45:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">gen 45:5</A></FONT></span></p>Now therefore be not (b) grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life. 
<p>
<p>(b) This example teaches that we must by all means comfort those who are truly ashamed and sorry for their sins.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#008">Genesis 45:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">gen 45:8</A></FONT></span></p>So now [it was] not you [that] sent me hither, but (c) God: and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt. 
<p>
<p>(c) Though God detests sin, yet he turns man's wickedness into his glory.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#012">Genesis 45:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">gen 45:12</A></FONT></span></p>And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that [it is] (d) my mouth that speaketh unto you. 
<p>
<p>(d) That is, that I speak in your own language and have no interpreter.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#018">Genesis 45:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">gen 45:18</A></FONT></span></p>And take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will give you the (e) good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the (f) fat of the land. 
<p>
<p>(e) The most plentiful ground. 
<p>
<p>(f) The main fruits and conveniences.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#024">Genesis 45:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">gen 45:24</A></FONT></span></p>So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See that ye (g) fall not out by the way. 
<p>
<p>(g) Seeing he had remitted the fault done to him, he did not want them to accuse one another.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#026">Genesis 45:26</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_026">gen 45:26</A></FONT></span></p>And told him, saying, Joseph [is] yet alive, and he [is] governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's heart (h) fainted, for he believed them not. 
<p>
<p>(h) As one between hope and fear.
