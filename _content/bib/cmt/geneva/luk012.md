### [Luke Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#001)

[Luke 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 12:1</span></span>

In (1) the mean time, when there were gathered together (a) an
innumerable multitude of people, insomuch that they trode one upon
another, he began to say unto his disciples first of all, Beware ye of
the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.

\(1\) The faithful teachers of God's word, who are appointed by him for
his people, must both take good heed of those who corrupt the purity of
doctrine with smooth speech, and also take pains through the help of God
to set forth sincere doctrine, openly and without fear.

\(a\) Literally, "ten thousand of people", a certain number which is
given for an uncertain number.

[Luke 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">luk 12:4</span></span>

\(2\) And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill the
body, and after that have no more that they can do.

\(2\) Although hypocrites have princes to execute their cruelty, yet
there is no reason why we should be afraid of them, even by the smallest
amount that may be, seeing that they can do nothing except that which
pleases God, and God does not will anything that may be against the
salvation of his elect.

[Luke 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">luk 12:5</span></span>

But I will (b) forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which after he
hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him.

\(b\) He warns them of dangers that presently hang over their heads, for
those that come upon one suddenly make a greater wound.

[Luke 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">luk 12:8</span></span>

\(3\) Also I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him
shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God:

\(3\) Great is the reward of a constant confession: and horrible is the
punishment for denying Christ; yea, it will be impossible to call the
punishment back again, if on purpose, both with mouth and heart we
blaspheme a known truth.

[Luke 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">luk 12:11</span></span>

\(4\) And when they bring you unto the synagogues, and \[unto\]
magistrates, and powers, take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall
answer, or what ye shall say:

\(4\) It is a great and difficult conflict to confess the truth, yet God
who can do all things and is almighty will provide strength to the
weakest who struggle greatly and do battle in God's appointed time.

[Luke 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">luk 12:13</span></span>

\(5\) And one of the company said unto him, Master, speak to my brother,
that he divide the inheritance with me.

\(5\) For three reasons Christ would not be a judge to divide an
inheritance. First, because he would not support and uphold the fleshly
opinion that the Jews had of Messiah: secondly, because he wanted to
distinguish the civil government from the ecclesiastical: thirdly, to
teach us to beware of those which abuse the show of the gospel, and also
the name of ministers, for their own private well-being.

[Luke 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">luk 12:15</span></span>

And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of (c) covetousness: for a
man's life (d) consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he
possesseth.

\(c\) By covetousness is meant that greedy desire to get, commonly
causing hurt to other men.

\(d\) God is the author and preserver of man's life; goods are not.

[Luke 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">luk 12:16</span></span>

\(6\) And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The (e) ground of a
certain rich man brought forth plentifully:

\(6\) There are none more mad than rich men who depend upon their
riches.

\(e\) Or rather country, for here is set forth a man that possesses not
only a piece of ground, but a whole country, as they do who join house
to house, and field to field; ([Isa
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#008)).

[Luke 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">luk 12:17</span></span>

And he (f) thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I
have no room where to bestow my fruits?

\(f\) Reckoned with himself, which is the characteristic of covetous
surly men who spend their life in those trifles.

[Luke 12:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">luk 12:19</span></span>

And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many
years; take thine ease, eat, drink, \[and\] (g) be merry.

\(g\) Be merry and make good cheer.

[Luke 12:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">luk 12:21</span></span>

So \[is\] he that layeth up treasure (h) for himself, and is not rich
toward God.

\(h\) Caring for no man but for himself, and making sure to trust in
himself.

[Luke 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">luk 12:22</span></span>

\(7\) And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Take no
thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the body, what ye
shall put on.

\(7\) Earnestly thinking upon the providence of God is a present remedy
for this life against the most foolish and wasting worry of men.

[Luke 12:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">luk 12:29</span></span>

And seek not ye what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, neither (i)
be ye of doubtful mind.

\(i\) A metaphor taken of things that hang in the air, for those that
care too much for this worldly life, and rely upon the arm of man,
always have wavering and doubtful minds, swaying sometimes this way, and
sometimes that way.

[Luke 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">luk 12:31</span></span>

\(8\) But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things shall
be added unto you.

\(8\) They will lack nothing who are diligent for the kingdom of heaven.

[Luke 12:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">luk 12:32</span></span>

\(9\) Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to
give you the kingdom.

\(9\) It is a foolish thing not to look for small things at the hands of
him who freely gives us the greatest things.

[Luke 12:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">luk 12:33</span></span>

\(10\) Sell that ye have, and give (k) alms; provide yourselves bags
which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no
thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth.

\(10\) A godly bountifulness is a proper way to get true riches.

\(k\) This is the figure of speech metonymy, for by this word "alms" is
meant that compassion and friendliness of a heart that cares tenderly
for the misery and poor condition of a man, and shows this feeling by
some gift, and has the name given to it in the Greek language of mercy
and compassion: and therefore he is said to give alms who gives
something to another, and gives to the poor, showing by this that he
pities their poor condition.

[Luke 12:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">luk 12:35</span></span>

\(11\) Let your loins be girded about, and \[your\] lights burning;

\(11\) The life of the faithful servants of God in this world is
certainly a diligent journey, having the light of the word going before
the journey.

[Luke 12:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">luk 12:40</span></span>

\(12\) Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of man cometh at an hour
when ye think not.

\(12\) None need to watch more than they that have some degree of honour
in the household of God.

[Luke 12:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">luk 12:42</span></span>

And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward, whom
\[his\] lord shall make ruler over his household, to give \[them their\]
(l) portion of meat in due season?

\(l\) That is, every month the measure of corn that was given to them.

[Luke 12:48](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#048)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">luk 12:48</span></span>

But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be
beaten with few \[stripes\]. For unto whomsoever much is given, of him
shall be much required: and to whom men have committed much, of him they
will ask (m) the more.

\(m\) More than the one who did not receive as much.

[Luke 12:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#049)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">luk 12:49</span></span>

\(13\) I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it be
already kindled?

\(13\) The gospel is the only reason of peace between the godly, and so
it is the occasion of great trouble among the wicked.

[Luke 12:54](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#054)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">luk 12:54</span></span>

\(14\) And he said also to the people, When ye see a cloud (n) rise out
of the west, straightway ye say, There cometh a shower; and so it is.

\(14\) Men who are very quick to see with regard to earthly things are
blind with regard to those things which pertain to the heavenly life,
and this through their own malice.

\(n\) Which appears, and gathers itself together in that part of the
air.

[Luke 12:57](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#057)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_057">luk 12:57</span></span>

\(15\) Yea, and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right?

\(15\) Men that are blinded with the love of themselves, and therefore
are detestable and stubborn, will bear the punishment of their folly.

[Luke 12:58](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#058)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_058">luk 12:58</span></span>

When thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate, \[as thou art\]
in the way, give diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him; lest
he hale thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the (o)
officer, and the officer cast thee into prison.

\(o\) To him that has to demand and gather the fines from those who were
fined at the discretion of the court, people who had wrongly troubled
men: moreover, the magistrate's officers make those who are condemned
pay what they owe, yea and often if they are obstinate, they not only
take the fine, but also imprison them.
