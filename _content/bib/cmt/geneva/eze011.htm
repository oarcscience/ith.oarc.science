<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#003">Ezekiel 11:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">eze 11:3</A></FONT></span></p>Who say, (a) [It is] not near; let us build houses: this [city is] the (b) caldron, and we [are] the flesh. 
<p>
<p>(a) Thus the wicked derided the prophets as though they preached only errors, and therefore gave themselves still to their pleasures. 
<p>
<p>(b) We will not be pulled out of Jerusalem, till the hour of our death comes, as the flesh is not taken out of the caldron until it is boiled.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#007">Ezekiel 11:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">eze 11:7</A></FONT></span></p>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it, they [are] (c) the flesh, and this [city is] the caldron: but I will bring you forth out of the midst of it. 
<p>
<p>(c) Contrary to their vain confidence he shows in what sense the city is the caldron: that is, because of the dead bodies that have been murdered in it, and so lit as flesh in the caldron.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#009">Ezekiel 11:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">eze 11:9</A></FONT></span></p>And I will bring you out of the midst of it, and deliver you into (d) the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you. 
<p>
<p>(d) That is, of the Chaldeans.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#010">Ezekiel 11:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">eze 11:10</A></FONT></span></p>Ye shall fall by the sword; I will judge you in the border of (e) Israel; and ye shall know that I [am] the LORD. 
<p>
<p>(e) That is, in Riblah, read (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#006">Kg2 25:6</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#013">Ezekiel 11:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">eze 11:13</A></FONT></span></p>And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of (f) Benaiah died. Then I fell down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel? 
<p>
<p>(f) It seems that this noble man died of some terrible death, and therefore the prophet feared some strange judgment of God toward the rest of the people.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#015">Ezekiel 11:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">eze 11:15</A></FONT></span></p>Son of man, thy (g) brethren, [even] thy brethren, the men of thy kindred, and all the house of Israel wholly, [are] they to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Retire far from the LORD: to us is this land given in possession. 
<p>
<p>(g) They that remained at Jerusalem thus reproached them that were gone into captivity as though they were cast off and forsaken by God.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#016">Ezekiel 11:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">eze 11:16</A></FONT></span></p>Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Although I have cast them far off among the nations, and although I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them as a little (h) sanctuary in the countries where they shall come. 
<p>
<p>(h) They will be yet a little church: showing that the Lord will ever have some to call on his Name, whom he will preserve and restore, though they are for a time afflicted.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#019">Ezekiel 11:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">eze 11:19</A></FONT></span></p>And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the (i) stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them an heart of flesh: 
<p>
<p>(i) Meaning, the heart to which nothing can enter and regenerate them anew, so that their heart may be soft and ready to receive my graces.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#025">Ezekiel 11:25</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_025">eze 11:25</A></FONT></span></p>Then I spoke to them of the (k) captivity all the things that the LORD had shown me. 
<p>
<p>(k) When Jeconiah was led away captive.
