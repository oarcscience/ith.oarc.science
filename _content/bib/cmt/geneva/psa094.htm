<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#001">Psalms 94:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">psa 94:1</A></FONT></span></p>O LORD God, to whom (a) vengeance belongeth; O God, to whom vengeance belongeth, (b) shew thyself. 
<p>
<p>(a) Whose office it is to take vengeance on the wicked. 
<p>
<p>(b) Show by effect that you are judge of the world to punish the wicked.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#003">Psalms 94:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">psa 94:3</A></FONT></span></p>LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked (c) triumph? 
<p>
<p>(c) That is, brag of their cruelty and oppression, or esteem themselves above all others.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#005">Psalms 94:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">psa 94:5</A></FONT></span></p>They (d) break in pieces thy people, O LORD, and afflict thine heritage. 
<p>
<p>(d) Seeing the Church was then so sore oppressed, it ought not to seem strange to us, if we see it so now, and therefore we must call to God, to take our cause in hand.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#007">Psalms 94:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">psa 94:7</A></FONT></span></p>(e) Yet they say, The LORD shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob regard [it]. 
<p>
<p>(e) He shows that they are desperate in malice, as they did not fear God, but gave themselves wholly to do wickedly.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#009">Psalms 94:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">psa 94:9</A></FONT></span></p>He that (f) planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the eye, shall he not see? 
<p>
<p>(f) He shows that it is impossible, but God should hear, see, and understand their wickedness.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#010">Psalms 94:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">psa 94:10</A></FONT></span></p>He that chastiseth the (g) heathen, shall not he correct? he that teacheth man knowledge, [shall not he know]? 
<p>
<p>(g) If God punishes whole nations for their sins, it is mere folly for any one man or else a few to think that God will spare them.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#012">Psalms 94:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">psa 94:12</A></FONT></span></p>Blessed [is] the man whom thou (h) chastenest, O LORD, and teachest him out of thy law; 
<p>
<p>(h) God has care over his, and chastised them for their own good, that they should not perish for ever with the wicked.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#015">Psalms 94:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">psa 94:15</A></FONT></span></p>But (i) judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all the upright in heart shall follow it. 
<p>
<p>(i) God will restore the state and government of things to their right use, and then the godly will follow him cheerfully.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#017">Psalms 94:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">psa 94:17</A></FONT></span></p>Unless the LORD [had been] my (k) help, my soul had almost dwelt in silence. 
<p>
<p>(k) He complains of them who would not help him to resist the enemies, yet was assured that God's help would not fail.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#018">Psalms 94:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">psa 94:18</A></FONT></span></p>When I said, (l) My foot slippeth; thy mercy, O LORD, held me up. 
<p>
<p>(l) When I thought there was no way but death.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#019">Psalms 94:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">psa 94:19</A></FONT></span></p>In the multitude of my (m) thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul. 
<p>
<p>(m) In my trouble and distress I always found your present help.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#020">Psalms 94:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">psa 94:20</A></FONT></span></p>Shall the throne of iniquity have (n) fellowship with thee, which frameth mischief by a law? 
<p>
<p>(n) Though the wicked judges pretend justice in oppressing the Church, yet they do not have the authority of God.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#023">Psalms 94:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">psa 94:23</A></FONT></span></p>And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall (o) cut them off in their own wickedness; [yea], the LORD our God shall cut them off. 
<p>
<p>(o) It is a great token of God's judgment when the purpose of the wicked is broken, but most, when they are destroyed in their own malice.
