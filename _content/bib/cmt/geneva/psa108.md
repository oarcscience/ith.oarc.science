### [Psalms Chapter 108](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#001)

[Psalms 108:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 108:1</span></span>

"A Song \[or\] Psalm of David." O God, my heart is (a) fixed; I will
sing and give praise, even with my glory.

\(a\) This earnest affection declares that he is free from hypocrisy and
that sluggishness does not stop him.

[Psalms 108:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 108:3</span></span>

I will praise thee, O LORD, among the (b) people: and I will sing
praises unto thee among the nations.

\(b\) He prophecies of the calling of the Gentiles: for unless they were
called, they could not hear the goodness of God.

[Psalms 108:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 108:5</span></span>

\(c\) Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all
the earth;

\(c\) Let all the world see your judgments in that you are God over all,
and so confess that you are glorious.

[Psalms 108:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 108:6</span></span>

That thy beloved may be delivered: (d) save \[with\] thy right hand, and
answer me.

\(d\) When God by his benefits makes us partakers of his mercies, he
admonishes us to be earnest in prayer, to desire him to continue and
finish his graces.

[Psalms 108:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 108:7</span></span>

God hath spoken in his (e) holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide
Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.

\(e\) As he has spoken to Samuel concerning me, so will he show himself
constant and holy in his promise, so that these nations following will
be subject to me.

[Psalms 108:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 108:11</span></span>

\(f\) \[Wilt\] not \[thou\], O God, \[who\] hast cast us off? and wilt
not thou, O God, go forth with our hosts?

\(f\) From the sixth verse of this psalm to the last, read also ([Psa
60:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#005)).
