with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat \[was\] five thousand
(b) shekels of brass.

\(b\) That is, 156 pounds 4 ounces, after half and ounce to the shekel:
and 600 shekels weight amounts to 18 3/4 pounds.

And Jesse said unto David his son, (d) Take now for thy brethren an
ephah of this parched \[corn\], and these ten loaves, and run to the
camp to thy brethren;

\(d\) Though Jesse meant one thing, yet God's providence directed David
to another end.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa1 17:18</span></span>

And carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of \[their\] thousand, and
look how thy brethren fare, and take their (e) pledge.

\(e\) If they have laid anything to gauge for their necessity, redeem it
out.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#023)

And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the
Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of the
Philistines, and spake according to the (f) same words: and David heard
\[them\].

\(f\) As in ([Sa1 17:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#008)).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">sa1 17:25</span></span>

And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come up?
surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, \[that\] the man
who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will
give him his daughter, and make his father's house (g) free in Israel.

\(g\) From taxes and payments.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">sa1 17:26</span></span>

And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done
to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the (h)
reproach from Israel? for who \[is\] this uncircumcised Philistine, that
he should defy the armies of the living God?

\(h\) This dishonour that he does to Israel.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">sa1 17:29</span></span>

And David said, What have I now done? \[Is there\] not a (i) cause?

\(i\) For his father's sending was a just occasion, and also he felt
himself inwardly moved by God's Spirit.

Philistine to fight with him: for thou \[art but\] a youth, and he a man
of war from his youth.

\(k\) Here Satan proves David's faith, by the infidelity of Saul.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:34](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">sa1 17:34</span></span>

And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father's sheep, and there
came a (l) lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock:

doubt to overcome this danger, seeing as he was zealous for God's
honour.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:37](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">sa1 17:37</span></span>

David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw of the
lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand
of this Philistine. And Saul said unto David, (m) Go, and the LORD be
with thee.

\(m\) For by these examples he saw that the power of God was with him.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:40](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#040)

And he took his (n) staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones
out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had, even in
a scrip; and his sling \[was\] in his hand: and he drew near to the
Philistine.

\(n\) So that by these weak means, It might be known that only God was
the author of this victory.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:43](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">sa1 17:43</span></span>

me with staves? And the Philistine (o) cursed David by his gods.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">sa1 17:46</span></span>

This (p) day will the LORD deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite
thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcases of the
host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the
wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a
God in Israel.

\(p\) David being assured both of his cause and of his calling
prophecies of the destruction of the Philistines.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:48](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#048)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">sa1 17:48</span></span>

And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew nigh
to meet David, that David (q) hasted, and ran toward the army to meet
the Philistine.

\(q\) Being moved with a fervent zeal to be revenged of this blaspheme
of God's name.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:55](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#055)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_055">sa1 17:55</span></span>

And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto
Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, (e) whose son \[is\] this youth?
And Abner said, \[As\] thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell.

\(e\) That is, of what family and tribe is he? He had forgotten David,
even though he had received so great a benefit by him.
