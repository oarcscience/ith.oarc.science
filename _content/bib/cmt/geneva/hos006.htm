<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#001">Hosea 6:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">hos 6:1</A></FONT></span></p>Come, and let (a) us return unto the LORD: for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up. 
<p>
<p>(a) He shows the people that they ought to turn to the Lord, so that he might stop his plagues.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#002">Hosea 6:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">hos 6:2</A></FONT></span></p>After two days will (b) he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight. 
<p>
<p>(b) Though he correct us from time to time, yet his help will not be far off, if we return to him.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#004">Hosea 6:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">hos 6:4</A></FONT></span></p>O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? for (c) your goodness [is] as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away. 
<p>
<p>(c) You seem to have a certain holiness and repentance, but it is very sudden, and as a morning cloud.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#005">Hosea 6:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">hos 6:5</A></FONT></span></p>Therefore have I (d) hewed [them] by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and thy (e) judgments [are as] the light [that] goeth forth. 
<p>
<p>(d) I have still laboured by my prophets, and as it were prepared you to bring you to correction, but all was in vain: for my word was not food to feed them, but a sword to slay them. 
<p>
<p>(e) My doctrine which I taught you, was most evident.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#006">Hosea 6:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">hos 6:6</A></FONT></span></p>For I desired (f) mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings. 
<p>
<p>(f) He shows to what his doctrine was aimed at, that they should unite the obedience of God, and the love of their neighbour, with outward sacrifices.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#007">Hosea 6:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">hos 6:7</A></FONT></span></p>But they (g) like men have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me. 
<p>
<p>(g) That is, like small and weak persons.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#008">Hosea 6:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">hos 6:8</A></FONT></span></p>(h) Gilead [is] a city of them that work iniquity, [and is] polluted with blood. 
<p>
<p>(h) Which was the place where the priests dwelt, and which should have been best instructed in my word.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#011">Hosea 6:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">hos 6:11</A></FONT></span></p>Also, O Judah, he hath set an (i) harvest for thee, when I returned the captivity of my people. 
<p>
<p>(i) That is, imitates your idolatry, and has taken grafts of your trees.
