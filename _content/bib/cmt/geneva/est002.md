### [Esther Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#001)

[Esther 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">est 2:1</span></span>

After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased, he
(a) remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed (b)
against her.

\(a\) That is, he brought the matter again into discussion. (b) By the
seven wise men of his counsel.

[Esther 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">est 2:3</span></span>

And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom,
that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan
the palace, to the house of the women, unto the custody of Hege the
king's chamberlain, (c) keeper of the women; and let their things (d)
for purification be given \[them\]:

\(c\) The abuse of these countries was so great, that they invented many
means to serve the lusts of princes and therefore they ordained wicked
laws that the king might have whose daughters he would. They had many
houses appointed, one for the virgins, another for the concubines and
another for the queen.

\(d\) Read what this purification was in ([Est
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#012)).

[Esther 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">est 2:11</span></span>

And Mordecai walked (e) every day before the court of the women's house,
to know how Esther did, and what should become of her.

\(e\) For though she was taken away by a cruel law, yet he did not cease
to have a fatherly care for her, and therefore often sought to hear of
her.

[Esther 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">est 2:13</span></span>

Then thus came \[every\] maiden unto the king; whatsoever she desired
was (f) given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the
king's house.

\(f\) Whatever apparel she asked for, the eunuch was bound to give to
her.

[Esther 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">est 2:15</span></span>

Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of
Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the
king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's chamberlain, the
keeper of the women, (g) appointed. And Esther obtained favour in the
sight of all them that looked upon her.

\(g\) In which her modesty appeared because she did not seek to dress to
command her beauty but sought the eunuch's appointment.

[Esther 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">est 2:16</span></span>

So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the
tenth month, which \[is\] the (h) month Tebeth, in the seventh year of
his reign.

\(h\) Which contained part of December and part of January.

[Esther 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">est 2:18</span></span>

Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants,
\[even\] Esther's (i) feast; and he made a release (k) to the provinces,
and gave gifts, according to the (l) state of the king.

\(i\) That is, made for her sake.

\(k\) He released their tribute.

\(l\) That is, great and magnificent.

[Esther 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">est 2:19</span></span>

And when the virgins were gathered together the (m) second time, then
Mordecai sat in the king's gate.

\(m\) That is, at the marriage of Esther, which was the second marriage
for the king.

[Esther 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">est 2:21</span></span>

In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king's gate, two of the king's
chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the door, were
wroth, and sought to lay (n) hand on the king Ahasuerus.

\(n\) Meaning, to kill him.

[Esther 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">est 2:23</span></span>

And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out; therefore
they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book of the
(o) chronicles before the king.

\(o\) In the chronicles of the Medes and Persians, ([Est
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/est010.htm#002)).
