And who [then] is (d) willing to consecrate his service this day unto the LORD? 
<p>
<p>(d) He was not only liberal himself but provoked others to set forth the work of God. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#008">1 Chronicles 29:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">ch1 29:8</A></FONT></span></p>And they with whom [precious] stones were (e) found gave [them] to the treasure of the house of the LORD, by the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite.
