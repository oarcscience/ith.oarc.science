<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">sa1 2:1</A></FONT></span></p>And Hannah (a) prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the LORD, mine (b) horn is exalted in the LORD: my mouth is (c) enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation. 
<p>
<p>(a) After she had obtained a son by prayer she gave thanks. 
<p>
<p>(b) I have recovered strength and glory by the benefit of the Lord. 
<p>
<p>(c) I can answer them that criticize my barrenness. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#003">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">sa1 2:3</A></FONT></span></p>Talk (d) no more so exceeding proudly; let [not] arrogancy come out of your mouth: for the LORD [is] a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed. 
<p>
<p>(d) In that you condemn my barrenness, you show your pride against God. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#005">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">sa1 2:5</A></FONT></span></p>[They that were] full have hired out themselves for (e) bread; and [they that were] hungry ceased: so that the barren hath born seven; and she that hath many children is waxed feeble. 
<p>
<p>(e) They sell their labours for necessary food. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#008">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">sa1 2:8</A></FONT></span></p>He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, [and] lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set [them] among (f) princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth [are] the (g) LORD'S, and he hath set the world upon them. 
<p>
<p>(f) He prefers to honour, and does according to his own will, though man's judgment is contrary. 
<p>
<p>(g) Therefore he may dispose all things according to his will. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#010">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">sa1 2:10</A></FONT></span></p>The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder upon them: the LORD shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength unto his (h) king, and exalt the horn of his anointed. 
<p>
<p>(h) She grounded her prayer on Jesus Christ who was to come. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#011">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">sa1 2:11</A></FONT></span></p>And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister unto the (i) LORD before Eli the priest. 
<p>
<p>(i) In all that Eli commanded him. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#012">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">sa1 2:12</A></FONT></span></p>Now the sons of Eli [were] sons of Belial; they (k) knew not the LORD. 
<p>
<p>(k) That is, they neglected his ordinance. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#014">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">sa1 2:14</A></FONT></span></p>And he struck [it] into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; (l) all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither. 
<p>
<p>(l) Transgressing the order appointed in the Law, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#031">Lev 7:31</A>), for their bellies sake. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#015">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">sa1 2:15</A></FONT></span></p>Also before they burnt the (m) fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw. 
<p>
<p>(m) Which was commanded first to have been offered to God. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#016">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">sa1 2:16</A></FONT></span></p>And [if] any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and [then] take [as much] as thy soul (n) desireth; then he would answer him, [Nay]; but thou shalt give [it me] now: and if not, I will take [it] by force. 
<p>
<p>(n) Not passing for their own profit, so that God might be served rightly. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#017">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">sa1 2:17</A></FONT></span></p>Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD: for men (o) abhorred the offering of the LORD. 
<p>
<p>(o) Seeing the horrible abuse of it. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#022">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">sa1 2:22</A></FONT></span></p>Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel; and how they lay with the women that (p) assembled [at] the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
<p>
<p>(p) Which was (as the Hebrews write) after their travail, when they came to be purified, read (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#008">Exo 38:8</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#006">Lev 12:6</A>). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#024">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">sa1 2:24</A></FONT></span></p>Nay, my sons; for [it is] no good report that I hear: ye make the LORD'S people to (q) transgress. 
<p>
<p>(q) Because they contemn their duty to God, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#017">Sa1 2:17</A>). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#025">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:25</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_025">sa1 2:25</A></FONT></span></p>If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against the LORD, who shall intreat for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the LORD (r) would slay them. 
<p>
<p>(r) So that to obey good admonition is God's mercy, and to disobey them is his just judgment for sin. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#027">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:27</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_027">sa1 2:27</A></FONT></span></p>And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy (s) father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house? 
<p>
<p>(s) That is, Aaron. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#029">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:29</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_029">sa1 2:29</A></FONT></span></p>Wherefore (t) kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded [in my] habitation; and honourest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people? 
<p>
<p>(t) Why have you contemned my sacrifices, and as it were trod them under foot? 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#030">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:30</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_030">sa1 2:30</A></FONT></span></p>Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith, I said indeed [that] thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD saith, (u) Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed. 
<p>
<p>(u) God's promises are only effective to those he gives faith to fear and obey him. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#031">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:31</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_031">sa1 2:31</A></FONT></span></p>Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine (x) arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thine house. 
<p>
<p>(x) Thy power and authority. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#032">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:32</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_032">sa1 2:32</A></FONT></span></p>And thou (y) shalt see an enemy [in my] habitation, in all [the wealth] which [God] shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever. 
<p>
<p>(y) Your posterity will see the glory of the chief priest given to another, whom they will envy, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#027">Kg1 2:27</A>). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#035">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:35</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_035">sa1 2:35</A></FONT></span></p>And I will raise me up a (z) faithful priest, [that] shall do according to [that] which [is] in mine heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever. 
<p>
<p>(z) Meaning Zadok, who succeeded Abiathar, and was the figure of Christ. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#036">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:36</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_036">sa1 2:36</A></FONT></span></p>And it shall come to pass, [that] every one that is left in thine house shall come [and] (a) crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a piece of bread. 
<p>
<p>(a) That is, will be inferior to him.
