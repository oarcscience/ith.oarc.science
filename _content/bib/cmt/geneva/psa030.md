### [Psalms Chapter 30](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#001)

[Psalms 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 30:1</span></span>

"A Psalm \[and\] Song \[at\] the dedication of the (a) house of David."
I will extol thee, O LORD; (b) for thou hast lifted me up, and hast not
made my foes to rejoice over me.

\(a\) After Absalom had polluted it with most filthy fornication.

\(b\) He condemns them for great ingratitude who do not praise God for
his benefits.

[Psalms 30:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 30:2</span></span>

O LORD my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast (c) healed me.

\(c\) Restored from the rebellion of Absalom.

[Psalms 30:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 30:3</span></span>

O LORD, thou hast brought up my (d) soul from the grave: thou hast kept
me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.

\(d\) Meaning, that he escaped death most narrowly.

[Psalms 30:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 30:4</span></span>

Sing unto the LORD, O ye (e) saints of his, and give thanks at the
remembrance of his holiness.

\(e\) The word signifies them who have received mercy, and show mercy
liberally to others.

[Psalms 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 30:6</span></span>

And in my (g) prosperity I said, I shall never be moved.

\(g\) I put too much confidence in my quiet state as in ([Jer
31:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#018); [Ch2
32:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#024)).

[Psalms 30:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 30:7</span></span>

LORD, by thy favour thou hast made my (h) mountain to stand strong: thou
didst hide thy face, \[and\] I (i) was troubled.

\(h\) I thought you had established me in Zion most surely.

\(i\) After you had withdrawn your help, I felt my misery.

[Psalms 30:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 30:9</span></span>

What profit \[is there\] in my blood, when I go down to the pit? Shall
the (k) dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth?

\(k\) David means that the dead are not profitable to the congregation
of the Lord here in the earth: therefore he would live to praise his
Name, which is the end of man's creation.

[Psalms 30:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 30:12</span></span>

To the end that \[my\] (l) glory may sing praise to thee, and not be
silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.

\(l\) Because you have preserved me that my tongue should praise you, I
will not be unmindful of my duty.
