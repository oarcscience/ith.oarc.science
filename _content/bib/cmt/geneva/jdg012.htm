<p>
<p>(a) After they had passed Jordan. 
<p>
<p>(b) Thus ambition envies God's work in others as they did against Gideon, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#001">Jdg 8:1</A>).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">jdg 12:3</A></FONT></span></p>And when I saw that ye delivered [me] not, (c) I put my life in my hands, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and the LORD delivered them into my hand: wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day, to fight against me? 
<p>
<p>(c) That is, I ventured my life, and when man's help failed, I put my trust only in God.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#004">Judges 12:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">jdg 12:4</A></FONT></span></p>Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said, Ye Gileadites [are] fugitives of Ephraim (d) among the Ephraimites, [and] among the Manassites. 
<p>
<p>(d) You ran from us, and chose Gilead, and now in respect to us you are nothing.

Then they took him, and slew him at the passages of Jordan: and there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two thousand. 
<p>
<p>(e) Which signifies the fall of waters, or an ear of corn.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">jdg 12:8</A></FONT></span></p>And after him (f) Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel.

<p>(f) Some think that this was Boaz the husband of Ruth.
