<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#001">Psalms 10:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">psa 10:1</A></FONT></span></p>Why standest thou afar off, O LORD? [why] hidest thou [thyself] in (a) times of trouble? 
<p>
<p>(a) As soon as we enter into affliction, we think God should help us, but that is not always his due time.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#003">Psalms 10:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">psa 10:3</A></FONT></span></p>For the wicked (b) boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth the covetous, [whom] the LORD abhorreth. 
<p>
<p>(b) The wicked man rejoices in his own lust he boasts when he has that he would; he brags of his wit and wealth and blesses himself and thus blasphemes the Lord.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#006">Psalms 10:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">psa 10:6</A></FONT></span></p>He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for [I shall] (c) never [be] in adversity. 
<p>
<p>(c) The evil will not touch me, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#015">Isa 28:15</A>) or else he speaks thus because he never felt evil.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#008">Psalms 10:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">psa 10:8</A></FONT></span></p>(d) He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are privily set against the poor. 
<p>
<p>(d) He shows that the wicked have many ways to hide their cruelty and therefore should be even more feared.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#010">Psalms 10:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">psa 10:10</A></FONT></span></p>He croucheth, [and] humbleth himself, that the (e) poor may fall by his strong ones. 
<p>
<p>(e) By the hypocrisy of them who have authority the poor are devoured.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#012">Psalms 10:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">psa 10:12</A></FONT></span></p>(f) Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the humble. 
<p>
<p>(f) He calls to God for help, because wickedness is so far overgrown that God must help now or never.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#013">Psalms 10:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">psa 10:13</A></FONT></span></p>Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not (g) require [it]. 
<p>
<p>(g) Therefore you must punish their blasphemy.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#014">Psalms 10:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">psa 10:14</A></FONT></span></p>Thou hast seen [it]; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to (h) requite [it] with thy hand: the poor committeth himself unto thee; thou art the helper of the fatherless. 
<p>
<p>(h) To judge between the right and the wrong.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#015">Psalms 10:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">psa 10:15</A></FONT></span></p>Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil [man]: seek out his wickedness [till] thou find (i) none. 
<p>
<p>(i) For you have utterly destroyed him.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#016">Psalms 10:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">psa 10:16</A></FONT></span></p>The LORD [is] King for ever and ever: the (k) heathen are perished out of his land. 
<p>
<p>(k) The hypocrites or such as live not after God's law, will be destroyed.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#018">Psalms 10:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">psa 10:18</A></FONT></span></p>(l) To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress. 
<p>
<p>(l) God helps when man's help ceases.
