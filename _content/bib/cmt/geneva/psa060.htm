<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">psa 60:1</A></FONT></span></p>"To the chief Musician upon (a) Shushaneduth, Michtam of David, to teach; when he strove with Aramnaharaim and with (b) Aramzobah, when Joab returned, and smote of Edom in the valley of salt twelve thousand." O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast (c) scattered us, thou hast been displeased; O turn thyself to us again. 
<p>
<p>(a) These were certain songs after the note of which this psalm was sung. 
<p>
<p>(b) Also called Sophene, which stands by Euphrates. 
<p>
<p>(c) For when Saul was not able to resist the enemy, the people fled here and there: for they were not safe in their own homes.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#002">Psalms 60:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">psa 60:2</A></FONT></span></p>Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast (d) broken it: heal the breaches thereof; for it shaketh. 
<p>
<p>(d) As split with an earthquake.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#003">Psalms 60:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">psa 60:3</A></FONT></span></p>Thou hast (e) shewed thy people hard things: thou hast made us to drink the wine of astonishment. 
<p>
<p>(e) You have handled your people sharply, in asking from them sense and judgment in that they aided Saul the wicked King, and punished him to whom God had given the just title of the realm.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#004">Psalms 60:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">psa 60:4</A></FONT></span></p>Thou hast given (f) a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah. 
<p>
<p>(f) In making me king, you have performed your promise, which seemed to have lost the force.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#006">Psalms 60:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">psa 60:6</A></FONT></span></p>God hath spoken in his (g) holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth. 
<p>
<p>(g) It is as certain as if it were spoken by an oracle, that I will possess those places which Saul has left to his children.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#007">Psalms 60:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">psa 60:7</A></FONT></span></p>Gilead [is] mine, and Manasseh [is] mine; Ephraim also [is] the (h) strength of mine head; (i) Judah [is] my lawgiver; 
<p>
<p>(h) For it was strong and well peopled. 
<p>
<p>(i) David means that in this tribe his kingdom will be established, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010">Gen 49:10</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#008">Psalms 60:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">psa 60:8</A></FONT></span></p>Moab [is] my (k) washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: (l) Philistia, triumph thou because of me. 
<p>
<p>(k) In most vile subjection. 
<p>
<p>(l) For you will lie and pretend you were glad.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#009">Psalms 60:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">psa 60:9</A></FONT></span></p>Who will bring me [into] the (m) strong city? who will lead me into Edom? 
<p>
<p>(m) He was assured that God would give him the strong cities of his enemies, in which they thought themselves sure.
