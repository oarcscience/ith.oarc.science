<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#001">Isaiah 34:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">isa 34:1</A></FONT></span></p>Come near, ye (a) nations, to hear; and hearken, ye people: let the earth hear, and all that is in it; the world, and all things that spring from it. 
<p>
<p>(a) He prophecies of the destruction of the Edomites and other nations which were enemies to the Church.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#002">Isaiah 34:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">isa 34:2</A></FONT></span></p>For the indignation of the LORD [is] upon all nations, and [his] fury upon all their armies: he hath utterly (b) destroyed them, he hath delivered them to the slaughter. 
<p>
<p>(b) God has determined in his counsel and has given sentence for their destruction.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#004">Isaiah 34:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">isa 34:4</A></FONT></span></p>And all the host of heaven (c) shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll: and all their hosts shall fall down, as the leaf falleth from the vine, and as a falling [fig] from the fig tree. 
<p>
<p>(c) He speaks this in respect to man's judgment, who in great fear and horrible troubles, think that heaven and earth perishes.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#005">Isaiah 34:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">isa 34:5</A></FONT></span></p>For my sword shall be (d) bathed in heaven: behold, it shall come down upon Edom, and upon the people of (e) my curse, to judgment. 
<p>
<p>(d) I have determined in my secret counsel and in the heavens to destroy them till my sword is weary with shedding blood. 
<p>
<p>(e) They had an opinion of holiness, because they came from the patriarch Isaac, but in effect were cursed by God, and enemies to his Church as the papists are.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#006">Isaiah 34:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">isa 34:6</A></FONT></span></p>The sword of the LORD is filled with blood, it is made fat with fatness, [and] with the blood of (f) lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams: for the LORD hath a sacrifice in (g) Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Edom. 
<p>
<p>(f) That is, both of young and old, poor and rich of his enemies. 
<p>
<p>(g) That famous city will be consumed as a sacrifice burnt to ashes.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#007">Isaiah 34:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">isa 34:7</A></FONT></span></p>And the (h) unicorns shall come down with them, and the bulls with the bulls; and their land shall be soaked with blood, and their dust made fat with fatness. 
<p>
<p>(h) The mighty and rich will be as well destroyed as the inferiors.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#009">Isaiah 34:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">isa 34:9</A></FONT></span></p>And its streams shall be turned into pitch, and its dust into (i) brimstone, and its land shall become burning pitch. 
<p>
<p>(i) He alludes to the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#024">Gen 19:24</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#011">Isaiah 34:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">isa 34:11</A></FONT></span></p>But the cormorant (k) and the bittern shall possess it; the owl also and the raven shall dwell in it: and he shall stretch out upon it the line of (l) confusion, and the stones of emptiness. 
<p>
<p>(k) Read (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#021">Isa 13:21</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#014">Zep 2:14</A>). 
<p>
<p>(l) In vain will any man go about to build it again.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#012">Isaiah 34:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">isa 34:12</A></FONT></span></p>(m) They shall call her nobles to the kingdom, but none [shall be] there, and all her princes shall be nothing. 
<p>
<p>(m) Meaning, here will be neither order nor policy nor state of commonwealth.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#014">Isaiah 34:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">isa 34:14</A></FONT></span></p>The wild beasts of the desert shall also (n) meet with the wild beasts of the isle, and the satyr shall cry to his fellow; the screech owl also shall rest there, and find for herself a place of rest. 
<p>
<p>(n) Read (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#021">Isa 13:21</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#015">Isaiah 34:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">isa 34:15</A></FONT></span></p>There (o) shall the great owl make her nest, and lay, and hatch, and gather under her shadow: there shall the vultures also be gathered, every one with her mate. 
<p>
<p>(o) Signifying that Idumea would be a horrible desolation and barren wilderness.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#016">Isaiah 34:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">isa 34:16</A></FONT></span></p>Seek ye out of the (p) book of the LORD, and read: no one of (q) these shall fail, none shall lack her mate: for my (r) mouth it hath commanded, and his spirit it hath gathered them. 
<p>
<p>(p) That is, in the law where such curses are threatened against the wicked. 
<p>
<p>(q) That is, beasts and souls. 
<p>
<p>(r) That is, the mouth of the Lord.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#017">Isaiah 34:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">isa 34:17</A></FONT></span></p>And he hath cast the (s) lot for them, and his hand hath divided it to them by line: they shall possess it for ever, from generation to generation shall they dwell in it. 
<p>
<p>(s) He has given the beasts and souls Idumea for an inheritance.
