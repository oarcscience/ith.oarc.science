### [Job Chapter 32](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#001)

[Job 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 32:2</span></span>

Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the (a) Buzite,
of the kindred of (b) Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he
justified himself (c) rather than God.

\(a\) Which came from Buz, the son of Nahor, Abraham's brother.

\(b\) Or, as the Chaldee translation reads, Abram.

\(c\) By making himself innocent, and by charging God of rigour.

[Job 32:4](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 32:4</span></span>

Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because (d) they \[were\]
elder than he.

\(d\) That is, the three mentioned before.

[Job 32:7](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 32:7</span></span>

I said, Days (e) should speak, and multitude of years should teach
wisdom.

\(e\) Meaning, the ancient, who have experience.

[Job 32:8](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 32:8</span></span>

But \[there is\] a spirit in man: (f) and the inspiration of the
Almighty giveth them understanding.

\(f\) It is a special gift of God that man has understanding and comes
neither from nature nor by age.

[Job 32:11](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 32:11</span></span>

Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye
searched out (g) what to say.

\(g\) To prove that Job's affliction came for his sins.

[Job 32:13](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 32:13</span></span>

Lest ye should say, We have (h) found out wisdom: God thrusteth him
down, not man.

\(h\) Flatter yourselves as though you had overcome him.

[Job 32:14](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 32:14</span></span>

Now (i) he hath not directed \[his\] words against me: neither will I
answer (k) him with your speeches.

\(i\) That is, Job.

\(k\) He uses almost the same arguments but without taunting and
reproaches.

[Job 32:18](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 32:18</span></span>

For I am full of (l) matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.

\(l\) I have conceived in my mind a great store of reasons.

[Job 32:21](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 32:21</span></span>

Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, (m) neither let me give
flattering titles unto man.

\(m\) I will neither have regard for riches, credit, nor authority but
will speak the very truth.

[Job 32:22](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 32:22</span></span>

For I know not to give flattering (n) titles; \[in so doing\] my maker
would soon take me away.

\(n\) The Hebrew word signifies to change the name as to call a fool a
wise man: meaning, that he would not cloak the truth to flatter men.
