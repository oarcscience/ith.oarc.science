### [John Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#001)

[John 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 8:3</span></span>

\(1\) And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in
adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,

\(1\) While the wicked go about to make a snare for good men, they make
a snare for themselves.

[John 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">joh 8:7</span></span>

\(2\) So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said
unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone
at her.

\(2\) Against hypocrites who are very severe judges against other men,
and flatter themselves while they are sinning.

[John 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">joh 8:10</span></span>

\(3\) When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he
said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man
condemned thee?

\(3\) Christ would not take upon himself the office of the civil
magistrate: he was content to bring sinners to faith and repentance.

[John 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">joh 8:12</span></span>

\(4\) Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the
world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have
the light of life.

\(4\) The world, which is blind in itself, cannot come to have any light
but in Christ alone.

[John 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">joh 8:13</span></span>

\(5\) The Pharisees therefore said unto him, (a) Thou bearest record of
thyself; thy record is not true.

\(5\) Christ is without all exception the best witness of the truth, for
he was sent by his Father for that purpose, and his Father showed his
approval of him to the world by infinite miracles.

\(a\) You bear witness of yourself, which is worth nothing in the
opinion of all men, and for a man to commend himself is very
uncommendable.

[John 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joh 8:14</span></span>

Jesus answered and said unto them, (b) Though I bear record of myself,
\[yet\] my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go;
but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.

\(b\) That which he denied before in ([Joh
5:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#031)) must be understood as Christ
granting their position in a way, for in that place he talked of himself
somewhat in line with the opinions of his hearers, who acknowledged
nothing in Christ but his humanity, and therefore he was content they
should not regard his own witness, unless it were otherwise confirmed.
But in this place he stands and affirms Godhead, and praises his Father,
who is his witness, and agrees with him.

[John 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joh 8:15</span></span>

Ye judge after the flesh; I (c) judge no man.

\(c\) I am presently only teaching you, I condemn no man: but yet if I
want to do it, I might lawfully do it, for I am not alone, but my Father
is with me.

[John 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joh 8:18</span></span>

\(d\) I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me
beareth witness of me.

\(d\) The Godhead is plainly distinguished from the manhood, or else
there would not be two witnesses: for the accused party is not taken as
a witness.

[John 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 8:19</span></span>

\(6\) Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye
neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known
my Father also.

\(6\) No man can know God except in Christ alone.

[John 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">joh 8:20</span></span>

These words spake Jesus in the (e) treasury, as he taught in the temple:
and no man laid hands on him; (7) for his hour was not yet come.

\(e\) This was a certain place appointed for the gathering of the
offerings. (7) We live and die according to the pleasure of God, and not
of men: therefore it behooves us that we constantly go forward in our
calling.

[John 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">joh 8:21</span></span>

\(8\) Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek
me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.

\(8\) Because men naturally abhor heavenly things, no man can be a fit
disciple of Christ unless the Spirit of God makes him so: in the
meantime nonetheless, the world must necessarily perish, because it
refuses the life that is offered unto it.

[John 8:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">joh 8:25</span></span>

\(9\) Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them,
Even (f) \[the same\] that I said unto you from the beginning.

\(9\) He will eventually know who Christ is who will diligently hear
what Christ says.

\(f\) That is, I am Christ, and the Saviour, for so I told you from the
beginning that I was.

[John 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">joh 8:26</span></span>

\(10\) I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent
me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of
him.

\(10\) God is the avenger of Christ's despised doctrine.

[John 8:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">joh 8:27</span></span>

\(11\) They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.

\(11\) Even the contempt of Christ results in his glory: and this thing
his enemies will eventually feel to their great pain.

[John 8:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">joh 8:31</span></span>

\(12\) Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye
continue in my word, \[then\] are ye my disciples indeed;

\(12\) The true disciples of Christ continue in his doctrine, that
profiting more and more in the knowledge of the truth they may be
delivered from the most grievous burden of sin, into the true liberty of
righteousness and life.

[John 8:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">joh 8:32</span></span>

And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall (g) make you free.

\(g\) From the slavery of sin.

[John 8:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">joh 8:33</span></span>

\(h\) They answered him, We be (i) Abraham's seed, and were never in
bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?

\(h\) Some of the multitude, not they that believed: for this is not the
speech of men that agree with him, but of men that are against him.

\(i\) Born and begotten of Abraham.

[John 8:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">joh 8:37</span></span>

\(13\) I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me,
because my word hath no place in you.

\(13\) Our wicked manners declare that we are obviously born of a wicked
nature: but we are changed, and made part of the household of God
according to the covenant which he made with Abraham by Christ alone,
apprehended and laid hold on by faith: and this faith is known by a
godly and honest life.

[John 8:43](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">joh 8:43</span></span>

Why do ye not understand my (k) speech? \[even\] because ye cannot hear
my word.

\(k\) Or, language: as though he said, "You do not understand what I say
any more than if I spoke in a strange and unknown language to you."

[John 8:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">joh 8:44</span></span>

Ye are of \[your\] father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye
will do. He was a murderer from the (l) beginning, and (m) abode not in
the (n) truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie,
he speaketh of his (o) own: for he is a liar, and the (p) father of it.

\(l\) From the beginning of the world: for as soon as man was made, the
devil cast him headlong into death.

\(m\) That is, did not continue constantly, or did not remain.

\(n\) That is, in faithfulness and uprightness, that is, he did not
remain in the manner in which he was created.

\(o\) Even from his own head, and from his own mind or disposition.

\(p\) The author of it.

[John 8:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#046)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">joh 8:46</span></span>

\(14\) Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do
ye not believe me?

\(14\) Christ thoroughly executed the office that his Father gave him.

[John 8:48](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#048)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">joh 8:48</span></span>

\(15\) Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that
thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?

\(15\) The enemies of Christ act bravely for a while, but the Father
will appear in his time to avenge the reproach that is done unto him in
the person of his Son.

[John 8:50](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#050)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">joh 8:50</span></span>

And I seek not mine own glory: there is one (q) that seeketh and
judgeth.

\(q\) That is, that will avenge both your despising of me and of him.

[John 8:51](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#051)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">joh 8:51</span></span>

\(16\) Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall
never (r) see death.

\(16\) Only the doctrine of the gospel apprehended by faith is a sure
remedy against death.

\(r\) That is, he will not feel it: for even in the midst of death the
faithful see life.

[John 8:52](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#052)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">joh 8:52</span></span>

\(17\) Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil.
Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my
saying, he shall never taste of death.

\(17\) Against those who abuse the glory of the saints to debase
Christ's glory.

[John 8:54](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#054)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">joh 8:54</span></span>

\(18\) Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is (s) nothing: it
is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:

\(18\) There is no one further from seeking glory than Christ, but his
Father has set him above all things.

\(s\) In saying this Christ grants their opinion, though not agreeing
with it, as if he had said, "Be it so, let this report which I give of
myself be of no force; yet there is another that glorifies me, that is,
that honours my name."

[John 8:55](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#055)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_055">joh 8:55</span></span>

\(19\) Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I
know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep
his saying.

\(19\) There is no right knowledge of God without Christ, neither is
there any right knowledge of Christ without his word.

[John 8:56](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#056)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_056">joh 8:56</span></span>

\(20\) Your father Abraham (t) rejoiced to see my (u) day: and he (x)
saw \[it\], and was glad.

\(20\) The power of Christ showed itself through all former ages in the
fathers, for they saw in the promises that he would come, and very
joyfully laid hold of him with a living faith.

\(t\) Was very desirous.

\(u\) A day is a space that a man lives in, or does any notable act in,
or endures any great thing in.

\(x\) With the eyes of faith; ([Heb
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#013)).

[John 8:58](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#058)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_058">joh 8:58</span></span>

Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham
was, I (y) am.

\(y\) Christ, as he was God, was before Abraham: and he was the Lamb
slain from the beginning of the world.

[John 8:59](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#059)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_059">joh 8:59</span></span>

\(21\) Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself,
and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so
passed by.

\(21\) Zeal without knowledge eventually breaks out into a most open
madness: and yet the wicked cannot do what they desire.
