<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 72:1</span></span>

"\[A Psalm\] (a) for Solomon." Give the king thy (b) judgments, O God,
and thy righteousness unto the king's (c) son.

\(a\) Composed by David concerning the reign of his son Solomon.

\(b\) Imbue the king with the Spirit of wisdom and justice, that he
reign not as the worldly tyrants do.

\(c\) That is, to his posterity.

[Psalms 72:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 72:3</span></span>

The (d) mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little hills,
by righteousness.

\(d\) When justice reigns, even the places most barren will be enriched
with your blessings.

[Psalms 72:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 72:4</span></span>

the innocent, and suppress the wicked.

[Psalms 72:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 72:5</span></span>

They shall (f) fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure, throughout

\(f\) The people will embrace your true religion, when you give a king
who rules according to your word.

[Psalms 72:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 72:6</span></span>

He shall come (g) down like rain upon the mown grass: as showers

\(g\) As this is true in all godly kings, so it is chiefly verified in
Christ, who with his heavenly dew, makes his Church ever to flourish.

[Psalms 72:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 72:8</span></span>

He shall have dominion also from (h) sea to sea, and from the river unto
the ends of the earth.

\(h\) That is, from the Red sea to the sea called the Syriacum, and from
Euphrates forward, meaning, that Christ's kingdom would be large and
universal.

[Psalms 72:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 72:10</span></span>

kings (k) of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.

means by the isles.

bordering on Ethiopia.

shall their blood be in his sight.

\(l\) Though tyrants pause not to shed blood, yet this godly king will
preserve his subjects from all kinds of wrong.

[Psalms 72:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 72:15</span></span>

And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the (m) gold of Sheba:
prayer also shall be made for him continually; \[and\] daily shall he be
praised.

\(m\) God will both prosper his life and make the people willing to obey
him.

[Psalms 72:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 72:16</span></span>

There shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the
mountains; the (n) fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: and \[they\]
of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth.

the increase of mankind.

prospers them for his sake.

wondrous things.

\(p\) He confesses that unless God miraculously preserves his people
neither the king nor the kingdom can continue.
