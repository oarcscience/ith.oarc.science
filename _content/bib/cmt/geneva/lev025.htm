<p>
<p>(a) The Jews began to count the year in September: for then all the fruits were gathered.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#005">Leviticus 25:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">lev 25:5</A></FONT></span></p>That which groweth of its (b) own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine (c) undressed: [for] it is a year of rest unto the land. 
<p>
<p>(b) Because of the corn that fell out of the ears the previous year. 
<p>
<p>(c) Or, which you have separated from yourself, and consecrated to God for the poor.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#006">Leviticus 25:6</A></p>

<p>
<p>(d) That which the land brings forth in her rest.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#009">Leviticus 25:9</A></p>

<p>
<p>(e) In the beginning of the 50 years was the Jubile, so called, because the joyful tidings of liberty were publicly proclaimed by the sound of a cornet.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#010">Leviticus 25:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">lev 25:10</A></FONT></span></p>And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout [all] the land unto all the (f) inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubile unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his (g) possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family. 
<p>
<p>(f) Which were in bondage. 
<p>
<p>(g) Because the tribes should neither have their possessions diminished nor confounded.

<p>
<p>(h) By deceit, or otherwise.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">lev 25:15</A></FONT></span></p>According to the number of (i) years after the jubile thou shalt buy of thy neighbour, [and] according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee: 
<p>
<p>(i) If the Jubile to come is near, you would be better to sell cheaply. If it is far off, sell at a higher price.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#016">Leviticus 25:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">lev 25:16</A></FONT></span></p>According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it: for [according] to the number [of the years] of the (k) fruits doth he sell unto thee. 
<p>
<p>(k) And not the full possession of the land.

<p>
<p>(l) It could not be sold for ever, but must return to the family in the Jubile.

<p>
<p>(m) You shall sell it on the condition that it may be redeemed.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#027">Leviticus 25:27</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_027">lev 25:27</A></FONT></span></p>Then let him (n) count the years of the sale thereof, and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; that he may return unto his possession. 
<p>
<p>(n) Deducting money for the years past, and paying for the rest of the years to come.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#028">Leviticus 25:28</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_028">lev 25:28</A></FONT></span></p>But if he be not able to restore [it] to him, then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubile: and in the jubile it shall go (o) out, and he shall return unto his possession. 
<p>
<p>(o) From his hand that bought it.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_030">lev 25:30</A></FONT></span></p>And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that [is] in the walled city shall be established (p) for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations: it shall not go out in the jubile. 
<p>
<p>(p) That is, for ever, read (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#023">Lev 25:23</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#034">Leviticus 25:34</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_034">lev 25:34</A></FONT></span></p>But the field of the (q) suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it [is] their perpetual possession. 
<p>
<p>(q) Where the Levites kept their cattle.

<p>
<p>(r) In Hebrew it is, if his hand shake: meaning if he stretch forth his hand for help as one in misery.

<p>
<p>(t) For they shall not be bought out at the Jubile.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#049">Leviticus 25:49</A></p>

<p>
<p>(u) If he be able.

<p>(x) Which remains yet to the Jubile.
