<p>
<p>(a) If you trespass in anything concerning the ceremonies of the sanctuary of your office, you will be punished.

<p>
<p>(b) That is, the things which are committed to you, or, which you command them.

<p>
<p>(d) As the first fruit, first born, and the tithes.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">num 18:9</A></FONT></span></p>This shall be thine of the most holy things, [reserved] from the (e) fire: every oblation of theirs, every meat offering of theirs, and every sin offering of theirs, and every trespass offering of theirs, which they shall render unto me, [shall be] most holy for thee and for thy sons. 
<p>
<p>(e) That which was not burned should be the priests.
