<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#002">Mark 1:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">mar 1:2</A></FONT></span></p>(1) As it is written in the (a) prophets, Behold, (b) I send my messenger (c) before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee. 
<p>
<p>(1) John goes before Christ as it was foretold by the prophets. 
<p>
<p>(a) This is the figure of speech called metonymy, by which is meant the books of the prophets Malachi and Isaiah. 
<p>
<p>(b) The prophet uses the present tense when he speaks of a thing to come, as he is as sure of it as if he had already seen it. 
<p>
<p>(c) A metaphor taken from the practice of kings, who used to have ushers go before them.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#004">Mark 1:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">mar 1:4</A></FONT></span></p>(2) John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the (d) baptism of repentance for the remission of sins. 
<p>
<p>(2) The sum of John's doctrine, or rather Christ's, is remission of sins and amendment of life. 
<p>
<p>(d) The Jews used many kinds of washings: but here a peculiar kind of washing is spoken of, which contains within it true baptism, amendment of life, and forgiveness of sins.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#007">Mark 1:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">mar 1:7</A></FONT></span></p>(3) And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to (e) stoop down and unloose. 
<p>
<p>(3) John and all ministers cast their eyes upon Christ the Lord. 
<p>
<p>(e) The evangelist is expressing here the condition of the basest servant.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#008">Mark 1:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">mar 1:8</A></FONT></span></p>I indeed have (f) baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost. 
<p>
<p>(f) He shows that all the power of baptism proceeds from Christ, who baptizes the inner man.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#009">Mark 1:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">mar 1:9</A></FONT></span></p>(4) And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan. 
<p>
<p>(4) Christ consecrates our baptism in himself.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#010">Mark 1:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">mar 1:10</A></FONT></span></p>(5) And straightway (g) coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him: 
<p>
<p>(5) The vocation of Christ from heaven, as head of the Church. 
<p>
<p>(g) John, who went down into the water with Christ.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#011">Mark 1:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">mar 1:11</A></FONT></span></p>And there came a voice from heaven, [saying], Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am (h) well pleased. 
<p>
<p>(h) See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#017">Mat 3:17</A>  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#012">Mark 1:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">mar 1:12</A></FONT></span></p>(6) And immediately the Spirit (i) driveth him into the wilderness. 
<p>
<p>(6) Christ being tempted overcomes. 
<p>
<p>(i) "Driveth" here does not refer to something violent and forcible: but the divine power clothes Christ (who had lived until this time as a private man) with a new person, and prepares him for the battle that was at hand, and for his ministry.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#014">Mark 1:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">mar 1:14</A></FONT></span></p>(7) Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, 
<p>
<p>(7) After John is taken Christ shows himself more fully.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#016">Mark 1:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">mar 1:16</A></FONT></span></p>(8) Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers. 
<p>
<p>(8) The calling of Simon and Andrew.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#019">Mark 1:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">mar 1:19</A></FONT></span></p>(9) And when he had gone a little further thence, he saw James the [son] of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets. 
<p>
<p>(9) The calling of James and John.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#021">Mark 1:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">mar 1:21</A></FONT></span></p>And they went into (k) Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught. 
<p>
<p>(k) From the city of Nazareth.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#023">Mark 1:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">mar 1:23</A></FONT></span></p>(10) And there was in their synagogue a man (l) with an unclean spirit; and he cried out, 
<p>
<p>(10) He preaches that doctrine by which alone Satan is driven out of the world, which he also confirms by a miracle. 
<p>
<p>(l) Literally, "a man in an unclean spirit", that is to say, possessed with an evil spirit.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#024">Mark 1:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">mar 1:24</A></FONT></span></p>Saying, Let [us] alone; what have we to do with thee, thou (m) Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the (n) Holy One of God. 
<p>
<p>(m) He was born in Bethlehem, but through the error of the people he was called a Nazarene, because he was brought up in Nazareth. 
<p>
<p>(n) He alludes to the name that was written in the golden plate which the high Priest wore; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#036">Exo 28:36</A>)  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#026">Mark 1:26</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_026">mar 1:26</A></FONT></span></p>And when the unclean spirit (o) had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him. 
<p>
<p>(o) See below, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#020">Mar 9:20</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#027">Mark 1:27</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_027">mar 1:27</A></FONT></span></p>And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned (p) among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine [is] this? for with authority (q) commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him. 
<p>
<p>(p) As men who were amazed. 
<p>
<p>(q) By his own authority, or as a lord.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#028">Mark 1:28</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_028">mar 1:28</A></FONT></span></p>And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region (r) round about Galilee. 
<p>
<p>(r) Not only into Galilee, but also into the countries bordering upon it.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#029">Mark 1:29</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_029">mar 1:29</A></FONT></span></p>(11) And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. 
<p>
<p>(11) By healing different diseases he shows that he has brought true life into the world.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#034">Mark 1:34</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_034">mar 1:34</A></FONT></span></p>And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and (f) suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him. 
<p>
<p>(s) For it is not proper for the demons to preach the gospel; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#018">Act 16:18</A>)  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#038">Mark 1:38</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_038">mar 1:38</A></FONT></span></p>And he said unto them, Let us go into the (t) next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth. 
<p>
<p>(t) Villages which were like cities.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#040">Mark 1:40</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_040">mar 1:40</A></FONT></span></p>(12) And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. 
<p>
<p>(12) By healing the leprous he shows that he came for this reason: to wipe out the sins of the world with his touch.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#044">Mark 1:44</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_044">mar 1:44</A></FONT></span></p>(13) And saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the (u) priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them. 
<p>
<p>(13) He shows that he was not motivated by ambition, but only by the desire for his Father's glory, and by his love towards poor sinners. 
<p>
<p>(u) All the posterity of Aaron had the authority to judge a leper.
