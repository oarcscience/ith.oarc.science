<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">rut 2:1</A></FONT></span></p>And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of (a) wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name [was] Boaz. 
<p>
<p>(a) Or power, both in virtue, authority and riches.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#002">Ruth 2:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">rut 2:2</A></FONT></span></p>And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and (b) glean ears of corn after [him] in whose sight I shall find grace. And she said unto her, Go, my daughter. 
<p>
<p>(b) Her humility declares her great love for her mother in law, for she spared no hardship to get both their livings.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#009">Ruth 2:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">rut 2:9</A></FONT></span></p>(c) [Let] thine eyes [be] on the field that they do reap, and go thou after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and drink of [that] which the young men have drawn. 
<p>
<p>(c) That is, take notice of what field they reap.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#010">Ruth 2:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">rut 2:10</A></FONT></span></p>Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I [am] a (d) stranger? 
<p>
<p>(d) Of the Moabites, who are enemies of God's people.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#012">Ruth 2:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">rut 2:12</A></FONT></span></p>The LORD recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of the LORD God of Israel, under whose (e) wings thou art come to trust. 
<p>
<p>(e) Signifying, that she would never lack anything, if she put her trust in God, and lived under his protection.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#014">Ruth 2:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">rut 2:14</A></FONT></span></p>And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers: and he reached her parched [corn], and she did eat, and was sufficed, and (f) left. 
<p>
<p>(f) Which she brought home to her mother in law.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#018">Ruth 2:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">rut 2:18</A></FONT></span></p>And she took [it] up, and went into the city: and her mother in law saw what she had gleaned: and she [g brought forth, and gave to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed. 
<p>
<p>(g) That is, from her bag, as it is in the Chaldee text.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#020">Ruth 2:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">rut 2:20</A></FONT></span></p>And Naomi said unto her daughter in law, Blessed [be] he of the LORD, who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the (h) dead. And Naomi said unto her, The man [is] near of kin unto us, one of our next kinsmen. 
<p>
<p>(h) To my husband and children, when they were alive, and now to us.
