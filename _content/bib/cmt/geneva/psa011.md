### [Psalms Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#001)

[Psalms 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 11:1</span></span>

"To the chief Musician, \[A Psalm\] of David." In the LORD put I my
trust: how say ye to my soul, (a) Flee \[as\] a bird to your mountain?

\(a\) This is the wicked counsel of his enemies to him and his
companions to drive him from the hope of God's promise.

[Psalms 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 11:3</span></span>

If the (b) foundations be destroyed, what can the (c) righteous do?

\(b\) All hope of help is taken away.

\(c\) Yet am I innocent and my cause good.

[Psalms 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 11:4</span></span>

The LORD \[is\] in his holy temple, the LORD'S throne \[is\] in heaven:
his eyes (d) behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.

\(d\) Though all things in earth are out of order, yet God will execute
judgment from heaven.

[Psalms 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 11:6</span></span>

Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, (e) fire and brimstone, and an
horrible tempest: \[this shall be\] the (f) portion of their cup.

\(e\) As in the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah.

\(f\) Which they will drink even to the dregs, ([Eze
23:34](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#034)).
