### [Genesis Chapter 45](../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#001)

[Genesis 45:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 45:1</span></span>

Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him;
and he cried, (a) Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no
man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren.

\(a\) Not because he was ashamed of his kindred, but rather because he
wanted to cover his brother's sin.

[Genesis 45:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 45:5</span></span>

Now therefore be not (b) grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye
sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life.

\(b\) This example teaches that we must by all means comfort those who
are truly ashamed and sorry for their sins.

[Genesis 45:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 45:8</span></span>

So now \[it was\] not you \[that\] sent me hither, but (c) God: and he
hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler
throughout all the land of Egypt.

\(c\) Though God detests sin, yet he turns man's wickedness into his
glory.

[Genesis 45:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gen 45:12</span></span>

And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that
\[it is\] (d) my mouth that speaketh unto you.

\(d\) That is, that I speak in your own language and have no
interpreter.

[Genesis 45:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">gen 45:18</span></span>

And take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will
give you the (e) good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the (f) fat
of the land.

\(e\) The most plentiful ground.

\(f\) The main fruits and conveniences.

[Genesis 45:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">gen 45:24</span></span>

So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them,
See that ye (g) fall not out by the way.

\(g\) Seeing he had remitted the fault done to him, he did not want them
to accuse one another.

[Genesis 45:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">gen 45:26</span></span>

And told him, saying, Joseph \[is\] yet alive, and he \[is\] governor
over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's heart (h) fainted, for he
believed them not.

\(h\) As one between hope and fear.
