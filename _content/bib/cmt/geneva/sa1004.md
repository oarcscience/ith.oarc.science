### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#001)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 4:3</span></span>

And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said,
(a) Wherefore hath the LORD smitten us to day before the Philistines?
Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of Shiloh unto us,
that, when it cometh among us, it may save us out of the hand of our
enemies.

\(a\) For it seems that this war was undertaken by Samuel's commandment.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa1 4:4</span></span>

So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence the ark
of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, which (b) dwelleth \[between\] the
cherubims: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, \[were\] there
with the ark of the covenant of God.

\(b\) For he used to appear to the Israelites between the cherubim over
the ark of the covenant, ([Exo 25:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#017)).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa1 4:7</span></span>

And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the
camp. And they said, (c) Woe unto us! for there hath not been such a
thing heretofore.

\(c\) Before we fought against men, and now God has come to fight
against us.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa1 4:8</span></span>

Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods?
these \[are\] the Gods that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues in
the (d) wilderness.

\(d\) For in the Red Sea in the wilderness the Egyptians were destroyed,
which was the last of all his plagues.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa1 4:10</span></span>

And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every
man into his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell
of Israel (e) thirty thousand footmen.

\(e\) David alluding to this place in ([Psa
78:63](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#063)) says they were consumed with
fire: meaning they were suddenly destroyed.

And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the
same day with his clothes (f) rent, and with earth upon his head.

\(f\) In token of sorrow and mourning.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa1 4:13</span></span>

And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching: for
his heart (g) trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into
the city, and told \[it\], all the city cried out.

\(g\) Lest it should be taken by the enemy.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa1 4:17</span></span>

And the messenger answered and said, Israel is fled before the
Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the
people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, (b) are dead, and
the ark of God is taken.

\(b\) According as God had said before.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa1 4:19</span></span>

And his daughter in law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, \[near\] to be
delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken,
and that her father in law and her husband were dead, she (i) bowed
herself and travailed; for her pains came upon her.

\(i\) And positioned her body for her labour and delivery.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">sa1 4:22</span></span>

And she said, (k) The glory is departed from Israel: for the ark of God
is taken.

\(k\) She uttered her great sorrow by repeating her words.
