Let destruction come upon (f) him at unawares; and let his net that he
hath hid catch himself: into (g) that very destruction let him fall.

\(f\) When he promises peace to himself.

\(g\) Which he prepared against the children of God.

[Psalms 35:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 35:10</span></span>

All my (h) bones shall say, LORD, who \[is\] like unto thee, which
deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, yea, the poor
and the needy from him that spoileth him?

\(h\) He attributes his deliverance only to God, praising him therefore
both in soul and body.

[Psalms 35:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 35:11</span></span>

that I knew not.

\(i\) That would not permit me to purge myself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 35:12</span></span>

They rewarded me evil for good \[to\] the (k) spoiling of my soul.

\(k\) To have taken from me all comfort and brought me into despair.

[Psalms 35:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 35:13</span></span>

But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing \[was\] sackcloth: I
humbled my soul with fasting; and (l) my prayer returned into mine own
bosom.

\(l\) I prayed for them with inward affection, as I would have done for
myself: or, I declared my affection with bowing down my head.

[Psalms 35:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 35:15</span></span>

But in mine (m) adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves
together: \[yea\], the abjects gathered themselves together against me,
and I knew \[it\] not; they did tear (n) \[me\], and ceased not:

\(m\) When they thought me ready to slip and as one that limped for
infirmity.

\(n\) With their railing words.

[Psalms 35:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 35:16</span></span>

teeth.

their dainty feasts scoff, rail, and conspire his death.

\[neither\] let them (p) wink with the eye that hate me without a cause.

[Psalms 35:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">psa 35:21</span></span>

Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, \[and\] said, Aha, aha,
(q) our eye hath seen \[it\].

\(q\) They rejoiced as though they had now seen David overthrown.

[Psalms 35:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">psa 35:24</span></span>

Judge me, O LORD my God, according to thy (r) righteousness; and let
them not rejoice over me.

\(r\) It is the justice of God to give to the oppressors affliction and
torment, and to the oppressed aid and relief, ([Th2
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#006)).

[Psalms 35:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">psa 35:25</span></span>

Let them not say in their hearts, (s) Ah, so would we have it: let them
not say, We have swallowed him up.

Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion (t) together that rejoice
at mine hurt: let them be clothed (u) with shame and dishonour that
magnify \[themselves\] against me.

\(t\) That is, at once, were they never so many or mighty.

\(u\) This prayer will always be verified against them who persecute the
faithful.

[Psalms 35:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">psa 35:27</span></span>

Let them shout for joy, and be glad, (x) that favour my righteous cause:
yea, let them say continually, Let the LORD be magnified, which hath
pleasure in the (y) prosperity of his servant.

\(x\) That at least favour my right, though they are not able to help
me.

\(y\) He exhorts the Church to praise God for the deliverance of his
servants, and for the destruction of his adversaries.

[Psalms 35:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 35:1</span></span>

"\[A Psalm\] of David." Plead \[my (a) cause\], O LORD, with them that
strive with me: fight against them that fight against me.

him and slander him.

[Psalms 35:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 35:2</span></span>

the Holy Spirit attributes to him these outward weapons to assure us of
his patient power.

salvation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 35:5</span></span>

Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of the LORD (d)
chase \[them\].

\(d\) Smite them with the spirit of giddiness that their enterprises may
be foolish, and they received just reward.

[Psalms 35:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 35:7</span></span>

For (e) without cause have they hid for me their net \[in\] a pit,
\[which\] without cause they have digged for my soul.

\(e\) Showing that we may not call God to be a revenger but only for his
glory, and when our cause is just.
