<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">isa 15:1</A></FONT></span></p>The (a) burden of Moab. Because in the night (b) Ar of Moab is laid waste, [and] brought to silence; because in the night Kir of Moab is laid waste, [and] brought to silence; 
<p>
<p>(a) See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#001">Isa 13:1</A> 
<p>
<p>(b) The chief city by which the whole country was meant.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#002">Isaiah 15:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">isa 15:2</A></FONT></span></p>(c) He is gone up to Bajith, and to Dibon, the high places, to weep: Moab shall wail over (d) Nebo, and over Medeba: on all (e) their heads [shall be] baldness, [and] every beard shorn. 
<p>
<p>(c) The Moabites will flee to their idols for comfort but it will be too late. 
<p>
<p>(d) Which were cites of Moab. 
<p>
<p>(e) For as in the west parts the people used to let their hair grow long when they mourned, so in the East part they cut it off.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#005">Isaiah 15:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">isa 15:5</A></FONT></span></p>My (f) heart shall cry out for Moab; his fugitives [shall flee] to Zoar, (g) an heifer of three years old: for they shall go up the ascent of Luhith with weeping for in the way of Horonaim they (h) shall raise a cry of destruction. 
<p>
<p>(f) The prophet speaks this in the person of the Moabites: or as one who felt the great judgment of God that God would come on them. 
<p>
<p>(g) Meaning that it was a city that always lived in pleasure and never felt sorrow. 
<p>
<p>(h) He describes the miserable dissipation and flight of the Moabites.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#007">Isaiah 15:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">isa 15:7</A></FONT></span></p>Therefore the abundance they have gained, and that which they have laid up, shall they carry away to the (i) brook of the willows. 
<p>
<p>(i) To hide themselves and their goods there.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#009">Isaiah 15:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">isa 15:9</A></FONT></span></p>For the waters of Dimon shall be full (k) of blood: for I will bring more upon Dimon, lions (l) upon him that escapeth of Moab, and upon the remnant of the land. 
<p>
<p>(k) Of them who are slain. 
<p>
<p>(l) So that by no means would they escape the hand of God: thus will God punish the enemies of his Church.
