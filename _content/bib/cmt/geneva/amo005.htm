<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#002">Amos 5:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">amo 5:2</A></FONT></span></p>The (a) virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise: she is forsaken upon her land; [there is] none to raise her up. 
<p>
<p>(a) He so calls them, because they so boasted of themselves, or because they were given to lustfulness and daintiness.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#003">Amos 5:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">amo 5:3</A></FONT></span></p>For thus saith the Lord GOD; The city that went out [by] a thousand shall leave (b) an hundred, and that which went forth [by] an hundred shall leave ten, to the house of Israel. 
<p>
<p>(b) Meaning, that the tenth part would hardly be saved.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#005">Amos 5:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">amo 5:5</A></FONT></span></p>But seek not Bethel, nor enter into (c) Gilgal, and pass not to Beersheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Bethel shall come to nought. 
<p>
<p>(c) In those places they worshipped new idols, which before served for the true honour of God: therefore he says that these will not save them.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#007">Amos 5:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">amo 5:7</A></FONT></span></p>Ye who turn (d) judgment to wormwood, and leave off righteousness in the earth, 
<p>
<p>(d) Instead of judgment and fairness they execute cruelty and oppression.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#008">Amos 5:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">amo 5:8</A></FONT></span></p>[Seek him] that (e) maketh the seven stars and Orion, and turneth the shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark with night: that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The LORD [is] his name: 
<p>
<p>(e) He describes the power of God; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#009">Job 9:9</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#010">Amos 5:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">amo 5:10</A></FONT></span></p>They hate him (f) that rebuketh in the gate, and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly. 
<p>
<p>(f) They hate the Prophets, who reprove them in the open assemblies.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#011">Amos 5:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">amo 5:11</A></FONT></span></p>Forasmuch therefore as your treading [is] upon the poor, and (g) ye take from him burdens of wheat: ye have built houses of hewn stone, but ye shall not dwell in them; ye have planted pleasant vineyards, but ye shall not drink wine of them. 
<p>
<p>(g) You take both his money and also his food, with which he should live.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#013">Amos 5:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">amo 5:13</A></FONT></span></p>Therefore (h) the prudent shall keep silence in that time; for it [is] an evil time. 
<p>
<p>(h) God will so plague them that they will not allow the godly to open their mouths once to admonish them of their faults.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#016">Amos 5:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">amo 5:16</A></FONT></span></p>Therefore the LORD, the God of hosts, the Lord, saith thus; Wailing [shall be] in all streets; and they shall say in all the highways, Alas! alas! and they shall call the (i) husbandman to mourning, and such as are skilful of lamentation to wailing. 
<p>
<p>(i) So that people of all types will have reason to lament because of the great plagues.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#018">Amos 5:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">amo 5:18</A></FONT></span></p>Woe unto you that (k) desire the day of the LORD! to what end [is] it for you? the day of the LORD [is] darkness, and not light. 
<p>
<p>(k) He speaks in this way because the wicked and hypocrites said they were content to endure God's judgments, whereas the godly tremble and fear; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#007">Jer 30:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#002">Joe 2:2</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#011">Joe 2:11</A>), (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#015">Zep 1:15</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#022">Amos 5:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">amo 5:22</A></FONT></span></p>Though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, (l) I will not accept [them]: neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts. 
<p>
<p>(l) Because you have corrupted my true service, and remain obstinate in your vices; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#011">Isa 1:11</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#010">Jer 6:10</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#024">Amos 5:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">amo 5:24</A></FONT></span></p>But let judgment run down as (m) waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream. 
<p>
<p>(m) Do your duty to God, and to your neighbour, and so you will plentifully feel his grace, if you show your abundant affections according to God's word.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#026">Amos 5:26</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_026">amo 5:26</A></FONT></span></p>But ye have borne the tabernacle of your (n) Moloch and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves. 
<p>
<p>(n) That idol which you esteemed as your king, and carried about as you did Chiun, in which images you thought that there was a certain divinity.
