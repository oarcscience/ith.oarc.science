<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">sa2 10:2</A></FONT></span></p>Then said David, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father (a) shewed kindness unto me. And David sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father. And David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon. 
<p>
<p>(a) The children of God are not unmindful of a benefit received. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#003">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 10:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">sa2 10:3</A></FONT></span></p>And the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their lord, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? hath not David [rather] sent his servants unto thee, (b) to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it? 
<p>
<p>(b) Their arrogant malice would not allow them to see the simplicity of David's heart: therefore their counsel turned to the destruction of their country. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#006">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 10:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">sa2 10:6</A></FONT></span></p>And when the children of Ammon saw that they (c) stank before David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Bethrehob, and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen, and of king Maacah a thousand men, and of Ishtob twelve thousand men. 
<p>
<p>(c) That they deserved David's displeasure, for the harm done to his ambassadors. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#008">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 10:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">sa2 10:8</A></FONT></span></p>And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entering in of the gate: and the Syrians of (d) Zoba, and of Rehob, and Ishtob, and Maacah, [were] by themselves in the field. 
<p>
<p>(d) These were various parts of the country of Syria, by which it appears that the Syrians served where they might have entertainment, as now the Sweitzers do. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#012">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 10:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">sa2 10:12</A></FONT></span></p>Be of good courage, and let us play the men for (e) our people, and for the cities of our God: and the LORD do that which seemeth him good. 
<p>
<p>(e) Here it is declared why war should be undertaken: for the defence of true religion and God's people. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#017">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 10:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">sa2 10:17</A></FONT></span></p>And when it was told David, he gathered (f) all Israel together, and passed over Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with him. 
<p>
<p>(f) Meaning, the greatest part. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#018">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 10:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">sa2 10:18</A></FONT></span></p>And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew [the men of] (g) seven hundred chariots of the Syrians, and forty thousand horsemen, and smote Shobach the captain of their host, who died there. 
<p>
<p>(g) Who were the chief and most principal: for in all he destroyed 7000, as in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#018">Ch1 19:18</A>), or the soldiers who were in 700 chariots.
