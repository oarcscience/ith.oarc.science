### [Ecclesiastes Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#001)

[Ecclesiastes 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ecc 7:1</span></span>

A good name \[is\] better than precious ointment; and the day of (b)
death than the day of one's birth.

\(b\) He speaks thus after the judgment of the flesh, which thinks death
is the end of all evils, or else because this corporal death is the
entering into everlasting life.

[Ecclesiastes 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ecc 7:2</span></span>

\[It is\] better to go to the house of (c) mourning, than to go to the
house of feasting: for that \[is\] the end of all men; and the living
will lay \[it\] to his heart.

\(c\) Where we may see the hand of God and learn to examine our lives.

[Ecclesiastes 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ecc 7:6</span></span>

For as the crackling of (d) thorns under a pot, so \[is\] the laughter
of the fool: this also \[is\] vanity.

\(d\) Which crackle for a while and profit nothing.

[Ecclesiastes 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ecc 7:7</span></span>

Surely oppression maketh a wise man (e) mad; and a gift destroyeth the
heart.

\(e\) A man that is esteemed wise, when he falls to oppression, becomes
like a beast.

[Ecclesiastes 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ecc 7:8</span></span>

Better \[is\] the (f) end of a thing than its beginning: \[and\] the
patient in spirit \[is\] better than the proud in spirit.

\(f\) He notes their lightness who attempt a thing and suddenly leave it
off again.

[Ecclesiastes 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ecc 7:10</span></span>

Say not thou, What is \[the cause\] that the former days were better
than these? for thou dost not enquire (g) wisely concerning this.

\(g\) Murmur not against God when he sends adversities for man's sins.

[Ecclesiastes 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ecc 7:11</span></span>

Wisdom \[is\] good with an (h) inheritance: and \[by it there is\]
profit to them that see the sun.

\(h\) He answers to them who do not value wisdom unless riches are
joined with it, showing that both are the gifts of God, but that wisdom
is far more excellent and may be without riches.

[Ecclesiastes 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ecc 7:14</span></span>

In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity (i)
consider: God also hath appointed the one as well as the other, to the
end that man should find (k) nothing after him.

\(i\) Consider why God sends it and what may comfort you.

\(k\) That man should be able to control nothing in his works.

[Ecclesiastes 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ecc 7:15</span></span>

All \[things\] have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just
\[man\] that perisheth in his (l) righteousness, and there is a wicked
\[man\] that prolongeth \[his life\] in his wickedness.

\(l\) Meaning that cruel tyrants put the godly to death and let the
wicked go free.

[Ecclesiastes 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ecc 7:16</span></span>

Be not righteous (m) over much; neither make thyself over wise: why
shouldest thou destroy thyself?

\(m\) Do not boast too much of your own justice and wisdom.

[Ecclesiastes 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ecc 7:17</span></span>

Be not (n) over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou
die before thy time?

\(n\) Do not tarry long when you are admonished to come out of the way
of wickedness.

[Ecclesiastes 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ecc 7:18</span></span>

\[It is\] good that thou shouldest take hold of (o) this; yea, also from
(p) this withdraw not thy hand: for he that feareth God shall escape
from them all.

\(o\) That is, on these admonitions that go before.

\(p\) Consider what desolation and destruction will come, if you do not
obey them.

[Ecclesiastes 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ecc 7:21</span></span>

Also take no (q) heed to all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy
servant curse thee:

\(q\) Credit them not, neither care for them.

[Ecclesiastes 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ecc 7:24</span></span>

That which is far off, (r) and exceedingly deep, who can find it out?

\(r\) Meaning wisdom.

[Ecclesiastes 7:27](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">ecc 7:27</span></span>

Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher, \[counting\] one by one,
to (s) find out the account:

\(s\) That is, to come to a conclusion.

[Ecclesiastes 7:29](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">ecc 7:29</span></span>

Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they
have sought out many (t) devices.

\(t\) And so are cause for their own destruction.
