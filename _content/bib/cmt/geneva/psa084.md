### [Psalms Chapter 84](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#001)

[Psalms 84:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 84:1</span></span>

"To the chief Musician upon Gittith, A Psalm for the sons of Korah." How
amiable \[are\] thy tabernacles, O (a) LORD of hosts!

\(a\) David complains that he cannot have access to the Church of God to
make profession of his faith, and to profit in religion.

[Psalms 84:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 84:2</span></span>

My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the (b) courts of the LORD: my
heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.

\(b\) For only the priests could enter the sanctuary and the rest of the
people into the courts.

[Psalms 84:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 84:3</span></span>

Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for
herself, where she may lay her young, \[even\] thine (c) altars, O LORD
of hosts, my King, and my God.

\(c\) So that the poor birds have more freedom than I.

[Psalms 84:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 84:5</span></span>

Blessed \[is\] the man whose (d) strength \[is\] in thee; in whose heart
\[are\] the ways \[of them\].

\(d\) Who trusts nothing in himself but in you only, and learns from you
to rule his life.

[Psalms 84:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 84:6</span></span>

\[Who\] passing through the valley of (c) Baca make it a well; the rain
also filleth the pools.

\(c\) So that the poor birds have more freedom than I.

[Psalms 84:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 84:7</span></span>

They go from (f) strength to strength, \[every one of them\] in Zion
appeareth before God.

\(f\) They are never weary but increase in strength and courage till
they come to God's house.

[Psalms 84:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 84:9</span></span>

Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thine (g) anointed.

\(g\) That is, for Christ's sake, whose figure I represent.

[Psalms 84:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 84:10</span></span>

For (h) a day in thy courts \[is\] better than a thousand. I had rather
be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of
wickedness.

\(h\) He would rather live one day in God's Church than a thousand in
the world.

[Psalms 84:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 84:11</span></span>

For the LORD God \[is\] a sun and shield: the LORD will give grace and
glory: no (i) good \[thing\] will he withhold from them that walk
uprightly.

\(i\) But will from time to time increase his blessings toward his more
and more.
