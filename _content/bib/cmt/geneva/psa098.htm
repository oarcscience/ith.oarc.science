<p>
<p>(a) That is, some song newly made in token of their wonderful deliverance by Christ. 
<p>
<p>(b) He preserves his Church miraculously.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#002">Psalms 98:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">psa 98:2</A></FONT></span></p>The LORD hath made known his (c) salvation: his righteousness hath he openly shewed in the sight of the heathen. 
<p>
<p>(c) For the deliverance of his Church.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#003">Psalms 98:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">psa 98:3</A></FONT></span></p>He hath (d) remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God. 
<p>
<p>(d) God was moved by no other means to gather his Church from the Jews and Gentiles, but because he would perform his promise.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#006">Psalms 98:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">psa 98:6</A></FONT></span></p>With (e) trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before the LORD, the King. 
<p>
<p>(e) By this repetition and earnest exhortation to give praise with instruments, and also of the dumb creatures, he signifies that the world is never able to praise God sufficiently for their deliverance.
