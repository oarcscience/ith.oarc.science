### [Malachi Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001)

[Malachi 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mal 3:1</span></span>

Behold, I will send my (a) messenger, and he shall prepare the way
before me: and the (b) Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his
temple, even the (c) messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in:
behold, he shall come, saith the LORD of hosts.

\(a\) This is meant of John the Baptist, as Christ interprets it; ([Luk
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#027)).

\(b\) Meaning, the Messiah, as in ([Psa
40:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#017); [Dan
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#017), [Dan
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025)).

\(c\) That is, Christ, by whom the covenant was made and ratified, who
is called the angel or messenger of the covenant, because he reconciles
us to his Father, and is Lord or King, because he has the rule of his
Church.

[Malachi 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mal 3:2</span></span>

But who (d) may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he
appeareth? for he \[is\] like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap:

\(d\) He shows that the hypocrites who wish so much for the Lord's
coming will not remain when he draws near: for he will consume them, and
purge his own and make them clean.

[Malachi 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mal 3:3</span></span>

And he shall sit \[as\] a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall
purify the sons of (e) Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that
they may offer unto the LORD an offering in righteousness.

\(e\) He begins at the priests, that they might be lights, and shine
unto others.

[Malachi 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mal 3:6</span></span>

For I \[am\] the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob (f) are
not consumed.

\(f\) They murmured against God, because they did not see his help which
was ever present to defend them: and therefore he accuses them of
ingratitude, and shows that in that they are not daily consumed, it is a
sign that he still defends them, and so his mercy towards them never
changes.

[Malachi 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mal 3:7</span></span>

Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine
ordinances, and have not kept \[them\]. (g) Return unto me, and I will
return unto you, saith the LORD of hosts. But ye said, Wherein shall we
return?

\(g\) Read ([Zac 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#003)).

[Malachi 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mal 3:8</span></span>

Will a (h) man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have
we robbed thee? In (i) tithes and offerings.

\(h\) There are none of the heathen so barbarous, that will defraud
their gods of their honour, or deal deceitfully with them.

\(i\) By which the service of God should have been maintained, and the
priests and the poor relieved.

[Malachi 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mal 3:10</span></span>

Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in
mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of hosts, if I
will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing,
(k) that \[there shall\] not \[be room\] enough \[to receive it\].

\(k\) Not having respect how much you need, but I will give you in all
abundance, so that you will lack place to put my blessings in.

[Malachi 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mal 3:11</span></span>

And I will rebuke the (l) devourer for your sakes, and he shall not
destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her
fruit before the time in the field, saith the LORD of hosts.

\(l\) Meaning the caterpillar, and whatever destroys corn and fruits.

[Malachi 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mal 3:13</span></span>

Your words have been stout (m) against me, saith the LORD. Yet ye say,
What have we spoken \[so much\] against thee?

\(m\) The Prophet condemns them of double blasphemy against God: first,
in that they said that God had no respect for those that served him, and
next, that the wicked were more in his favour than the godly.

[Malachi 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mal 3:15</span></span>

And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are set
up; yea, \[they that\] tempt God are even (n) delivered.

\(n\) They are not only preferred to honour, but also delivered from
dangers.

[Malachi 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mal 3:16</span></span>

\(o\) Then they that feared the LORD spake often one to another: and the
LORD hearkened, and heard \[it\], and a (p) book of remembrance was
written before him for them that feared the LORD, and that thought upon
his name.

\(o\) After these admonitions of the Prophet, some were strongly
touched, and encouraged others to fear God.

\(p\) Both because the thing was strange that some turned to God in that
great and universal corruption, and also that this might be an example
of God's mercies to all repentant sinners.

[Malachi 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mal 3:17</span></span>

And they shall be mine, saith the LORD of hosts, in that day (q) when I
make up my jewels; and I will (r) spare them, as a man spareth his own
son that serveth him.

\(q\) When I will restore my Church according to my promise, they will
be as my own proper goods.

\(r\) That is, forgive their sins, and govern them with my Spirit.
