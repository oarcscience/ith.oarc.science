<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#002">4 Kings (2 Kings) 22:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">kg2 22:2</A></FONT></span></p>And he did [that which was] right in the sight of the LORD, and (a) walked in all the way of David his father, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left. 
<p>
<p>(a) His zeal was prophesied of, and his name mentioned by Iddo the prophet, more than 300 years before, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#002">Kg1 13:2</A>) and being but eight years old, he sought the God of his father David, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#003">Ch2 34:3</A>). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#004">4 Kings (2 Kings) 22:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">kg2 22:4</A></FONT></span></p>Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may sum the silver which is brought into the house of the LORD, which the keepers of the (b) door have gathered of the people: 
<p>
<p>(b) Certain of the priests were appointed to this office, as in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#009">Kg2 12:9</A>). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#005">4 Kings (2 Kings) 22:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">kg2 22:5</A></FONT></span></p>And let (c) them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD: and let them give it to the doers of the work which [is] in the house of the LORD, to repair the breaches of the house, 
<p>
<p>(c) From the time of Joash for the space of 244 years, the temple remained without repairs through the negligence of the priests. This shows that they who have a charge and do not execute it should have it taken from them. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#007">4 Kings (2 Kings) 22:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">kg2 22:7</A></FONT></span></p>Howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand, because they dealt (d) faithfully. 
<p>
<p>(d) So God provided him with faithful servants, seeing he went about so zealously to set forth the work of God. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#008">4 Kings (2 Kings) 22:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">kg2 22:8</A></FONT></span></p>And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe, I have found the (e) book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it. 
<p>
<p>(e) This was the copy that Moses left them, as it appears in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#014">Ch2 34:14</A>), which either by the negligence of the priests had been lost, or else by the wickedness of idolatrous kings had been abolished. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#013">4 Kings (2 Kings) 22:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">kg2 22:13</A></FONT></span></p>Go ye, (f) enquire of the LORD for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found: for great [is] the wrath of the LORD that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this book, to do according unto all that which is written concerning us. 
<p>
<p>(f) Meaning, to some prophet to whom God reveals the knowledge of things, as in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#008">Jer 21:8</A>), though at other times they enquired the Lord by Urim and Thummim. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#014">4 Kings (2 Kings) 22:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">kg2 22:14</A></FONT></span></p>So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asahiah, went unto Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the (g) college;) and they communed with her. 
<p>
<p>(g) Or the house of doctrine, which was near the temple, and where the learned assembled to search the scriptures and the doctrine of the prophets. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#017">4 Kings (2 Kings) 22:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">kg2 22:17</A></FONT></span></p>Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the (h) works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, and shall not be quenched. 
<p>
<p>(h) The works of man's hand here signifies all that man invents beside the word of God, which are abominable in God's service. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#019">4 Kings (2 Kings) 22:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">kg2 22:19</A></FONT></span></p>Because thine heart was (i) tender, and thou hast humbled thyself before the LORD, when thou heardest what I spake against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and hast rent thy clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard [thee], saith the LORD. 
<p>
<p>(i) Meaning, that he repented as they that do not repent are said to harden their heart, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#008">Psa 95:8</A>). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#020">4 Kings (2 Kings) 22:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">kg2 22:20</A></FONT></span></p>Behold therefore, I will gather thee unto thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered into thy grave in (k) peace; and thine eyes shall not see all the evil which I will bring upon this place. And they brought the king word again. 
<p>
<p>(k) Upon which we may gather that the anger of God is ready against the wicked when God takes his servants out of this world.
