<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#001">Deuteronomy 3:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">deu 3:1</A></FONT></span></p>Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan (a) came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei. 
<p>
<p>(a) Therefore aside from the commandment of the Lord, they had just cause to fight against him.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#005">Deuteronomy 3:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">deu 3:5</A></FONT></span></p>All these cities [were] fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside (b) unwalled towns a great many. 
<p>
<p>(b) As villages and small towns.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#006">Deuteronomy 3:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">deu 3:6</A></FONT></span></p>And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, (c) women, and children, of every city. 
<p>
<p>(c) Because this was God's appointment, therefore it may not be judged cruel.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#011">Deuteronomy 3:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">deu 3:11</A></FONT></span></p>For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold, his (d) bedstead [was] a bedstead of iron; [is] it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits [was] the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man. 
<p>
<p>(d) The more terrible this giant was, the greater reason they had to glorify God for the victory.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#014">Deuteronomy 3:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">deu 3:14</A></FONT></span></p>Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashanhavothjair, unto (e) this day. 
<p>
<p>(e) Meaning, when he wrote this history.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#016">Deuteronomy 3:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">deu 3:16</A></FONT></span></p>And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even unto the river (f) Jabbok, [which is] the border of the children of Ammon; 
<p>
<p>(f) Which separates the Ammonites from the Amorites.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#018">Deuteronomy 3:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">deu 3:18</A></FONT></span></p>And I commanded (g) you at that time, saying, The LORD your God hath given you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all [that are] meet for the war. 
<p>
<p>(g) That is, the Reubenites, Gadites, and half Manasseh, as in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#032">Num 32:32</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#021">Deuteronomy 3:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">deu 3:21</A></FONT></span></p>And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that the (h) LORD your God hath done unto these two kings: so shall the LORD do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest. 
<p>
<p>(h) So that the victories did not come by your own wisdom, strength or multitude.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#024">Deuteronomy 3:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">deu 3:24</A></FONT></span></p>O Lord GOD, thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness, and thy mighty hand: for what God [is there] in heaven or in earth, that can (i) do according to thy works, and according to thy might? 
<p>
<p>(i) He speaks according to the common and corrupt speech of those who attribute power to idols that only belongs to God.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#025">Deuteronomy 3:25</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_025">deu 3:25</A></FONT></span></p>I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that [is] beyond Jordan, that goodly (k) mountain, and Lebanon. 
<p>
<p>(k) He means Zion, where the Temple should be built, and God honoured.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#027">Deuteronomy 3:27</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_027">deu 3:27</A></FONT></span></p>Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and (l) lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold [it] with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan. 
<p>
<p>(l) As before he saw by the spirits of prophecy the good mountain which was Zion: so here his eyes were lifted up above the order of nature to behold all the plentiful land of Canaan.
