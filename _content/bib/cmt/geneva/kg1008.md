### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#001)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 8:1</span></span>

Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the
tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto king
Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might (a) bring up the ark of the
covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which \[is\] Zion.

\(a\) For David brought it from Obed-edom, and placed it in the
tabernacle which he made for it in ([Sa2
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#017)).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg1 8:2</span></span>

And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the
feast in the month (b) Ethanim, which \[is\] the seventh month.

\(b\) Containing part of September and part of October, in which they
held three solemn feasts, ([Num 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#001)).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg1 8:6</span></span>

And the (c) priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto
his place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy \[place,
even\] under the wings of the cherubims.

\(c\) That is, the Kohathites, ([Num
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#005)).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg1 8:8</span></span>

And they (d) drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves were seen
out in the holy \[place\] before the oracle, and they were not seen
without: and there they are unto this day.

\(d\) They drew them out only far enough to be seen, for they could not
pull them out completely, ([Exo
25:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#015)).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg1 8:9</span></span>

\[There was\] nothing in the ark (e) save the two tables of stone, which
Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made \[a covenant\] with the
children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.

\(e\) For it is likely that the enemy when they had the ark in their
hands took away the rod of Aaron and the pot of manna.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg1 8:13</span></span>

I have surely built thee an house to dwell in, a settled place for thee
to abide in for (f) ever.

\(f\) He spoke according to the tenor of God's promise which was on the
condition that they served him correctly.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg1 8:21</span></span>

And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein \[is\] the (g)
covenant of the LORD, which he made with our fathers, when he brought
them out of the land of Egypt.

\(g\) The two tables in which the articles of the covenant were written.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg1 8:23</span></span>

And he said, LORD God of Israel, \[there is\] no God like thee, in
heaven above, or on earth beneath, who keepest covenant and mercy with
thy servants that walk before thee with (h) all their heart:

\(h\) Truthfully and without hypocrisy.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg1 8:27</span></span>

\(i\) But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and
heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I
have builded?

\(i\) He is ravished with the admiration of God's mercies, who being
incomprehensible and Lord over all will become familiar with men.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">kg1 8:31</span></span>

If any man trespass against his neighbour, (k) and an oath be laid upon
him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this
house:

\(k\) That is, the judge or neighbours.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">kg1 8:32</span></span>

Then hear thou in heaven, and (l) do, and judge thy servants, condemning
the wicked, to bring his way upon his head; and justifying the
righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.

\(l\) That is, make it known.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">kg1 8:33</span></span>

When thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy, because they
have sinned against thee, and shall turn again to thee, and (m) confess
thy name, and pray, and make supplication unto thee in this house:

\(m\) Acknowledge your just judgment and praise you.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">kg1 8:35</span></span>

When heaven is (n) shut up, and there is no rain, because they have
sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess thy
name, and turn from their sin, when thou afflictest them:

\(n\) So that there is a drought to destroy the fruit of the land.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">kg1 8:38</span></span>

What prayer and supplication soever be \[made\] by any man, \[or\] by
all thy people Israel, which shall know every man the plague of his own
(o) heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house:

\(o\) For such are most suitable to receive God's mercies.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:41](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">kg1 8:41</span></span>

Moreover concerning a (p) stranger, that \[is\] not of thy people
Israel, but cometh out of a far country for thy name's sake;

\(p\) He means such as should be turned from their idolatry to serve the
true God.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:43](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">kg1 8:43</span></span>

Hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and do according to all that the
stranger calleth to thee for: that all people of the earth may know thy
name, to fear thee, as \[do\] thy people Israel; and that they may know
that this house, which I have builded, is called by thy (q) name.

\(q\) That this is the true religion with which you will be worshipped.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:47](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#047)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">kg1 8:47</span></span>

\[Yet\] if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they were
carried captives, and repent, and make supplication unto thee (r) in the
land of them that carried them captives, saying, We have sinned, and
have done perversely, we have committed wickedness;

\(r\) Though the temple was the chief place of prayer, yet he does not
exclude them who being forced by necessity to call upon him in other
places.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:48](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#048)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">kg1 8:48</span></span>

And \[so\] return unto thee with all their heart, and with all their
soul, in the land of their enemies, which led them away captive, and
pray unto thee toward (s) their land, which thou gavest unto their
fathers, the city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have
built for thy name:

\(s\) As Daniel did in ([Dan 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#010)).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:50](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#050)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">kg1 8:50</span></span>

And forgive thy people that have sinned against thee, and all their
transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee, and give
them compassion before them who carried them captive, that they may (t)
have compassion on them:

\(t\) He understood by faith, that God of enemies would make friends
with them who converted to him.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:54](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#054)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">kg1 8:54</span></span>

And it was \[so\], that when Solomon had made an (u) end of praying all
this prayer and supplication unto the LORD, he arose from before the
altar of the LORD, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up
to heaven.

\(u\) Solomon is a figure of Christ, who continually is the mediator
between God and his Church.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:58](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#058)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_058">kg1 8:58</span></span>

That he may (x) incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his ways,
and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgments, which
he commanded our fathers.

\(x\) He concludes that man of himself is enemy to God, and that all
obedience to his law proceeds from his mercy.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:63](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#063)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_063">kg1 8:63</span></span>

And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered
unto the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty
thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the
(y) house of the LORD.

\(y\) Before the oracle where the ark was.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:65](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#065)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_065">kg1 8:65</span></span>

And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a great
congregation, from the entering in of (z) Hamath unto the river of
Egypt, before the LORD our God, (a) seven days and seven days, \[even\]
fourteen days.

\(z\) That is, from North to South: meaning all the country.

\(a\) Seven days for the dedication, and seven for the feast.
