<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 6:2</span></span>

Thou art (a) snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the
words of thy mouth.

\(a\) He forbids us not to become surety one for another, according to
the rule of charity, but that we consider for whom and after what sort,
so that the creditor may not be defrauded.

[Proverbs 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 6:6</span></span>

Go to the (b) ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:

\(b\) If the word of God cannot instruct you, learn from the little ant
to labour for yourself and not to burden others.

[Proverbs 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 6:10</span></span>

\[Yet\] a little sleep, a little slumber, (c) a little folding of the
hands to sleep:

\(c\) He expresses the nature of the sluggards, who though they sleep
long, yet never have enough, but always seek opportunity for more.

[Proverbs 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 6:11</span></span>

So shall thy poverty come as one that (d) travelleth, and thy want as
(e) an armed man.

\(d\) That is, suddenly, and when you do not look for it.

\(e\) It will come in such sort, as you are not able to resist it.

[Proverbs 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 6:12</span></span>

A naughty person, (f) a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.

\(f\) He shows to what inconvenience the idle persons and sluggards
come, by calling them unthrifty, or the men of Belial, and slanderous.

[Proverbs 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 6:13</span></span>

He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he (g) teacheth
with his fingers;

\(g\) Thus all his gesture tends to wickedness,

[Proverbs 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 6:18</span></span>

An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, (h) feet that be swift in
running to mischief,

\(h\) Meaning, the raging affections, which carry a man away in such
sort that he cannot tell what he does.

[Proverbs 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#021)

neck.

[Proverbs 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 6:23</span></span>

For the (k) commandment \[is\] a lamp; and the law \[is\] light; and (l)
reproofs of instruction \[are\] the way of life:

\(k\) By the commandment, he means the word of God; and by the
instruction, the preaching and declaration of the same, which is
committed to the Church.

\(l\) And reprehensions when the word is preached bring us to life.

[Proverbs 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">pro 6:25</span></span>

Lust not after her beauty in thy heart; neither let her take thee with
her (m) eyelids.

\(m\) With her wanton looks and gesture.

[Proverbs 6:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 6:27</span></span>

\(n\) Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?

\(n\) Meaning, that she will never cease till she has brought you to
begging, and then seek your destruction.

[Proverbs 6:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">pro 6:30</span></span>

\[Men\] do not (o) despise a thief, if he stealeth to satisfy his (p)
soul when he is hungry;

\(o\) He does not reprove theft, showing that it is not as abominable as
whoredom, for theft can be restored, but adultery is permanent, and
death by the law of God.

\(p\) Meaning, for necessity.

[Proverbs 6:33](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">pro 6:33</span></span>

A (q) wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be
wiped away.

\(q\) That is, death appointed by the Law.

[Proverbs 6:34](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">pro 6:34</span></span>

For jealousy \[is\] the rage of a man: therefore he will not (r) spare
in the day of vengeance.

\(r\) He shows that man by nature seeks the death of he that has abused
his wife, and so concludes that neither God's law nor the law of nature
admits any ransom for the adultery.
