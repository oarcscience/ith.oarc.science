### [Deuteronomy Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#001)

[Deuteronomy 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 9:1</span></span>

Hear, O Israel: Thou \[art\] to pass over Jordan (a) this day, to go in
to possess nations greater and mightier than thyself, cities great and
fenced up to heaven,

\(a\) Meaning shortly.

[Deuteronomy 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">deu 9:2</span></span>

A people great and tall, the children of the Anakims, whom thou knowest,
and \[of whom\] thou hast (b) heard \[say\], Who can stand before the
children of Anak!

\(b\) By the report of the spies. ([Num
13:26](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#026)).

[Deuteronomy 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 9:3</span></span>

Understand therefore this day, that the LORD thy God \[is\] he which (c)
goeth over before thee; \[as\] a consuming fire he shall destroy them,
and he shall bring them down before thy face: so shalt thou drive them
out, and destroy them quickly, as the LORD hath said unto thee.

\(c\) To guide you and govern you.

[Deuteronomy 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">deu 9:4</span></span>

Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the LORD thy God hath cast
them out from before thee, saying, For my (d) righteousness the LORD
hath brought me in to possess this land: but for the wickedness of these
nations the LORD doth drive them out from before thee.

\(d\) Man by himself deserves nothing but God's anger, and if God spares
anyone it comes from his great mercy.

[Deuteronomy 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">deu 9:6</span></span>

Understand therefore, that the LORD thy God giveth thee not this good
land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou \[art\] a (e)
stiffnecked people.

\(e\) Like stubborn oxen who will not endure their masters yoke.

[Deuteronomy 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">deu 9:7</span></span>

Remember, \[and\] forget not, how thou provokedst the LORD thy God to
wrath in the wilderness: (f) from the day that thou didst depart out of
the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been
rebellious against the LORD.

\(f\) He proves by the length of time, that their rebellion was great
and intolerable.

[Deuteronomy 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">deu 9:10</span></span>

And the LORD delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the (g)
finger of God; and on them \[was written\] according to all the words,
which the LORD spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire
in the day of the assembly.

\(g\) That is, miraculously, and not by the hand of men.

[Deuteronomy 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">deu 9:12</span></span>

And the LORD said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for
thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have (h) corrupted
\[themselves\]; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I
commanded them; they have made them a molten image.

\(h\) As soon as man declines from the obedience of God, his ways are
corrupt.

[Deuteronomy 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">deu 9:14</span></span>

\(i\) Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name
from under heaven: and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater
than they.

\(i\) Demonstrating that the prayers of the faithful are a bar to
restrain God's anger so that he does not consume all.

[Deuteronomy 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">deu 9:16</span></span>

And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the LORD your God,
\[and\] had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out of
the (k) way which the LORD had commanded you.

\(k\) That is, from the Law: in which he declares what the cause of our
punishment is.

[Deuteronomy 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">deu 9:20</span></span>

And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have (l) destroyed him: and I
prayed for Aaron also the same time.

\(l\) By which he shows the danger they are in who have authority and do
not resist wickedness.

[Deuteronomy 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">deu 9:21</span></span>

And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire,
and stamped it, \[and\] ground \[it\] very small, \[even\] until it was
as small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that
descended out of the (m) mount.

\(m\) Horeb, or Sinai.

[Deuteronomy 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">deu 9:23</span></span>

Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadeshbarnea, saying, Go up and
possess the land which I have given you; then ye (n) rebelled against
the commandment of the LORD your God, and ye believed him not, nor
hearkened to his voice.

\(n\) At the return of the spies.

[Deuteronomy 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">deu 9:25</span></span>

Thus I fell down before the LORD (o) forty days and forty nights, as I
fell down \[at the first\]; because the LORD had said he would destroy
you.

\(o\) By which is signified that God requires earnest continuance in
prayer.

[Deuteronomy 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">deu 9:27</span></span>

\(p\) Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto
the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their
sin:

\(p\) The godly in their prayers ground on God's promise, and confess
their sins.
