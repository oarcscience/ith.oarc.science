<p>
<p>(a) Where they were in most cruel slavery. 
<p>
<p>(b) To signify that they did not have time to leaven their bread.

<p>
<p>(d) Both the seventh and the first day were holy, as in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#016">Exo 12:16</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#008">Exodus 13:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">exo 13:8</A></FONT></span></p>And thou shalt shew thy son (e) in that day, saying, [This is done] because of that [which] the LORD did unto me when I came forth out of Egypt. 
<p>
<p>(e) When you celebrate the feast of unleavened bread.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">exo 13:9</A></FONT></span></p>And it shall be for a sign unto thee (f) upon thine hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes, that the LORD'S law may be in thy mouth: for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt. 
<p>
<p>(f) You will constantly remember it, as you would of a thing that is in your hand, or before your eyes.

<p>
<p>(g) This is also understood about the horse and other beasts which were not offered in sacrifice. 
<p>
<p>(h) By offering a clean beast in sacrifice; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#006">Lev 12:6</A>).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">exo 13:17</A></FONT></span></p>And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not [through] the way of the land of the Philistines, although that [was] near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they (i) see war, and they return to Egypt: 
<p>
<p>(i) Which the Philistines would have made against them by blocking their passage.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#018">Exodus 13:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">exo 13:18</A></FONT></span></p>But God led the people about, [through] the way of the wilderness of the Red sea: and the children of Israel went up (k) harnessed out of the land of Egypt. 
<p>
<p>(k) That is, not secretly but openly and as the word signifies, set in order by five and five.

<p>
<p>(l) To defend them from the heat of the sun.
