<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#001">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">sa2 15:1</A></FONT></span></p>And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to (a) run before him. 
<p>
<p>(a) Which were as a guard to set forth his estate. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#002">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">sa2 15:2</A></FONT></span></p>And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was [so], that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city [art] thou? And he said, Thy servant [is] of one of the (b) tribes of Israel. 
<p>
<p>(b) That is, noting of what city or place he was. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#004">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">sa2 15:4</A></FONT></span></p>Absalom said moreover, (c) Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice! 
<p>
<p>(c) Thus by slander, flattery and fair promises, the wicked seek preference. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#006">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">sa2 15:6</A></FONT></span></p>And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom (d) stole the hearts of the men of Israel. 
<p>
<p>(d) By enticing them from his father to himself. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#007">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">sa2 15:7</A></FONT></span></p>And it came to pass after (e) forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the LORD, in Hebron. 
<p>
<p>(e) Counting from the time that the Israelites had asked a king of Samuel. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#008">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">sa2 15:8</A></FONT></span></p>For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will (f) serve the LORD. 
<p>
<p>(f) By offering a peace-offering, which was lawful to do in any place. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#011">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">sa2 15:11</A></FONT></span></p>And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, [that were] (g) called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing. 
<p>
<p>(g) And bid to his feast in Hebron. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#014">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">sa2 15:14</A></FONT></span></p>And David said unto all his servants that [were] with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not [else] escape from (h) Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword. 
<p>
<p>(h) Whose heart he saw that Satan had so possessed that he would leave no mischief unattempted. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#017">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">sa2 15:17</A></FONT></span></p>And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was (i) far off. 
<p>
<p>(i) That is, from Jerusalem. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#018">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">sa2 15:18</A></FONT></span></p>And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the (k) Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king. 
<p>
<p>(k) These were as the king's guard, or as some write, his counsellors. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#019">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">sa2 15:19</A></FONT></span></p>Then said the king to (l) Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king: for thou [art] a stranger, and also an exile. 
<p>
<p>(l) Who as some write was the king's son of Gath. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#020">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">sa2 15:20</A></FONT></span></p>Whereas thou camest [but] yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return thou, and take back thy (m) brethren: mercy and (n) truth [be] with thee. 
<p>
<p>(m) Meaning, those of his family. 
<p>
<p>(n) God require of you your friendship and fidelity. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#023">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">sa2 15:23</A></FONT></span></p>And all the country wept with a loud voice, and (o) all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness. 
<p>
<p>(o) That is, the four hundred men. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#024">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">sa2 15:24</A></FONT></span></p>And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites [were] with him, (p) bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went (q) up, until all the people had done passing out of the city. 
<p>
<p>(p) Which was the charge, of the Kohathites, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#004">Num 4:4</A>). 
<p>
<p>(q) To stand by the ark. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#026">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:26</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_026">sa2 15:26</A></FONT></span></p>But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, (r) [here am] I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him. 
<p>
<p>(r) The faithful in all their afflictions show themselves obedient to God's will. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#030">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:30</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_030">sa2 15:30</A></FONT></span></p>And David went up by the ascent of [mount] Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head (s) covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people that [was] with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up. 
<p>
<p>(s) With ashes and dust in sign of sorrow. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#031">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:31</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_031">sa2 15:31</A></FONT></span></p>And [one] told David, saying, Ahithophel [is] among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O LORD, I pray thee, turn the (t) counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness. 
<p>
<p>(t) The counsel of the crafty worldlings does more harm than the open force of the enemy. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#034">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:34</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_034">sa2 15:34</A></FONT></span></p>But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy (u) servant, O king; [as] I [have been] thy father's servant hitherto, so [will] I now also [be] thy servant: then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel. 
<p>
<p>(u) Though Hushai was deceitful here at the king's request, we may not use this example to excuse our deceit.
