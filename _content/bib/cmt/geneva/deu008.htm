<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#001">Deuteronomy 8:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">deu 8:1</A></FONT></span></p>All the commandments which I command thee this day shall ye observe (a) to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers. 
<p>
<p>(a) Showing that it is not enough to hear the word, unless we express it by the example of our lives.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#002">Deuteronomy 8:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">deu 8:2</A></FONT></span></p>And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, [and] to (b) prove thee, to know what [was] in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments, or no. 
<p>
<p>(b) Which is declared in afflictions, either by patience, or by grudging against God's visitation.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#003">Deuteronomy 8:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">deu 8:3</A></FONT></span></p>And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by (c) bread only, but by every [word] that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live. 
<p>
<p>(c) Man does not live by meat only, but by the power of God, who gives it strength to nourish us.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#004">Deuteronomy 8:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">deu 8:4</A></FONT></span></p>Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot (d) swell, these forty years. 
<p>
<p>(d) As those that go barefoot.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#005">Deuteronomy 8:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">deu 8:5</A></FONT></span></p>Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that, as a man chasteneth his son, [so] the LORD thy God (e) chasteneth thee. 
<p>
<p>(e) So that his affliction are signs of his fatherly love toward us.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#009">Deuteronomy 8:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">deu 8:9</A></FONT></span></p>A land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack any [thing] in it; a land (f) whose stones [are] iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass. 
<p>
<p>(f) Where there are mines of metal.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#010">Deuteronomy 8:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">deu 8:10</A></FONT></span></p>When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt (g) bless the LORD thy God for the good land which he hath given thee. 
<p>
<p>(g) To receive God's benefits and not be thankful, is to despise God in them.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#014">Deuteronomy 8:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">deu 8:14</A></FONT></span></p>Then thine heart (h) be lifted up, and thou forget the LORD thy God, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage; 
<p>
<p>(h) By attributing God's benefits to your own wisdom and labour, or to good fortune.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#018">Deuteronomy 8:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">deu 8:18</A></FONT></span></p>But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God: for [it is] he that (i) giveth thee power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant which he sware unto thy fathers, as [it is] this day. 
<p>
<p>(i) If things concerning this life proceed only from God's mercy, how much more do spiritual gifts and everlasting life.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#019">Deuteronomy 8:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">deu 8:19</A></FONT></span></p>And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD thy God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I (k) testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish. 
<p>
<p>(k) Or take to witness the heaven and the earth, as in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#026">Deu 4:26</A>).
