<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">deu 11:2</A></FONT></span></p>And (a) know ye this day: for [I speak] not with your children which have not known, and which have not seen the chastisement of the LORD your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his stretched out arm, 
<p>
<p>(a) You who have seen God's graces with your eyes should be moved, rather than your children who have only heard of them.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">deu 11:5</A></FONT></span></p>And (b) what he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came into this place; 
<p>
<p>(b) As well concerning his benefits, as his corrections.

<p>
<p>(c) Because you have felt both his chastisement and his benefits.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">deu 11:10</A></FONT></span></p>For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, [is] not as the land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed, and wateredst [it] with thy (d) foot, as a garden of herbs: 
<p>
<p>(d) By making gutters for the water to come out of the Nile river to water the land.

<p>
<p>(e) In the seed time, and toward harvest.

<p>(f) By devising foolish devotions according to your own fantasies.

<p>
<p>(g) As long as the heavens and earth endure, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#010">Pe2 3:10</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#012">Pe2 3:12</A>).

<p>
<p>(h) This was accomplished in David and Solomon's time. 
<p>
<p>(i) The Mediterranean.

<p>(k) He reproves the malice of men who leave that which is certain to follow that which is uncertain.
