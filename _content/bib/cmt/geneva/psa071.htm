<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#001">Psalms 71:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">psa 71:1</A></FONT></span></p>In (a) thee, O LORD, do I put my trust: let me never be put to confusion. 
<p>
<p>(a) He prays to God with full assurance of faith, that he will deliver him from his adversaries.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#002">Psalms 71:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">psa 71:2</A></FONT></span></p>Deliver me in thy (b) righteousness, and cause me to escape: incline thine ear unto me, and save me. 
<p>
<p>(b) By declaring yourself true to your promises.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#003">Psalms 71:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">psa 71:3</A></FONT></span></p>Be thou my strong habitation, whereunto I may continually resort: thou (c) hast given commandment to save me; for thou [art] my rock and my fortress. 
<p>
<p>(c) You have infinite means and all creatures are at your commandment; therefore show some sign by which I will be delivered.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#004">Psalms 71:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">psa 71:4</A></FONT></span></p>Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand (d) of the wicked, out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man. 
<p>
<p>(d) That is, from Absalom, Ahithophel and that conspiracy.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#005">Psalms 71:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">psa 71:5</A></FONT></span></p>For thou [art] my hope, O Lord GOD: [thou art] my (e) trust from my youth. 
<p>
<p>(e) He strengthens his faith by the experience of God's benefits, who not only preserved him in his mother's womb, but took him from there, and ever since has preserved him.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#007">Psalms 71:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">psa 71:7</A></FONT></span></p>I am as a (f) wonder unto many; but thou [art] my strong refuge. 
<p>
<p>(f) All the world wonders at me because of my miseries: both those in authority and the common people, yet being assured of your favour, I remain steadfast.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#009">Psalms 71:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">psa 71:9</A></FONT></span></p>Cast me not off in the time of (g) old age; forsake me not when my strength faileth. 
<p>
<p>(g) You who helped me in my youth when I had more strength, help me now even more in my old age and weakness.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#011">Psalms 71:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">psa 71:11</A></FONT></span></p>Saying, (h) God hath forsaken him: persecute and take him; for [there is] none to deliver [him]. 
<p>
<p>(h) Thus the wicked both blaspheme God and triumph against his saints, as though he had forsaken them if he permits them to fall into their hands.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#012">Psalms 71:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">psa 71:12</A></FONT></span></p>O God, be not far from me: O (i) my God, make haste for my help. 
<p>
<p>(i) In calling him his God, he puts back the false reports of the adversaries who said God had forsaken him.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#015">Psalms 71:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">psa 71:15</A></FONT></span></p>My mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness [and] thy salvation all the day; (k) for I know not the numbers [thereof]. 
<p>
<p>(k) Because your benefits toward me are innumerable, I cannot but continually meditate and rehearse them.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#016">Psalms 71:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">psa 71:16</A></FONT></span></p>I will (l) go in the strength of the Lord GOD: I will make mention of thy righteousness, [even] of thine only. 
<p>
<p>(l) I will remain steadfast, being upheld by the power of God.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#018">Psalms 71:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">psa 71:18</A></FONT></span></p>(m) Now also when I am old and grayheaded, O God, forsake me not; until I have shewed thy strength unto [this] generation, [and] thy power to every one [that] is to come. 
<p>
<p>(m) He desires that as he has begun, he would so continue his benefits, that his liberality may have perfect praise.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#019">Psalms 71:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">psa 71:19</A></FONT></span></p>Thy (n) righteousness also, O God, [is] very high, who hast done great things: O God, who [is] like unto thee! 
<p>
<p>(n) Your just performance of your promise.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#020">Psalms 71:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">psa 71:20</A></FONT></span></p>[Thou], which hast shewed me great and (p) sore troubles, shalt quicken me again, and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the earth. 
<p>
<p>(p) As he confesses that God is the only author of his deliverance, so he acknowledges that these evils were sent to him by God's providence.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#022">Psalms 71:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">psa 71:22</A></FONT></span></p>I will also praise thee with the psaltery, [even] thy (q) truth, O my God: unto thee will I sing with the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel. 
<p>
<p>(q) He confesses that his long delay was well recompensed, when God performed his promise.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#023">Psalms 71:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">psa 71:23</A></FONT></span></p>My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee; and my (r) soul, which thou hast redeemed. 
<p>
<p>(r) For there is no true praising of God, unless it comes from the heart: and therefore he promises to delight in nothing, except that in which God is glorified.
