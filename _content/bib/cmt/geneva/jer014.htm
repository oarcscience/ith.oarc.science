<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#001">Jeremiah 14:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">jer 14:1</A></FONT></span></p>The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah concerning the (a) dearth. 
<p>
<p>(a) Which came for lack of rain as in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#004">Jer 14:4</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#002">Jeremiah 14:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">jer 14:2</A></FONT></span></p>Judah mourneth, and her gates languish; they are (b) black to the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up. 
<p>
<p>(b) The word signifies extreme sorrow.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#003">Jeremiah 14:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">jer 14:3</A></FONT></span></p>And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters: they came to the pits, [and] found no water; they returned with their vessels empty; they were ashamed and confounded, and (c) covered their heads. 
<p>
<p>(c) That is, with ashes in token of sorrow.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#005">Jeremiah 14:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">jer 14:5</A></FONT></span></p>Yea, the hind also calved in the field, and forsook (d) [it], because there was no grass. 
<p>
<p>(d) Meaning, that the brute beasts for drought were compelled to forsake their young, contrary to nature, and to go seek water which they could not find.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#006">Jeremiah 14:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">jer 14:6</A></FONT></span></p>And the wild donkeys stood in the high places, they snuffed up the wind like (e) dragons; their eyes failed, because [there was] no grass. 
<p>
<p>(e) Who are so hot by nature, that they cannot be cooled by drinking water, but still gasp for the air to refresh them.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#007">Jeremiah 14:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">jer 14:7</A></FONT></span></p>(f) O LORD, though our iniquities testify against us, do thou [it] for thy name's sake: for our backslidings are many; we have sinned against thee. 
<p>
<p>(f) He shows the only way to remedy God's plagues, which is by true confession of our sins, and returning to him by repentance.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#008">Jeremiah 14:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">jer 14:8</A></FONT></span></p>O the hope of Israel, his saviour in time of trouble, why shouldest thou be as a (g) stranger in the land, and as a wayfaring man [that] turneth aside to tarry for a night? 
<p>
<p>(g) That takes no care for us.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#009">Jeremiah 14:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">jer 14:9</A></FONT></span></p>Why shouldest thou be as a man astonished, as (h) a mighty man [that] cannot save? yet thou, O LORD, [art] in the midst of us, and we are called by thy name; leave us not. 
<p>
<p>(h) That takes no care for us.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#011">Jeremiah 14:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">jer 14:11</A></FONT></span></p>Then said the LORD to me, (i) Pray not for this people for [their] good. 
<p>
<p>(i) Read (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#016">Jer 7:16</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#014">Jer 11:14</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#013">Jeremiah 14:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">jer 14:13</A></FONT></span></p>Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, the (k) prophets say to them, Ye shall not see the sword, neither shall ye have famine; but I will give you assured peace in this place. 
<p>
<p>(k) He pities the people, and accuses the false prophets who deceived them: but the Lord answered that both the prophets who deceived and the people who permitted themselves to be seduced, will perish, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#015">Jer 23:15</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#008">Jer 27:8-9</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#008">Jer 29:8</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#017">Jeremiah 14:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">jer 14:17</A></FONT></span></p>Therefore thou shalt say this word to them; Let my eyes run down with (l) tears night and day, and let them not cease: for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous blow. 
<p>
<p>(l) The false prophets promised peace and assurance, but Jeremiah calls to tears, and repentance for their affliction, which is at hand, as in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#001">Jer 9:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#016">Lam 1:16</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#018">Lam 2:18</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#018">Jeremiah 14:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">jer 14:18</A></FONT></span></p>If I go forth into the field, then behold the slain with the sword! and if I enter into the city, then behold them that are sick with famine! yea, both the prophet and the priest go about (m) into a land that they know not. 
<p>
<p>(m) Both high and low will be led captive into Babylon.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#019">Jeremiah 14:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">jer 14:19</A></FONT></span></p>Hast thou utterly rejected (n) Judah? hath thy soul abhorred Zion? why hast thou smitten us, and [there is] no healing for us? we looked for peace, and [there is] no good; and for the time of healing, and behold trouble! 
<p>
<p>(n) Though the prophet knew that God had cast off the multitude, who were hypocrites and bastard children, yet he was assured that for his promise sake he would still have a Church, for which he prays.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#020">Jeremiah 14:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">jer 14:20</A></FONT></span></p>We (o) acknowledge, O LORD, our wickedness, [and] the iniquity of our fathers: for we have sinned against thee. 
<p>
<p>(o) He teaches the Church a form of prayer to humble themselves to God by true repentance, which is the only way to avoid this famine, which was the beginning of God's plagues.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#022">Jeremiah 14:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">jer 14:22</A></FONT></span></p>Are there [any] among the (p) vanities of the Gentiles that can cause rain? or can the heavens give showers? [art] not thou he, O LORD our God? therefore we will wait upon thee: for thou hast made all these [things]. 
<p>
<p>(p) Meaning their idols, read (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#015">Jer 10:15</A>).
