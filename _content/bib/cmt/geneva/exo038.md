<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">exo 38:4</span></span>

And he made for the altar a brasen grate of network under the compass
thereof beneath unto the (a) midst of it.

\(a\) So that the gridiron or grate was half as high as the altar and
stood within it.

[Exodus 38:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">exo 38:8</span></span>

And he made the laver \[of\] brass, and the foot of it \[of\] brass, of
the (b) lookingglasses of \[the women\] assembling, which assembled
\[at\] the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

\(b\) R. Kimbi says that the women brought their looking glasses, which
were of brass or fine metal, and offered them freely for the use of the
tabernacle: which was a bright thing and of great majesty.

[Exodus 38:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">exo 38:21</span></span>

This is the sum of the tabernacle, \[even\] of the tabernacle of
testimony, as it was counted, according to the commandment of Moses,
\[for\] the service of the (c) Levites, by the hand of Ithamar, son to
Aaron the priest.

\(c\) That the Levites might be in charge of it, and minister in the
same, as did Eleazar and Ithamar, ([Num
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#004)).

[Exodus 38:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#023)

And with him \[was\] Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an
engraver, and a (d) cunning workman, and an embroiderer in blue, and in
purple, and in scarlet, and fine linen.

\(d\) Or, a graver, or carpenter, ([Exo
36:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#004)).

[Exodus 38:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">exo 38:29</span></span>

And the brass of the offering \[was\] seventy (e) talents, and two
thousand and four hundred shekels.

\(e\) Read the weight of a talent, ([Exo
25:39](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#039)).
