<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">deu 20:1</A></FONT></span></p>When (a) thou goest out to battle against thine enemies, and seest horses, and chariots, [and] a people more than thou, be not afraid of them: for the LORD thy God [is] with thee, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. 
<p>
<p>(a) Meaning, upon just occasion: for God does not permit his people to fight every time it seems good to them.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#004">Deuteronomy 20:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">deu 20:4</A></FONT></span></p>For the LORD your God [is] he that (b) goeth with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you. 
<p>
<p>(b) Is present to defend you with his grace and power.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#005">Deuteronomy 20:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">deu 20:5</A></FONT></span></p>And the officers shall speak unto the people, saying, What man [is there] that hath built a new house, and hath not (c) dedicated it? let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it. 
<p>
<p>(c) For when they first entered to dwell in a house, they gave thanks to God, acknowledging that they had that benefit by his grace.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#006">Deuteronomy 20:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">deu 20:6</A></FONT></span></p>And what man [is he] that hath planted a vineyard, and hath not [yet] (d) eaten of it? let him [also] go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man eat of it. 
<p>
<p>(d) The Hebrew word signifies to make common or profane, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#025">Lev 19:25</A>)  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#011">Deuteronomy 20:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">deu 20:11</A></FONT></span></p>And it shall be, if it make thee answer of (e) peace, and open unto thee, then it shall be, [that] all the people [that is] found therein shall be tributaries unto thee, and they shall serve thee. 
<p>
<p>(e) If it accept peace.

<p>
<p>(f) For God had appointed the Canaanites to be destroyed, and made the Israelites the executers of his will, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#001">Deu 7:1</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#019">Deuteronomy 20:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">deu 20:19</A></FONT></span></p>When thou shalt besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to take it, thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by forcing an axe against them: for thou mayest eat of them, and thou shalt not cut them down (for the (g) tree of the field [is] man's [life]) to employ [them] in the siege: 
<p>
<p>(g) Some read: For man shall be instead of the tree of the field, to come out in the siege against you.
