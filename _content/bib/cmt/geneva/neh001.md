<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">neh 1:1</span></span>

The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it came to pass in the
month (a) Chisleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the
palace,

The Argument - God, in all ages and at all times, sets up worthy persons
for the convenience and profit of his Church, as now within the compass
of seventy years he raised up various excellent men for the preservation
of his people after their return from Babylon. Zerubbabel, Ezra, and
Nehemiah, of which the first was their captain to bring them home, and
provided that the temple was built: the second reformed their manners
and planted religion: and the third built up the walls, delivered the
people from oppression and provided that the law of God was carried out
among them. He was a godly man, and in great authority with the king, so
that the king favoured him greatly and gave him letters to accomplish
all the things he desired. This book is also called the second of Ezra
by the Latins because he was the author of it.

And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there
in the (c) province \[are\] in great affliction and reproach: the wall
of Jerusalem also \[is\] broken down, and the gates thereof are burned
with fire.

\(c\) Meaning in Judea.

[Nehemiah 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">neh 1:11</span></span>

O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of
thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who desire to (d) fear
thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him
mercy in the sight of (e) this man. For I was the king's cupbearer.
