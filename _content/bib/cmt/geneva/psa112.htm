<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">psa 112:1</A></FONT></span></p>Praise ye the LORD. Blessed [is] the man [that] (a) feareth the LORD, [that] delighteth greatly in his commandments. 
<p>
<p>(a) He means that reverent fear which is in the children of God, which causes them to delight only in the word of God.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#003">Psalms 112:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">psa 112:3</A></FONT></span></p>(b) Wealth and riches [shall be] in his house: and his righteousness endureth for ever. 
<p>
<p>(b) The godly will have abundance and contentment, because their heart is satisfied in God alone.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#004">Psalms 112:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">psa 112:4</A></FONT></span></p>Unto the (c) upright there ariseth light in the darkness: [he is] gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous. 
<p>
<p>(c) The faithful in all their adversities know that all will go well with them for God will be merciful and just.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#005">Psalms 112:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">psa 112:5</A></FONT></span></p>A good man sheweth favour, and (d) lendeth: he will guide his affairs with discretion. 
<p>
<p>(d) He shows what the fruit of mercy is, to lend freely and not for gain, and so to measure his doings that he may be able to help where need requires and not to bestow all on himself.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#009">Psalms 112:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">psa 112:9</A></FONT></span></p>He hath (e) dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his righteousness endureth for ever; his (f) horn shall be exalted with honour. 
<p>
<p>(e) The godly are not stingy, but distribute liberally, as the need of the poor requires and as his power is able. 
<p>
<p>(f) His power and prosperous estate.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#010">Psalms 112:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">psa 112:10</A></FONT></span></p>The wicked shall see [it], and be grieved; he shall gnash with his teeth, and (g) melt away: the desire of the wicked shall perish. 
<p>
<p>(g) The blessings of God on his children will cause the wicked to die for envy.
