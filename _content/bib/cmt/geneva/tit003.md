### [Titus Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#001)

[Titus 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">tit 3:1</span></span>

Put (1) them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey
magistrates, to be ready to every good work,

\(1\) He declares particularly and separately that which he said before
generally, noting out certain main and principal duties which men owe to
men, and especially subjects to their magistrates.

[Titus 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">tit 3:3</span></span>

\(2\) For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient,
deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy,
hateful, \[and\] hating one another.

\(2\) He confirms again the former exhortation by propounding the free
benefit of our regeneration, the symbol of which is our baptism. (Ed.)

[Titus 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">tit 3:5</span></span>

Not by works of (a) righteousness which we have done, but according to
his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of
the (b) Holy Ghost;

\(a\) Literally, "of works which are done in righteousness": and this
passage fully refutes the doctrine of meritorious works.

\(b\) Which the power of the Holy Spirit works.

[Titus 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">tit 3:8</span></span>

\(3\) \[This is\] a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou
affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful
to maintain (c) good works. These things are good and profitable unto
men.

\(3\) Again with great earnestness emphasises how we ought to give
ourselves to true godliness and avoid all vain questions, which serve to
nothing but to cause strife and debate.

\(c\) Give themselves earnestly to good works.

[Titus 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">tit 3:10</span></span>

\(4\) A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition
reject;

\(4\) The ministers of the word must at once cast off heretics, that is,
those who stubbornly and seditiously disquiet the Church, and will pay
no attention to ecclesiastical admonitions.

[Titus 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">tit 3:12</span></span>

\(5\) When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to
come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter.

\(5\) Last of all, he writes a word or two regarding personal matters,
and commends certain men.
