### [2 Chronicles Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 4:2</span></span>

Also he made a molten (a) sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in
compass, and five cubits the height thereof; and a line of thirty cubits
did compass it round about.

\(a\) A great vessel of brass, so called because of the great quantity
of water which it contained, ([Kg1
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#024)).

[2 Chronicles 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 4:3</span></span>

And under (b) it \[was\] the similitude of oxen, which did compass it
round about: (c) ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about. Two
rows of oxen \[were\] cast, when it was cast.

\(b\) Meaning, under the brim of the sea, ([Kg1
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#024)).

\(c\) In the length of every cubit were ten heads or knops which in all
are 300.

[2 Chronicles 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 4:5</span></span>

And the thickness of it \[was\] an handbreadth, and the brim of it like
the work of the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies; \[and\] it
received and held (d) three thousand baths.

\(d\) In the first book of the kings, ([Kg1
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#026)), mention is only made of 2000,
but the lesser number was taken there, and here according as the
measures proved afterwards, is declared.

[2 Chronicles 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 4:7</span></span>

And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to (e) their form, and
set \[them\] in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the
left.

\(e\) Even as they should be made.

[2 Chronicles 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch2 4:9</span></span>

Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great (f) court,
and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with brass.

\(f\) Called also the porch of Solomon, ([Act
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#011)). It is also taken for the temple
where Christ preached, ([Mat 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#023)).

[2 Chronicles 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch2 4:16</span></span>

The pots also, and the shovels, and the fleshhooks, and all their
instruments, did Huram (g) his father make to king Solomon for the house
of the LORD of bright brass.

\(g\) Whom Solomon reverenced for the gifts that God had given him, as a
father; he had the same name as Huram the king of Tyrus, his mother was
a Jewess, and his father a Tyrian. Some read, for his father, the author
of this work.

[2 Chronicles 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch2 4:19</span></span>

And Solomon made all the vessels that \[were for\] the house of God, the
golden altar also, and the tables whereon the (h) shewbread \[was set\];

\(h\) In Hebrew, the bread of the faces because they were set before the
ark, where the Lord showed his presence.

[2 Chronicles 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch2 4:22</span></span>

And the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers,
\[of\] pure gold: and the entry of the house, the inner doors thereof
for the most holy \[place\], and the doors of the house of the temple,
\[were (i) of\] gold.

\(i\) That is, covered with plates of gold.
