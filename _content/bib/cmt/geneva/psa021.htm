<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#001">Psalms 21:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">psa 21:1</A></FONT></span></p>"To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David." The king shall (a) joy in thy strength, O LORD; and in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice! 
<p>
<p>(a) When he will overcome his enemies, and so be assured of his calling.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#003">Psalms 21:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">psa 21:3</A></FONT></span></p>For thou (b) preventest him with the blessings of goodness: thou settest a crown of pure gold on his head. 
<p>
<p>(b) You declared your liberal favour toward him before he prayed.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#004">Psalms 21:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">psa 21:4</A></FONT></span></p>(c) He asked life of thee, [and] thou gavest [it] him, [even] length of days for ever and ever. 
<p>
<p>(c) David not only obtained life, but also assurance that his posterity would reign forever.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#006">Psalms 21:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">psa 21:6</A></FONT></span></p>For thou hast made him most (d) blessed for ever: thou hast made him exceeding glad with thy countenance. 
<p>
<p>(d) You have made him your blessings to others, and a perpetual example of your favour forever.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#008">Psalms 21:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">psa 21:8</A></FONT></span></p>(e) Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies: thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee. 
<p>
<p>(e) Here he describes the power of Christ's kingdom against the enemies of it.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#009">Psalms 21:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">psa 21:9</A></FONT></span></p>Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger: the LORD shall swallow them up in his (f) wrath, and the fire shall devour them. 
<p>
<p>(f) This teaches us patiently to endure the cross till God destroys the adversary.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#011">Psalms 21:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">psa 21:11</A></FONT></span></p>For they (g) intended evil against thee: they imagined a mischievous device, [which] they are not able [to perform]. 
<p>
<p>(g) They laid as it were their nets to make God's power bend to their wicked enterprises.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#012">Psalms 21:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">psa 21:12</A></FONT></span></p>Therefore shalt thou make them (h) turn their back, [when] thou shalt make ready [thine arrows] upon thy strings against the face of them. 
<p>
<p>(h) As a mark to shoot at.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#013">Psalms 21:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">psa 21:13</A></FONT></span></p>(i) Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength: [so] will we sing and praise thy power. 
<p>
<p>(i) Maintain your Church against your adversaries that we may have ample opportunity to praise your Name.
