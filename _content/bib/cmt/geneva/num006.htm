<p>
<p>(a) Who separated themselves from the world, and dedicated themselves to God: a figure which was accomplished in Christ.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#006">Numbers 6:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">num 6:6</A></FONT></span></p>All the days that he separateth [himself] unto the LORD he shall come at no (b) dead body. 
<p>
<p>(b) As at burials, or mournings.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">num 6:7</A></FONT></span></p>He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die: because the consecration of his God [is] upon (c) his head. 
<p>
<p>(c) In that he allowed his hair to grow, he signified that he was consecrated to God.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#009">Numbers 6:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">num 6:9</A></FONT></span></p>And if any man die very suddenly by him, and he hath defiled the (d) head of his consecration; then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave it. 
<p>
<p>(d) Whose long hair is a sign that he is dedicated to God.

<p>
<p>(e) By being present where the deceased was.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">num 6:12</A></FONT></span></p>And he shall (f) consecrate unto the LORD the days of his separation, and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a trespass offering: but the (g) days that were before shall be lost, because his separation was defiled. 
<p>
<p>(f) Beginning at the eighth day, when he is purified. 
<p>
<p>(g) So that he shall begin his vow anew.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#018">Numbers 6:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">num 6:18</A></FONT></span></p>And the Nazarite shall shave the head (h) of his separation [at] the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall take the hair of the head of his separation, and (i) put [it] in the fire which [is] under the sacrifice of the peace offerings. 
<p>
<p>(h) In token that his vow is ended. 
<p>
<p>(i) For the hair which was consecrated to the Lord, might not be cast into any profane place.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#021">Numbers 6:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">num 6:21</A></FONT></span></p>This [is] the law of the Nazarite who hath vowed, [and of] his offering unto the LORD for his separation, (k) beside [that] that his hand shall get: according to the vow which he vowed, so he must do after the law of his separation. 
<p>
<p>(k) At the least he shall do this, if he is not able to offer more.

<p>(l) That is, pray for them.

<p>(m) They shall pray in my Name for them.
