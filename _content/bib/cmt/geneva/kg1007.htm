<p>
<p>(b) Because of the beauty of the place, and great abundance of cedar trees that went into the building of it, it was compared to mount Lebanon.

<p>
<p>(c) There were as many and like proportion on the one side as the other, and at every end even three in a row one above another.

<p>
<p>(e) For his house which was at Jerusalem.

<p>
<p>(h) As the Lord's house was built so was this, only the great court of Solomon's house was uncovered.

And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work. 
<p>
<p>(i) Thus when God will have his glory set forth, he raises up men, and gives them excellent gifts for the accomplishment of the same, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#002">Exo 31:2-3</A>).

<p>
<p>(q) The mouth of the great base or frame entered into the chapiter, or pillar that bore up the cauldron.
