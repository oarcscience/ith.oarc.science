<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#001">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">sa2 11:1</A></FONT></span></p>And it came to pass, after the year was (a) expired, at the time when kings go forth [to battle], that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried still at Jerusalem. 
<p>
<p>(a) The year following about the spring time. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#002">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">sa2 11:2</A></FONT></span></p>And it came to pass in an eveningtide, that David arose from off his (b) bed, and walked upon the roof of the king's house: and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman [was] very beautiful to look upon. 
<p>
<p>(b) Upon which he used to rest in the afternoon, as was read of Ishbosheth in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#007">Sa2 4:7</A>). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#003">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">sa2 11:3</A></FONT></span></p>And David sent and enquired after the woman. And [one] said, [Is] not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the (c) Hittite? 
<p>
<p>(c) Who was not an born an Israelite, but converted to the true religion. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#005">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">sa2 11:5</A></FONT></span></p>And the woman conceived, and sent and (d) told David, and said, I [am] with child. 
<p>
<p>(d) Fearing lest she be stoned according to the law. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#008">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">sa2 11:8</A></FONT></span></p>And David said to Uriah, (e) Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet. And Uriah departed out of the king's house, and there followed him a mess [of meat] from the king. 
<p>
<p>(e) David thought that if Uriah lay with his wife, his sin might be covered. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#011">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">sa2 11:11</A></FONT></span></p>And Uriah said unto David, (f) The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open fields; shall I then go into mine house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? [as] thou livest, and [as] thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing. 
<p>
<p>(f) By this God would touch David's conscience, for seeing the fidelity and religion of his servant, he would declare himself forgetful of God, and injurious to his servant. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#013">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">sa2 11:13</A></FONT></span></p>And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before him; and he made him (g) drunk: and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to his house. 
<p>
<p>(g) He made him drink more liberally than he was wont to do, thinking by this he would have slept with his wife. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#015">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">sa2 11:15</A></FONT></span></p>And he wrote in the letter, saying, (h) Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten, and die. 
<p>
<p>(h) Except God continually uphold us with his mighty Spirit, the most perfect fall headlong into all vice and abomination. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#021">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">sa2 11:21</A></FONT></span></p>Who smote Abimelech the son of (i) Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, that he died in Thebez? why went ye nigh the wall? then say thou, Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also. 
<p>
<p>(i) Meaning Gideon, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#052">Jdg 9:52-53</A>). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#025">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:25</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_025">sa2 11:25</A></FONT></span></p>Then David said unto the messenger, (k) Thus shalt thou say unto Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth one as well as another: make thy battle more strong against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage thou him. 
<p>
<p>(k) He conceals the truth from the messenger, so that neither his cruel commandment, nor Joab's wicked obedience would be discovered.
