<p>
<p>(a) Which comes by well doing.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#002">Proverbs 22:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">pro 22:2</A></FONT></span></p>The rich and poor (b) meet together: the LORD [is] the maker of them all.

<p>(c) That is, the punishment, which is prepared for the wicked and flees to God for help.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#006">Proverbs 22:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">pro 22:6</A></FONT></span></p>Train up a child (d) in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.

<p>(d) Bring him up virtuously and he will continue so.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#008">Proverbs 22:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">pro 22:8</A></FONT></span></p>He that soweth iniquity shall reap vanity: and the (e) rod of his anger shall fail.

<p>(i) He derides them that invent vain excuses, because they would not do their duty.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#014">Proverbs 22:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">pro 22:14</A></FONT></span></p>The mouth of strange women [is] a deep pit: he that is abhorred by the LORD (k) shall fall in it. 
<p>
<p>(k) So God punishes one sin by another, when he suffers the wicked to fall into the acquaintance of a harlot.
