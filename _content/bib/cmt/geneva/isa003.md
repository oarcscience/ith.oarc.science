### [Isaiah Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#001)

[Isaiah 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 3:1</span></span>

For, behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem
and from Judah the rod (a) and the staff, the whole support of bread,
and the whole support of water,

\(a\) Because they trusted in their abundance and prosperity he shows
that they should be taken from them.

[Isaiah 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 3:2</span></span>

The mighty man, and the man of war, (b) the judge, and the prophet, and
the prudent, and the ancient,

\(b\) The temporal governor and the minister.

[Isaiah 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 3:3</span></span>

The captain of fifty, and the honourable man, and the counsellor, and
the skilful craftsman, and the (c) eloquent orator.

\(c\) By these he means that God would take away everything that was of
any value, and which they had any opportunity to want in themselves.

[Isaiah 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 3:4</span></span>

And I will give (d) children \[to be\] their princes, and babes shall
rule over them.

\(d\) Not only in age: but in manners, knowledge and strength.

[Isaiah 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 3:5</span></span>

And the people shall be (e) oppressed, every one by another, and every
one by his neighbour: the child shall behave himself proudly against the
elder, and the base against the honourable.

\(e\) For lack of good regiment and order.

[Isaiah 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 3:6</span></span>

When a man shall (f) take hold of his brother of the house of his
father, \[saying\], Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and \[let\]
this ruin \[be\] under thy hand:

\(f\) He shows that this plague will be so horrible that contrary to the
common manner of men, who by nature are ambitious, no one will be found
able or willing to be their governor.

[Isaiah 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 3:7</span></span>

In that day shall he (g) swear, saying, I will not be an healer; for in
my house \[is\] neither bread nor clothing: make me not a ruler of the
people.

\(g\) Fear will cause him to forswear himself, rather than to take such
a dangerous charge upon himself.

[Isaiah 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 3:9</span></span>

The (h) show of their countenance doth witness against them; and they
declare their sin as Sodom, they hide \[it\] not. Woe to their soul! for
they have rewarded evil to themselves.

\(h\) When God examines their deed on which they now set an impudent
face, he will find the mark of their impiety in their forehead.

[Isaiah 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 3:10</span></span>

\(i\) Say ye to the righteous, that \[it shall be\] well \[with him\]:
for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.

\(i\) You that are godly be assured that God will defend you in the
midst of these troubles.

[Isaiah 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 3:12</span></span>

\[As for\] my people, (k) children \[are\] their oppressors, and women
rule over them. O my people, they who lead thee cause \[thee\] to err,
and destroy the way of thy paths.

\(k\) Because the wicked people were more addicted to their princes than
to the commandments of God, he shows that he would give them such
princes, by whom they would have no help, but that they would be
manifest tokens of his wrath, because they would be fools and
effeminate.

[Isaiah 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 3:14</span></span>

The LORD will enter into judgment with the (l) elders of his people, and
with their princes: for ye have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the
poor \[is\] in your houses.

\(l\) Meaning that the rulers and governors had destroyed his Church and
not preserved it, according to their duty.

[Isaiah 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 3:15</span></span>

What mean ye \[that\] ye beat my people to pieces, (m) and grind the
faces of the poor? saith the Lord GOD of hosts.

\(m\) That is, you show all cruelty against them.

[Isaiah 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 3:16</span></span>

Moreover the LORD saith, (n) Because the daughters of Zion are haughty,
and walk with (o) extended necks and (p) wanton eyes, walking and (q)
mincing \[as\] they go, and making a (r) tinkling with their feet:

\(n\) He means the people because of the arrogancy and pride of their
women who gave themselves to all wantonness and dissolution.

\(o\) Which declared their pride.

\(p\) As a sign that they were not chaste.

\(q\) Which showed their wantonness.

\(r\) They delighted then in slippers that creaked or had little plates
sewn on them which tinkled as they went.

[Isaiah 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">isa 3:23</span></span>

The mirrors, and the fine linen, and the turbans, and the (s) veils.

\(s\) In rehearsing all these things particularly he shows the lightness
and vanity of such as cannot be content with comely apparel according to
their degree.

[Isaiah 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">isa 3:25</span></span>

Thy men shall fall by the (t) sword, and thy mighty in the war.

\(t\) Meaning that God will not only punish the women but their husbands
who have permitted this dissoluteness and also the commonwealth which
has not remedied it.
