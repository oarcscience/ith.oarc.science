### [Psalms Chapter 61](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#001)

[Psalms 61:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 61:2</span></span>

From (a) the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is
overwhelmed: lead me to the rock \[that\] is (b) higher than I.

\(a\) From the place where I was banished, being driven out of the city
and temple by my son Absalom.

\(b\) To which without your help I cannot attain.

[Psalms 61:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 61:5</span></span>

For thou, O God, (c) hast heard my vows: thou hast given \[me\] the
heritage of those that fear thy name.

\(c\) There is nothing that strengthens our faith more than the memory
of God's help in times past.

[Psalms 61:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 61:6</span></span>

Thou wilt prolong the king's (d) life: \[and\] his years as many
generations.

\(d\) This chiefly refers to Christ, who lives eternally not only in
himself but also in his members.

[Psalms 61:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 61:7</span></span>

He shall abide before God for ever: O prepare (e) mercy and truth,
\[which\] may preserve him.

\(e\) For the stability of my kingdom stands in your mercy and truth.
