<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#001">Psalms 83:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">psa 83:1</A></FONT></span></p>"A Song [or] Psalm of Asaph." Keep (a) not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God. 
<p>
<p>(a) This psalm seems to have been composed as a form of prayer against the dangers that the Church was in, in the days of Jehoshaphat.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#002">Psalms 83:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">psa 83:2</A></FONT></span></p>For, lo, thine (b) enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head. 
<p>
<p>(b) He calls them God's enemies, who are enemies of his Church.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#003">Psalms 83:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">psa 83:3</A></FONT></span></p>They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy (c) hidden ones. 
<p>
<p>(c) The elect of God are his secret ones: for he hides them in the secret of his tabernacle, and preserves them from all dangers.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#004">Psalms 83:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">psa 83:4</A></FONT></span></p>They have said, Come, and let us (d) cut them off from [being] a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance. 
<p>
<p>(d) They were not content to take the Church as prisoner: but sought to utterly destroy it.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#005">Psalms 83:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">psa 83:5</A></FONT></span></p>For they have consulted together (e) with one consent: they are confederate (f) against thee: 
<p>
<p>(e) By all secret means. 
<p>
<p>(f) They thought to have subverted your counsel in which the constancy of the Church was established.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#008">Psalms 83:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">psa 83:8</A></FONT></span></p>Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children (g) of Lot. Selah. 
<p>
<p>(g) The wickedness of the Ammonites and Moabites is described in that they provoked these other nations to fight against the Israelites.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#009">Psalms 83:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">psa 83:9</A></FONT></span></p>Do unto them as [unto] the (h) Midianites; as [to] Sisera, as [to] Jabin, at the brook of Kison: 
<p>
<p>(h) By these examples they were confirmed that God would not permit his people to be completely destroyed, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#021">Jdg 7:21</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#015">Jdg 4:15</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#010">Psalms 83:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">psa 83:10</A></FONT></span></p>[Which] perished at Endor: they became [as] (i) dung for the earth. 
<p>
<p>(i) Trodden under foot as mire.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#012">Psalms 83:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">psa 83:12</A></FONT></span></p>Who said, Let us take to ourselves the (k) houses of God in possession. 
<p>
<p>(k) That is, Judea: for where his Church is, there he dwells among them.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#013">Psalms 83:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">psa 83:13</A></FONT></span></p>O my God, make them like a (l) wheel; as the stubble before the wind. 
<p>
<p>(l) Because the reprobate could by no means be amended, he prays that they may utterly be destroyed, be unstable and led by all winds.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#016">Psalms 83:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">psa 83:16</A></FONT></span></p>Fill their faces with shame; that they may (m) seek thy name, O LORD. 
<p>
<p>(m) That is, be compelled by your plagues to confess your power.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#018">Psalms 83:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">psa 83:18</A></FONT></span></p>That [men] may (n) know that thou, whose name alone [is] JEHOVAH, [art] the most high over all the earth. 
<p>
<p>(n) Though they do not believe, yet they may prove by experience, that it is in vain to resist against your counsel in establishing your Church.
