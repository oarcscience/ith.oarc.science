<p>
<p>(a) Which (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#001">Sa2 8:1</A>) calls the bridle of bondage, because it was a strong town and kept the country around it in subjection. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#006">1 Chronicles 18:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">ch1 18:6</A></FONT></span></p>Then David put [garrisons] in Syriadamascus; and the Syrians became David's servants, [and] brought gifts. Thus the LORD (b) preserved David whithersoever he went. 
<p>
<p>(b) That is in all things that he attempted.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">ch1 18:8</A></FONT></span></p>Likewise from (c) Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, brought David very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brasen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass. 
<p>
<p>(c) Which in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#008">Sa2 8:8</A>) is called Betah and Berothai.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">ch1 18:10</A></FONT></span></p>He sent (d) Hadoram his son to king David, to enquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war with Tou;) and [with him] all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass. 
<p>
<p>(d) Called also Joram (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#010">Sa2 8:10</A>).

<p>
<p>(e) Because the Edomites and the Syrians joined their power together, it is said, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#012">Sa2 8:12</A>) that the Amramites were spoiled. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#012">1 Chronicles 18:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">ch1 18:12</A></FONT></span></p>Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt (f) eighteen thousand. 
<p>
<p>(f) Which is understood that Joab slew 12,000 as is in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#001">Psa 60:1</A>) and Abishai the rest. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#017">1 Chronicles 18:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">ch1 18:17</A></FONT></span></p>And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada [was] over the (g) Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David [were] chief about the king.
