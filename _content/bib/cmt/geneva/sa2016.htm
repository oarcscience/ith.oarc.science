<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#001">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 16:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">sa2 16:1</A></FONT></span></p>And when David was a little past the (a) top [of the hill], behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred [loaves] of bread, and an hundred bunches of raisins, and an hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine. 
<p>
<p>(a) Which was the hill of olives, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#030">Sa2 15:30</A>). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#002">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 16:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">sa2 16:2</A></FONT></span></p>And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba said, The (b) asses [be] for the king's household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink. 
<p>
<p>(b) Commonly there are no viler traitors than they, who under the pretence of friendship accuse others. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#005">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 16:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">sa2 16:5</A></FONT></span></p>And when king David came to (c) Bahurim, behold, thence came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name [was] Shimei, the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came. 
<p>
<p>(c) Which was a city in the tribe of Benjamin. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#006">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 16:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">sa2 16:6</A></FONT></span></p>And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men [were] on his (d) right hand and on his left. 
<p>
<p>(d) That is, round about him. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#008">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 16:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">sa2 16:8</A></FONT></span></p>The LORD hath returned upon thee all the (e) blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and, behold, thou [art taken] in thy mischief, because thou [art] a bloody man. 
<p>
<p>(e) Reproaching him, as though by his means Ishbosheth and Abner were slain. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#010">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 16:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">sa2 16:10</A></FONT></span></p>And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? so let him curse, because the LORD hath (f) said unto him, Curse David. Who shall then say, Wherefore hast thou done so? 
<p>
<p>(f) David felt that this was the judgment of God for his sin, and therefore humbles himself to his rod. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#012">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 16:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">sa2 16:12</A></FONT></span></p>It may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction, and that the LORD will (g) requite me good for his cursing this day. 
<p>
<p>(g) Meaning, that the Lord will send comfort to his, when they are oppressed. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#014">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 16:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">sa2 16:14</A></FONT></span></p>And the king, and all the people that [were] with him, came weary, and refreshed themselves (h) there. 
<p>
<p>(h) That is, at Bahurim. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#017">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 16:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">sa2 16:17</A></FONT></span></p>And Absalom said to Hushai, [Is] this thy kindness to thy (i) friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend? 
<p>
<p>(i) Meaning, David. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#021">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 16:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">sa2 16:21</A></FONT></span></p>And (k) Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father's concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then shall the hands of all that [are] with thee be strong. 
<p>
<p>(k) Suspecting the change of the kingdom, and so his own overthrow, he gives such counsel as might most hinder his father's reconciliation: and also declare to the people that Absalom was in highest authority. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#023">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 16:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">sa2 16:23</A></FONT></span></p>And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days, [was] as if a man had (l) enquired at the oracle of God: so [was] all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom. 
<p>
<p>(l) It was so esteemed for the success of it.
