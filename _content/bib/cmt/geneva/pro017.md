### [Proverbs Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#001)

[Proverbs 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 17:1</span></span>

Better \[is\] a dry morsel, and quietness with it, than an house full of
(a) sacrifices \[with\] strife.

\(a\) For where there were many sacrifices, there were many portions
given to the people, with which they feasted.

[Proverbs 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 17:2</span></span>

A wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame, and shall
have part of the (b) inheritance among the brethren.

\(b\) That is, will be made governor over the children.

[Proverbs 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 17:8</span></span>

A bribe \[is as\] a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it:
wherever it (c) turneth, it prospereth.

\(c\) The reward has great force to gain the hearts of men.

[Proverbs 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 17:9</span></span>

He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that repeateth a
matter separateth \[very\] (d) friends.

\(d\) He that admonishes the prince of his fault makes him his enemy.

[Proverbs 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 17:11</span></span>

An evil \[man\] seeketh only rebellion: therefore a cruel (e) messenger
shall be sent against him.

\(e\) By the messenger is meant such means as God uses to punish the
rebels.

[Proverbs 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 17:12</span></span>

Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than (f) a fool in
his folly.

\(f\) By which he means the wicked in his rage, who has no fear of God.

[Proverbs 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 17:16</span></span>

Why \[is there\] a (g) price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom, seeing
\[he hath\] no heart \[to it\]?

\(g\) What good does it do the wicked to be rich, seeing he does not set
his mind to wisdom?

[Proverbs 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 17:17</span></span>

A friend loveth at all times, and a (h) brother is born for adversity.

\(h\) So that he is more than a friend, even a brother that helps in
time of adversity.

[Proverbs 17:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 17:18</span></span>

A man void of understanding (i) striketh hands, \[and\] becometh surety
in the presence of his friend.

\(i\) Read ([Pro 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#001)).

[Proverbs 17:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 17:19</span></span>

He loveth transgression that loveth strife: \[and\] he that exalteth his
(k) gate seeketh destruction.

\(k\) Lifts up himself above his degree.

[Proverbs 17:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 17:23</span></span>

A wicked \[man\] taketh a bribe out of the (l) bosom to pervert the ways
of judgment.

\(l\) That is, secretly and out of the bosom of the rich.

[Proverbs 17:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 17:24</span></span>

Wisdom \[is\] before him that hath understanding; but the eyes of a fool
\[are\] in the (m) ends of the earth.

\(m\) That is, wander to and fro, and seek not after wisdom.

[Proverbs 17:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">pro 17:26</span></span>

Also to punish the just \[is\] not good, \[nor\] to strike princes (n)
for equity.

\(n\) For their well doing.
