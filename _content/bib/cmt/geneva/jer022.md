### [Jeremiah Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 22:3</span></span>

Thus saith the LORD; Execute ye judgment and (a) righteousness, and
deliver him that is laid waste out of the hand of the oppressor: and do
no wrong, do no violence to the stranger, the fatherless, nor the widow,
neither shed innocent blood in this place.

\(a\) This was his ordinary manner of preaching before the kings from
Josiah to Zedekiah which was about forty years.

[Jeremiah 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 22:5</span></span>

But if ye will not hear these words, I (b) swear by myself, saith the
LORD, that this house shall become a desolation.

\(b\) Showing that there is no one greater than he is, ([Heb
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#013)) and that he will most certainly
perform his oath.

[Jeremiah 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 22:6</span></span>

For thus saith the LORD to the king's house of Judah; Thou \[art\] (c)
Gilead to me, \[and\] the head of Lebanon: \[yet\] surely I will make
thee a wilderness, \[and\] cities \[which\] are not inhabited.

\(c\) He compares Jerusalem to Gilead which was beyond Jordan and the
beauty of Judea to Lebanon.

[Jeremiah 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 22:7</span></span>

And I will (d) prepare destroyers against thee, every one with his
weapons: and they shall cut down thy choice (e) cedars, and cast
\[them\] into the fire.

\(d\) The Hebrew word signifies to sanctify because the Lord dedicates
to his use and purpose such as he prepares to execute his work, ([Isa
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#003); [Jer
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#004), [Jer
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#003)).

\(e\) Your buildings made from cedar trees.

[Jeremiah 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 22:8</span></span>

\(f\) And many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say every
man to his neighbour, Why hath the LORD done thus to this great city?

\(f\) As they who wonder at a thing which they thought would never have
come to pass, ([Deu 29:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#024); [Kg1
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#008)).

[Jeremiah 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 22:10</span></span>

Weep ye not for the dead, neither bemoan him: \[but\] weep bitterly for
him (g) that goeth away: for he shall return no more, nor see his native
country.

\(g\) Signifying that they would lose their king: for Jehoiachin went
forth to meet Nebuchadnezzar and yielded himself, and was carried into
Babylon, ([Kg2 24:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#012)).

[Jeremiah 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 22:11</span></span>

For thus saith the LORD concerning (h) Shallum the son of Josiah king of
Judah, who reigned instead of Josiah his father, who went forth from
this place; He shall not return there any more:

\(h\) Whom some think to be Jehoiachin and that Josiah was his
grandfather: but it seems this was Jehoiakim, as in ([Jer
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#018)).

[Jeremiah 22:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 22:13</span></span>

Woe to him that buildeth his house by (i) unrighteousness, and his
chambers by wrong; \[that\] useth his neighbour's service without wages,
and giveth him not for his work;

\(i\) By bribes and extortion.

[Jeremiah 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 22:15</span></span>

Shalt thou reign, because thou closest \[thyself\] in cedar? did not thy
(k) father eat and drink, and do judgment and justice, \[and\] then \[it
was\] well with him?

\(k\) Meaning Josiah, who was not given to ambition and superfluity, but
was content with mediocrity, and only delighted in setting forth God's
glory, and to do justice to all.

[Jeremiah 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 22:18</span></span>

Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah
king of Judah; They shall not lament for (l) him, \[saying\], Ah my
brother! or, Ah sister! they shall not lament for him, \[saying\], Ah
lord! or, Ah his glory!

\(l\) For everyone will have enough to lament for himself.

[Jeremiah 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 22:19</span></span>

He shall be (m) buried with the burial of a donkey, drawn and cast forth
beyond the gates of Jerusalem.

\(m\) Not honourably among his fathers, but as carrion are cast in a
hole, because their stink should not infect, read ([Kg1
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#010)). Josephus writes that the enemy
slew him in the city and commanded him to be cast before the walls
unburied, see ([Jer 36:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#030)).

[Jeremiah 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 22:20</span></span>

Go up to (n) Lebanon, and cry; and lift up thy voice in (o) Bashan, and
cry from the passes: for all thy lovers are destroyed.

\(n\) To call to the Assyrians for help.

\(o\) For this was the way out of India to Assyria, by which is meant
that all help would fail: for the Chaldeans have subdued both them and
the Egyptians.

[Jeremiah 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 22:22</span></span>

The wind shall eat up all thy shepherds, (p) and thy lovers shall go
into captivity: surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for all
thy wickedness.

\(p\) Both your governors and they that would help you will vanish away
as wind.

[Jeremiah 22:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 22:23</span></span>

O inhabitant of Lebanon, that makest thy nest in the (q) cedars, how
gracious shalt thou be when pangs come upon thee, the pain as of a woman
in travail!

(q You that are built of the fair cedar trees of Lebanon.

[Jeremiah 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jer 22:24</span></span>

\[As\] I live, saith the LORD, though (r) Coniah the son of Jehoiakim
king of Judah were the signet upon my right hand, yet would I pluck thee
from there;

\(r\) Who was called Jehoiachin or Jeconiah, whom he calls here Coniah
in contempt who thought his kingdom could never depart from him, because
he came of the stock of David, and therefore for the promise sake could
not be taken from his house, but he abused God's promise and therefore
was justly deprived of the kingdom.

[Jeremiah 22:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jer 22:29</span></span>

O (s) earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the LORD.

\(s\) He shows that all posterity will be witnesses of his just plague,
as though it were registered for perpetual memory.

[Jeremiah 22:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">jer 22:30</span></span>

Thus saith the LORD, Write ye this (t) man childless, a man \[that\]
shall not prosper in his days: for no man of his seed shall prosper,
sitting upon the throne of David, and ruling any more in Judah.

\(t\) Not that he had no children (for later he begat Salathiel in the
captivity, ([Mat 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#012))) but that none
would reign after him as king.
