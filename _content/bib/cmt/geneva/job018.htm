<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">job 18:2</A></FONT></span></p>How long [will it be ere] (a) ye make an end of words? (b) mark, and afterwards we will speak. 
<p>
<p>(a) Who count yourselves just as (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#004">Job 12:4</A>). 
<p>
<p>(b) Whom you take to be only beasts, as in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#007">Job 12:7</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#004">Job 18:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">job 18:4</A></FONT></span></p>(c) He teareth himself in his anger: shall the (d) earth be forsaken for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of his place? 
<p>
<p>(c) That is, like a madman. 
<p>
<p>(d) Shall God change the order of nature for your sake, by dealing with you otherwise than he does with all man?  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#005">Job 18:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">job 18:5</A></FONT></span></p>Yea, the light of the wicked shall be (e) put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine. 
<p>
<p>(e) When the wicked is in his prosperity, then God changes his state: and this is his ordinary working for their sins.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#008">Job 18:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">job 18:8</A></FONT></span></p>For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he (f) walketh upon a snare. 
<p>
<p>(f) Meaning, that the wicked are in continual danger.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#012">Job 18:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">job 18:12</A></FONT></span></p>His strength shall be (g) hungerbitten, and destruction [shall be] ready at his side. 
<p>
<p>(g) That which should nourish him will be consumed by famine.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#013">Job 18:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">job 18:13</A></FONT></span></p>It shall devour the strength of his skin: [even] the (h) firstborn of death shall devour his strength. 
<p>
<p>(h) That is, some strong and violent death will consume his strength: or as the Hebrew word signifies his members or parts.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#014">Job 18:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">job 18:14</A></FONT></span></p>His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it shall bring him to the (i) king of terrors. 
<p>
<p>(i) That is, with great fear.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#015">Job 18:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">job 18:15</A></FONT></span></p>It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because [it is] none of his: (l) brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation. 
<p>
<p>(l) Though all the world would favour him, yet God would destroy him and his.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#018">Job 18:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">job 18:18</A></FONT></span></p>He shall be driven from (m) light into darkness, and chased out of the world. 
<p>
<p>(m) He will fall from prosperity to adversity.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#020">Job 18:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">job 18:20</A></FONT></span></p>They that come after [him] shall be astonied at his (n) day, as they that went before were affrighted. 
<p>
<p>(n) When they will see what came to him.
