### [Psalms Chapter 41](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#001)

[Psalms 41:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 41:1</span></span>

"To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David." Blessed \[is\] he that (a)
considereth the poor: the LORD will deliver him in time of trouble.

\(a\) Not condemning him as accused whom God visits, knowing that there
are various reasons why God lays his hand on us, yea and afterwards he
restores us.

[Psalms 41:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 41:3</span></span>

The LORD will strengthen him upon the (b) bed of languishing: thou wilt
make all his (c) bed in his sickness.

\(b\) When for sorrow and grief of mind he calls himself on his bed.

\(c\) You have restored him in his sick bed and sent him comfort.

[Psalms 41:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 41:5</span></span>

Mine enemies (d) speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his name
perish?

\(d\) That is, curse me and cannot have their cruel hate quenched but
with my shameful death.

[Psalms 41:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 41:6</span></span>

And if he come to see \[me\], he speaketh (e) vanity: his heart
gathereth iniquity to itself; \[when\] he goeth abroad, he telleth
\[it\].

\(e\) For pretending to comfort me, he conspires my death in his heart,
and brags of it.

[Psalms 41:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 41:8</span></span>

\(f\) An evil disease, \[say they\], cleaveth fast unto him: and \[now\]
that he lieth he shall rise up no more.

\(f\) The enemies thought by his sharp punishments that God had become
his mortal enemy.

[Psalms 41:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 41:9</span></span>

Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my
bread, (g) hath lifted up \[his\] heel against me.

\(g\) As David felt this falsehood, and as it was chiefly accomplished
in Christ, ([Joh 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#018)) so shall his
members continually prove the same.

[Psalms 41:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 41:12</span></span>

And as for me, thou upholdest me (h) in mine integrity, and settest me
before thy (i) face for ever.

\(h\) Meaning, either in prosperity of life or in the true fear of God
against all temptation.

\(i\) Showing me evident signs of your fatherly providence.

[Psalms 41:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 41:13</span></span>

Blessed \[be\] the LORD God of Israel from everlasting, and to
everlasting. (k) Amen, and Amen.

\(k\) By this repetition he stirs up the faithful to praise God.
