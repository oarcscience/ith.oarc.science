<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#001">Genesis 12:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">gen 12:1</A></FONT></span></p>Now the LORD had said unto Abram, (a) Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto (b) a land that I will shew thee: 
<p>
<p>(a) From the flood to this time were four hundred and twenty-three years. 
<p>
<p>(b) In appointing him no certain place, he proves so much more his faith and obedience.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#002">Genesis 12:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">gen 12:2</A></FONT></span></p>And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be (c) a blessing: 
<p>
<p>(c) The world shall recover by your seed, which is Christ, the blessing which they lost in Adam.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#005">Genesis 12:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">gen 12:5</A></FONT></span></p>And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the (d) souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came. 
<p>
<p>(d) Meaning servants as well as cattle.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#006">Genesis 12:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">gen 12:6</A></FONT></span></p>And Abram (e) passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the (f) Canaanite [was] then in the land. 
<p>
<p>(e) He wandered to and fro in the land before he could find a settling place: thus God exercises the faith of his children. 
<p>
<p>(f) Which was a cruel and rebellious nation, by whom God kept his in continual exercise.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#007">Genesis 12:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">gen 12:7</A></FONT></span></p>And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he (g) an altar unto the LORD, who appeared unto him. 
<p>
<p>(g) It was not enough for him to worship God in his heart, but it was expedient to declare by outward profession his faith before men, of which this altar was a sign.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#008">Genesis 12:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">gen 12:8</A></FONT></span></p>And he removed from (h) thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, [having] Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he builded an (i) altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD. 
<p>
<p>(h) Because of the troubles that he had among that wicked people. 
<p>
<p>(i) And so served the true God, and renounced all idolatry.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#009">Genesis 12:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">gen 12:9</A></FONT></span></p>(k) And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south. 
<p>
<p>(k) Thus the children of God may look for no rest in this world, but must wait for the heavenly rest and quietness.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#010">Genesis 12:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">gen 12:10</A></FONT></span></p>And there was a (l) famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine [was] grievous in the land. 
<p>
<p>(l) This was a new trial of Abram's faith: by which we see that the end of one affliction is the beginning of another.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#013">Genesis 12:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">gen 12:13</A></FONT></span></p>Say, I pray thee, thou [art] my (m) sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee. 
<p>
<p>(m) By this we learn not to use unlawful means nor to put others in danger to save ourselves, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#020">Gen 12:20</A>). Though it may appear that Abram did not fear death, so much as dying without children, he acts as though God's promise had not taken place; in which appeared a weak faith.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#015">Genesis 12:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">gen 12:15</A></FONT></span></p>The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was (n) taken into Pharaoh's house. 
<p>
<p>(n) To be his wife.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#017">Genesis 12:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">gen 12:17</A></FONT></span></p>And the LORD (o) plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram's wife. 
<p>
<p>(o) The Lord took the defence of this poor stranger against a mighty king: and as he is ever careful over his, so did he preserve Sarai.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#020">Genesis 12:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">gen 12:20</A></FONT></span></p>And Pharaoh (p) commanded [his] men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had. 
<p>
<p>(p) To the intent that none should hurt him either in his person or goods.
