### [2 Chronicles Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 18:1</span></span>

Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance, and joined (a)
affinity with Ahab.

\(a\) For Joram Jehoshaphat's son married Ahab's daughter.

[2 Chronicles 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 18:2</span></span>

And after \[certain\] (b) years he went down to Ahab to Samaria. And
Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the people that
\[he had\] with him, and persuaded him to go up \[with him\] to (c)
Ramothgilead.

\(b\) That is, the third year, ([Kg1
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#002)).

\(c\) To recover it out of the hands of the Syrians.

[2 Chronicles 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch2 18:4</span></span>

And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at
the (d) word of the LORD to day.

\(d\) Hear the advise of some prophet to know whether it is God's will.

[2 Chronicles 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 18:5</span></span>

Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of (e) prophets four
hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle,
or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God will deliver \[it\]
into the king's hand.

\(e\) Who were the prophets of Baal, signifying that the wicked esteem
none but liars and such as will bear with their inordinate affections.

[2 Chronicles 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 18:7</span></span>

And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, \[There is\] yet one man,
by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I (f) hate him; for he never
prophesied good unto me, but always evil: the same \[is\] Micaiah the
son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say (g) so.

\(f\) Yet the true ministers of God should not cease to do their duty,
even though the wicked magistrates cannot abide them speaking the truth.

\(g\) Meaning, that he should not refuse to hear any that was from God.

[2 Chronicles 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch2 18:9</span></span>

And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat either of them
on his throne, clothed in \[their\] (h) robes, and they sat in a void
place at the entering in of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets
prophesied before them.

\(h\) That is, in their majesty and royal apparel.

[2 Chronicles 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch2 18:10</span></span>

And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him (i) horns of iron, and
said, Thus saith the LORD, With these thou shalt push Syria until they
be consumed.

\(i\) Read ([Kg1 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#011)).

[2 Chronicles 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch2 18:12</span></span>

And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him, saying,
Behold, the words of the prophets \[declare\] good to the king with one
(k) assent; let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of theirs,
and speak thou good.

\(k\) Thinking, that since four hundred prophets had agreed in one
thing, that he being but one man and in least estimation, did not dare
to go against it.

[2 Chronicles 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 18:14</span></span>

And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall
we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, (l) Go
ye up, and prosper, and they shall be delivered into your hand.

\(l\) He spoke this in derision of the false prophets as the king well
knew.

[2 Chronicles 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch2 18:16</span></span>

Then he said, I did see all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as
sheep that have no shepherd: and the LORD said, (m) These have no
master; let them return \[therefore\] every man to his house in peace.

\(m\) He prophesied of how the people would be scattered and Ahab slain.

[2 Chronicles 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch2 18:18</span></span>

Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the LORD; I saw the LORD
sitting upon his throne, and all the (n) host of heaven standing on his
right hand and \[on\] his left.

\(n\) Meaning his angels.

[2 Chronicles 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch2 18:21</span></span>

And he said, I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all
his prophets. And (o) \[the LORD\] said, Thou shalt entice \[him\], and
thou shalt also prevail: go out, and do \[even\] so.

\(o\) That is, the Lord.

[2 Chronicles 18:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch2 18:22</span></span>

Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a (p) lying spirit in the mouth
of these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil against thee.

\(p\) To those who would not believe the truth, God sent a strong
delusion, that they would believe lies, ([Th2
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#010)).

[2 Chronicles 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ch2 18:23</span></span>

Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah upon the
(q) cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to
speak unto thee?

\(q\) By this cruelty his ambition and hypocrisy was discovered; thus
the hypocrites boast of the Spirit which they do not have, and declare
their malice against them on whom the true Spirit is.

[2 Chronicles 18:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">ch2 18:26</span></span>

And say, Thus saith the king, Put this \[fellow\] in the prison, and
feed him with bread of (r) affliction and with water of affliction,
until I return in peace.

\(r\) Keep him in prison, and let him feel hunger and thirst.

[2 Chronicles 18:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">ch2 18:29</span></span>

And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will (s) disguise
myself, and will go to the battle; but put thou on thy robes. So the
king of Israel disguised himself; and they went to the battle.

\(s\) Thus the wicked think by their own subtilty to escape God's
judgments which he threatens by his word.

[2 Chronicles 18:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">ch2 18:31</span></span>

And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat,
that they said, It \[is\] the king of Israel. Therefore they compassed
about him to fight: but Jehoshaphat (t) cried out, and the LORD helped
him; and God moved them \[to depart\] from him.

\(t\) He cried to the Lord by acknowledging his fault in going with this
wicked king to war against the word of the Lord by his prophet and also
by desiring mercy for the same.

[2 Chronicles 18:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">ch2 18:34</span></span>

And the battle increased that day: howbeit the king of Israel (u) stayed
\[himself\] up in \[his\] chariot against the Syrians until the even:
and about the time of the sun going down he died.

\(u\) He disguised his wound that his soldiers might fight more
courageously.
