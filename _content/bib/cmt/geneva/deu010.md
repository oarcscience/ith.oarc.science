### [Deuteronomy Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#001)

[Deuteronomy 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 10:3</span></span>

And I made an ark \[of\] (a) shittim wood, and hewed two tables of stone
like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables
in mine hand.

\(a\) Which is a wood of long endurance.

[Deuteronomy 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">deu 10:4</span></span>

And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten
commandments, which the LORD spake unto you in the mount out of the
midst of the fire in the day of the (b) assembly: and the LORD gave them
unto me.

\(b\) When you were assembled to receive the Law.

[Deuteronomy 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">deu 10:6</span></span>

And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the
children of Jaakan to (c) Mosera: there Aaron died, and there he was
buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his
stead.

\(c\) This mountain was also called Hor, ([Num
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#028)).

[Deuteronomy 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">deu 10:8</span></span>

At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of
the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to (d) minister unto
him, and to bless in his name, unto this day.

\(d\) That is, to offer sacrifice, and to declare the Law to the people.

[Deuteronomy 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 10:9</span></span>

Wherefore Levi hath no part nor (e) inheritance with his brethren; the
LORD \[is\] his inheritance, according as the LORD thy God promised him.

\(e\) So God turned the curse of Jacob to a blessing ([Gen
49:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#007)).

[Deuteronomy 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">deu 10:12</span></span>

And now, Israel, what doth the LORD thy God (f) require of thee, but to
fear the LORD thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to
serve the LORD thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul,

\(f\) For all our sins and transgressions God requires nothing but to
turn to him and obey him.

[Deuteronomy 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">deu 10:15</span></span>

\(g\) Only the LORD had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he
chose their seed after them, \[even\] you above all people, as \[it is\]
this day.

\(g\) Although he was Lord of heaven and earth, he chose no one but you.

[Deuteronomy 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">deu 10:16</span></span>

\(h\) Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more
stiffnecked.

\(h\) Cut off all your evil affections, ([Jer
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#004)).

[Deuteronomy 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">deu 10:20</span></span>

Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God; him shalt thou serve, and to him shalt
thou cleave, and (i) swear by his name.

\(i\) Read ([Deu 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#013)).
