### [Psalms Chapter 125](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#001)

[Psalms 125:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 125:1</span></span>

"A Song of degrees." They that trust in the LORD \[shall be\] as mount
Zion, \[which\] cannot (a) be removed, \[but\] abideth for ever.

\(a\) Though the world is subject to mutations, yet the people of God
will stand sure and be defended by God's providence.

[Psalms 125:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 125:3</span></span>

For the (b) rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the
righteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity.

\(b\) Though God permits his to be under the cross lest they embrace
wickedness, yet this cross will not so rest on them, that it should
drive them from hope.

[Psalms 125:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 125:5</span></span>

\(c\) As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the LORD shall
lead them forth with the workers of iniquity: \[but\] peace \[shall be\]
upon Israel.

\(c\) He desires God to purge his Church from hypocrites and such as
have no zeal for the truth.
