### [Acts Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#001)

[Acts 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 14:1</span></span>

And (1) it came to pass in (a) Iconium, that they went both together
into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake, that a great multitude
both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed.

\(1\) We should be no less constant in the preaching of the Gospel than
the perversity of the wicked is obstinate in persecuting it.

\(a\) Iconium was a city of Lycaonia.

[Acts 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 14:2</span></span>

But the (b) unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their
minds evil affected against the brethren.

\(b\) Who did not obey the doctrine.

[Acts 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 14:3</span></span>

\(2\) Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord, which
gave testimony unto the word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders
to be done by their hands.

\(2\) We should not leave our places and give in to threatenings, or to
open rage, but only when there is no other remedy, and that not for our
own peace and quiet, but only so that the Gospel may be spread further
abroad.

[Acts 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 14:6</span></span>

They were ware of \[it\], and (c) fled unto Lystra and Derbe, cities of
Lycaonia, and unto the region that lieth round about:

\(c\) It is sometimes proper to flee dangers, at the appropriate times.

[Acts 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 14:8</span></span>

\(3\) And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet, being
a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked:

\(3\) It is an old subtlety of the devil, either to cause the faithful
servants of God to be immediately banished, or to be worshipped as
idols: and he does this by taking occasion of miracles which they have
done.

[Acts 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 14:13</span></span>

Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city, brought oxen
and garlands unto the (d) gates, and would have done sacrifice with the
people.

\(d\) Of the house where Paul and Barnabas were.

[Acts 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 14:15</span></span>

\(4\) And saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of (e)
like passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn from
these (f) vanities unto the living God, which made heaven, and earth,
and the sea, and all things that are therein:

\(4\) That is also called idolatry which gives to creatures, be they
ever so holy and excellent, that which is proper to the only One God,
that is, invocation, or calling upon.

\(e\) Men, as you are, and partakers of the very same nature of man as
you are.

\(f\) He calls idols "vanities", after the manner of the Hebrews.

[Acts 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">act 14:16</span></span>

\(5\) Who in times past (g) suffered all nations to walk in their own
ways.

\(5\) Custom, be it ever so old, does not excuse the idolaters.

\(g\) Allowed them to live as they wished, prescribing and appointing
them no type of religion.

[Acts 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 14:19</span></span>

\(6\) And there came thither \[certain\] Jews from Antioch and Iconium,
who persuaded the people, and, having stoned Paul, drew \[him\] out of
the city, supposing he had been dead.

\(6\) The devil, when he is brought to his last chance, at length rages
openly, but in vain, even at that time when he seems to have the upper
hand.

[Acts 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 14:21</span></span>

\(7\) And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had taught
many, they returned again to Lystra, and \[to\] Iconium, and Antioch,

\(7\) We must go forward in our calling through a thousand deaths.

[Acts 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 14:22</span></span>

\(8\) Confirming the souls of the disciples, \[and\] exhorting them to
continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter
into the kingdom of God.

\(8\) It is the office of the ministers, not only to teach, but also to
confirm those that are taught, and prepare them for the cross.

[Acts 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 14:23</span></span>

\(9\) And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had
prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they
believed.

\(9\) The apostles committed the churches which they had planted to
proper and special pastors, who they appointed not rashly, but with
prayers and fastings preceding their choice: neither did they thrust
them upon churches through bribery, or lordly superiority, but chose and
placed them by the voice of the congregation.

[Acts 14:24](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 14:24</span></span>

\(10\) And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to
Pamphylia.

\(10\) Paul and Barnabas, having completed their journey, and having
returned to Antioch, give an account of their journey to the
congregation or church.

[Acts 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 14:25</span></span>

And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down into (h)
Attalia:

\(h\) Attalia was a sea city of Pamphylia, near to Lycia.

[Acts 14:26](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 14:26</span></span>

And thence sailed to (i) Antioch, from whence they had been recommended
to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled.

\(i\) Antioch of Syria.
