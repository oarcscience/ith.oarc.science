<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">col 4:2</span></span>

\(1\) (2) Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving;

\(1\) He adds certain general exhortations, and at length ends his
epistle with various familiar and godly salutations. (2) Prayers must be
continual and earnest.

[Colossians 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">col 4:3</span></span>

\(3\) Withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a (a) door
of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in
bonds:

\(3\) Those who minister the word, must especially be entrusted to the
prayers of the Church.

\(a\) An open and free mouth to preach the Gospel.

[Colossians 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">col 4:5</span></span>

\(4\) Walk (b) in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the (c)
time.

\(4\) In all parts of our life, we ought to have good consideration even
of those who are outside of the Church.

\(b\) Advisedly and cautiously.

\(c\) Seek occasion to win them, even though you lose something of your
own by it.

[Colossians 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">col 4:6</span></span>

\(5\) Let your speech \[be\] alway with (d) grace, seasoned with (e)
salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man.

\(5\) Our speech and talk must be applied to the profit of the hearers.

\(d\) Fit for the profit of your neighbour.

\(e\) Against this is set filthy communication, as in ([Eph
4:29](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#029)).

[Colossians 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">col 4:11</span></span>

And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These
(f) only \[are my\] fellowworkers unto the (g) kingdom of God, which
have been a comfort unto me.

\(f\) Hence, Peter was not at that time in Rome.

\(g\) In the Gospel.
