### [Joshua Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#001)

[Joshua 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 22:1</span></span>

Then (a) Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half
tribe of Manasseh,

\(a\) After that the Israelites enjoyed the land of Canaan.

[Joshua 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jos 22:2</span></span>

And said unto them, Ye have kept all that Moses the servant of the LORD
(b) commanded you, and have obeyed my voice in all that I commanded you:

\(b\) Which was to go armed before their brethren, ([Num
32:29](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#029)).

[Joshua 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jos 22:5</span></span>

But take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law, which Moses
the servant of the LORD charged you, to (c) love the LORD your God, and
to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and to cleave
unto him, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul.

\(c\) He shows where fulfilling the Law consists.

[Joshua 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jos 22:6</span></span>

So Joshua (d) blessed them, and sent them away: and they went unto their
tents.

\(d\) He commended them to God, and prayed for them.

[Joshua 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jos 22:8</span></span>

And he spake unto them, saying, Return with much riches unto your tents,
and with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with brass,
and with iron, and with very much raiment: divide the spoil of your
enemies with your (e) brethren.

\(e\) Who remained at home and did not go to the war, ([Num
31:27](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#027); [Sa1
30:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#024)).

[Joshua 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jos 22:10</span></span>

And when they came unto the borders of Jordan, that \[are\] in the land
of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half
tribe of Manasseh built (f) there an altar by Jordan, a great altar to
see to.

\(f\) That is, beyond Jordan: for sometime the whole country on both
sides of Jordan is referred to as Canaan.

[Joshua 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jos 22:12</span></span>

And when the children of Israel heard \[of it\], the whole congregation
of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh, to go
up (g) to war against them.

\(g\) Such was their zeal, that they would rather lose their lives, that
allow the true religion to be changed or corrupted.

[Joshua 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jos 22:16</span></span>

Thus saith (h) the whole congregation of the LORD, What trespass \[is\]
this that ye have committed against the God of Israel, to turn away this
day from following the LORD, in that ye have builded you an altar, that
ye might rebel this day against the LORD?

\(h\) Not only of the princes, but also of the common people.

[Joshua 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jos 22:17</span></span>

\[Is\] the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we are not (l)
cleansed until this day, although there was a plague in the congregation
of the LORD,

\(l\) Meaning, God is not fully pacified, in that no punishment can be
sufficient for such wickedness and idolatry.

[Joshua 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jos 22:19</span></span>

Notwithstanding, if the land of your possession \[be\] (k) unclean,
\[then\] pass ye over unto the land of the possession of the LORD,
wherein the LORD'S tabernacle dwelleth, and take possession among us:
but (l) rebel not against the LORD, nor rebel against us, in building
you an altar beside the altar of the LORD our God.

\(k\) In your judgment.

\(l\) To use any other service than God has appointed is to rebel
against God, ([Sa1 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#023)).

[Joshua 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jos 22:20</span></span>

Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing,
and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? and that man (m)
perished not alone in his iniquity.

\(m\) Signifying, that if many suffered for one man's sin, for the fault
of many, all should suffer.

[Joshua 22:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jos 22:23</span></span>

That we have built us an altar to turn from following the LORD, or if to
offer thereon burnt offering or meat offering, or if to offer peace
offerings thereon, let the LORD (n) himself require \[it\];

\(n\) Let him punish us.

[Joshua 22:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jos 22:25</span></span>

For the LORD hath made Jordan a border between us and you, ye children
of Reuben and children of Gad; ye have no part in the LORD: so shall
your children make our children (o) cease from fearing the LORD.

\(o\) Or, to turn back from the true God.

[Joshua 22:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jos 22:28</span></span>

Therefore said we, that it shall be, when they should \[so\] say to us
or to our (p) generations in time to come, that we may say \[again\],
Behold the pattern of the altar of the LORD, which our fathers made, not
for burnt offerings, nor for sacrifices; but it \[is\] a witness between
us and you.

\(p\) They signify a wonderful care that they bore toward their
posterity, that they might live in the true service of God.

[Joshua 22:31](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">jos 22:31</span></span>

And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the children of
Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh,
This day we perceive that the LORD \[is\] (q) among us, because ye have
not committed this trespass against the LORD: now ye have (r) delivered
the children of Israel out of the hand of the LORD.

\(q\) By preserving and governing us.

\(r\) Whom if ye had offended; he would have punished with you.
