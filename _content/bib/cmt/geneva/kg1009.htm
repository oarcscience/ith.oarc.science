<p>
<p>(a) If you walk in my fear, and withdraw yourself from the common manner of men, who follow their sensualities.

<p>(b) God declares that disobedience against him, is the cause of his displeasure, and so of all misery.

<p>(c) The world will make a mockery of you for the vile contempt and abusing of God's most liberal benefit.

<p>
<p>(f) Millo was as the town house or place of assembly which was open above.

<p>
<p>(i) The overseers of Solomon's works were divided into three parts: the first contained 3300, the second 300, and the third 250 who were Israelites. Here are the two last parts, which make 550. See (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#010">Ch2 8:10</A>).
