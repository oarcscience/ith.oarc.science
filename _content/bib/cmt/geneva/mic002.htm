<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#001">Micah 2:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">mic 2:1</A></FONT></span></p>Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their beds! (a) when the morning is light, they practise it, because it is in the power of their hand. 
<p>
<p>(a) As soon as they rise, they execute their wicked devices of the night, and according to their ability hurt others.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#004">Micah 2:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">mic 2:4</A></FONT></span></p>In that day shall [one] take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, [and] say, (b) We be utterly spoiled: he hath changed the portion of my people: how hath he removed [it] from me! turning away he hath divided our fields. 
<p>
<p>(b) Thus the Jews lament and say that there is no hope of restitution, seeing their possessions are divided among the enemies.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#005">Micah 2:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">mic 2:5</A></FONT></span></p>Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in (c) the congregation of the LORD. 
<p>
<p>(c) You will have no more lands to divide as you had in times past, and as you used to measure them in the Jubilee.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#006">Micah 2:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">mic 2:6</A></FONT></span></p>(d) Prophesy ye not, [say they to them that] prophesy: (e) they shall not prophesy to them, [that] they shall not take shame. 
<p>
<p>(d) Thus the people warn the prophets that they speak to them no more, for they cannot endure their threatenings. 
<p>
<p>(e) God says that they will not prophesy, nor receive any more of their rebukes or taunts.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#007">Micah 2:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">mic 2:7</A></FONT></span></p>O [thou that art] named the house of Jacob, is the spirit of the LORD straitened? (f) [are] these his doings? do not my words do good to him (g) that walketh uprightly? 
<p>
<p>(f) Are these your works according to his Law? 
<p>
<p>(g) Do not the godly find my words comfortable?  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#008">Micah 2:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">mic 2:8</A></FONT></span></p>Even (h) of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye pull off the (i) robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from war. 
<p>
<p>(h) That is, in past times. 
<p>
<p>(i) The poor can have no benefit from them, but they rob them, as though they were enemies.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#009">Micah 2:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">mic 2:9</A></FONT></span></p>The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their children have ye taken away (k) my glory for ever. 
<p>
<p>(k) That is, their substance and living, which is God's blessing, and as it were part of his glory.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#010">Micah 2:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">mic 2:10</A></FONT></span></p>Arise ye, and depart; for this [is] not [your] (l) rest: because it is polluted, it shall destroy [you], even with a sore destruction. 
<p>
<p>(l) Jerusalem will not be your safeguard, but rather the cause of your destruction.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#011">Micah 2:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">mic 2:11</A></FONT></span></p>If a man (m) walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, [saying], (n) I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people. 
<p>
<p>(m) That is, show himself to be a prophet. 
<p>
<p>(n) He shows what prophets they delight in, that is, in flatterers, who tell them pleasant tales, and speak of their benefits.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#012">Micah 2:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">mic 2:12</A></FONT></span></p>I will surely assemble, O Jacob, (o) all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as the flock in the midst of their fold: they shall make great noise by reason of [the multitude of] men. 
<p>
<p>(o) To destroy you.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#013">Micah 2:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">mic 2:13</A></FONT></span></p>The (p) breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and have passed through the gate, and are gone out by it: and their king shall pass before them, and the LORD (q) on the head of them. 
<p>
<p>(p) The enemy will break their gates and walls, and lead them into Chaldea. 
<p>
<p>(q) To drive them forward, and to help their enemies.
