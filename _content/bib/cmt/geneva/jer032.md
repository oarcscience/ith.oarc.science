### [Jeremiah Chapter 32](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 32:1</span></span>

The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the (a) tenth year of
Zedekiah king of Judah, which \[was\] the eighteenth year of
Nebuchadnezzar.

\(a\) So that Jeremiah had now prophesied from the thirteenth year of
Josiah to the last year save one of Zedekiah's reign, which was almost
forty years.

[Jeremiah 32:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 32:5</span></span>

And he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until (b) I
visit him, saith the LORD: though ye fight with the Chaldeans, ye shall
not prosper.

\(b\) Till I take Zedekiah away by death: for he will not die by the
sword as in ([Jer 34:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#004)).

[Jeremiah 32:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 32:7</span></span>

Behold, Hanameel the son of Shallum thy uncle shall come to thee,
saying, (c) Buy for thee my field that \[is\] in Anathoth: for the right
of redemption \[is\] thine (d) to buy \[it\].

\(c\) By which was meant that the people would return again out of
captivity and enjoy their possessions and vineyards as in ([Jer
32:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#015), [Jer
32:44](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#044)).

\(d\) Because he was next of the kindred, as in ([Rut
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#004)).

[Jeremiah 32:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 32:8</span></span>

So Hanameel my uncle's son came to me in the court of the prison
according to the word of the LORD, and said to me, Buy my (e) field, I
pray thee, that \[is\] in Anathoth, which \[is\] in the country of
Benjamin: for the right of inheritance \[is\] thine, and the redemption
\[is\] thine; buy \[it\] for thyself. Then I knew that this \[was\] the
word of the LORD.

\(e\) Of the possession of the Levites, read ([Lev
25:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#032)).

[Jeremiah 32:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 32:9</span></span>

And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle's son, that \[was\] in
Anathoth, and weighed him the money, \[even\] seventeen (f) shekels of
silver.

\(f\) Which amounts to about ten shillings six pence in our money if
this shekel were the common shekel, See [Gen
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#015), for the shekel of the temple
was of double value, and ten pieces of silver were half a shekel, for
twenty made the shekel.

[Jeremiah 32:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 32:11</span></span>

So I took the deed of the purchase, \[both\] that which was sealed (g)
\[according\] to the law and custom, and that which was open:

\(g\) According to the custom the instrument or evidence was sealed up
with the common seal and a copy of it remained which contained the same
in effect but was left open to be seen if anything should be called into
doubt.

[Jeremiah 32:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 32:14</span></span>

Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Take these deeds, this
deed of the purchase, both that which is sealed, and this deed which is
open; and put them in an earthen (h) vessel, that they may continue many
days.

\(h\) And so to hide them in the ground, that they might be reserved as
a token of their deliverance.

[Jeremiah 32:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 32:18</span></span>

Thou shewest lovingkindness to thousands, and recompensest the iniquity
of the fathers into the bosom of their (i) children after them: the
Great, the Mighty God, JEHOVAH of hosts, \[is\] his name,

\(i\) Because the wicked are subject to the curse of God, he shows that
their posterity who by nature are under this malediction will be
punished both for their own wickedness and that the iniquity of their
fathers which is likewise in them, will be also avenged on their head.

[Jeremiah 32:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 32:20</span></span>

\(k\) Who hast set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, \[even\] to
this day, and in Israel, and among \[other\] men; and hast made thee a
name, as at this day;

\(k\) Meaning that his miracles in delivering his people would never be
forgotten.

[Jeremiah 32:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jer 32:24</span></span>

Behold the (l) mounts, they are come to the city to take it; and the
city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans, that fight against it,
because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence: and what
thou hast spoken is come to pass; and, behold, thou seest \[it\].

\(l\) The word signifies anything that is cast up, as a mount or
rampart, and is also used for engines of war, which were laid on a high
place to shoot into a city before guns were in use.

[Jeremiah 32:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jer 32:27</span></span>

Behold, I \[am\] the LORD, the God of all (m) flesh: is there any thing
too hard for me?

\(m\) That is, of every creature: who as they are his work, so does he
govern and guide them as pleases him, by which he shows that as he is
the author of their captivity for their sins, so will he for his mercies
be their redeemer to restore them again to liberty.

[Jeremiah 32:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">jer 32:30</span></span>

For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done evil only
before me from their (n) youth: for the children of Israel have only
provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, saith the LORD.

\(n\) From the time that I brought them out of Egypt and made them my
people and called them my firstborn.

[Jeremiah 32:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">jer 32:33</span></span>

And they have turned to me the back, and not the face: though I taught
them, (o) rising early and teaching \[them\], yet they have not
hearkened to receive instruction.

\(o\) ([Ch2 36:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#015); [Isa
65:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#002); [Jer
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#013), [Jer
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#003), [Jer
26:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#005), [Jer
29:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#019), [Jer
35:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#014), [Jer
44:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#004)).

[Jeremiah 32:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">jer 32:35</span></span>

And they built the high (p) places of Baal, which \[are\] in the valley
of the (q) son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to (r)
pass through \[the fire\] to Molech; which I commanded them not, neither
came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause
Judah to sin.

\(p\) That is, the altars which were made to offer sacrifices to their
idols on.

\(q\) Read ([Jer 7:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#031); [Kg2
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#004), [Kg2
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#006)).

\(r\) Read ([Kg2 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#003)).

[Jeremiah 32:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">jer 32:36</span></span>

And now (s) therefore thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning
this city, of which ye say, It shall be delivered into the hand of the
king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence;

\(s\) Read ([Jer 30:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#016)).

[Jeremiah 32:39](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">jer 32:39</span></span>

And I will give them (t) one heart, and one way, that they may fear me
for ever, for the good of them, and of their children after them:

\(t\) One consent and one religion, as in ([Eze
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#019), [Eze
36:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#026)).

[Jeremiah 32:40](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">jer 32:40</span></span>

And I will make an everlasting (u) covenant with them, that I will not
turn away from them, to do them good; but I will put my fear in their
hearts, that they shall not depart from me.

\(u\) Read (Jeremiah 31:1-33:26).

[Jeremiah 32:44](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">jer 32:44</span></span>

Men shall buy (x) fields for money, and signed deeds, and seal \[them\],
and take witnesses in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about
Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the
mountains, and in the cities of the valley, and in the cities of the
south: for I will cause their captives to return, saith the LORD.

\(x\) This is the declaration of that which was spoken of in ([Jer
32:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#008)).
