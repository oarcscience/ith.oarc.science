<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#002">Deuteronomy 6:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">deu 6:2</A></FONT></span></p>That thou mayest (a) fear the LORD thy God, to keep all his statutes and his commandments, which I command thee, thou, and thy son, and thy son's son, all the days of thy life; and that thy days may be prolonged. 
<p>
<p>(a) A reverent face and love for God is the first beginning to keeping God's commandments.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#003">Deuteronomy 6:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">deu 6:3</A></FONT></span></p>Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do [it]; that it may be well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath promised thee, (b) in the land that floweth with milk and honey. 
<p>
<p>(b) Which has an abundance of all things needed for man's life.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#007">Deuteronomy 6:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">deu 6:7</A></FONT></span></p>And thou shalt (c) teach them diligently to thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thy house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. (teach: Heb. whet, or, sharpen) 
<p>
<p>(c) Some read, "You shall whet them upon your children": that is, that they may imprint them more deeply in their memory.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#009">Deuteronomy 6:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">deu 6:9</A></FONT></span></p>And thou shalt write them upon the (d) posts of thy house, and on thy gates. 
<p>
<p>(d) That when you enter in you may remember them.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#012">Deuteronomy 6:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">deu 6:12</A></FONT></span></p>(e) [Then] beware lest thou shouldest forget the LORD, who brought thee forth from the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage. (bondage: Heb. bondmen or, servants) 
<p>
<p>(e) Do not let wealth and ease cause you to forget God's mercies, by which you were delivered out of misery.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#013">Deuteronomy 6:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">deu 6:13</A></FONT></span></p>Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God, and serve him, and shalt (f) swear by his name. 
<p>
<p>(f) We must fear God, serve him only and confess his Name, which is done by swearing lawfully.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#016">Deuteronomy 6:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">deu 6:16</A></FONT></span></p>Ye shall not (g) tempt the LORD your God, as ye tempted [him] in Massah. 
<p>
<p>(g) By doubting his power, refusing lawful means, and abusing his graces.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#018">Deuteronomy 6:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">deu 6:18</A></FONT></span></p>And thou shalt do [that which is] right and good in the (h) sight of the LORD: that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest go in and possess the good land which the LORD swore to thy fathers, 
<p>
<p>(h) Here he condemns all of man's good intentions.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#020">Deuteronomy 6:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">deu 6:20</A></FONT></span></p>[And] when (i) thy son shall ask thee in time to come, saying, What [mean] the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which the LORD our God hath commanded you? 
<p>
<p>(i) God not only requires that we serve him all our lives, but also that we see that our posterity sets forth his glory.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#023">Deuteronomy 6:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">deu 6:23</A></FONT></span></p>And he (k) brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers. 
<p>
<p>(k) Nothing should move us more to true obedience than the great benefits which we have received from God.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#025">Deuteronomy 6:25</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_025">deu 6:25</A></FONT></span></p>And it shall be our (l) righteousness, if we observe to do all these commandments before the LORD our God, as he hath commanded us. 
<p>
<p>(l) Because no one can fully obey the law, we must turn to Christ to be justified by faith.
