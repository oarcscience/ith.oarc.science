<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#001">Genesis 26:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">gen 26:1</A></FONT></span></p>And there was a famine in the (a) land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar. 
<p>
<p>(a) In the land of Canaan.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#002">Genesis 26:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">gen 26:2</A></FONT></span></p>And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, (b) Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of: 
<p>
<p>(b) God's providence always watches to direct the ways of his children.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#005">Genesis 26:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">gen 26:5</A></FONT></span></p>Because that Abraham (c) obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws. 
<p>
<p>(c) He commends Abraham's obedience, because Isaac should be even more ready to follow the same: for as God made this promise of his free mercy, so does the confirmation of it proceed from the same fountain.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#007">Genesis 26:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">gen 26:7</A></FONT></span></p>And the men of the place asked [him] of his wife; and he said, She [is] my sister: (d) for he feared to say, [She is] my wife; lest, [said he], the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she [was] fair to look upon. 
<p>
<p>(d) By which we see that fear and distrust is found in the most faithful.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#008">Genesis 26:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">gen 26:8</A></FONT></span></p>And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac [was] (e) sporting with Rebekah his wife. 
<p>
<p>(e) Or showing some familiar sign of love, by which it might be known that she was his wife.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#010">Genesis 26:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">gen 26:10</A></FONT></span></p>And Abimelech said, What [is] this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought (f) guiltiness upon us. 
<p>
<p>(f) In all ages men were persuaded that God's vengeance would come on adulterers.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#014">Genesis 26:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">gen 26:14</A></FONT></span></p>For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines (g) envied him. 
<p>
<p>(g) The malicious always envy the graces of God in others.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#017">Genesis 26:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">gen 26:17</A></FONT></span></p>And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the (k) valley of Gerar, and dwelt there. 
<p>
<p>(k) The Hebrew word signifies a flood, or valley, where water at any time runs.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#024">Genesis 26:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">gen 26:24</A></FONT></span></p>And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I [am] the God (i) of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I [am] with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake. 
<p>
<p>(i) God assures Isaac against all fear by rehearsing the promise made to Abraham.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#025">Genesis 26:25</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_025">gen 26:25</A></FONT></span></p>And he builded an (x) altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants digged a well. 
<p>
<p>(x) To signify that he would serve no other God, but the God of his father Abraham.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#029">Genesis 26:29</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_029">gen 26:29</A></FONT></span></p>(l) That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou [art] now the blessed of the LORD. 
<p>
<p>(l) The Hebrews in swearing begin commonly with "If" and understand the rest, that is, that God will punish him who breaks the oath: here the wicked show that they are afraid lest that happen to them which they would do to others.
