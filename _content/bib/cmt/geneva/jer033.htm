<p>
<p>(a) Which was in the king's house at Jerusalem, as in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#001">Jer 32:1-2</A>).

<p>
<p>(c) Read (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#024">Jer 32:24</A>).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">jer 33:5</A></FONT></span></p>They come to (d) fight with the Chaldeans, but [it is] to fill them with the dead bodies of men, whom I have slain in my anger and in my fury, and for all whose wickedness I have hid my (e) face from this city. 
<p>
<p>(d) The Jews think to overcome the Chaldeans, but they seek their own destruction. 
<p>
<p>(e) He shows that God's favour is cause of all prosperity, as his anger is of all adversity.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#006">Jeremiah 33:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">jer 33:6</A></FONT></span></p>Behold, I (f) will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them, and will reveal to them the abundance of peace and truth.

<p>
<p>(g) Declaring that there is no deliverance nor joy, but where we feel remission of sins.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">jer 33:9</A></FONT></span></p>And it shall be to me a name of (h) joy, a praise and an honour before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that I do to them: and they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all the prosperity that I procure to it. 
<p>
<p>(h) By which he shows that the Church in which is remission of sins, is God's honour and glory, so that whoever is enemy to it, labours to dishonour God.

For I will cause to return the captives of the land, as at the first, saith the LORD.

<p>
<p>(l) That is, I will send the Messiah, who will come of the house of David, of whom this prophecy is meant, as testify all the Jews and that which is written, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005">Jer 23:5</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#016">Jeremiah 33:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">jer 33:16</A></FONT></span></p>In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell in safety: and this [is the name] by which (m) she shall be called, The LORD our (n) righteousness. 
<p>
<p>(m) That is, Christ that will call his Church. 
<p>
<p>(n) That is, Christ is our Lord God, our righteousness, sanctification and redemption, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#030">Co1 1:30</A>).

<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#020">Jeremiah 33:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">jer 33:20</A></FONT></span></p>Thus saith the LORD; If ye can break my covenant of the (p) day, and my covenant of the night, so that there should not be day and night in their season; 
<p>
<p>(p) Read (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#035">Jer 31:35</A>).
