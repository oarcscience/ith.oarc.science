### [Deuteronomy Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#001)

[Deuteronomy 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 5:3</span></span>

The LORD (a) made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us,
\[even\] us, who \[are\] all of us here alive this day.

\(a\) Some read, God made not this covenant, that is, in such ample
forth and with such signs and wonders.

[Deuteronomy 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">deu 5:4</span></span>

The LORD talked with you (b) face to face in the mount out of the midst
of the fire,

\(b\) So plainly that you do not need to doubt it.

[Deuteronomy 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">deu 5:7</span></span>

Thou shalt have none (c) other gods before me.

\(c\) God binds us to serve him only without superstition and idolatry.

[Deuteronomy 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 5:9</span></span>

Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them: for I the
LORD thy God \[am\] a (d) jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the
fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth \[generation\] of
them that hate me,

\(d\) That is, of his honour, not permitting it to be given to others.

[Deuteronomy 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">deu 5:10</span></span>

And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that (e) love me and keep my
commandments.

\(e\) The first degree to keep the commandments, is to love God.

[Deuteronomy 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">deu 5:13</span></span>

Six days (f) thou shalt labour, and do all thy work:

\(f\) Meaning, since God permits six days for our labours, we should
willingly dedicate the seventh to serve him wholly.

[Deuteronomy 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">deu 5:16</span></span>

\(g\) Honour thy father and thy mother, as the LORD thy God hath
commanded thee; that thy days may be prolonged, and that it may go well
with thee, in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.

\(g\) Not for a show, but with true obedience, and due reverence.

[Deuteronomy 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">deu 5:21</span></span>

Neither shalt (h) thou desire thy neighbour's wife, neither shalt thou
covet thy neighbour's house, his field, or his male servant, or his
female servant, his ox, or his donkey, or any \[thing\] that \[is\] thy
neighbour's.

\(h\) He not only speaks of that resolute will, but that there should be
no motion or affection.

[Deuteronomy 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">deu 5:22</span></span>

These words the LORD spoke to all your assembly on the mount from the
midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great
voice: and he (i) added no more. And he wrote them in two tables of
stone, and delivered them to me.

\(i\) Teaching us by his example to be content with his word, and add
nothing to it.

[Deuteronomy 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">deu 5:29</span></span>

O (k) that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me,
and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them,
and with their children for ever!

\(k\) He requires nothing but obedience from us, showing also that we
ourselves are the unveiling of it.

[Deuteronomy 5:32](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">deu 5:32</span></span>

Ye shall observe to do therefore as the LORD your God hath commanded
you: ye shall not (l) turn aside to the right hand or to the left.

\(l\) You shall neither add nor take away, ([Deu
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#002)).

[Deuteronomy 5:33](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">deu 5:33</span></span>

Ye shall walk in all the ways which the LORD your God hath commanded
you, that ye may (m) live, and \[that it may be\] well with you, and
\[that\] ye may prolong \[your\] days in the land which ye shall
possess.

\(m\) In the same way that God, by way of our obedience, gives us all
happiness: so from disobeying God proceed all our miseries.
