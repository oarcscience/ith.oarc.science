### [1 Thessalonians Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#001)

[1 Thessalonians 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">th1 1:2</span></span>

\(1\) We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in
our prayers;

\(1\) An example of proper Christian rejoicing, by which also we learn,
that those who have great gifts in them, are in two ways governed:
first, if they consider that they have received all from God, and
second, that continuance must be desired at his hands. And to these
things this whole epistle exhorts the Thessalonians.

[1 Thessalonians 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">th1 1:3</span></span>

\(2\) Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of
love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God
and our Father;

\(2\) He commends them for three special gifts: effectual faith,
continual love, and patient hope. And he does this to the end that they
might be ashamed, being endued with such excellent gifts, not to
continue in God's election.

[1 Thessalonians 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">th1 1:4</span></span>

Knowing, brethren beloved, your (a) election of God.

\(a\) Literally, "that your election is of God".

[1 Thessalonians 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">th1 1:5</span></span>

\(3\) For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power,
and in the Holy Ghost, and in (b) much assurance; as ye know what manner
of men we were among you for your sake.

\(3\) Another reason why they ought in no way start back but continue to
the end, because they cannot doubt this doctrine which has been so many
ways confirmed to them, even from heaven, as they themselves well knew.

\(b\) Paul shows by two things that there followed very great fruit from
his preaching, that is, by these gifts of the Holy Spirit, and that
certain assurance which was thoroughly settled in their minds, as
appeared by their willingly bearing the cross.

[1 Thessalonians 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">th1 1:6</span></span>

\(4\) And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received
the word in much affliction, with (c) joy of the Holy Ghost:

\(4\) Another reason, because even to that day they embraced the Gospel
with great cheerfulness, insomuch that they were an example to all their
neighbours: so that it would be more shameful for them to faint in the
middle of the race.

\(c\) With joy which comes from the Holy Spirit.

[1 Thessalonians 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">th1 1:9</span></span>

For (d) they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had
unto you, (5) and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living
and true God;

\(d\) All the believers. (5) It is no true conversion to forsake idols,
unless a man in addition worships the true and living God in Christ the
only Redeemer.

[1 Thessalonians 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">th1 1:10</span></span>

And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead,
\[even\] Jesus, which delivered us from (e) the wrath to come.

\(e\) This word "the" is not put here without reason: and by "wrath" is
meant that revenge and punishment with which the Lord will in time judge
the world in his terrible wrath.
