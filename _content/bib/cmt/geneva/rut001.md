### [Ruth Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#001)

[Ruth 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rut 1:1</span></span>

Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a
famine in the (a) land. And a certain man of (b) Bethlehemjudah went to
sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.

The Argument - This book is called Ruth, who is the main person spoken
of in this writing. In which also the state of the Church is set forth
figuratively, being subject to many afflictions and yet eventually God
gives good and joyful offspring, teaching us to abide with patience till
God delivers us out of troubles. In this also it is described how Jesus
Christ, who according to the flesh came from David, proceeded by Ruth,
of whom the Lord Jesus promised to come, nonetheless she was a Moabite
of base condition, and a stranger to the people of God; declaring to us
by it that the Gentiles would be sanctified by him, and joined with his
people, and that there would be one sheepfold, and one shepherd. It
would appear that this account belongs to the time of the judges.

\(a\) In the land of Canaan.

\(b\) In the tribe of Judah, which was also called Bethlehem Ephrathat,
because there was another city so called in the tribe of Zebulun.

[Ruth 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rut 1:4</span></span>

And they took them wives of the (c) women of Moab; the name of the one
\[was\] Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelled there
about ten years.

\(c\) By this wonderful providence of God Ruth became one of God's
household, of whom Christ came.

[Ruth 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rut 1:6</span></span>

Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from the
country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the
LORD had (d) visited his people in giving them bread.

\(d\) By sending them plenty again.

[Ruth 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rut 1:9</span></span>

The LORD grant you that ye may find (e) rest, each \[of you\] in the
house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their
voice, and wept.

\(e\) By this it appears that Naomi by dwelling among idolaters, had
become cold to the true zeal of God, having more respect for the comfort
of the body than the comfort of the soul.

[Ruth 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rut 1:14</span></span>

And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah (f) kissed her
mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her.

\(f\) When she took leave and departed.

[Ruth 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rut 1:15</span></span>

And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her people,
and unto her gods: (g) return thou after thy sister in law.

\(g\) No persuasion can convince them to turn back from God, if he has
chosen them to be his.

[Ruth 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rut 1:19</span></span>

So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to pass, when
they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was (h) moved about them,
and they said, \[Is\] this Naomi?

\(h\) By which it appears that she was of a great family of good
reputation.

[Ruth 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">rut 1:22</span></span>

So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with
her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to
Bethlehem in the beginning of (i) barley harvest.

\(i\) Which was in the month of Nisan, that is, part March and part
April.
