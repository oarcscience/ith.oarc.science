And the people did yet (b) corruptly. 
<p>
<p>(a) That is, to offer incense against the word of God, which is spoken of in the commendation of Jotham. 
<p>
<p>(b) They were not completely purged from idolatry.

<p>
<p>(c) Which was 60 cubits high and was for the height called Ophel: it was at the east gate and mention is made of it in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#004">Ch2 3:4</A>).

<p>
<p>(d) He shows that all prosperity comes from God, who never fails when we put our trust in him.
