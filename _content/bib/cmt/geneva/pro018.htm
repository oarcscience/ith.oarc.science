<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">pro 18:1</A></FONT></span></p>Through desire a man, having (a) separated himself, seeketh [and] intermeddleth with all wisdom. 
<p>
<p>(a) He who loves wisdom will separate himself from all impediments, and give himself wholly to seek it.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#002">Proverbs 18:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">pro 18:2</A></FONT></span></p>A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart may (b) reveal itself. 
<p>
<p>(b) That is, that he may talk licentiously of whatever comes to mind.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#003">Proverbs 18:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">pro 18:3</A></FONT></span></p>When the wicked cometh, [then] cometh also (c) contempt, and with ignominy reproach. 
<p>
<p>(c) Meaning, such a one as condemns all others.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">pro 18:4</A></FONT></span></p>The words of a man's mouth [are as] deep (d) waters, [and] the wellspring of wisdom [as] a flowing brook. 
<p>
<p>(d) Which can never be drawn empty, but always bring profit.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#005">Proverbs 18:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">pro 18:5</A></FONT></span></p>[It is] not good to (e) accept the person of the wicked, to overthrow the righteous in judgment. 
<p>
<p>(e) That is, to favour him and support him.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#008">Proverbs 18:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">pro 18:8</A></FONT></span></p>The words of a talebearer [are] as wounds, and they go down into the (f) innermost parts of the belly. 
<p>
<p>(f) They are soon believed and enter most deeply.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">pro 18:10</A></FONT></span></p>The name of the LORD [is] a strong tower: the righteous runneth (g) into it, and is safe. 
<p>
<p>(g) He shows the refuge of the godly against all trouble.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">pro 18:14</A></FONT></span></p>The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but (h) a wounded spirit who can bear? 
<p>
<p>(h) The mind can well bear the infirmity of the body, but when the spirit is wounded, it is hard to sustain.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#016">Proverbs 18:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">pro 18:16</A></FONT></span></p>A man's gift (i) maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great men. 
<p>
<p>(i) Gets him liberty to speak, and the favour of them that are esteemed.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#017">Proverbs 18:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">pro 18:17</A></FONT></span></p>(k) [He that is] first in his own cause [seemeth] just; but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him. 
<p>
<p>(k) He who speaks first, is best heard from the wicked judge, but when his adversary enquires out the matter it turns to his shame.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#018">Proverbs 18:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">pro 18:18</A></FONT></span></p>The lot (l) causeth contentions to cease, and (m) parteth between the mighty. 
<p>
<p>(l) If a controversy cannot otherwise be decided, it is best to cast lots to know whose the thing will be. 
<p>
<p>(m) Appeases their controversy, who are so stout that they cannot otherwise be pacified.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#019">Proverbs 18:19</A></p>

<p>
<p>(n) Which for the strength of it will not bow or yield.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#021">Proverbs 18:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">pro 18:21</A></FONT></span></p>Death and life [are] in the power of the tongue: and they that (o) love it shall eat the fruit of it.

<p>
<p>(p) He who is joined with a virtuous woman in marriage is blessed by the Lord, as in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#014">Pro 19:14</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#024">Proverbs 18:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">pro 18:24</A></FONT></span></p>A man [that hath] friends must show himself friendly: and there is a friend [that] sticketh closer (q) than a brother. 
<p>
<p>(q) That is, often such are found who are more ready to do pleasure, than he that is more bound by duty.
