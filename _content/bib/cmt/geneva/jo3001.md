### [3 John Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#001)

[3 John 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jo3 1:1</span></span>

The (1) elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.

\(1\) An example of a Christian greeting.

[3 John 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jo3 1:4</span></span>

I have no greater joy than (a) to hear that my children walk in truth.

\(a\) Than these joys.

[3 John 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jo3 1:5</span></span>

Beloved, thou doest (b) faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the
brethren, and to strangers;

\(b\) As becomes a believer and a Christian.

[3 John 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jo3 1:6</span></span>

Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church: whom if thou
(c) bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do
well:

\(c\) He commends to Gaius, either those same men whom he had
entertained before returning to him, about the affairs of the Church, or
else some other who had similar business.

[3 John 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jo3 1:8</span></span>

We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be (d) fellowhelpers
to the truth.

\(d\) That we ourselves may help the preaching of the truth.

[3 John 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jo3 1:9</span></span>

\(2\) I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the
preeminence among them, receiveth us not.

\(2\) Ambition and covetousness, two pestilent sins (especially in those
who have any church responsibilities) are condemned in Diotrephes.

[3 John 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jo3 1:11</span></span>

Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that
doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not (e) seen God.

\(e\) Has not known God.
