<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#001">Psalms 116:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">psa 116:1</A></FONT></span></p>I (a) love the LORD, because he hath heard my voice [and] my supplications. 
<p>
<p>(a) He grants that no pleasure is so great as to feel God's help in our need, neither that anything more stirs up our love toward him.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#002">Psalms 116:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">psa 116:2</A></FONT></span></p>Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon [him] (b) as long as I live. 
<p>
<p>(b) That is in convenient time to seek help, which was when he was in distress.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#005">Psalms 116:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">psa 116:5</A></FONT></span></p>Gracious [is] the LORD, and righteous; yea, our God [is] (c) merciful. 
<p>
<p>(c) He shows forth the fruit of his love in calling on him, confessing him to be just and merciful and to help them who are destitute of aid and counsel.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#007">Psalms 116:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">psa 116:7</A></FONT></span></p>Return unto thy rest, O (d) my soul; for the LORD hath dealt bountifully with thee. 
<p>
<p>(d) Which was disturbed before, now rest on the Lord, for he has been beneficial towards you.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#009">Psalms 116:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">psa 116:9</A></FONT></span></p>I will (e) walk before the LORD in the land of the living. 
<p>
<p>(e) The Lord will preserve me and save my life.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#010">Psalms 116:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">psa 116:10</A></FONT></span></p>(f) I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted: 
<p>
<p>(f) I felt all these things, and therefore was moved by faith to confess them, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#013">Co2 4:13</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#011">Psalms 116:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">psa 116:11</A></FONT></span></p>I said in my (g) haste, All men [are] liars. 
<p>
<p>(g) In my great distress I thought God would not regard man, who is but lies and vanity, yet I overcame this temptation and felt the contrary.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#013">Psalms 116:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">psa 116:13</A></FONT></span></p>I will (h) take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the LORD. 
<p>
<p>(h) In the Law they used to make a banquet when they gave solemn thanks to God, and to take the cup and drink in sign of thanksgiving.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#015">Psalms 116:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">psa 116:15</A></FONT></span></p>Precious in the sight of the LORD [is] the (i) death of his saints. 
<p>
<p>(i) I perceive that God has a care over his, so that he both disposes their death, and takes an account.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#018">Psalms 116:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">psa 116:18</A></FONT></span></p>I will pay my (k) vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people, 
<p>
<p>(k) I will thank him for his benefits, for that is a just payment, to confess that we owe all to God.
