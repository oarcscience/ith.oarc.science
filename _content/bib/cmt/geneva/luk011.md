### [Luke Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#001)

[Luke 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">luk 11:2</span></span>

And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, (1) Our Father which art in
heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in
heaven, so in earth.

\(1\) A form of true prayer.

[Luke 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">luk 11:3</span></span>

Give us (a) day by day our daily bread.

\(a\) That is, as much as is needed for us this day, by which we are not
prevented from having an honest care for the maintenance of our lives;
but that complaining care, which kills a number of men, is cut off and
restrained.

[Luke 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">luk 11:5</span></span>

\(2\) And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall
go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves;

\(2\) We must pray with faith.

[Luke 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">luk 11:8</span></span>

I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his
friend, yet because of his (b) importunity he will rise and give him as
many as he needeth.

\(b\) Literally, "impudence": but that impudency which is spoken of here
is not to be found fault with, but is very commendable before God, for
he is well pleased by such importunity.

[Luke 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">luk 11:15</span></span>

\(3\) But some of them said, He casteth out devils through Beelzebub the
chief of the devils.

\(3\) An example of horrible blindness, and such as cannot be healed,
when the power of God is blasphemed by an evil conscience and pretended
malice.

[Luke 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">luk 11:17</span></span>

\(4\) But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom
divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house \[divided\]
against a house falleth.

\(4\) The true way to know the true Christ from the false is this, that
the true Christ has no harmony or agreement with Satan: and once we know
him it is left for us to acknowledge him.

[Luke 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">luk 11:18</span></span>

If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand?
because ye say that I cast out devils (c) through Beelzebub.

\(c\) By the name and power of Beelzebub.

[Luke 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">luk 11:20</span></span>

But if I with the (d) finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the
kingdom of God is come upon you.

\(d\) That is, by the power of God: so it says in See [Exo
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#019).

[Luke 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">luk 11:21</span></span>

When a strong man armed keepeth his (e) palace, his goods are in peace:

\(e\) The word properly signifies an open and empty room in front of a
house, and so in translation is taken for noblemen's houses.

[Luke 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">luk 11:23</span></span>

\(5\) He that is not with me is against me: and he that gathereth not
with me scattereth.

\(5\) Against indifferent men, and such as love to have a compromise,
who seek means to reconcile Christ and Satan together.

[Luke 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">luk 11:24</span></span>

\(6\) When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through
dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he saith, I will return unto
my house whence I came out.

\(6\) He that does not continue, but is in a worse case, than he that
never began.

[Luke 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">luk 11:27</span></span>

\(7\) And it came to pass, as he spake these things, a certain woman of
the company lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed \[is\] the
womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked.

\(7\) Christ does not seek praise for himself, but in our salvation.

[Luke 11:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">luk 11:33</span></span>

\(9\) No man, when he hath lighted a candle, putteth \[it\] in a secret
place, neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they which
come in may see the light.

\(9\) Our minds are therefore lightened with the knowledge of God, that
we should give light unto others, and therefore our main labour ought to
be to pray for that light.

[Luke 11:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">luk 11:37</span></span>

\(10\) And as he spake, a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with
him: and he went in, and sat down to meat.

\(10\) The service of God consists not in outward cleanliness and
planned rites or ceremonies, but in the spiritual righteousness of the
heart and charity.

[Luke 11:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">luk 11:41</span></span>

But rather give alms (f) of such things as ye have; and, behold, all
things are clean unto you.

\(f\) That is, according to your ability: as one would say, instead of
your extortion which hindered you so that you could not eat cleanly, use
charity, and in accordance with your ability be good to the poor, and in
this way will that which is within the platter be sanctified even though
the platter is unwashed.

[Luke 11:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">luk 11:42</span></span>

\(11\) But woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye (g) tithe mint and rue and
(h) all manner of herbs, and pass over (i) judgment and the love of God:
these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.

\(11\) It is the characteristic of hypocrites to stand firmly for little
trifles and to let greater matters pass.

\(g\) You decide by God's law that the tenth part is due to be paid.

\(h\) Of all types of herbs, some as Augustine expounds it in his
Enchiridion to Laurence, chap. 99, where he shows in like manner how
that place of Paul, (God "will have all men to be saved"), ([Ti1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#004)), is to be expounded after the
same manner.

\(i\) That is to say, that which is right and reasonable to do, for this
word "judgment" contains the commandments of the second table, and the
other words, "the love of God", contain the commandments of the first.

[Luke 11:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">luk 11:43</span></span>

\(12\) Woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye love the uppermost seats in the
synagogues, and greetings in the markets.

\(12\) Hypocrisy and ambition are commonly joined together.

[Luke 11:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">luk 11:44</span></span>

\(13\) Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are as
graves which appear not, and the men that walk over \[them\] are not
aware \[of them\].

\(13\) Hypocrites deceive men with an outward show.

[Luke 11:45](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#045)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">luk 11:45</span></span>

\(14\) Then answered one of the lawyers, and said unto him, Master, thus
saying thou reproachest us also.

\(14\) Hypocrites are very severe against other men, but think that all
things are lawful for themselves.

[Luke 11:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#047)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">luk 11:47</span></span>

\(15\) Woe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and
your fathers killed them.

\(15\) Hypocrites honour those saints when they are dead whom they
persecute most cruelly when they are alive.

[Luke 11:48](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#048)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">luk 11:48</span></span>

Truly (k) ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers: for
they indeed killed them, and ye build their sepulchres.

\(k\) When you persecute God's servants like mad men, even as your
fathers did, though you try and cover it with a pretence of godliness,
yet nonetheless, by beautifying the sepulchres of the prophets, what
else are you doing but glorying in your father's cruelty, and setting up
monuments (as it were) in glory and triumph of it?

[Luke 11:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#049)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">luk 11:49</span></span>

Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets and
apostles, and \[some\] of them they shall slay and (l) persecute:

\(l\) They will so vex them and trouble them, that at length they will
banish them.

[Luke 11:50](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#050)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">luk 11:50</span></span>

That the blood of all the prophets, which was (m) shed from the
foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;

\(m\) That you may be called to give an account for it, yea, and be
punished for the shedding of that blood of the prophets.

[Luke 11:52](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#052)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">luk 11:52</span></span>

\(16\) Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have (n) taken away the key of
knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in
ye hindered.

\(16\) Those who ought to be the door keepers of the Church have for a
long time mainly hindered the people from entering into the knowledge of
God.

\(n\) You have hidden and taken away, so that it cannot be found
anywhere.

[Luke 11:53](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#053)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">luk 11:53</span></span>

\(17\) And as he said these things unto them, the scribes and the
Pharisees began to urge \[him\] vehemently, and to (o) provoke him to
speak of many things:

\(17\) The more the world is reprehended, the worse it is, and yet we
must not betray the truth.

\(o\) They proposed many questions to him, to draw something out of his
mouth which they might traitorously find fault with.
