<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#001">2 Corinthians 9:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">co2 9:1</A></FONT></span></p>For (1) as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you: 
<p>
<p>(1) He wisely answers the suspicion which the Corinthians might conceive, as though the apostle in urging them so carefully was doubting of their good will. Therefore he witnesses that he does it not to teach them that they ought to help the saints, seeing that he had become surety for them to the Macedonians. But only to stir those up who were labouring by themselves, to the end that all things might both be in a better readiness, and also be more plentiful. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#004">2 Corinthians 9:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">co2 9:4</A></FONT></span></p>Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same (a) confident boasting. 
<p>
<p>(a) The word which he uses signifies a mind so steady and established that it cannot be moved by any terror or fear. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#005">2 Corinthians 9:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">co2 9:5</A></FONT></span></p>Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as [a matter of] bounty, and not as [of] (b) covetousness. 
<p>
<p>(b) As from covetous men. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#006">2 Corinthians 9:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">co2 9:6</A></FONT></span></p>(2) But this [I say], He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully. 
<p>
<p>(2) Alms must be given neither grudgingly, nor with a loathful mind, or sparingly. And a generous and free alms is compared to a sowing which has a most plentiful harvest of most abundant blessing following it. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#007">2 Corinthians 9:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">co2 9:7</A></FONT></span></p>Every man according as he (c) purposeth in his heart, [so let him give]; not (d) grudgingly, or of (e) necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver. 
<p>
<p>(c) Determines and appoints freely with himself. 
<p>
<p>(d) With a sparing and grudging heart. 
<p>
<p>(e) Against his will, not wanting to have evil spoken of him. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#008">2 Corinthians 9:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">co2 9:8</A></FONT></span></p>And God [is] able to make (f) all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all [things], may abound to (g) every good work: 
<p>
<p>(f) All the bountiful liberality of God. 
<p>
<p>(g) To help others by all means possible, in doing them good in their needs. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#009">2 Corinthians 9:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">co2 9:9</A></FONT></span></p>(As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the poor: his righteousness remaineth for (h) ever. 
<p>
<p>(h) Is everlasting: now David speaks of a man that fears God, and loves his neighbour, who will always be able (he says) to give to others. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#010">2 Corinthians 9:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">co2 9:10</A></FONT></span></p>Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for [your] food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the (i) fruits of your righteousness;) 
<p>
<p>(i) There is no inheritance as good to the godly as bountifulness is. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#012">2 Corinthians 9:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">co2 9:12</A></FONT></span></p>(3) For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God; 
<p>
<p>(3) Another excellent and double fruit of liberality towards the saints is this, that it gives occasion to praise God, and that our faith also is by it made manifest. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#013">2 Corinthians 9:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">co2 9:13</A></FONT></span></p>Whiles by the (k) experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your (l) professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and for [your] liberal distribution unto them, and unto all [men]; 
<p>
<p>(k) By this proof of your liberality in this helping of them. 
<p>
<p>(l) In showing with one consent that you acknowledge that Gospel alone which you have willingly submitted yourselves to, declaring by this that you agree with the church of Jerusalem. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#015">2 Corinthians 9:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">co2 9:15</A></FONT></span></p>(m) Thanks [be] unto God for his unspeakable gift. 
<p>
<p>(m) Lest by this great commendation and praise the Corinthians should be puffed up, he concludes this exhortation with this exclamation.
