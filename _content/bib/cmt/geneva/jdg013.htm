<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#002">Judges 13:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">jdg 13:2</A></FONT></span></p>And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name [was] Manoah; and his wife [was] (a) barren, and bare not. 
<p>
<p>(a) Signifying that their deliverance came only from God, and not by man's power.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#005">Judges 13:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">jdg 13:5</A></FONT></span></p>For, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come on his head: for the child shall be a (b) Nazarite unto God from the womb: and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines. 
<p>
<p>(b) Meaning he should be separate from the world, and dedicated to God.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#006">Judges 13:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">jdg 13:6</A></FONT></span></p>Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came unto me, and his countenance [was] like the countenance of an angel of God, very (c) terrible: but I asked him not whence he [was], neither told he me his name: 
<p>
<p>(c) If flesh is not able to endure the sight of an angel, how much less the presence of God?  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#008">Judges 13:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">jdg 13:8</A></FONT></span></p>Then Manoah (d) intreated the LORD, and said, O my Lord, let the man of God which thou didst send come again unto us, and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born. 
<p>
<p>(d) He shows himself ready to obey God's will, and therefore desires to know more.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#010">Judges 13:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">jdg 13:10</A></FONT></span></p>And the woman made haste, and ran, and shewed her husband, and said unto him, Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that came unto me the (e) [other] day. 
<p>
<p>(e) It seems that the angel appeared to her twice in one day.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#011">Judges 13:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">jdg 13:11</A></FONT></span></p>And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the (f) man, and said unto him, [Art] thou the man that spakest unto the woman? And he said, I [am]. 
<p>
<p>(f) He calls him man, because he so seemed, but he was Christ the eternal word, which at his appointed time became man.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#014">Judges 13:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">jdg 13:14</A></FONT></span></p>She may not eat of any [thing] that cometh of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any (g) unclean [thing]: all that I commanded her let her observe. 
<p>
<p>(g) Anything forbidden by the Law.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#016">Judges 13:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">jdg 13:16</A></FONT></span></p>And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread: and if thou wilt offer a burnt offering, thou must offer it unto the (h) LORD. For Manoah knew not that he [was] an angel of the LORD. 
<p>
<p>(h) Showing that he did not seek his own honour but God's, whose messenger he was.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#019">Judges 13:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">jdg 13:19</A></FONT></span></p>So Manoah took a kid with a meat offering, and offered [it] upon a rock unto the LORD: and [the angel] did (i) wondrously; and Manoah and his wife looked on. 
<p>
<p>(i) God sent fire from heaven to consume their sacrifice, to consume their faith in his promise.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#023">Judges 13:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">jdg 13:23</A></FONT></span></p>But his wife said unto him, If the LORD were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a (k) burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands, neither would he have shewed us all these [things], nor would as at this time have told us [such things] as these. 
<p>
<p>(k) These graces that we have received from God, and his accepting of our obedience, are sure tokens of his love for us, so that nothing can hurt us.
