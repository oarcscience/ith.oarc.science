<p>
<p>(a) For such is the inconstancy of the people, that for the most part they follow the vices of their governors. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#003">2 Chronicles 12:3</A></p>

<p>
<p>(b) Who were a people of Africa called the Troglodytes because they lived in holes.

<p>
<p>(c) Signifying that no calamity can come to us unless we forsake God, and that he never leaves us till we have cast him off.
