<p>
<p>(a) By this he signified both that he worshipped the true God, and that he kept in his heart the possession of that land from which need drove him at that time.

<p>
<p>(b) Conducting you by my power. 
<p>
<p>(c) In your posterity. 
<p>
<p>(d) Shall shut your eyes when you die: which belongs to him that was most dear or chief of the kindred.

<p>(e) He was not ashamed of his father and kindred, though they were of base condition.

<p>
<p>(f) God permits the world to hate his own, so they will forsake the filth of the world, and cling to him.
