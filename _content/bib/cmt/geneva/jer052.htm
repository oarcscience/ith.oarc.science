<p>
<p>(a) So the Lord punished sin by sin and gave him up to his rebellious heart, till he had brought the enemy on him to lead him away and his people.

<p>
<p>(d) In (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#008">Kg2 25:8</A>) is it called the seventh day, because the fire began then and so continued to the tenth.

<p>
<p>(g) Which were also made of brass, as in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#045">Kg1 7:45</A>).

<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#025">Jeremiah 52:25</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_025">jer 52:25</A></FONT></span></p>He took also out of the city an eunuch, who had the charge of the men of war; and (l) seven men of them that were near the king's person, who were found in the city; and the principal scribe of the host, who mustered the people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land, that were found in the midst of the city. 
<p>
<p>(l) In (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#019">Kg2 25:19</A>) is read but of five: those were the most excellent and the other two, which were not so noble are not there mentioned with them.

<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#029">Jeremiah 52:29</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_029">jer 52:29</A></FONT></span></p>In the (n) eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons:

<p>(n) To the latter end also of that year, and the beginning of the nineteenth.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#031">Jeremiah 52:31</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_031">jer 52:31</A></FONT></span></p>And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the five and twentieth [day] of the month, [that] Evilmerodach king of Babylon in the [first] year of his reign (o) lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him out of prison, 
<p>
<p>(o) That is, restored him to liberty and honour.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_033">jer 52:33</A></FONT></span></p>And changed his prison (p) garments: and he continually ate bread before him all the days of his life. 
<p>
<p>(p) And gave him princely apparel.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#034">Jeremiah 52:34</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_034">jer 52:34</A></FONT></span></p>And [for] his food, there was a (q) continual diet given him of the king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of his life. 
<p>
<p>(q) That is he had allowance in the court, and thus at length he had rest and quietness because he obeyed Jeremiah the Prophet, while the others were cruelly ordered that would not obey him.
