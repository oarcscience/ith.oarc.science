<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">deu 2:1</A></FONT></span></p>Then (a) we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as the LORD spake unto me: and we compassed mount Seir (b) many days. 
<p>
<p>(a) They obeyed, after God had chastised them. 
<p>
<p>(b) Eight and thirty years, as in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#014">Deu 2:14</A>).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">deu 2:4</A></FONT></span></p>And command thou the people, saying, Ye [are] to pass through the (c) coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore: 
<p>
<p>(c) This was the second time, before they had caused the Israelites to return, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#021">Num 20:21</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#007">Deuteronomy 2:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">deu 2:7</A></FONT></span></p>For the LORD thy God hath (d) blessed thee in all the works of thy hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years the LORD thy God [hath been] with thee; thou hast lacked nothing. 
<p>
<p>(d) And given you means, with which you may make recompence: also God will direct you by his providence, as he has done.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#009">Deuteronomy 2:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">deu 2:9</A></FONT></span></p>And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land [for] a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children (e) of Lot [for] a possession. 
<p>
<p>(e) Which were the Moabites and Ammonites.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">deu 2:14</A></FONT></span></p>And the (g) space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, [was] thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as the LORD sware unto them. 
<p>
<p>(g) He shows by this, that as God is true in his promise, so his threatenings are not in vain.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#015">Deuteronomy 2:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">deu 2:15</A></FONT></span></p>For indeed the (h) hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from among the host, until they were consumed. 
<p>
<p>(h) His plague and punishment to destroy all that were twenty years old and above.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#020">Deuteronomy 2:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">deu 2:20</A></FONT></span></p>(That also was accounted a land (i) of giants: giants dwelt therein in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims; 
<p>
<p>(i) Who called themselves Rephaims: that is, preservers, or physicians to heal and reform vices: but were indeed Zamzummims, that is, wicked and abominable.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">deu 2:24</A></FONT></span></p>Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the (k) Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess [it], and contend with him in battle. 
<p>
<p>(k) According to his promise made to Abraham, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#016">Gen 15:16</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#025">Deuteronomy 2:25</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_025">deu 2:25</A></FONT></span></p>This day will I (l) begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations [that are] under the whole heaven, who shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee. 
<p>
<p>(l) This declares that the hearts of men are in God's hands either to be made faint, or bold.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#029">Deuteronomy 2:29</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_029">deu 2:29</A></FONT></span></p>(As the (m) children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us. 
<p>
<p>(m) Because neither intreaty nor examples or others could move him, he could not complain of his just destruction.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#030">Deuteronomy 2:30</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_030">deu 2:30</A></FONT></span></p>But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the LORD thy God (n) hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as [appeareth] this day. 
<p>
<p>(n) God in his election and reprobation not only appoints the ends, but the means tending to the same.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#034">Deuteronomy 2:34</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_034">deu 2:34</A></FONT></span></p>And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the (o) women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain: 
<p>
<p>(o) God had cursed Canaan, and therefore he did not want any of the wicked race to be preserved.
