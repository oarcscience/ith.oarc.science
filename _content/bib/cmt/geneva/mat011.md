### [Matthew Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#001)

[Matthew 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 11:1</span></span>

And (1) it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of (a) commanding
his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to preach in (b)
their cities.

\(1\) Christ shows by his works that he is the promised Messiah.

\(a\) Of instructing them with precepts.

\(b\) The disciples' cities, that is to say, in Galilee, where many of
them were born; ([Act 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#007)).

[Matthew 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mat 11:7</span></span>

\(2\) And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes
concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed
shaken with the wind?

\(2\) The similarity and the difference between the ministry of the
prophets, the preaching of John, and the full light, of the gospel,
which Christ has brought.

[Matthew 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mat 11:11</span></span>

Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not
risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least
in the (c) kingdom of heaven is greater than he.

\(c\) In the new state of the Church where the true glory of God shines:
the people are not compared together, but the types of doctrines, the
preaching of John with the law and the prophets: and again, the most
clear preaching of the gospel is compared with John's.

[Matthew 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mat 11:13</span></span>

For all the prophets and the law (d) prophesied until John.

\(d\) They prophesied of things to come, which are now present, and
clearly and plainly seen.

[Matthew 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mat 11:16</span></span>

\(3\) But whereunto shall I liken this generation? (e) It is like unto
children sitting in the markets, and calling unto their fellows,

\(3\) There are none who are more stout and stubborn enemies of the
gospel, than they to whom it ought to be most acceptable.

\(e\) He blames the perverseness of this age, by a proverb, in that they
could be moved neither with rough nor gentle dealing.

[Matthew 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mat 11:19</span></span>

The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man
gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners. (4) But
(f) wisdom is justified of her children.

\(4\) That which the many refuse, the elect and chosen embrace.

\(f\) Wise men acknowledge the wisdom of the gospel when they receive
it.

[Matthew 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mat 11:20</span></span>

\(5\) Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty
works were done, because they repented not:

\(5\) The proud reject the gospel offered to them (to their great hurt
and pain) which leads to the salvation of the simple.

[Matthew 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mat 11:25</span></span>

At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of
heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and
prudent, and hast (g) revealed them unto babes.

\(g\) Through the ministry of Christ, who alone shows the truth of all
things pertaining to God.

[Matthew 11:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mat 11:26</span></span>

\(h\) Even so, Father: for so it seemed (i) good in thy sight.

\(h\) This word shows that he contents himself in his Father's council.

\(i\) God's will is the only rule of righteousness.

[Matthew 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mat 11:27</span></span>

\(6\) All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth
the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the
Son, and \[he\] to whomsoever the Son will reveal \[him\].

\(6\) There is no true knowledge of God, nor quietness of mind, but only
in Christ alone.

[Matthew 11:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">mat 11:30</span></span>

For my yoke \[is\] (k) easy, and my burden is light.

\(k\) May easily be carried. For his commandments are not grievous, for
all who are born of God overcome the world; ([Jo1
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#004)).
