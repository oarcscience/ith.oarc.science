### [Genesis Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#001)

[Genesis 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 22:2</span></span>

And he said, Take now thy son, thine only \[son\] Isaac, whom thou
lovest, and get thee into the land of (a) Moriah; and (b) offer him
there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell
thee of.

\(a\) Signifying the fear of God, in which place he was also honoured,
Solomon later building the temple there.

\(b\) This was the main point of his temptation, seeing that he was
commanded to offer up him in whom God had promised to bless all the
nations of the world.

[Genesis 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 22:5</span></span>

And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I
and the lad will go yonder and worship, and (e) come again to you.

\(e\) He did not doubt that God would accomplish his promise, even if he
should sacrifice his son.

[Genesis 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 22:8</span></span>

And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a (d)
burnt offering: so they went both of them together.

\(d\) The only way to overcome all temptation is to rest on God's
providence.

[Genesis 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 22:9</span></span>

And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built
an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and (e) bound Isaac his son,
and laid him on the altar upon the wood.

\(e\) For it is likely that his father had told him God's commandment,
to which he showed himself obedient.

[Genesis 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gen 22:12</span></span>

And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing
unto him: for now I (f) know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not
withheld thy son, thine only \[son\] from me.

\(f\) That is, by your true obedience you have declared your living
faith.

[Genesis 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gen 22:14</span></span>

And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is said
\[to\] this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall (g) be seen.

\(g\) The name is changed to show that God both sees and provides
secretly for his and also evidently is seen, and felt in the right time.

[Genesis 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gen 22:16</span></span>

And said, By (h) myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because thou
hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only \[son\]:

\(h\) Signifying, that there is none greater then he.

[Genesis 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">gen 22:24</span></span>

And his (i) concubine, whose name \[was\] Reumah, she bare also Tebah,
and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.

\(i\) Concubine is often used to refer to those women who were inferior
to the wives.
