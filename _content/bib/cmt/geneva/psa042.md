### [Psalms Chapter 42](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001)

[Psalms 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 42:1</span></span>

"To the chief Musician, Maschil, (a) for the sons of Korah." As the hart
(b) panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O
God.

\(a\) As a treasure to be kept by them, who were of the number of the
Levites.

\(b\) By these comparisons of the thirst and panting, he shows his
fervent desire to serve God in his temple.

[Psalms 42:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 42:3</span></span>

\(c\) My tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually
say unto me, Where \[is\] thy God?

\(c\) As others take pleasure in eating and drinking, so he was
altogether given to weeping.

[Psalms 42:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 42:4</span></span>

When I remember (d) these \[things\], I pour out my soul in me: for I
had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God, with
the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holyday.

\(d\) That is, how I led the people to serve you in your tabernacle, and
now seeing my contrary estate, I die for sorrow.

[Psalms 42:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 42:5</span></span>

Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and \[why\] art thou disquieted in
me? (e) hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him \[for\] the help of
his countenance.

\(e\) Though he sustained grievous assaults of the flesh to cast him
into despair, yet his faith grounded on God's accustomed mercies gets
the victory.

[Psalms 42:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 42:6</span></span>

O my God, my soul is cast down within me: (f) therefore will I remember
thee from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites, from the hill
Mizar.

\(f\) That is, when I remember you in this land of my banishment among
the mountains.

[Psalms 42:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 42:7</span></span>

\(g\) Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts: all thy
waves and thy billows are gone over me.

\(g\) Afflictions came so thick upon me that I felt overwhelmed: by
which he shows there is no end to our misery till God is pacified and
sends help.

[Psalms 42:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 42:8</span></span>

\[Yet\] the LORD (h) will command his lovingkindness in the daytime, and
in the night his song \[shall be\] with me, \[and\] my prayer unto the
God of my life.

\(h\) He assures himself of God's help in time to come.

[Psalms 42:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 42:10</span></span>

\[As\] with a sword in my (i) bones, mine enemies reproach me; while
they say daily unto me, Where \[is\] thy God?

\(i\) That is, I am most grievously tormented.

[Psalms 42:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 42:11</span></span>

\(k\) Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted
within me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him, \[who is\] the
health of my countenance, and my God.

\(k\) This repetition declares that David did not overcome at once, to
teach us to be constant, for as much as God will certainly deliver his.
