<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#001">Proverbs 17:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">pro 17:1</A></FONT></span></p>Better [is] a dry morsel, and quietness with it, than an house full of (a) sacrifices [with] strife. 
<p>
<p>(a) For where there were many sacrifices, there were many portions given to the people, with which they feasted.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#002">Proverbs 17:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">pro 17:2</A></FONT></span></p>A wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame, and shall have part of the (b) inheritance among the brethren. 
<p>
<p>(b) That is, will be made governor over the children.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#008">Proverbs 17:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">pro 17:8</A></FONT></span></p>A bribe [is as] a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it: wherever it (c) turneth, it prospereth. 
<p>
<p>(c) The reward has great force to gain the hearts of men.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#009">Proverbs 17:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">pro 17:9</A></FONT></span></p>He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that repeateth a matter separateth [very] (d) friends. 
<p>
<p>(d) He that admonishes the prince of his fault makes him his enemy.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#011">Proverbs 17:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">pro 17:11</A></FONT></span></p>An evil [man] seeketh only rebellion: therefore a cruel (e) messenger shall be sent against him. 
<p>
<p>(e) By the messenger is meant such means as God uses to punish the rebels.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#012">Proverbs 17:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">pro 17:12</A></FONT></span></p>Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than (f) a fool in his folly. 
<p>
<p>(f) By which he means the wicked in his rage, who has no fear of God.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#016">Proverbs 17:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">pro 17:16</A></FONT></span></p>Why [is there] a (g) price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom, seeing [he hath] no heart [to it]? 
<p>
<p>(g) What good does it do the wicked to be rich, seeing he does not set his mind to wisdom?  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#017">Proverbs 17:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">pro 17:17</A></FONT></span></p>A friend loveth at all times, and a (h) brother is born for adversity. 
<p>
<p>(h) So that he is more than a friend, even a brother that helps in time of adversity.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#018">Proverbs 17:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">pro 17:18</A></FONT></span></p>A man void of understanding (i) striketh hands, [and] becometh surety in the presence of his friend. 
<p>
<p>(i) Read (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#001">Pro 6:1</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#019">Proverbs 17:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">pro 17:19</A></FONT></span></p>He loveth transgression that loveth strife: [and] he that exalteth his (k) gate seeketh destruction. 
<p>
<p>(k) Lifts up himself above his degree.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#023">Proverbs 17:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">pro 17:23</A></FONT></span></p>A wicked [man] taketh a bribe out of the (l) bosom to pervert the ways of judgment. 
<p>
<p>(l) That is, secretly and out of the bosom of the rich.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#024">Proverbs 17:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">pro 17:24</A></FONT></span></p>Wisdom [is] before him that hath understanding; but the eyes of a fool [are] in the (m) ends of the earth. 
<p>
<p>(m) That is, wander to and fro, and seek not after wisdom.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#026">Proverbs 17:26</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_026">pro 17:26</A></FONT></span></p>Also to punish the just [is] not good, [nor] to strike princes (n) for equity. 
<p>
<p>(n) For their well doing.
