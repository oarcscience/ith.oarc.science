<p>
<p>(a) When he called him up to the mountain to give him the laws, beginning at the 20th chapter till now.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#003">Exodus 24:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">exo 24:3</A></FONT></span></p>(b) And Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD, and all the judgments: and all the people answered with one voice, and said, All the words which the LORD hath said will we do. 
<p>
<p>(b) When he had received these laws in mount Sinai.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#005">Exodus 24:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">exo 24:5</A></FONT></span></p>And he sent young (c) men of the children of Israel, which offered burnt offerings, and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto the LORD. 
<p>
<p>(c) For as yet the priesthood was not given to Levi.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#008">Exodus 24:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">exo 24:8</A></FONT></span></p>And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled [it] on the people, and said, Behold the (d) blood of the covenant, which the LORD hath made with you concerning all these words. 
<p>
<p>(d) Which signifies that the covenant broken cannot be satisfied without shedding of blood.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#010">Exodus 24:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">exo 24:10</A></FONT></span></p>And they (e) saw the God of Israel: and [there was] under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in [his] clearness. 
<p>
<p>(e) As perfectly as their infirmities could behold his majesty.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#011">Exodus 24:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">exo 24:11</A></FONT></span></p>And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he (f) laid not his hand: also they saw God, and (g) did eat and drink. 
<p>
<p>(f) He did not make them afraid, nor punish them. 
<p>
<p>(g) That is, rejoiced.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#012">Exodus 24:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">exo 24:12</A></FONT></span></p>And the LORD (h) said unto Moses, Come up to me into the mount, and be there: and I will give thee (i) tables of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have written; that thou mayest teach (k) them. 
<p>
<p>(h) The second time. 
<p>
<p>(i) Signifying the hardness of our hearts, unless God writes his laws in it by his Spirit, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#033">Jer 31:33</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#019">Eze 11:19</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#003">Co2 3:3</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#010">Heb 8:10</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#016">Heb 10:16</A>) 
<p>
<p>(k) That is, the people.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">exo 24:17</A></FONT></span></p>And the sight of the glory of the LORD [was] like (l) devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel. 
<p>
<p>(l) The Lord appears like devouring fire to carnal men: but to them that he draws with his Spirit, he is like pleasant sapphire.
