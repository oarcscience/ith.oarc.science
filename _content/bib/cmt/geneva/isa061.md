### [Isaiah Chapter 61](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001)

[Isaiah 61:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 61:1</span></span>

The Spirit of the Lord GOD \[is\] (a) upon me; because the LORD hath
anointed me to preach good tidings to the meek; he hath sent me to bind
up the (b) brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the (c) captives, and
the opening of the prison to \[them that are\] bound;

\(a\) Thus belongs to all the prophets and ministers of God, but chiefly
to Christ, of whose abundant graces everyone receives according as it
pleases him to distribute.

\(b\) To them that are lively touched with the feeling of their sins.

\(c\) Who are in the bondage of sin.

[Isaiah 61:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 61:2</span></span>

To proclaim the (d) acceptable year of the LORD, and the day of (e)
vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn;

\(d\) The time when it pleased God to show his good favour to man, which
Paul calls the fulness of time, ([Gal
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#004)).

\(e\) For when God delivers his Church, he punishes his enemies.

[Isaiah 61:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 61:3</span></span>

To appoint to them that mourn in Zion, to give to them beauty for (f)
ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit
of heaviness; that they may be called (g) trees of righteousness, the
planting of the LORD, that he may be glorified.

\(f\) Which was the sign of mourning.

\(g\) Trees that bring forth good fruits, as in ([Mat
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#008)).

[Isaiah 61:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 61:4</span></span>

And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former
desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of
many (h) generations.

\(h\) That is, for a long time.

[Isaiah 61:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 61:5</span></span>

And foreigners shall (i) stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of the
alien \[shall be\] your plowmen and your vinedressers.

\(i\) They will be ready to serve you in all your needs.

[Isaiah 61:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 61:6</span></span>

But ye shall be named the (k) Priests of the LORD: \[men\] shall call
you the Ministers of our God: ye shall eat the (l) riches of the
Gentiles, and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves.

\(k\) This is accomplished in the time of Christ, by whom all the
faithful are made priests and kings, ([Pe1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009); [Rev
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006), [Rev
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#010)).

\(l\) Read ([Isa 60:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#011), [Isa
60:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#016)).

[Isaiah 61:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 61:7</span></span>

For your shame \[ye shall have\] (m) double; and \[for\] confusion (n)
they shall rejoice in (o) their portion: therefore in their land they
shall possess the (p) double: everlasting joy shall be to them.

\(m\) Abundant recompence as this word is used, ([Isa
40:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#002)).

\(n\) That is, the Jews.

\(o\) That is, of the Gentiles.

\(p\) While the Gentiles had dominion over the Jews in times past, now
they will have double authority over them and possess twice as much.

[Isaiah 61:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 61:8</span></span>

For I the LORD love judgment, I hate (q) robbery for burnt offering; and
I will direct their work in truth, and I will make an everlasting
covenant with them.

\(q\) I will not receive their offerings who are extortioners,
deceivers, hypocrites or that deprive me of my glory.

[Isaiah 61:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 61:9</span></span>

And (r) their seed shall be known among the Gentiles, and their
offspring among the people: all that see them shall acknowledge them,
that they \[are\] the seed \[which\] the LORD hath blessed.

\(r\) That is, of the Church.

[Isaiah 61:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 61:10</span></span>

\(s\) I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in my
God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath
covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh
\[himself\] with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth \[herself\] with her
jewels.

\(s\) He shows what will be the affection, when they feel their
deliverance.
