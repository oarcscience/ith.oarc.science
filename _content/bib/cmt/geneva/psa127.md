### [Psalms Chapter 127](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#001)

[Psalms 127:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 127:1</span></span>

"A Song of degrees for Solomon." Except the LORD (a) build the house,
they labour in vain that build it: except the LORD keep the (b) city,
the watchman waketh \[but\] in vain.

\(a\) That is, govern and dispose all things pertaining to the family.

\(b\) The public estate of the commonwealth.

[Psalms 127:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 127:2</span></span>

\[It is\] vain for (c) you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the
bread (d) of sorrows: \[for\] so he giveth his beloved (e) sleep.

\(c\) Who watch and ward and are also magistrates and rulers of the
city.

\(d\) Either that which is gained by hard labour, or eaten with grief of
mind.

\(e\) Not exempting them from labour, but making their labours
comfortable and as it were a rest.

[Psalms 127:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 127:4</span></span>

As arrows \[are\] in the hand of a mighty man; so \[are\] (f) children
of the youth.

\(f\) That is, endued with strength and virtues from God: for these are
signs of God's blessings, and not the number.

[Psalms 127:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 127:5</span></span>

Happy \[is\] the man that hath his quiver full of them: they (g) shall
not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.

\(g\) Such children will be able to stop their adversaries mouths, when
their godly life is maliciously accused before judges.
