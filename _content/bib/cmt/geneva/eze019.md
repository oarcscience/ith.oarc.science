### [Ezekiel Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#001)

[Ezekiel 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 19:1</span></span>

Moreover take thou up a lamentation for the (a) princes of Israel,

\(a\) That is, Jehoahaz and Jehoiakim, Josiah's sons, who for their
pride and cruelty are compared to lions.

[Ezekiel 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 19:2</span></span>

And say, What \[is\] thy (b) mother? A lioness: she lay down among
lions, she nourished her whelps among young lions.

\(b\) That is Jehoahaz's mother, or Jerusalem.

[Ezekiel 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 19:4</span></span>

The (c) nations also heard of him; he was taken in their pit, and they
brought him with chains to the land of Egypt.

\(c\) By Pharaoh Nebo king of Egypt, ([Kg2
23:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#033)).

[Ezekiel 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 19:5</span></span>

Now when she saw that she had waited, \[and\] her hope was lost, then
she took another of her (d) whelps, \[and\] made him a young lion.

\(d\) Which was Jehoiakim.

[Ezekiel 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 19:6</span></span>

And he went up and down among the lions, he became a young lion, and
learned to catch the prey, \[and\] devoured (e) men.

\(e\) He slew the prophets and them that feared God and ravished their
wives.

[Ezekiel 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 19:8</span></span>

Then the (f) nations set against him on every side from the provinces,
and spread their net over him: he was taken in their pit.

\(f\) Nebuchadnezzar with his great army which was gathered from various
nations.

[Ezekiel 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 19:10</span></span>

Thy (g) mother \[is\] like a vine in thy blood, planted by the waters:
she was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters.

\(g\) He speaks this in the reproach of this wicked king, in whose
blood, that is in the race of his predecessors, Jerusalem would have
been blessed according to God's promise and flourished as a fruitful
vine.

[Ezekiel 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 19:12</span></span>

But she was plucked up in fury, she was cast down to the ground, and the
(h) east wind dried up her fruit: her strong rods were broken and
withered; the fire consumed them.

\(h\) Meaning, that the Chaldeans would destroy them as the east wind
does the fruit of the vine.

[Ezekiel 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 19:14</span></span>

And fire hath gone out (i) of a rod of her branches, \[which\] hath
devoured her fruit, so that she hath no strong rod \[to be\] a sceptre
to rule. This \[is\] a lamentation, and shall be for a lamentation.

\(i\) Destruction is come by Zedekiah, who was the opportunity for this
rebellion.
