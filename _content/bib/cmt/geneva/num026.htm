<p>
<p>(a) Which came because of their whoredom and idolatry.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#003">Numbers 26:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">num 26:3</A></FONT></span></p>And Moses and Eleazar the priest spake with them in the plains of Moab by Jordan (b) [near] Jericho, saying, 
<p>
<p>(b) Where the river is near to Jericho.

This [is that] Dathan and Abiram, [which were] famous in the congregation, who strove against Moses and against Aaron in the (c) company of Korah, when they strove against the LORD: 
<p>
<p>(c) In that rebellion of which Korah was head.

<p>
<p>(d) That is, as an example that others should not complain and rebel against God's ministers.

<p>
<p>(e) Before Jacob went into Egypt, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#003">Gen 38:3</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#007">Gen 38:7</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#010">Gen 38:10</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#012">Gen 46:12</A>).
