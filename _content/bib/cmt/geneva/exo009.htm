<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#004">Exodus 9:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">exo 9:4</A></FONT></span></p>And the LORD shall (a) sever between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt: and there shall nothing die of all [that is] the children's of Israel. 
<p>
<p>(a) He will declare his heavenly judgment against his enemies, and his favour toward his children.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#007">Exodus 9:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">exo 9:7</A></FONT></span></p>And Pharaoh (b) sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go. 
<p>
<p>(b) Into the land of Goshen, where the Israelites lived.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#014">Exodus 9:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">exo 9:14</A></FONT></span></p>For I will at this time send all my plagues upon (c) thine heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that [there is] none like me in all the earth. 
<p>
<p>(c) So that your own conscience will condemn you of ingratitude and malice.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#016">Exodus 9:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">exo 9:16</A></FONT></span></p>And in very deed for this [cause] have I raised thee up, for to shew [in] thee my power; and that my (d) name may be declared throughout all the earth. 
<p>
<p>(d) That is, that all the world may magnify my power in overcoming you.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#019">Exodus 9:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">exo 9:19</A></FONT></span></p>Send therefore now, [and] (e) gather thy cattle, and all that thou hast in the field; [for upon] every man and beast which shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die. 
<p>
<p>(e) Here we see though God's wrath is kindled yet there is a certain mercy shown even to his enemies.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#021">Exodus 9:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">exo 9:21</A></FONT></span></p>And he that regarded not the (f) word of the LORD left his servants and his cattle in the field. 
<p>
<p>(f) The word of the minister is called the word of God.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#027">Exodus 9:27</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_027">exo 9:27</A></FONT></span></p>And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them, I (g) have sinned this time: the LORD [is] righteous, and I and my people [are] wicked. 
<p>
<p>(g) The wicked confess their sins to their condemnation, but they cannot believe to obtain remission.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#030">Exodus 9:30</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_030">exo 9:30</A></FONT></span></p>But as for thee and thy servants, (h) I know that ye will not yet fear the LORD God. 
<p>
<p>(h) Meaning that when they have their request, they are never better off, even though they make many fair promises, in which we see the practices of the wicked.
