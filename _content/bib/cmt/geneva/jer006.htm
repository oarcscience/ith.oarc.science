<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#001">Jeremiah 6:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">jer 6:1</A></FONT></span></p>O ye children of (a) Benjamin, gather yourselves to flee out of the midst of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in (b) Tekoa, and set up a sign of fire in (c) Bethhaccerem: for evil appeareth out of the north, and great destruction. 
<p>
<p>(a) He speaks to them chiefly because they should take heed by the example of their brethren the other half of their tribe, who were now carried away prisoners. 
<p>
<p>(b) Which was a city in Judah, six miles from Bethlehem, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#006">Ch2 11:6</A>). 
<p>
<p>(c) Read (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#014">Neh 3:14</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#002">Jeremiah 6:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">jer 6:2</A></FONT></span></p>I have likened the daughter of Zion to (d) a comely and delicate [woman]. 
<p>
<p>(d) I have intreated her gently, and given her abundance of all things.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#003">Jeremiah 6:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">jer 6:3</A></FONT></span></p>The shepherds with their flocks (e) shall come to her; they shall pitch [their] tents against her on every side; they shall feed every one in his place. 
<p>
<p>(e) She will be so destroyed that the sheep may be fed in her.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#004">Jeremiah 6:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">jer 6:4</A></FONT></span></p>(f) Prepare ye war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe to us! for the day departeth, for the shadows of the evening are lengthened. 
<p>
<p>(f) He speaks this in the person of the Babylonians, who complain that the time fails them before they have brought their enterprises to pass.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#007">Jeremiah 6:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">jer 6:7</A></FONT></span></p>As a fountain casteth out her waters, so she casteth out her wickedness: (g) violence and destruction is heard in her; before me continually [are] grief and wounds. 
<p>
<p>(g) He shows the reason why it would be destroyed, and how it comes from themselves.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#008">Jeremiah 6:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">jer 6:8</A></FONT></span></p>Be thou instructed, O (h) Jerusalem, lest my soul depart from thee; lest I make thee desolate, a land not inhabited. 
<p>
<p>(h) He warns them to amend by his correction, and turn to him by repentance.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#009">Jeremiah 6:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">jer 6:9</A></FONT></span></p>Thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine: turn (i) back thy hand as a grapegatherer into the baskets. 
<p>
<p>(i) He exhorts the Babylonians to be diligent to search out all and to leave none.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#010">Jeremiah 6:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">jer 6:10</A></FONT></span></p>To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear? behold, their ear [is] (k) uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken: behold, the word of the LORD is to them a reproach; they have no delight in it. 
<p>
<p>(k) They delight to hear vain things, and to shut up their ears to true doctrine.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#011">Jeremiah 6:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">jer 6:11</A></FONT></span></p>Therefore I am full of the fury of the LORD; I am weary with holding in: (l) I will pour it out upon the (m) children abroad, and upon the assembly of young men together: for even the husband with the wife shall be taken, the aged with [him that is] full of days. 
<p>
<p>(l) As the Lord had given him his word to be as a fire of his indignation to burn the wicked, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#014">Jer 5:14</A>) so he kindles it now when he sees that all remedies are past. 
<p>
<p>(m) No one will be spared.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#014">Jeremiah 6:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">jer 6:14</A></FONT></span></p>They have healed also the hurt [of the daughter] of my people slightly, saying, (n) Peace, peace; when [there is] no peace. 
<p>
<p>(n) When the people began to fear God's judgments, the false prophets comforted them by flatterings, showing that God would send peace and not war.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#016">Jeremiah 6:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">jer 6:16</A></FONT></span></p>Thus saith the LORD, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the (o) old paths, where [is] the good way, and walk in it, and ye shall find rest for your souls. But they said, We will not walk [in it]. 
<p>
<p>(o) In which the patriarchs and prophets walked, directed by the word of God: signifying that there is no true way, but that which God prescribes.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#017">Jeremiah 6:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">jer 6:17</A></FONT></span></p>Also I set (p) watchmen over you, [saying], Hearken to the sound of the trumpet. But they said, We will not hearken. 
<p>
<p>(p) Prophets who would warn you of the dangers that were at hand.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#018">Jeremiah 6:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">jer 6:18</A></FONT></span></p>Therefore hear, ye (q) nations, and know, O congregation, what [is] among them. 
<p>
<p>(q) God takes all the world to witness and the insensible creatures of the ingratitude of the Jews.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#020">Jeremiah 6:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">jer 6:20</A></FONT></span></p>To what purpose cometh there to me (r) incense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a distant country? your burnt offerings [are] not acceptable, nor your sacrifices sweet to me. 
<p>
<p>(r) Read (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#011">Isa 1:11</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#021">Amo 5:21</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#022">Jeremiah 6:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">jer 6:22</A></FONT></span></p>Thus saith the LORD, Behold, a people cometh from the (s) north country, and a great nation shall be raised from the sides of the earth. 
<p>
<p>(s) From Babylon by Dan, which was north of Jerusalem.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#024">Jeremiah 6:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">jer 6:24</A></FONT></span></p>We have heard the report of it: our hands become (t) feeble: anguish hath taken hold of us, [and] pain, as of a woman in travail. 
<p>
<p>(t) For fear of the enemy: he speaks this in the person of the Jews.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#027">Jeremiah 6:27</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_027">jer 6:27</A></FONT></span></p>I have set (u) thee [for] a tower [and] a fortress among my people, that thou mayest know and try their way. 
<p>
<p>(u) Meaning, Jeremiah, whom God had appointed to try out the godly from the wicked, as a founder does the pure metal from the dross.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#029">Jeremiah 6:29</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_029">jer 6:29</A></FONT></span></p>The (x) bellows is burned, the lead is consumed by the fire; the founder melteth in vain: for the wicked are not plucked away. 
<p>
<p>(x) All the pain and labour that has been taken with them is lost.
