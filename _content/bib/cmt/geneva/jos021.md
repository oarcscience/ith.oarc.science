And unto the families of the children of Merari, the (l) rest of the
Levites, out of the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam with her suburbs, and

of Israel \[were\] forty and eight cities with their suburbs.

\(n\) Thus according to Jacob's prophecy they were scattered throughout
the country, which God used so that his people might be instructed in
the true religion by them.
