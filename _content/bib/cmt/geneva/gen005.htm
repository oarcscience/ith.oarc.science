<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#001">Genesis 5:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">gen 5:1</A></FONT></span></p>This [is] the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, in the (a) likeness of God made he him; 
<p>
<p>(a) Read (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#026">Gen 1:26</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#002">Genesis 5:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">gen 5:2</A></FONT></span></p>Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their name (b) Adam, in the day when they were created. 
<p>
<p>(b) By giving them both one name, he notes the inseparable conjunction of man and wife.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#003">Genesis 5:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">gen 5:3</A></FONT></span></p>And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat [a son] in his own (c) likeness, after his image; and called his name Seth: 
<p>
<p>(c) As well, concerning his creation, as his corruption.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#006">Genesis 5:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">gen 5:6</A></FONT></span></p>And (d) Seth lived an hundred and five years, and begat Enos: 
<p>
<p>(d) He proves Adam's generation by those who came from Seth, to show the true Church, and also what care God had over the same from the beginning, in that he continued his graces toward it by a continual succession.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#008">Genesis 5:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">gen 5:8</A></FONT></span></p>And all the days of Seth were (e) nine hundred and twelve years: and he died. 
<p>
<p>(e) The main reason for long life in the first age, was the multiplication of mankind, that according to God's commandment at the beginning the world might be filled with people, who would universally praise him.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#022">Genesis 5:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">gen 5:22</A></FONT></span></p>And Enoch (f) walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years, and begat sons and daughters: 
<p>
<p>(f) That is, he led an upright and godly life.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#024">Genesis 5:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">gen 5:24</A></FONT></span></p>And Enoch walked with God: and he [was] not; for (g) God took him. 
<p>
<p>(g) To show that there was a better life prepared and to be a testimony of the immortality of souls and bodies. To inquire where he went is mere curiosity.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#029">Genesis 5:29</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_029">gen 5:29</A></FONT></span></p>And he called his name Noah, saying, This [same] shall (h) comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the ground which the LORD hath cursed. 
<p>
<p>(h) Lamech had respect for the promise, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#015">Gen 3:15</A>), and desired to see the deliverer who would be sent and yet saw but a figure of it. He spoke this by the spirit of prophecy because Noah delivered the Church and preserved it by his obedience.
