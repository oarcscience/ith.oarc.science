<p>
<p>(c) For a final price, or good cheap.

<p>
<p>(d) For the greedy lust of flesh.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">num 11:7</A></FONT></span></p>And the manna [was] as coriander seed, and the colour thereof as the colour of (e) bdellium.

<p>
<p>(f) Or, how have I displeased you?

<p>(g) Am I their father, that no one may have charge of them but I?

<p>
<p>(i) I would rather die than see my grief and misery daily increased by their rebellion.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">num 11:17</A></FONT></span></p>And I will come down and talk with thee there: (k) and I will take of the spirit which [is] upon thee, and will put [it] upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear [it] not thyself alone. 
<p>
<p>(k) I will distribute my spirit among them, as I have done to you.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">num 11:18</A></FONT></span></p>And say thou unto the people, (l) Sanctify yourselves against to morrow, and ye shall eat flesh: for ye have wept in the ears of the LORD, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for [it was] well with us in Egypt: therefore the LORD will give you flesh, and ye shall eat. 
<p>
<p>(l) Prepare yourselves that you may be clean.

<p>
<p>(m) Or, cast him off, because you refused manna, which he appointed as most suitable for you. 
<p>
<p>(n) Who leads and governs you.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">num 11:21</A></FONT></span></p>And Moses said, The people, (o) among whom I [am], [are] six hundred thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month. 
<p>
<p>(o) Of whom I have charge.

<p>
<p>(p) From that day the spirit of prophecy did not settle them.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_028">num 11:28</A></FONT></span></p>And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, [one] of his (q) young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, (r) forbid them. 
<p>
<p>(q) Or, a young man whom he had chosen from his youth. 
<p>
<p>(r) Such blind zeal was in the apostles, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#038">Mar 9:38</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#044">Luk 9:44</A>).

<p>(s) Of Homer, read (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#016">Lev 27:16</A>) also it signifies a heap, as in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#014">Exo 8:14</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#016">Jdg 15:16</A>).
