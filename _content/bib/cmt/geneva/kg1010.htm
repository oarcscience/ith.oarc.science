<p>
<p>(a) Josephus says that she was Queen of Ethiopia, and that Sheba was the name of the chief city of Meroe, which is an island of the Nile.

<p>
<p>(b) That is, the whole order, and trade of his house.

<p>
<p>(d) It is a chief sign of God's favour, when godly and wise rulers fit in the throne of justice. 
<p>
<p>(e) This is the reason kings are appointed.

<p>
<p>(g) As the chair bows, or places to lean upon.
