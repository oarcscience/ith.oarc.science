### [Joshua Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#001)

[Joshua 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jos 14:3</span></span>

For Moses had given the inheritance of (a) two tribes and an half tribe
on the other side Jordan: but unto the Levites he gave none inheritance
among them.

\(a\) As Reuben and Gad and half the tribe of Manasseh, ([Num
32:33](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#033)).

[Joshua 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jos 14:4</span></span>

For the children of Joseph were (b) two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim:
therefore they gave no part unto the Levites in the land, save cities to
dwell \[in\], with their suburbs for their cattle and for their
substance.

\(b\) So though Levi lacked, yet were there still twelve tribes by this
means.

[Joshua 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jos 14:6</span></span>

Then the children of Judah came unto Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the son
of Jephunneh the Kenezite said unto him, Thou knowest the thing that the
LORD said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and (c) thee in
Kadeshbarnea.

\(c\) Which was that only those two should enter into the land, ([Num
14:24](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#024)).

[Joshua 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jos 14:8</span></span>

Nevertheless my (d) brethren that went up with me made the heart of the
people melt: but I wholly followed the LORD my God.

\(d\) Which were the ten other spies.

[Joshua 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jos 14:12</span></span>

Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the LORD spake in that day;
for thou heardest in that day how the Anakims \[were\] there, and
\[that\] the cities \[were\] great \[and\] fenced: (e) if so be the LORD
\[will be\] with me, then I shall be able to drive them out, as the LORD
said.

\(e\) This he spoke out of modesty, and not from doubting.

[Joshua 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jos 14:15</span></span>

And the name of Hebron before \[was\] Kirjatharba; \[which Arba was\] a
(f) great man among the Anakims. And the land had rest from war.

\(f\) Either for his power or person.
