### [Hosea Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#001)

[Hosea 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hos 14:1</span></span>

O Israel, (a) return unto the LORD thy God; for thou hast fallen by
thine iniquity.

\(a\) He exhorts them to repentance to avoid all these plagues,
exhorting them to declare by words their obedience and repentance.

[Hosea 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">hos 14:2</span></span>

Take with you words, and turn to the LORD: say unto him, (b) Take away
all iniquity, and receive \[us\] graciously: so will we render the
calves of our (c) lips.

\(b\) He shows them that they ought to confess their sins.

\(c\) Declaring that this is the true sacrifice that the faithful can
offer, even thanks and praise; ([Heb
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#015)).

[Hosea 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">hos 14:3</span></span>

Asshur shall (d) not save us; we will not ride upon horses: neither will
we say any more to the work of our hands, \[Ye are\] our gods: for in
thee the fatherless findeth mercy.

\(d\) We will forsake all vain confidence and pride.

[Hosea 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hos 14:4</span></span>

\(e\) I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely: for mine
anger is turned away from him.

\(e\) He declares how ready God is to receive those that do repent.

[Hosea 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">hos 14:7</span></span>

They that dwell under his (f) shadow shall return; they shall revive
\[as\] the corn, and grow as the vine: the scent thereof \[shall be\] as
the wine of Lebanon.

\(f\) Whoever unites themselves to this people will be blessed.

[Hosea 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">hos 14:8</span></span>

Ephraim \[shall say\], What have I to do any more with idols? I (g) have
heard \[him\], and observed him: I \[am\] like a green fir tree. From me
is thy fruit found.

\(g\) God shows how prompt he is to hear his own when they repent, and
to offer himself as a protection and safeguard for them, as a most
sufficient fruit and benefit.

[Hosea 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">hos 14:9</span></span>

Who \[is\] (h) wise, and he shall understand these \[things\]? prudent,
and he shall know them? for the ways of the LORD \[are\] right, and the
just shall walk in them: but the transgressors shall fall therein.

\(h\) Signifying that the true wisdom and knowledge consists in this,
even to rest upon God.
