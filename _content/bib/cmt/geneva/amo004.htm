<p>
<p>(a) Thus he calls the princes and governors, who being overwhelmed with the great abundance of God's benefits, forgot God, and therefore he calls them by the name of beasts and not of men. 
<p>
<p>(b) They encourage those who have authority over the people to oppress them, so that they may have profit by it.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#002">Amos 4:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">amo 4:2</A></FONT></span></p>The Lord GOD hath sworn by his holiness, that, lo, the days shall come upon you, that he will take you away with (c) hooks, and your posterity with fishhooks. 
<p>
<p>(c) He alludes to fishers, who catch fish by hooks or thorns.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#004">Amos 4:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">amo 4:4</A></FONT></span></p>Come to (d) Bethel, and transgress; at Gilgal multiply transgression; and bring your sacrifices every morning, [and] your tithes after three (e) years: 
<p>
<p>(d) He speaks this in contempt of those who resorted to those places, thinking that their great devotion and good intention was sufficient to have bound God to them. 
<p>
<p>(e) Read (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#028">Deu 14:28</A>).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">amo 4:5</A></FONT></span></p>And offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving (f) with leaven, and proclaim [and] publish the free offerings: for this (g) liketh you, O ye children of Israel, saith the Lord GOD. 
<p>
<p>(f) As (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#013">Lev 7:13</A>). 
<p>
<p>(g) You only delight in these outward ceremonies and care for nothing else.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">amo 4:6</A></FONT></span></p>And I also have given you (h) cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and want of bread in all your places: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">amo 4:7</A></FONT></span></p>And also I have withholden the rain from you, when [there were] yet three (i) months to the harvest: and I caused it to rain upon one city, and caused it not to rain upon another city: one piece was rained upon, and the piece whereupon it rained not withered. 
<p>
<p>(i) I stopped the rain until the fruits of the earth were destroyed with drought, and yet you would not consider to return to me by repentance.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#008">Amos 4:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">amo 4:8</A></FONT></span></p>So two [or] three cities wandered unto one city, to drink water; but they were (k) not satisfied: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD. 
<p>
<p>(k) They could not find enough water where they had heard that it had rained.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">amo 4:10</A></FONT></span></p>I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of (l) Egypt: your young men have I slain with the sword, and have taken away your horses; and I have made the stink of your camps to come up unto your nostrils: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD. 
<p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">amo 4:11</A></FONT></span></p>I have overthrown [some] of you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and ye were as a (m) firebrand plucked out of the burning: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD. 
<p>
<p>(m) You were almost all consumed, and a few of you were wonderfully preserved; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#026">Kg2 14:26</A>).
