### [Psalms Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#001)

[Psalms 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 29:1</span></span>

"A Psalm of David." Give unto the LORD, O ye (a) mighty, give unto the
LORD glory and strength.

\(a\) He exhorts the proud tyrants to humble themselves under God's
hand, and not to be inferior to brute beasts and dumb creatures.

[Psalms 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 29:3</span></span>

The (b) voice of the LORD \[is\] upon the waters: the God of glory
thundereth: the LORD \[is\] upon many waters.

\(b\) The thunder claps that are heard out of the clouds should make the
wicked tremble for fear of God's anger.

[Psalms 29:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 29:5</span></span>

The (c) voice of the LORD breaketh the cedars; yea, the LORD breaketh
the cedars of Lebanon.

\(c\) That is, the thunderbolt breaks the most strong trees, and will
men think their power able to resist God?

[Psalms 29:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 29:6</span></span>

He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and (d) Sirion like a
young unicorn.

\(d\) Called also Hermon.

[Psalms 29:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 29:7</span></span>

The voice of the LORD divideth the (e) flames of fire.

\(e\) It causes the lightnings to shoot and glide.

[Psalms 29:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 29:8</span></span>

The voice of the LORD shaketh the wilderness; the LORD shaketh the
wilderness of (f) Kadesh.

\(f\) In places most desolate, where it seems there is no presence of
God.

[Psalms 29:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 29:9</span></span>

The voice of the LORD maketh the hinds to (g) calve, and (h) discovereth
the forests: and in his (i) temple doth every one speak of \[his\]
glory.

\(g\) For fear makes them deliver their calves.

\(h\) Makes the trees bare, or pierces the most secret places.

\(i\) Though the wicked are not moved by these lights, yet the faithful
praise God.

[Psalms 29:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 29:10</span></span>

The LORD sitteth upon the (k) flood; yea, the LORD sitteth King for
ever.

\(k\) To moderate the rage of the tempests and waters that they not
destroy all.
