### [Ezekiel Chapter 44](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#001)

[Ezekiel 44:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 44:2</span></span>

Then said the LORD to me; This gate shall be (a) shut, it shall not be
opened, and no man shall enter in by it; because the LORD, the God of
Israel, hath entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut.

\(a\) Meaning, from the common people, but not from the priests nor the
prince, read ([Eze 46:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/eze046.htm#008)).

[Ezekiel 44:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 44:7</span></span>

In that ye have brought \[into my sanctuary\] (b) strangers,
uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my
sanctuary, to pollute it, \[even\] my house, when ye offer my bread, the
fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenant because of all your
abominations.

\(b\) For they had brought idolaters who were from other countries, to
teach them their idolatry, ([Eze
23:40](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#040)).

[Ezekiel 44:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 44:8</span></span>

And ye have not kept the (c) charge of my holy things: but ye have set
keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves.

\(c\) You have not offered to me according to my Law.

[Ezekiel 44:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 44:10</span></span>

And the (d) Levites that have gone away far from me, when Israel went
astray, who went astray from me after their idols; they shall even bear
their iniquity.

\(d\) The Levites who had committed idolatry were put from their dignity
and could not be received into the priests office although they had been
of the house of Aaron, but must serve in the inferior offices as to
watch and to keep the doors, read ([Kg2
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#009)).

[Ezekiel 44:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 44:15</span></span>

But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that (e) kept the charge
of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me, they
shall come near to me to minister to me, and they shall stand before me
to offer to me the fat and the blood, saith the Lord GOD:

\(e\) Who observed the law of God and did not fall to idolatry.

[Ezekiel 44:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 44:20</span></span>

Neither shall they (f) shave their heads, nor allow their locks to grow
long; they shall only cut \[the hair of\] their heads.

\(f\) As did the infidels and heathen.

[Ezekiel 44:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">eze 44:25</span></span>

And they shall come near no dead person to defile themselves: but for
father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother, or for
sister that hath had no husband, they may (g) defile themselves.

\(g\) They may be at their burial which was a defiling.
