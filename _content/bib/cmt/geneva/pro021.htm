<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">pro 21:1</A></FONT></span></p>The (a) king's heart [is] in the hand of the LORD, [as] the rivers of water: he turneth it wherever he will. 
<p>
<p>(a) Though kings seem to have all things at commandment, they are not able to bring their own purposes to pass unless God has appointed: much less are the inferiors able.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#004">Proverbs 21:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">pro 21:4</A></FONT></span></p>An high look, and a proud heart, [and] the (b) plowing of the wicked, [is] sin. 
<p>
<p>(b) That is, the thing by which he is guided or which he brings forth as the fruit of his work.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#005">Proverbs 21:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">pro 21:5</A></FONT></span></p>The thoughts of the diligent [tend] only to plenteousness; but of (c) every one [that is] hasty only to want. 
<p>
<p>(c) He who goes rashly about his business and without counsel.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#007">Proverbs 21:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">pro 21:7</A></FONT></span></p>The (d) robbery of the wicked shall destroy them; because they refuse to do judgment. 
<p>
<p>(d) He means this chiefly of judges and princes who leave that calling, to which God has called them, and impoverish their subjects to maintain their lusts.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">pro 21:11</A></FONT></span></p>(e) When the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise: and when the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge.

<p>
<p>(f) Though the godly admonish them both by words and example of life, yet the wicked will not amend, till God destroys them.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">pro 21:14</A></FONT></span></p>A (g) gift in secret pacifieth anger: and a reward in the bosom strong wrath. 
<p>
<p>(g) To do a pleasure to the angry man pacifies him.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#018">Proverbs 21:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">pro 21:18</A></FONT></span></p>The (h) wicked [shall be] a ransom for the righteous, and the transgressor for the upright. 
<p>
<p>(h) God will cause that to fall on their own heads, which they intended against the just by delivering the just, and putting the wicked in their places.
