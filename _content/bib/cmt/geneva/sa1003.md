### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#001)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 3:1</span></span>

And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD (a) before Eli. And the
word of the LORD was (b) precious in those days; \[there was\] no open
vision.

\(a\) The Chaldee text reads "while Eli lived".

\(b\) Because there were very few prophets to declare it.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 3:2</span></span>

And it came to pass at that time, when Eli \[was\] laid down in his (c)
place, and his eyes began to wax dim, \[that\] he could not see;

\(c\) In the court next to the tabernacle.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 3:3</span></span>

And ere the (d) lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where
the ark of God \[was\], and Samuel was laid down \[to sleep\];

\(d\) That is, the lamps which burnt in the night.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa1 3:4</span></span>

That the LORD (e) called Samuel: and he answered, Here \[am\] I.

\(e\) Josephus writes that Samuel was 12 years old when the Lord
appeared to him.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa1 3:7</span></span>

Now Samuel did not yet know (f) the LORD, neither was the word of the
LORD yet revealed unto him.

\(f\) By vision.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa1 3:8</span></span>

And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went
to Eli, and said, Here \[am\] I; for thou didst call me. And Eli (g)
perceived that the LORD had called the child.

\(g\) Such was the corruption of those times that the chief priest had
become dull and negligent to understand the Lord's appearing.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa1 3:11</span></span>

And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at
which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall (h) tingle.

\(h\) God declares that sudden fear will come on men when they hear that
the ark is taken, and see Eli's house destroyed.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa1 3:14</span></span>

And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of
Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for (i)
ever.

\(i\) Meaning that his posterity would never enjoy the chief priests
office.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa1 3:17</span></span>

And he said, What \[is\] the thing that \[the LORD\] hath said unto
thee? I pray thee hide \[it\] not from me: God (k) do so to thee, and
more also, if thou hide \[any\] thing from me of all the things that he
said unto thee.

\(k\) God punish you after this and that sort, unless you tell me the
truth, ([Rut 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#017)).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa1 3:19</span></span>

And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his
words (l) fall to the ground.

\(l\) The Lord accomplished whatever he had said.
