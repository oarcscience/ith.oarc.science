### [Acts Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#001)

[Acts 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 6:1</span></span>

And (1) in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied,
there arose a murmuring of the (a) Grecians against the Hebrews, because
their widows were neglected in the (b) daily ministration.

\(1\) When Satan has assailed the Church on the outside, and with little
result and in vain, he assails it on the inside, with civil dissension
and strife between themselves: but the apostles take occasion by this to
set order in the Church.

\(a\) From among their own members, who became religious Jews from among
the Greeks.

\(b\) In the bestowing of alms according to their need.

[Acts 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 6:2</span></span>

\(2\) Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples \[unto
them\], and said, It is not (c) reason that we should leave the word of
God, and serve (d) tables.

\(2\) The office of preaching the word, and dispensing the goods of the
Church, are different from one another, and not rashly to be joined
together, as the apostles institute here. And the deacons must seek the
consent of the Church more than the apostles.

\(c\) It is such a matter that we may in no way accept it.

\(d\) Banquets: though by the name of tables other offices are also
meant, which are added to it, such as those which pertain to the care of
the poor.

[Acts 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 6:3</span></span>

\(3\) Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest
report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this
business.

\(3\) In choosing deacons (and much more in choosing ministers) there
must be an examination of both their learning and their manners of life.

[Acts 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 6:6</span></span>

\(4\) Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they
(e) laid \[their\] hands on them.

\(4\) The ancient Church, with the laying on of hands, as it were
consecrated to the Lord those who were lawfully elected.

\(e\) This ceremony of the laying on of hands came from the Jews, who
used this ceremony both in public affairs, and in the offering of
sacrifices, and also in private prayers and blessings, as appears in
([Gen 48:13-22](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#013)); and the Church also
observed this ceremony, as is evident from ([Ti1
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#022); [Act
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#017)). However, there is no mention
made here either of cream, or shaving, or razing, or crossing, etc.

[Acts 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 6:7</span></span>

\(5\) And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples
multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were
obedient to the (f) faith.

\(5\) A happy result of temptation.

\(f\) This is the figure of speech metonymy, meaning by "faith" the
doctrine of the Gospel which brings about faith.

[Acts 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 6:8</span></span>

\(6\) And Stephen, full of faith and (g) power, did great wonders and
miracles among the people.

\(6\) God trains his Church first with evil words and slanders, then
with imprisonments, afterwards with scourgings, and by these means
prepares it in such a way that at length he causes it to meet in combat
with Satan and the world, even to bloodshed and death.

\(g\) Excellent and singular gifts.

[Acts 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 6:9</span></span>

\(7\) Then there arose certain of the (h) synagogue, which is called
\[the synagogue\] of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians,
and of them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen.

\(7\) Schools and universities in ancient times were addicted to false
pastors, and were the instruments of Satan to spread abroad and defend
false doctrines.

\(h\) Of the people and the school, as it were.

[Acts 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 6:10</span></span>

\(8\) And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by
which he spake.

\(8\) False teachers, because they will not be overcome, flee from
disputations and resort to manifest and open slandering and false
accusations.

[Acts 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 6:12</span></span>

\(9\) And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes,
and came upon \[him\], and caught him, and brought \[him\] to the
council,

\(9\) The first bloody persecution of the Church of Christ, began and
sprang from a council of priests, by the suggestion of the university
teachers.

[Acts 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 6:13</span></span>

\(10\) And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not to
speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law:

\(10\) An example of frivolous objectors or false accusers, who gather
false conclusions from things that are well uttered and spoken.

[Acts 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 6:15</span></span>

And all that sat in the council, looking stedfastly on him, (i) saw his
face as it had been the face of an angel.

\(i\) By this it appears that Steven had an excellent and wholesome
countenance, having a quiet and settled mind, a good conscience, and
certain conviction that his cause was just: for seeing as he was to
speak before the people, God beautified his countenance, so that by the
very beholding of him the Jews' minds might be penetrated and amazed.
