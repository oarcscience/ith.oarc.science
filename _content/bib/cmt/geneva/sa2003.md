### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#001)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 3:1</span></span>

Now there was (a) long war between the house of Saul and the house of
David: but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul
waxed weaker and weaker.

\(a\) That is, without intermission enduring two years, which was the
whole reign of Ishbosheth.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa2 3:3</span></span>

And his second, (b) Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite;
and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of
Geshur;

\(b\) Who is also called Daniel, ([Ch1
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#001)).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa2 3:5</span></span>

And the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah David's wife. These were born to David
in (c) Hebron.

\(c\) Within seven years and six months.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa2 3:8</span></span>

Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ishbosheth, and said, \[Am\]
I a (d) dog's head, which against Judah do shew kindness this day unto
the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and
have not delivered thee into the hand of David, that thou chargest me to
day with a fault concerning this woman?

\(d\) Do you esteem me no more than a dog, for all my service done to
your father's house?

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa2 3:9</span></span>

\(e\) So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the LORD hath sworn
to David, even so I do to him;

\(e\) We see how the wicked cannot abide being admonished about their
faults, but seek their displeasure, who go about to bring them from
their wickedness.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa2 3:17</span></span>

And Abner had (f) communication with the elders of Israel, saying, Ye
sought for David in times past \[to be\] king over you:

\(f\) Rather for malice that he bore toward Ishbosheth, than for love he
bore to David.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa2 3:19</span></span>

And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to
speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and
that seemed good to the whole (g) house of Benjamin.

\(g\) Who challenged the kingdom, because of their father Saul.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">sa2 3:22</span></span>

And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came (h) from \[pursuing\] a
troop, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner \[was\] not
with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in
peace.

\(h\) From war against the Philistines.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">sa2 3:24</span></span>

Then Joab came to the king, and said, (i) What hast thou done? behold,
Abner came unto thee; why \[is\] it \[that\] thou hast sent him away,
and he is quite gone?

\(i\) Here appears the malicious mind of Joab, who would have had the
king slay Abner for his private grudge.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 3:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">sa2 3:28</span></span>

And afterward when David heard \[it\], he said, I and my kingdom \[are\]
(k) guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner the son
of Ner:

\(k\) the Lord knows that I did not consent to his death.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 3:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">sa2 3:30</span></span>

So Joab and (l) Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had slain
their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.

\(l\) Abishai is said to slay him with Joab, because he consented to the
murder.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 3:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">sa2 3:31</span></span>

And David said to Joab, and to all the people that \[were\] with him,
Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn (m) before
Abner. And king David \[himself\] followed the bier.

\(m\) Meaning before the corpse.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 3:33](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">sa2 3:33</span></span>

And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner (n) as a fool
dieth?

\(n\) He declares that Abner died not as a wretch or vile person, but as
a valiant man might do, being traitorously deceived by the wicked.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 3:35](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">sa2 3:35</span></span>

And when all the people came to cause David to eat (o) meat while it was
yet day, David sware, saying, So do God to me, and more also, if I taste
bread, or ought else, till the sun be down.

\(o\) According to their custom, which was to feast at burials.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 3:36](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">sa2 3:36</span></span>

And all the people took notice \[of it\], and it (p) pleased them: as
whatsoever the king did pleased all the people.

\(p\) It is expedient sometimes not only to conceive inward sorrow, but
also that it may appear to others, so that they may be satisfied.
