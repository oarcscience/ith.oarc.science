<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#001">Psalms 55:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">psa 55:1</A></FONT></span></p>"To the chief Musician on Neginoth, Maschil, [A Psalm] of David." Give ear to (a) my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my supplication. 
<p>
<p>(a) The earnestness of his prayer declares the vehemency of his grief in so much as he is compelled to burst out into cries.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#003">Psalms 55:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">psa 55:3</A></FONT></span></p>Because of the (b) voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked: for (c) they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me. 
<p>
<p>(b) For the threatenings of Saul and his adherents. 
<p>
<p>(c) They have defamed me as a wicked person, or they have imagined my destruction.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#005">Psalms 55:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">psa 55:5</A></FONT></span></p>Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath (d) overwhelmed me. 
<p>
<p>(d) There was no part of him that was not astonished with extreme fear.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#006">Psalms 55:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">psa 55:6</A></FONT></span></p>And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! [for then] would I (e) fly away, and be at rest. 
<p>
<p>(e) Fear had driven him to so great distress, that he wished to be hid in some wilderness, and to be banished from that kingdom which God had promised that he should enjoy.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#008">Psalms 55:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">psa 55:8</A></FONT></span></p>I would hasten my escape (f) from the windy storm [and] tempest. 
<p>
<p>(f) From the cruel rage and tyranny of Saul.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#009">Psalms 55:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">psa 55:9</A></FONT></span></p>Destroy, O Lord, [and] (g) divide their tongues: for I have seen violence and strife in the city. 
<p>
<p>(g) As in the confusion of Babylon when the wicked conspired against God.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#010">Psalms 55:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">psa 55:10</A></FONT></span></p>Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: (h) mischief also and sorrow [are] in the midst of it. 
<p>
<p>(h) All laws and good orders are broken and only vice and dissolution reigns under Saul.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#012">Psalms 55:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">psa 55:12</A></FONT></span></p>For [it was] not an (i) enemy [that] reproached me; then I could have borne [it]: neither [was it] he that hated me [that] did magnify [himself] against me; then I would have hid myself from him: 
<p>
<p>(i) If my open enemy had sought by hurt, I could better have avoided him.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#013">Psalms 55:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">psa 55:13</A></FONT></span></p>But [it was] thou, a man mine (k) equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance. 
<p>
<p>(k) Who was not only joined to me in friendship and counsel in worldly matters, but also in religion.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#015">Psalms 55:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">psa 55:15</A></FONT></span></p>Let death seize upon them, [and] let them (l) go down quick into hell: for wickedness [is] in their dwellings, [and] among them. 
<p>
<p>(l) As Korah, Dathan and Abiram.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#017">Psalms 55:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">psa 55:17</A></FONT></span></p>Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, (m) and cry aloud: and he shall hear my voice. 
<p>
<p>(m) Which signifies a servants mind and sure trust to obtain his portion, which made him earnest at all times in prayer.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#018">Psalms 55:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">psa 55:18</A></FONT></span></p>He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle [that was] against me: for there were (n) many with me. 
<p>
<p>(n) Even the angels of God fought on my side against my enemies, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#016">Kg2 6:16</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#019">Psalms 55:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">psa 55:19</A></FONT></span></p>God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old. Selah. Because they (o) have no changes, therefore they fear not God. 
<p>
<p>(o) But their prosperous estate still continues.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#020">Psalms 55:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">psa 55:20</A></FONT></span></p>He (p) hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him: he hath broken his covenant. 
<p>
<p>(p) I did not provoke him but was as at peace with him, yet he made war against me.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#022">Psalms 55:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">psa 55:22</A></FONT></span></p>Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: he shall (q) never suffer the righteous to be moved. 
<p>
<p>(q) Though for their bettering and trial, he permits them to slip for a time.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#023">Psalms 55:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">psa 55:23</A></FONT></span></p>But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out (r) half their days; but I will trust in thee. 
<p>
<p>(r) Though they sometimes live longer, yet their life is cursed by God, unquiet, and worse than any death.
