<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">jdg 14:3</A></FONT></span></p>Then his father and his mother said unto him, [Is there] (a) never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And Samson said unto his father, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well. 
<p>
<p>(a) Though his parents justly reprove him, yet it appears that this was the secret work of the Lord, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#004">Jdg 14:4</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#004">Judges 14:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">jdg 14:4</A></FONT></span></p>But his father and his mother knew not that it [was] of the LORD, that he sought an occasion against the (b) Philistines: for at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel. 
<p>
<p>(b) To fight against them for the deliverance of Israel.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#006">Judges 14:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">jdg 14:6</A></FONT></span></p>And the Spirit of the LORD (c) came mightily upon him, and he rent him as he would have rent a kid, and [he had] nothing in his hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had done. 
<p>
<p>(c) By which he had strength and boldness.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#010">Judges 14:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">jdg 14:10</A></FONT></span></p>So his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made there a (d) feast; for so used the young men to do. 
<p>
<p>(d) Meaning when he was married.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#011">Judges 14:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">jdg 14:11</A></FONT></span></p>And it came to pass, when (e) they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him. 
<p>
<p>(e) That is, her parents or friends.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#012">Judges 14:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">jdg 14:12</A></FONT></span></p>And Samson said unto them, I will now put forth a riddle unto you: if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast, and find [it] out, then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty (f) change of garments: 
<p>
<p>(f) To wear at feasts, or solemn days.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#015">Judges 14:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">jdg 14:15</A></FONT></span></p>And it came to pass (g) on the seventh day, that they said unto Samson's wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father's house with fire: have ye called us to take that we have? [is it] not [so]? 
<p>
<p>(g) Or as the seventh day drew near, for it was the fourth day.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#016">Judges 14:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">jdg 14:16</A></FONT></span></p>And Samson's wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a riddle unto the (h) children of my people, and hast not told [it] me. And he said unto her, Behold, I have not told [it] my father nor my mother, and shall I tell [it] thee? 
<p>
<p>(h) To those who are of my nation.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#017">Judges 14:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">jdg 14:17</A></FONT></span></p>And she wept before him the (i) seven days, while their feast lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she lay sore upon him: and she told the riddle to the children of her people. 
<p>
<p>(i) Or, to the seventh day beginning at the fourth.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#018">Judges 14:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">jdg 14:18</A></FONT></span></p>And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What [is] sweeter than honey? and what [is] stronger than a lion? And he said unto them, (k) If ye had not plowed with my heifer, ye had not found out my riddle. 
<p>
<p>(k) If you had not used the help of my wife.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#019">Judges 14:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">jdg 14:19</A></FONT></span></p>And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he went down (l) to Ashkelon, and slew thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave change of garments unto them which expounded the riddle. And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his father's house. 
<p>
<p>(l) Which was one of the five chief cities of the Philistines.
