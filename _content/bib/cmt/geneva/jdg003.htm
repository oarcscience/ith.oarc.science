<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">jdg 3:1</A></FONT></span></p>Now these [are] the nations which the LORD left, to prove Israel by them, [even] as many [of Israel] as had not known all the (a) wars of Canaan; 
<p>
<p>(a) Which were achieved by the hand of God, and not by the power of man.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#002">Judges 3:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">jdg 3:2</A></FONT></span></p>Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew (b) nothing thereof; 
<p>
<p>(b) For they trusted in God and he fought for them.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#006">Judges 3:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">jdg 3:6</A></FONT></span></p>And they took (c) their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods. 
<p>
<p>(c) Contrary to God's commandment, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#003">Deu 7:3</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#007">Judges 3:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">jdg 3:7</A></FONT></span></p>And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgat the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the (d) groves. 
<p>
<p>(d) Or Ashteroth, trees or woods erected for idolatry.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#010">Judges 3:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">jdg 3:10</A></FONT></span></p>And the (e) Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the LORD delivered Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushanrishathaim. 
<p>
<p>(e) He was stirred up by the Spirit of the Lord.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#011">Judges 3:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">jdg 3:11</A></FONT></span></p>And the land had rest (f) forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died. 
<p>
<p>(f) That is, 32 under Joshua and 8 under Othniel.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#012">Judges 3:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">jdg 3:12</A></FONT></span></p>And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD (g) strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD. 
<p>
<p>(g) So that the enemies of God's people have no power over them, but by God's appointment.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#019">Judges 3:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">jdg 3:19</A></FONT></span></p>But he himself turned again from the (h) quarries that [were] by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king: who said, Keep (i) silence. And all that stood by him went out from him. 
<p>
<p>(h) Or, as some read from the places of idols. 
<p>
<p>(i) Till all be departed.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#030">Judges 3:30</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_030">jdg 3:30</A></FONT></span></p>So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the (k) land had rest fourscore years. 
<p>
<p>(k) Meaning, the Israelites.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#031">Judges 3:31</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_031">jdg 3:31</A></FONT></span></p>And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox (l) goad: and he also delivered Israel. 
<p>
<p>(l) So that it is not the number, nor the means that God regards, when he will get the victory.
