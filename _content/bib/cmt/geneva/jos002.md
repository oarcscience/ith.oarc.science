### [Joshua Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#001)

[Joshua 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 2:1</span></span>

And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of (a) Shittim two men to spy
secretly, saying, Go view the land, even Jericho. And they went, and
came into an harlot's house, named Rahab, and lodged there.

\(a\) Which was in the plain of Moab near Jordan.

[Joshua 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jos 2:3</span></span>

And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, (b) Bring forth the men
that are come to thee, which are entered into thine house: for they be
come to search out all the country.

\(b\) Though the wicked see the hand of God on them, they do not repent,
but seek how they may by their power and policy resist his working.

[Joshua 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jos 2:6</span></span>

But she had brought them up to the (c) roof of the house, and hid them
with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof.

\(c\) Meaning, on the house: for then their houses were flat above, so
that they might do their business on it.

[Joshua 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jos 2:9</span></span>

And she said unto the men, I know that the LORD hath given you the land,
and that your (d) terror is fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants
of the land faint because of you.

\(d\) For so God promised, ([Deu 28:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#007);
[Jos 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#001)).

[Joshua 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jos 2:11</span></span>

And as soon as we had heard \[these things\], our hearts did melt,
neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because of you:
for (e) the LORD your God, he \[is\] God in heaven above, and in earth
beneath.

\(e\) In this the great mercy of God appears, that in this common
destruction he would draw a most miserable sinner to repent, and confess
his Name.

[Joshua 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jos 2:14</span></span>

And the men answered her, (f) Our life for yours, if ye utter not this
our business. And it shall be, when the LORD hath given us the land,
that we will deal kindly and truly with thee.

\(f\) We warrant you on pain of our lives.

[Joshua 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jos 2:16</span></span>

And she said unto them, Get you to the (g) mountain, lest the pursuers
meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be
returned: and afterward may ye go your way.

\(g\) which was near to the city.

[Joshua 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jos 2:17</span></span>

And the men said unto her, (h) We \[will be\] blameless of this thine
oath which thou hast made us swear.

\(h\) We will be released from our oath if you perform this condition
that follows for so shall you and yours be delivered.

[Joshua 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jos 2:19</span></span>

And it shall be, \[that\] whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy
house into the street, (i) his blood \[shall be\] upon his head, and we
\[will be\] guiltless: and whosoever shall be with thee in the house,
his blood \[shall be\] on our head, if \[any\] hand be upon him.

\(i\) He shall be guilty of his own death.

[Joshua 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jos 2:20</span></span>

And if thou utter this our (k) business, then we will be quit of thine
oath which thou hast made us to swear.

\(k\) So that others should think to escape by the same means.
