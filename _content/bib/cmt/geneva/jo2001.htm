<p>
<p>(a) This is not a proper name, but is to be taken as it sounds that is to say, the worthy and noble lady. 
<p>
<p>(b) Excellent and honourable woman. (1) The bond of Christian union is the true and constant profession of the truth. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#003">2 John 1:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">jo2 1:3</A></FONT></span></p>Grace be with you, mercy, [and] peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in 
<p>
<p>(c) truth and love. 
<p>
<p>(c) With true knowledge which always has love united with it, and following it.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">jo2 1:4</A></FONT></span></p>(2) I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in (d) truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father. 
<p>
<p>(2) This true profession consists both in love towards one another which the Lord has commanded, and also especially in wholesome and sound doctrine, which also is delivered to us: for the commandment of God is a sound and sure foundation both of the rule of conduct and of doctrine, and these cannot be separated from one another, 
<p>
<p>(d) According as the truth directs them. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#007">2 John 1:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">jo2 1:7</A></FONT></span></p>(3) For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist. 
<p>
<p>(3) Antichrists fighting against the person and office of Christ had already crept into the Church, in the time of the apostles.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">jo2 1:8</A></FONT></span></p>(4) (e) Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward. 
<p>
<p>(4) He that makes shipwreck of doctrine, loses all. 
<p>
<p>(e) Beware, and take good heed.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">jo2 1:10</A></FONT></span></p>(5) If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into [your] house, neither bid him God speed: 
<p>
<p>(5) We should have nothing to do with those who defend perverse doctrine.
