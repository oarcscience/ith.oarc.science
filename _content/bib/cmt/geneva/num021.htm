<p>
<p>(a) By that way which their spies, that searched the dangers found to he most safe.

<p>
<p>(b) For they were forbidden to destroy it, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#005">Deu 2:5</A>).

<p>
<p>(g) Only Moses and Aaron, the heads of the people, struck the rock with the rod or staff, which gave water as a well that was deep digged.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#024">Numbers 21:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">num 21:24</A></FONT></span></p>And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from Arnon unto (h) Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon [was] (i) strong. 
<p>
<p>(h) The river. 
<p>
<p>(i) For the people were tall and strong like giants; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#020">Deu 2:20</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#026">Numbers 21:26</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_026">num 21:26</A></FONT></span></p>For (k) Heshbon [was] the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even unto Arnon. 
<p>
<p>(k) For if it had been the Moabites, the Israelites might not have possessed it, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#009">Deu 2:9</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#028">Numbers 21:28</A></p>
