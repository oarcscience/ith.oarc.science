<p>
<p>(a) By fellowship of faith, he means those duties of charity which are given to the saints, and flow from a productive faith. 
<p>
<p>(b) That by this means all men may perceive how rich you are in Christ, that is, in faith, charity, and all bountifulness.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#007">Philemon 1:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">plm 1:7</A></FONT></span></p>For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because 
<p>
<p>the (c) bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother. 
<p>
<p>(c) Because you did so dutifully and cheerfully refresh the saints, that they conceived inwardly a marvellous joy: for by this word 
<p>
<p>(bowels) is meant not only the inward feeling of wants and miseries that men have of one another's state, but also that joy and comfort which enters into the very bowels, as though the heart were refreshed and comforted.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#009">Philemon 1:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">plm 1:9</A></FONT></span></p>(1) Yet for love's sake I rather beseech [thee], being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ. 
<p>
<p>(1) An example of a Christian exercise and commendation for another man.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">plm 1:12</A></FONT></span></p>Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own (d) bowels: 
<p>
<p>(d) As my own son, and as if I had begotten him from my own body.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#014">Philemon 1:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">plm 1:14</A></FONT></span></p>But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of (e) necessity, but willingly. 
<p>
<p>(e) That you might not seem to have lent me your servant on constraint, but willingly.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#015">Philemon 1:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">plm 1:15</A></FONT></span></p>For perhaps he therefore (f) departed for (g) a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever; 
<p>
<p>(f) He uses a more gentle type of speech, but in reality, he ran away. 
<p>
<p>(g) For a little time.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#016">Philemon 1:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">plm 1:16</A></FONT></span></p>Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the (h) flesh, and in the Lord? 
<p>
<p>(h) Because he is your servant, as other servants are, and because he is the Lord's servant, you must love him both for the Lord's sake and for your own sake.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#020">Philemon 1:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">plm 1:20</A></FONT></span></p>(i) Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord. 
<p>
<p>(i) Good brother let me obtain this benefit at your hand.
