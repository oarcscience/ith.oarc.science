### [Ephesians Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#001)

[Ephesians 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eph 5:9</span></span>

righteousness

(See Scofield) - ([Jo1 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#007)).

[Ephesians 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eph 5:23</span></span>

saviour

(See Scofield) - ([Rom 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#016)).

[Ephesians 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">eph 5:25</span></span>

even as Christ

Christ's love-work for the church is threefold: past, present, future:

\(1\) Past; For love, He gave Himself to redeem the church ([Eph
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#025));

\(2\) Present; In love, He is sanctifying the church ([Eph
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#026));

\(3\) Future; For the reward of His sacrifice and labour of love, He
will present the church to Himself in flawless perfection, "one pearl of
great price" ([Eph 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#027)); ([Mat
13:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#046)).

[Ephesians 5:32](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">eph 5:32</span></span>

bride

([Eph 5:30](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#030)); ([Eph
5:31](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#031)) are quoted from ([Gen
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#023)); ([Gen
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#024)), and exclude the interpretation
that the reference is to the church merely as the body of Christ. Eve,
taken from Adam's body, was truly "bone of his bones, and flesh of his
flesh," but she was also his wife, united to him in a relation which
makes of "twain. . . One flesh", ([Mat
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#005)); ([Mat
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#006)), and so a clear type of the
church as bride of Christ. ([Co2
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#002)); ([Co2
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#003)). The bride types are:

Eve ([Gen 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#023)); ([Gen
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#024)).

Rebecca (See Scofield) - ([Gen 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#001)).

Asenath (See Scofield) - ([Gen 41:45](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#045)).

(See Scofield) - ([Gen 37:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#002)).

Zipporah ([Exo 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#021)); (See Scofield) -
([Hos 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#002)).

mystery

(See Scofield) - ([Mat 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#011)).
