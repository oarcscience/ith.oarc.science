<p>Book Introduction - 1 Thessalonians
<p>Writer: The apostle Paul (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#001">Th1 1:1</A>). 
<p>Date: The Epistle was written from Corinth, A.D. 54, shortly after Paul's departure from Thessalonica (Acts 16, 17), and is the earliest of his letters. 
<p>Theme: The theme of the Epistle is threefold: 
<p>1. To confirm young disciples in the foundational truths already taught them; 
<p>2. To exhort them to go on to holiness; 
<p>3. To comfort them concerning those who had fallen asleep. The second coming of Christ is prominent throughout. The Epistle is incidentally most interesting as showing the richness in doctrine of the primitive evangelism. During a mission of about one month the apostle had taught all the great doctrines of the Christian faith. 
<p>The divisions of the Epistle are sufficiently indicated by the Chapters. 
<p>1. The model church, and the three tenses of the Christian life (1 Thessalonians 1:1-10). 
<p>2. The model servant and his reward (1 Thessalonians 2:1-20). 
<p>3. The model brother, and the believer's sanctification (1 Thessalonians 3:1-13). 
<p>4. The model walk, and the believer's hope (1 Thessalonians 4:1-18). 
<p>5. The model walk, and the day of Jehovah (1 Thessalonians 5:1-28).
