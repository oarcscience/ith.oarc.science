### [Matthew Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#001)

[Matthew 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 2:1</span></span>

Herod the king

Called Herod the Great, son of Antipater, an Idumean ([Gen
36:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#001)).

(See Scofield) - ([Gen 36:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#001))

and Cypros, an Arabian woman. Antipater was appointed procurator of
Judea by Julius Caesar, B.C. 47. At the age of fifteen Herod was
appointed to the government of Galilee. B.C. 40 the Roman senate made
him king of Judea. An able, strong, and cruel man, he increased greatly
the splendour of Jerusalem, erecting the temple which was the centre of
Jewish worship in the time of our Lord.

[Matthew 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 2:2</span></span>

King

"The King" is one of the divine titles ([Psa
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#016)) and so used in the worship of
the Church ([Ti1 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#017)) but Christ is
never called "King of the Church." He is "King of the Jews" ([Mat
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#002)) and Lord and "Head of the Church"
([Eph 1:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#022)).

(See Scofield) - ([Mat 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018)). (See
Scofield) - ([Heb 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#023)) " ([Mat
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018)); ([Heb
12:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#023)).

[Matthew 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mat 2:4</span></span>

Scribes

(Greek, "grammateis", means "writer"). Hebrew, "spherim", means "to
write," "set in order," "count." The scribes were so called because it
was their office to make copies of the Scriptures; to classify and teach
the precepts of oral law

(See Scofield) - ([Mat 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#007))

and to keep careful count of every letter in the Old Testament writings.
Such an office was necessary in a religion of law and precept, and was
an Old Testament function ([Sa2 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#017));
([Sa2 20:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#025)); ([Kg1
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#003)); ([Jer
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#008)); ([Jer
36:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#010)); ([Jer
36:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#012)); ([Jer
36:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#026)). To this legitimate work the
scribes added a record of rabbinical decisions on questions of ritual
(Halachoth); the new code resulting from those decisions (Mishna); the
Hebrew sacred legends (Gemara, forming with the Mishna the Talmud);
commentaries on the Old Testament (Midrashim); reasonings upon these
(Hagada); and finally, mystical interpretations which found in Scripture
meanings other than the grammatical, lexical, and obvious ones (the
Kabbala); not unlike the allegorical method of Origen, or the modern
Protestant "spiritualizing" interpretation. In our Lord's time, to
receive this mass of writing superposed upon the Scriptures was to be
orthodox; to return to the Scriptures themselves was heterodoxy -- our
Lord's most serious offence.

[Matthew 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mat 2:15</span></span>

Out of Egypt

The words quoted are in ([Hos 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001))
and the passage illustrates the truth that prophetic utterances often
have a latent and deeper meaning than at first appears. Israel,
nationally, was a "Song of Songs" ([Sol
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#001)); ([Exo
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#022)), but Christ was the greater
"Song of Songs" ([Sol 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#001)); ([Rom
9:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#004)); ([Isa
41:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#008)); ([Isa
42:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001)); ([Isa
52:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#013)), where the servant-nation
and the Servant-Son are both in view.

[Matthew 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mat 2:19</span></span>

angel

(See Scofield) - ([Heb 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#004)).

[Matthew 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mat 2:22</span></span>

Archelaus

Son of Herod the Great, ([Mat 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#001)) and
Malthace, a Samaritan woman. Deposed A.D. 6.

[Matthew 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mat 2:23</span></span>

He shall be called

Probably referring to ([Isa 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001))
where Christ is spoken of as "a 'netzer' (or, 'rod') out of the stem of
Jesse."
