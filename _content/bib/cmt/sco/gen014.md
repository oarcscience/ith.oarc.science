when Abram

It is Abram the separated man who has power to help. See ([Gen
19:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#029)); ([Ti2
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#020)); ([Ti2
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#021)).

Melchizedek

1 Melchizedek, type of Christ the King-Priest. The type strictly applies
to the priestly work of Christ in resurrection, since Melchizedek
presents only the memorials of sacrifice, bread and wine. "After the
order of Melchizedek" ([Heb 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#020))
refers to the royal authority and unending duration of Christ's high
priesthood ([Heb 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#023)); ([Heb
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#024)). The Aaronic priesthood was
often interrupted by death. Christ is a priest after the order of
Melchizedek, as King of righteousness, King of peace; ([Isa
11:4-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#004)); ([Heb
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#002)) and in the endlessness of his
priesthood; but the Aaronic priesthood typifies His priestly work.

most high God

2 "Most high," or "most high God" (Hebrew, El Elyon). "Elyon means
simply "highest."

\(1\) The first revelation of this name ([Gen
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#008)) indicates its distinctive
meanings. Abram, returning from his victory over the confederated kings
([Gen 14:1-17](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#001)) is met by Melchizedek,
King of Salem. . . The "priest of the most high God" (El Elyon), who
blesses Abram in the name of El Elyon, "possessor of heaven and earth."
This revelation produced a remarkable impression upon the patriarch. Not
only did he at once give Melchizedek "tithes of all" the spoil of the
battle, but when the King of Sodom offered other of that spoil to Abram,
his answer was; "I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord Jehovah, the
most high God El-Elyon, the possessor of heaven and earth, that I will
not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet," etc. ([Gen
14:18-23](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#018)).

\(a\) The Lord (Jehovah) is know to a Gentile king (Melchizedek) by the
name "most high god" El Elyon);

\(b\) a Gentile is the priest of El Elyon and

\(c\) His distinctive character as most high God is "possessor of heaven
and earth."

Appropriately to this Gentile knowledge of God by His name "Most High,"
we read that "the Most High divided to the nationsthat is, Gentiles\]
their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam," etc. ([Deu
32:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#008)). As "possessor heaven and
earth," it was the prerogative of the Most High to distribute the earth
among the nations according to whatever principle He chose. That
principle is declared ([Deu 32:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#008)). To
the same purport is the use of the name in Daniel, the book of Gentile
prophecy; ([Dan 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#026)); ([Dan
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#017)); ([Dan
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#024)); ([Dan
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#025)); ([Dan
4:32](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#032)); ([Dan
4:34](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#034)); ([Dan
4:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#035)); ([Dan
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#018)); ([Dan
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#021)).

\(2\) As "possessor of heaven and earth," the most high God has and
exercises authority in both spheres:

\(a\) the heavenly authority of El Elyon (for example ([Dan
4:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#035)); ([Dan
4:37](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#037)); ([Isa
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#013)); ([Isa
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#014)); ([Mat
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#018)).

\(b\) the earthly authority of El Elyon (e.g). ([Deu
32:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#008)); ([Psa
9:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#002)); ([Psa
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#007)); ([Psa
47:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#002)); ([Psa
56:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#002)); ([Psa
82:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#006)); ([Psa
82:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#008)); ([Psa
83:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#016)); ([Psa
91:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#009)); ([Sa2
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#014)); ([Sa2
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#015)); ([Dan
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#018)).
