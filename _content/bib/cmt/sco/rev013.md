### [Revelation Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#001)

[Revelation 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 13:1</span></span>

rise up

Daniel's fourth beast.

(See Scofield) - ([Dan 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#026)).

The "ten horns" are explained in ([Dan
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#024)); ([Rev
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#012)) to be ten kings, and the whole
vision is of the last form of Gentile world-power, a confederated
ten-kingdom empire covering the sphere of authority of ancient Rome
([Rev 13:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#001)) refers to the
ten-kingdom empire; versus ([Rev
13:4-10](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#004)) to the emperor, who is
emphatically "the Beast."

(See Scofield) - ([Rev 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#020)).

[Revelation 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rev 13:2</span></span>

like unto a leopard

The three animals, leopard, bear, and lion, are found in ([Dan
7:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#004)) as symbols of the empires which
preceded Rome, and whose characteristics all entered into the qualities
of the Roman empire: Macedonian swiftness of conquest, Persian tenacity
of purpose, Babylonish voracity.

[Revelation 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rev 13:3</span></span>

wounded to death

Fragments of the ancient Roman empire have never ceased to exist as
separate kingdoms. It was the imperial form of government which ceased;
the one head wounded to death. What we have prophetically in ([Rev
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#003)) is the restoration of the
imperial form as such, though over a federated empire of ten kingdoms;
the "head" is "healed," that is, Restored; there is an emperor again --
the Beast.

world

(Greek, "gē", means "earth"). ([Joh
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#007));

(See Scofield) - ([Rev 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#008)).

[Revelation 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rev 13:8</span></span>

world

Kosmos, Summary:

In the sense of the present world-system, the ethically bad sense of the
word, refers to the "order," "arrangement," under which Satan has
organized the world of unbelieving mankind upon his cosmic principle of
force, greed, selfishness, ambition, and pleasure. ([Mat
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#008)); ([Mat
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#009)); ([Joh
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#031)); ([Joh
14:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#030)); ([Joh
18:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#036)); ([Eph
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#002)); ([Eph
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#012)); ([Jo1
2:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#015)). This world-system is
imposing and powerful with armies and fleets; is often outwardly
religious, scientific, cultured, and elegant; but, seething with
national and commercial rivalries and ambitions, is upheld in any real
crisis only by armed force, and is dominated by Satanic principles.

[Revelation 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rev 13:16</span></span>

he causeth

Antichrist; the person is to be distinguished from the "many
antichrists" ([Jo1 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#018)) and the
"spirit of antichrist" ([Jo1 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#003))
which characterizes all. The supreme mark of all is the denial of the
Christian truth of the incarnation of the Logos, the eternal Son in
Jesus as the Christ ([Joh 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001)); ([Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014)).

(See Scofield) - ([Mat 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#016)).

The "many antichrists" precede and prepare the way for the Antichrist,
who is "the Beast out of the earth" of ([Rev
13:11-17](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#011)) and the "false prophet" of
([Rev 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#013)); ([Rev
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#020)); ([Rev
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#010)). He is the last ecclesiastical
head, as the Beast of ([Rev 13:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#001)) is
the last civil head. For purposes of persecution he is permitted to
exercise the autocratic power of the emperor-Beast.

(See Scofield) - ([Rev 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#020)).
