<p>Book Introduction - Exodus
<p>Exodus, "going out," records the redemption out of Egyptian bondage of the descendants of Abraham, and sets forth, in type, all redemption. It is therefore peculiarly the book of redemption. But as all redemption is unto a relationship with God of which worship, fellowship, and service are expressions, so Exodus, in the giving of the law and the provisions of sacrifice and priesthood, becomes not only the book of redemption, but also, in type, of the conditions upon which all relationships with God exist. 
<p>Broadly, the book teaches that redemption is essential to any relationship with a holy God; and that even a redeemed people cannot have fellowship with Him unless constantly cleaned of defilement. 
<p>In Exodus, God, hitherto connected with the Israelitish people only through His covenant with Abraham, brings them to himself nationally through redemption, puts them under the Mosaic Covenant, and dwells among them in the cloud of glory. Galatians explains the relation of the law to the Abrahamic Covenant. In the Commandments God taught Israel His just demands. Experience under the Commandments convicted Israel of sin; and the provision of priesthood and sacrifice (filled with precious types of Christ) gave a guilty people a way of forgiveness, cleansing, restoration to fellowship, and worship. 
<p>Exodus falls into three chief divisions: 
<p>1. Israel in Egypt (Exodus 1 - 15.). 
<p>2. From the Red Sea to Sinai (Exodus 16 - 18.). 
<p>3. Israel at Sinai (Exodus 19 - 40.). 
<p>The events recorded in Exodus cover a period of 216 years (Ussher).
