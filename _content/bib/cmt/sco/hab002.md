### [Habakkuk Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#001)

[Habakkuk 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">hab 2:2</span></span>

run that readeth it

Not, as usually quoted, "that he that runneth may read," but, "that he
may run that readeth"; that is, as a messenger of the "vision."

Compare ([Zac 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#004)); ([Zac
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#005)).

[Habakkuk 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">hab 2:3</span></span>

appointed time

To the watching prophet comes the response of the "vision" ([Hab
2:2-20](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#002)). Three elements are to be
distinguished:

\(1\) The moral judgment of Jehovah upon the evils practised by
dispersed Israel ([Hab 2:5-13](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#005)); ([Hab
2:15-19](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#015)).

\(2\) The future purpose of God that, practised by dispersed Israel
([Hab 2:5-13](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#005)); ([Hab
2:15-19](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#015)).

\(3\) The future purpose of God that, "the earth shall be filled with
the knowledge of the glory of Jehovah, as the waters cover the sea"
([Hab 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#014)). That this revelation
awaits the return of the Lord in glory is shown

\(a\) by the parallel passage in ([Isa
11:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#009)) and

\(b\) by the quotation of verse 3 ([Hab
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#003)) in ([Heb
10:37](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#037)); ([Heb
10:38](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#038)) where the "it" of the "vision"
becomes "he" and refers to the return of the Lord. It is then, after the
"vision" is fulfilled, that "the knowledge of the glory," etc, shall
fill the earth. But

\(4\) meantime, "the just shall live by his faith." This great evangelic
word is applied to Jew and Gentile in ([Rom
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#017)) to the Gentiles in ([Gal
3:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#011)) and to Hebrews (especially)
in ([Heb 10:38](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#038)). This opening of life
to faith alone, makes possible not only the salvation of the Gentiles
during the dispersion of Israel "among the nations"; ([Hab
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#005)); ([Gal
3:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#011)) but also makes possible a
believing remnant in Israel while the nation, as such, is in blindness
and unbelief,

(See Scofield) - ([Rom 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#001)),

with neither priesthood nor temple, and consequently unable to keep the
ordinances of the law. Such is Jehovah! In disciplinary government His
ancient Israel is cast out of the land and judicially blinded ([Co2
3:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#012)) but in covenanted mercy the
individual Jew may resort to the simple faith of Abraham; ([Gen
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#006)); ([Rom
4:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#001)) and be saved. But this does not
set aside the Palestinian

(See Scofield) - ([Deu 30:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#003))

and Davidic

(See Scofield) - ([Sa2 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#016)).

Covenants, for "the earth shall be filled," etc. ([Hab
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#014)),and Jehovah will again be in His
temple ([Hab 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#020)).

Compare ([Hab 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#014)); ([Hab
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#020)); ([Rom
11:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#025)).

[Habakkuk 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">hab 2:5</span></span>

hell

Sheol is, in the Old Testament, the place to which the dead go.

\(1\) Often, therefore, it is spoken of as the equivalent of the grave,
merely, where all human activities cease; the terminus toward which all
human life moves (for example ([Gen
42:38](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#038)) grave ([Job
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#013)) grave ([Psa
88:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#003)) grave

\(2\) To the man "under the sun," the natural man, who of necessity
judges from appearances, sheol seems no more than the grave -- the end
and total cessation, not only of the activities of life, but of life
itself. ([Ecc 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#005)); ([Ecc
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#010)).

\(3\) But Scripture reveals sheol as a place of sorrow ([Sa2
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#006)); ([Psa
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#005)); ([Psa
18:116](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#116)); ([Psa
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#003)); in which the wicked are turned
([Psa 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#017)) and where they are fully
conscious; ([Isa 14:9-17](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#009)); ([Eze
32:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#021)) see, especially, ([Jon
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jon002.htm#002)) what the belly of the great fish
was to Jonah that sheol is to those who are therein). The sheol of the
Old Testament and hades of the New Testament

(See Scofield) - ([Luk 16:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#023))

are identical.

[Habakkuk 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">hab 2:13</span></span>

is it not

Or, it is not of the LORD, etc, that is, though permitted in His
providence, not His plan.

Compare ([Mic 4:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#002)).

[Habakkuk 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">hab 2:14</span></span>

For the earth shall be filled

Compare ([Isa 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#009)) which fixes the
time when "the earth," etc. It is when David's righteous Branch has set
up the kingdom.

(See "Kingdom (Old Testament),"; ([Sa2
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#009)); ([Zac
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#008)) also,

"Kingdom (New Testament),"; ([Luk
1:31-33](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#031)); ([Co1
15:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#028)).

Habakkuk's phrase marks an advance on that of Isaiah. In the latter it
is "the knowledge of the Lord." That, in a certain sense, is being
diffused now; but in Habakkuk it is "the knowledge of the glory of the
Lord," and that cannot be till He is manifested in glory; ([Mat
24:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#030)); ([Mat
25:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#031)); ([Luk
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#026)); ([Th2
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#007)); ([Th2
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#008)); ([Jde
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#014)). The transfiguration was a
foreview of this. ([Luk 9:26-29](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#026)).
