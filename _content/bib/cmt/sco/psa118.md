The stone which the builders refused

See "Christ (as Stone),"

(See Scofield) - ([Exo 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#006)).

(See Scofield) - ([Pe1 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#008)).

Psalm 118 looks beyond the rejection of the Stone (Christ) to His final
exaltation in the kingdom ([Psa
118:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#022)).

See Psalm 2, first of the Messianic Psalms.

O give thanks unto the Lord

The Messianic Psalms: Summary. That the Psalms contain a testimony to
Christ our Lord Himself affirmed ([Luk
24:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#044)) and the New Testament
quotations from the Psalter point unerringly to those Psalms which have
the Messianic character. A close spiritual and prophetic character as
surely identifies others. Christ is seen in the Psalms

\(1\) in two general character, as suffering (for example Psa. 22), and
as entering into His kingdom glory (for example Psalms 2; 24.) Compare
([Luk 24:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#025)).

\(2\) Christ is seen in His person

\(a\) as Son of God ([Psa 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#007)) and
very God; ([Psa 45:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#006)); ([Psa
45:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#007)); ([Psa
102:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#025)); ([Psa
110:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001)).

\(b\) as Son of man ([Psa 8:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#004))

\(c\) as Son of David ([Psa 89:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#003));
([Psa 89:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#004)); ([Psa
89:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#027)); ([Psa
89:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#029)).

\(3\) Christ is seen in His offices

\(a\) as Prophet ([Psa 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#022)); ([Psa
22:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#025)); ([Psa
40:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#009)); ([Psa
40:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#010)).

\(b\) as Priest ([Psa 110:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#004)) and

\(c\) as King (for example Psa 2, 24.)

\(4\) Christ is seen in His varied work. As Priest He offers Himself in
sacrifice ([Psa 22:1-31](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#001)); ([Psa
40:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006)); ([Heb
10:5-12](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005)) and, in resurrection, as the
Priest-Shepherd, ever living to make intercession; ([Psa
23:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#001)); ([Heb
7:21-25](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#021)); ([Heb
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#020)). As Prophet He proclaims the
name of Jehovah as Father; ([Psa
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#022)); ([Joh
20:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#017)). As King He fulfils the Davidic
Covenant ([Psa 89:1-52](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#001)) and restores
alike the dominion of man over creation; ([Psa
8:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#004)); ([Rom
8:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#017)) and of the Father over all.
([Co1 15:25-28](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#025)).

\(5\) The Messianic Psalms give, also, the inner thoughts, the exercises
of soul, of Christ in His earthly experiences. (See, e.g, ([Psa
16:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#008)); ([Psa
22:1-2140](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#001)); ([Psa
22:1-17](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#001)).
