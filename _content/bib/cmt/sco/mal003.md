[Malachi 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001)

Lord

The first verse of Malachi 3 ([Mal
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001)) is quoted of John the Baptist;
([Mat 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#010)); ([Mar
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#002)); ([Luk
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#027)), but the second clause, "the
Lord whom ye see," etc, is nowhere quoted in the New Testament The
reason is obvious: in everything save the fact of Christ's first advent,
the latter clause awaits fulfilment ([Hab
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#020)). ([Mal
3:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#002)) speak of judgment, not of
grace. Malachi, in common with other Old Testament prophets, saw both
advents of Messiah blended in one horizon, but did not see the
separating interval described in Matthew 13 consequent upon the
rejection of the King ([Mat 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#016));
([Mat 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#017)). Still less was the
Church-age in his vision; ([Eph
3:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#003)); ([Col
1:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#025)). "My messenger" ([Mal
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001)) is John the Baptist; the
"messenger of the covenant" is Christ in both of His advents, but with
especial reference to the events which are to follow His return.

(See Scofield) - ([Sa1 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#003)).

The trinity is suggested by the three times repeated groups of threes.
This is not an arbitrary arrangement, but inheres in the Old Testament
itself.

This revelation of God by His name is invariably made in connection with
some particular need of His people, and there can be no need of man to
which these names do not answer as showing that man's true resource is
in God. Even human failure and sin but evoke new and fuller revelations
of the divine fulness.

\(2\) The Old Testament Scriptures reveal the existence of a Supreme
Being, the Creator of the universe and of man, the Source of all life
and of all intelligence, who is to be worshipped and served by men and
angels. This Supreme Being is One, but, in some sense not fully revealed
in the Old Testament, is a unity in plurality. This is shown by the
plural name, Elohim, by the use of the plural pronoun in the
interrelation of deity as evidenced in ([Gen
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#026)); ([Gen
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#022)); ([Psa
110:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001)); ([Isa
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#008)). That this plurality is really a
Trinity is intimated in the three primary names of Deity, and in the
threefold ascription of the Seraphim in ([Isa
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#003)) That the interrelation of Deity
is that of Father and Son is directly asserted; ([Psa
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#007)); ([Heb
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#005)) and the Spirit is distinctly
recognized in His personality, and to Him are ascribed all the divine
attributes (for example; ([Gen 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#002));
([Num 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#025)); ([Num
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#002)); ([Jdg
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#010)); ([Jdg
6:34](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#034)); ([Jdg
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#029)); ([Jdg
13:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#025)); ([Jdg
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#006)); ([Jdg
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#019)); ([Jdg
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#014)); ([Sa2
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#002)); ([Job
26:13](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#013)); ([Job
33:4](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#004)); ([Psa
106:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#033)); ([Psa
139:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#007)); ([Isa
40:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#007)); ([Isa
59:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#019)); ([Isa
63:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#010)).

(See Scofield) - ([Mal 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#015)).

\(3\) The future incarnation is intimated in the theophanies, or
appearances of God in human form (for example ([Gen
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#001)); ([Gen
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#013)); ([Gen
18:17-22](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#017)); ([Gen
32:24-30](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#024)) and distinctly predicted in
the promises connected with redemption (for example ([Gen
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#015)) and with the Davidic Covenant
([Isa 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#013)); ([Isa
9:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006)); ([Jer
23:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005)).

The revelation of Deity in the New Testament so illuminates that of the
Old Testament that the latter is seen to be, from Genesis to Malachi,
the foreshadowing of the coming incarnation of God in Jesus the Christ.
In promise, covenant, type, and prophecy the Old Testament points
forward to Him.

\(4\) The revelation of God to man is one of authority and redemption.
He requires righteousness from man, but saves the unrighteous through
sacrifice; and in His redemptive dealings with man all the divine
persons and attributes are brought into manifestation. The Old Testament
reveals the justice of God equally with His mercy, but never in
opposition to His mercy. The flood, for example, was an unspeakable
mercy to unborn generations. From Genesis to Malachi He is revealed as
the seeking God who has no pleasure in the death of the wicked, and who
heaps up before the sinner every possible motive to persuade to faith
and obedience.

\(5\) In the experience of the Old Testament men of faith their God
inspires reverence but never slavish fear; and they exhaust the
resources of language to express their love and adoration in view of His
loving-kindness and tender mercy. This adoring love of His saints is the
triumphant answer to those who pretend to find the Old Testament
revelation of God cruel and repellent. It is in harmony, not contrast,
with the New Testament revelation of God in Christ.

\(6\) Those passages which attribute to God bodily parts and human
emotions (for example ([Exo 33:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#011));
([Exo 33:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#020)); ([Deu
29:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#020)); ([Ch2
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#009)); ([Gen
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#006)); ([Gen
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#007)); ([Jer
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#006)) are metaphorical and mean that
in the infinite being of God exists that which answers to these things
-- eyes, a hand, feet, etc.; and the jealousy and anger attributed to
Him are the emotions of perfect Love in view of the havoc of sin.

\(7\) In the Old Testament revelation there is a true sense in which,
wholly apart from sin or infirmity, God is like His creature man ([Gen
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#027)) and the supreme and perfect
revelation of God, toward which the Old Testament points, is a
revelation in and through a perfect Man.
