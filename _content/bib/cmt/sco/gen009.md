### [Genesis Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#001)

[Genesis 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 9:1</span></span>

and said unto them

The Noahic Covenant. The elements are:

\(1\) The relation of man to the earth under the Adamic Covenant is
confirmed

(See Scofield) - ([Gen 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#021))

\(2\) The order of nature is confirmed ([Gen
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#022))

\(3\) Human government is established ([Gen
9:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#001))

\(4\) Earth is secured against another universal judgment by water ([Gen
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#021)); ([Gen
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#011)).

\(5\) A prophetic declaration is made that from Ham will descend an
inferior and servile posterity ([Gen
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#024)); ([Gen
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#025)).

\(6\) A prophetic declaration is made that Shem will have a peculiar
relation to Jehovah ([Gen 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#026)); ([Gen
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#027)). All divine revelation is
through Semitic men, and Christ, after the flesh, descends from Shem.

\(7\) A prophetic declaration is made that from Japheth will descend the
"enlarged" races ([Gen 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#027)).
Government, science, and art, speaking broadly, are and have been
Japhetic, so that history is the indisputable record of the exact
fulfilment of these declarations.

(See Scofield) - ([Gen 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#021)).

for the other seven covenants:

EDENIC ([Gen 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#028))

ADAMIC ([Gen 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#015))

ABRAHAMIC ([Gen 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#018))

MOSAIC ([Exo 19:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#025))

PALESTINIAN ([Deu 30:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#003))

DAVIDIC ([Sa2 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#016))

NEW ([Heb 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#008)).

[Genesis 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 9:8</span></span>

saying

(See Scofield) - ([Gen 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#021)).

(See Scofield) - ([Gen 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#001))

[Genesis 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gen 9:13</span></span>

bow

The bow is not said to have come into existence at this time, but only
to have been here invested with the character of a sign.

Compare ([Exo 31:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#013)).

Typically, the bow, seen upon the storm clouds of judgment ([Gen
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#011)) has been thought to speak of the
cross where judgment, never to be repeated has been visted upon the
believer's sins. ([Gal 3:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#010)); ([Heb
10:14-18](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#014)).

[Genesis 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">gen 9:25</span></span>

Cursed

(See Scofield) - ([Gen 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#001)).
