[Zechariah 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#008)

I saw

The "man" ([Zac 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#008)) is the "my lord,"
"the angel that talked with me" ([Zac
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#009)), and "the angel of the Lord"
([Zac 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#010)); ([Zac
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#011)). The "man" "stood among the
myrtle trees" ([Zac 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#008)). The prophet
addresses him as "my lord" (compare ([Gen
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#002)), but when the "man" answers he
perceives that he has addressed an angel -- "the angel that talked with
me" ([Zac 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#009)). In ([Zac
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#010)). The being of the vision is
again "the man that stood among the myrtle trees." In ([Zac
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#011)). He is called "the angel of the
Lord," and to him the (riders on the) "red horses, speckled with white"
say: "We have walked to and fro," etc. Then ([Zac
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#012)), "the angel of the Lord" (that
is, the "man," "my lord," "the angel that talked with me") intercedes
for the land against a world at ease. The date of the intercession was
at the end of the 70 years' captivity of Judah. ([Zac
1:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#009)).

Taken as a whole ([Zac 1:8-17](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#008))
Zechariah's first vision reveals Judah in dispersion; Jerusalem under
adverse possession; and the Gentile nations at rest about it. This
condition still continues, and Jehovah's answer to the intercession of
the angel sweeps on to the end-time of Gentile domination, when "the
Lord shall yet comfort Zion," etc. ([Zac
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#016)); ([Zac
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#017)); ([Isa
40:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#001)).

red horse

Compare ([Rev 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#004)).

The whole Gentile period is characterized by the red horse, that is,
"sword."; ([Dan 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026)); ([Mat
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#006)); ([Mat
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#007)).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">zac 1:18</span></span>

horn

A "horn" is the symbol of a Gentile king ([Dan
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#024)); ([Rev
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#012)) and the vision is of the four
world empires; ([Dan 2:36-44](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#036)); ([Dan
7:3-7](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#003)) which have "scattered Judah,
Israel, and Jerusalem" ([Zac 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#019)).

[Zechariah 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#019)

angel

(See Scofield) - ([Heb 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#004)).

[Zechariah 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">zac 1:20</span></span>

And the Lord

The word "charash", translated, "carpenter," is literally, carver,
engraver. ([Zac 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#021)) makes it plain
that, whatever the four carvers may be, they are used to "fray," or
carve away (Hebrew, charad) in the sense of diminishing, enfeebling, the
great Gentile world-powers. They may stand for Jehovah's "four sore
judgments," the sword, famine, evil beasts, and pestilence ([Eze
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#021)); the four horses of Revelation
6.
