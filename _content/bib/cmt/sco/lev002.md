### [Leviticus Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#001)

[Leviticus 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 2:1</span></span>

fine flour

The meal-offering. The fine flour speaks of the evenness and balance of
the character of Christ; of that perfection in which no quality was in
excess, none lacking; the fire, of His testing by suffering, even unto
death; frankincense; the fragrance of His life Godward (see) ([Exo
30:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#034)) absence of leaven, His
character as "the Truth" (see) ([Exo
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#008)) absence of honey; -- His was not
that mere natural sweetness which may exist quite apart from grace; oil
mingled, Christ as born of the Spirit ([Mat
1:18-23](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#018)) oil upon, Christ as baptized
with the Spirit; ([Joh 1:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#032)); ([Joh
6:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#027)) the oven, the unseen sufferings
of Christ -- His inner agonies; ([Heb
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#018)); ([Mat
27:45-46](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#045)) the pan, His more evident
sufferings (for example) ([Mat
27:27-31](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#027)) salt, the pungency of the
truth of God -- that which arrests the action of leaven.

leaven

honey

For meanings of leaven, see ([Mat
13:.33](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#000)). Also ([Lev

(See Scofield) - ([Lev 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#013))

Honey

honey is mere natural sweetness and could not symbolize the divine
graciousness of the Lord Jesus.
