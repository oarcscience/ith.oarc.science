Book Introduction - Luke

Writer: The Writer of the third Gospel is called by Paul "the beloved
physician" [Col 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#014) and, as we learn
from the Acts, was Paul's frequent companion. He was of Jewish ancestry,
but his correct Greek marks him as a Jew of the dispersion. Tradition
says that he was a Jew of Antioch, as Paul was of Tarsus.

Date: The date of Luke falls between A.D. 63 and 68.

Theme: Luke is the Gospel of the human-divine One, as John is of the
divine-human One. The key-phrase is "Son of man," and the key-verse [Luk
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#010). "For the Son of man is come to
seek and to save that which was lost." In harmony with this intent, Luke
relates those things concerning Jesus which demonstrate how entirely
human He was. His genealogy is traced to Adam, and the most detailed
account is given of His mother, and of His infancy and boyhood. The
parables peculiar to Luke have distinctively the human and the seeking
note. But Luke is careful to guard the Deity and Kingship of Jesus
Christ [Luk 1:32-35](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#032). Luke, then, is
the Gospel of "the man whose name is The BRANCH" [Zac
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#012).

Luke has six chief divisions:

1\. The Evangelist's Introduction (Luke 1:1-4).

2\. The human relationships of Jesus (Luke 1:5 - 2:52).

3\. The baptism, ancestry, and testing of Jesus (Luke 3:1 - 4:13).

4\. The ministry of the Son of man as Prophet-King in Galilee (Luke 4:14
- 9:44).

5\. The final offer of the Son of man as King to israel, His rejection
and sacrifice (Luke 19:45 - 23:56).

6\. The resurrection, resurrection ministry, and ascension of the Son of
man (Luke 24:1-53).

The events recorded in this book cover a period of 39 years.
