angels

Angel, Summary:

Angel, "messenger," is used of God, of men, and of an order of created
spiritual beings whose chief attributes are strength and wisdom. ([Sa2
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#020)); ([Psa
103:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#020)); ([Psa
104:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#004)).

In the Old Testament, the expression "the angel of the Lord"; (sometimes
"of God"); usually implies the presence of Deity in angelic form. ([Gen
16:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#001)); ([Gen
21:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#017)); ([Gen
22:11-16](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#011)); ([Gen
31:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#011)); ([Exo
3:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#002)); ([Jdg
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#001)); ([Jdg
6:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#012)); ([Jdg
13:3-22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#003)).

(See Scofield) - ([Mal 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001)).

The word "angel" is used of men in; ([Luk
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#024)); ([Jam
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#025)); ([Rev
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#020)); ([Rev
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#001)); ([Rev
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#008)); ([Rev
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#012)); ([Rev
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#018)); ([Rev
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#001)); ([Rev
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#007)); ([Rev
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#014)).

In ([Rev 8:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#003)), Christ is evidently
meant.

Sometimes, angel is used of the spirit of man. ([Mat
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#010)); ([Act
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#015)). Though angels are spirits;
([Psa 104:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#004)); ([Heb
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#014)); power is given them to become
visible in the semblance of human form. ([Gen
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#001)).

Compare ([Gen 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#005)); ([Exo
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#002)); ([Num
22:22-31](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#022)); ([Jdg
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#001)); ([Jdg
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#011)); ([Jdg
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#022)); ([Jdg
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#003)); ([Jdg
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#006)); ([Ch1
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#016)); ([Ch1
21:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#020)); ([Mat
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#020)); ([Luk
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#026)); ([Joh
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#012)); ([Act
7:30](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#030)); ([Act
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#007)); ([Act
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#008)); etc.).

The word is always used in the masculine gender, though sex, in the
human sense, is never ascribed to angels. ([Mat
22:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#030)); ([Mar
12:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#025)).

They are exceedingly numerous. ([Mat
26:53](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#053)); ([Heb
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#022)); ([Rev
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#011)); ([Psa
68:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#017)).

Their power is inconceivable. ([Kg2
19:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#035)).

Their place is about the throne of God. ([Rev
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#011)); ([Rev
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#011)).

Their relation to the believer is that of "ministering spirits, sent
forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation", and this
ministry has reference largely to the physical safety and well-being of
believers. ([Kg1 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#005)); ([Psa
34:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#007)); ([Psa
91:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#011)); ([Dan
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#022)); ([Mat
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#013)); ([Mat
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#019)); ([Mat
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#011)); ([Luk
22:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#043)); ([Act
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#019)); ([Act
12:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#007)).

From ([Heb 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#014)); ([Mat
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#010)); ([Psa
91:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#011)), it would seem that this care
for the heirs of salvation begins in infancy and continues through life.

The angels observe us; ([Co1 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#009));
([Eph 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#010)); ([Ecc
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#006)); a fact which should influence
conduct.

They receive departing saints. ([Luk
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#022)).

Man is made "a little lower than the angels," and in incarnation, Christ
took "for a little "time" this lower place ([Psa
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#004)); ([Psa
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#005)); ([Heb
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#006)); ([Heb
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#009)) that He might lift the believer
into His own sphere above angels. ([Heb
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#009)); ([Heb
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#010)).

The angels are to accompany Christ in His second advent. ([Mat
25:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#031)).

To them will be committed the preparation of the judgment of the
nations. ([Mat 13:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#030)); ([Mat
13:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#039)); ([Mat
13:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#041)); ([Mat
13:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#042)).

(See Scofield) - ([Mat 25:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#032)).

The kingdom-age is not to be subject to angels, but to Christ and those
for whom He was made a little lower than the angels. ([Heb
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#005)).

An archangel, Michael, is mentioned as having a particular relation to
Israel and to the resurrections. ([Dan
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#013)); ([Dan
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#021)); ([Dan
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001)); ([Dan
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#002)); ([Jde
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#009)); ([Th1
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#016)).

The only other angel whose name is revealed Gabriel, was employed in the
most distinguished services. ([Dan
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#016)); ([Dan
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#021)); ([Luk
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#019)); ([Luk
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#026)).

Fallen angels. Two classes of these are mentioned:

\(1\) "The angels which kept not their first estate place, but left
their own habitation," are "chained under darkness," awaiting judgment.
([Pe2 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#004)); ([Jde
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#006)); ([Co1
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#003)); ([Joh
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#022)).

(See Scofield) - ([Gen 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#004)).

\(2\) The angels who have Satan ([Gen
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#001)) as leader.

(See Scofield) - ([Rev 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#010)).

The origin of these is nowhere explicitly revealed. They may be
identical with the demons.

(See Scofield) - ([Mat 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#022)).

For Satan and his angels everlasting fire is prepared. ([Mat
25:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#041)); ([Rev
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#010)).
