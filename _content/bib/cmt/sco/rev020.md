### [Revelation Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#001)

[Revelation 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rev 20:2</span></span>

thousand years

The duration of the kingdom of heaven in its mediatorial form.

(See Scofield) - ([Co1 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#024)).

[Revelation 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rev 20:5</span></span>

first resurrection

The "resurrection of the just" is mentioned in ([Luk
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#013)); ([Luk
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#014)), and the resurrection of "life"
distinguished from the "resurrection unto damnation" in ([Joh
5:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#029)). We here learn for the first
time what interval of time separates these two resurrections.

(See Scofield) - ([Co1 15:52](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#052)).

[Revelation 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rev 20:8</span></span>

Gog

(See Scofield) - ([Eze 38:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#002)).

[Revelation 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rev 20:10</span></span>

devil

Satan, Summary:

This fearful being, apparently created one of the cherubim

(See Scofield) - ([Eze 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#005)).

(See Scofield) - ([Eze 28:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#012)).

and anointed for a position of great authority, perhaps over the
primitive creation, (note 3);

(See Scofield) - ([Gen 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#002)); ([Eze
28:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#011)).

fell through pride; ([Isa 14:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#012));
His "I will" ([Isa 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#013)) marks the
introduction of sin into the universe. Cast out of heaven, ([Luk
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#018)), he makes earth and air the
scene of his tireless activity. ([Eph
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#002)); ([Pe1
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#008)). After the creation of man he
entered into the serpent.

(See Scofield) - ([Gen 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#001)).

and, beguiling Eve by his subtilty, secured the downfall of Adam and
through him of the race, and the entrance of sin into the world of men.
([Rom 5:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#012)).

The Adamic Covenant

(See Scofield) - ([Gen 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#014)).

Promised the ultimate destruction of Satan through the "Seed of the
woman." Then began his long warfare against the work of God in behalf of
humanity, which still continues. The present world-system ([Rev
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#008)) organized upon the principle of
force, greed, selfishness, ambition, and sinful pleasure, is his work
and was the bribe which he offered to Christ. ([Mat
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#008)); ([Mat
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#009)). Of that world-system, he is
prince; ([Joh 14:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#030)); ([Joh
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#011)) and god ([Co2
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#004)). As "prince of the power of the
air", ([Eph 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#002)), he is at the head of
vast host of demons.

(See Scofield) - ([Mat 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#022)).

To him, under God, was committed upon earth the power of death. ([Heb
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#014)). Cast out of heaven as his
proper sphere and "first estate," he still has access to God as the
"accuser of the brethren" ([Rev 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#010))
and is permitted a certain power of sifting or testing the
self-confident and carnal among believers; ([Job
1:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#006)); ([Luk
22:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#031)); ([Luk
22:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#032)); ([Co1
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#005)); ([Ti1
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#020)); but this is strictly permissive
and limited power, and believers so sifted are kept in faith through the
advocacy of Christ. ([Luk 22:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#031));
([Luk 22:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#032)).

(See Scofield) - ([Jo1 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#001)).

At the beginning of the great tribulation, Satan's privilege of access
to God as accuser will be withdrawn. ([Rev
12:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#007)). At the return of Christ in
glory, Satan will be bound for one thousand years ([Rev
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#002)) after which he will be "loosed
for a little season" ([Rev 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#003));
([Rev 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#007)); ([Rev
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#008)) and will become the head of
final effort to overthrow the kingdom. Defeated in this, he will be
finally cast into the lake of fire, his final doom. The notion that he
reigns in hell is Miltonic, not biblical. He is prince of this present
world-system, but will be tormented in the lake of fire.

[Revelation 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#011)

great white throne

The expressions, "the judgment," or, "day of judgment," as the passages
and their context show, refer to the final judgment of ([Rev
20:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#011)).

there was found no place for him

The "day of destruction" is that aspect of the day of Jehovah ([Isa
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#012)).

(See Scofield) - ([Rev 19:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#019)).

(Summary) which visits final and eternal judgment upon the wicked. Three
such "days" are included in the "day" of Jehovah, and are described in
the references beginning with ([Isa
34:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#001)).

(See Scofield) - ([Mat 25:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#032)).

And I saw

(See Scofield) - ([Rev 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#012)).

[Revelation 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rev 20:12</span></span>

judged

The final judgment. The subjects are the "dead." As the redeemed were
raised from among the dead one thousand years before ([Rev
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#005)) and have been in glory with
Christ during that period, the "dead" can only be the wicked dead, from
the beginning to the setting up of the great white throne in space. As
there are degrees of punishment ([Luk
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#027)); ([Luk
12:48](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#048)) the dead are judged according
to their works. The book of life is there to answer such as plead their
works for justification, for example ([Mat
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#022)); ([Mat
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#023)) an awful blank where the name
might have been.

The Judgments, Summary:

Among the many judgments mentioned in Scripture, seven are invested with
especial significance. These are:

\(1\) The judgment of the Believer's sins in the cross of Christ.

(See Scofield) - ([Joh 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#031)).

\(2\) the believer's self-judgment.

(See Scofield) - ([Co1 11:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#031)).

\(3\) the judgment of the believers' works.

(See Scofield) - ([Co2 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#010)).

\(4\) the judgment of the nations at the return of Christ.

(See Scofield) - ([Mat 25:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#032)).

\(5\) the judgment of Israel at the return of Christ.

(See Scofield) - ([Eze 20:37](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#037)).

\(6\) the judgment of angels after the one thousand years.

(See Scofield) - ([Jde 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#006)), and

\(7\) the judgment of the wicked dead with which the history of the
present earth ends.

[Revelation 20:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#013)

hell

(See Scofield) - ([Luk 16:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#023)).

[Revelation 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rev 20:14</span></span>

second death

Second death, Summary:

"The second death" and the "lake of fire" are identical terms ([Rev
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#014)) and are used of the eternal
state of the wicked. It is "second" relative to the preceding physical
death of the wicked in unbelief and rejection of God; their eternal
state is one of eternal "death" (that is, separation from God) in sins
([Joh 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#021)); ([Joh
8:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#024)). That the second death is not
annihilation is shown by a comparison of ([Rev
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#020)); ([Rev
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#010)).

After one thousand years in the lake of fire, the Beast and False
Prophet are still there, undestroyed. The words "forever and forever"
("to the ages of the ages") are used in ([Heb
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#008)) for the duration of the throne of
God, eternal in the sense of unending.
