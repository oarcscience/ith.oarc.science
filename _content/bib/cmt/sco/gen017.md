[Genesis 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#001)

Almighty God

"Almighty God" (Hebrew, El Shaddai)

\(1\) The etymological signification of Almighty God (El Shaddai) is
both interesting and touching. God (El) signifies the "Strong One" (See
Scofield) - ([Gen 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001)). The qualifying
word Shaddai is formed from the Hebrew word "shad," the breast,
invariably used in Scripture for a woman's breast; for example ([Gen
49:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#025)); ([Job
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#012)); ([Psa
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#009)); Song of ([Sol
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#013)); ([Sol
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#005)); Song of ([Sol
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#003)); ([Sol
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#007)); ([Sol
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#008)); ([Sol
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#001)); ([Sol
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#008)); ([Sol
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#010)); ([Isa
28:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#009)); ([Eze
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#007)). Shaddai therefore means
primarily "the breasted." God is "Shaddai," because He is the Nourisher,
the Strength-giver, and so, in a secondary sense, the Satisfier, who
pours himself into believing lives. As a fretful, unsatisfied babe is
not only strengthened and nourished from the mother's breast, but also
is quieted, rested, satisfied, so El Shaddai is that name of God which
sets Him forth as the Strength-giver and Satisfier of His people. It is
on every account to be regretted that "Shaddai" was translated
"Almighty." The primary name El or Elohim sufficiently signifies
almightiness. "All-sufficient" would far better express both the Hebrew
meaning and the characteristic use of the name in Scripture.

\(2\) Almighty God (El Shaddai) not only enriches, but makes fruitful.
This is nowhere better illustrated than in the first occurrence of the
name ([Gen 17:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#001)). To a man
ninety-nine years of age, and "as good as dead" ([Heb
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#012)). He said: "I am the Almighty
God El Shaddai . . . I will . . . multiply thee exceedingly." To the
same purport is the use of the name in ([Gen
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#003)); ([Gen
28:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#004)).

\(3\) As Giver of fruitfulness, Almighty God (El Shaddai) chastens His
people. For the moral connection of chastening with fruit bearing, see
([Joh 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#002)); ([Heb
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#010)); ([Rut
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#020)). Hence, Almighty is the
characteristic name of God in Job, occurring thirty-one times in that
book. The hand of El Shaddai falls upon Job, the best man of his time,
not in judgment, but in purifying unto greater fruitfulness ([Job
5:17-25](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#017)).
