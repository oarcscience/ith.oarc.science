Book Introduction - Song of Solomon

Nowhere in Scripture does the unspiritual mind tread upon ground so
mysterious and incomprehensible as in this book, while the saintliest
men and women of the ages have found it a source of pure and exquisite
delight. That the love of the divine Bridegroom should follow all the
analogies of the marriage relation seems evil only to minds so ascetic
that martial desire itself seems to them unholy.

The interpretation is twofold: Primarily, the book is the expression of
pure marital love as ordained of God in creation, and the vindication of
that love as against both asceticism and lust--the two profanations of
the holiness of marriage. The secondary and larger interpretation is of
Christ, the Son and His heavenly bride, the Church ([Co2
11:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#001) refs).

In this sense the book has six divisions:

1\. The bride seen in restful communion with the Bridegroom (Song of
Songs 1:1 - 2:7).

2\. A lapse and restoration (Song of Songs 2:3 - 3:5).

3\. Joy of fellowship (Song of Songs 3:6 - 5:1).

4\. Separation of interest--the bride satisfied, the Bridegroom toiling
for others (Song of Songs 5:2-5).

5\. The bride seeking and witnessing (Song of Songs 5:6 - 6:3).

6\. Unbroken communion (Song of Songs 6:4 - 8:14).
