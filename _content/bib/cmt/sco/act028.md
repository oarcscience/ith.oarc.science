his own hired house

It has been much disputed whether Paul endured two Roman imprisonments,
from A.D. 62 to 68 or one. The tradition from Clement to Eusebius
favours two imprisonments with a year of liberty between.

Erdman (W.J.) has pointed out the leaving of Trophimus sick at Miletus,
mentioned in ([Ti2 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#020)) could not
have been an occurrence of Paul's last journey to Jerusalem, for then
Trophimus was not left; ([Act 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#004));
([Act 21:29](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#029)) nor of the journey to
Rome to appear before Caesar, for then he did not touch at Miletus.

To make this incident possible, there must have been a release from the
first imprisonment, and an interval of ministry and travel.
