<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pe2 1:18</span></span>

holy mount

Where the reference is to things, the meaning of "holy" or "sanctified"
is, simply, set apart for the use of God, or rendered sacred by the
divine presence.

[2 Peter 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#019)

whereunto

That is, made more sure by fulfilment in part. Fulfilled prophecy is a
proof of inspiration because the Scripture predictions of future events
were uttered so long before the events transpired that no merely human
sagacity or foresight could have anticipated them, and these predictions
are so detailed, minute, and specific, as to exclude the possibility
that they were mere fortunate guesses.

Hundreds of predictions concerning Israel, the land of Canaan, Babylon,
Assyria, Egypt, and numerous personages -- so ancient, so singular, so
seemingly improbable, as well as so detailed and definite that no mortal
could have anticipated them -- have been fulfilled by the elements, and
by men who were ignorant of them, or who utterly disbelieved them, or
who struggled with frantic desperation to avoid their fulfilment.

It is certain, therefore, that the Scriptures which contain them are
inspired. "Prophecy came not in olden time by the will of man; but holy
men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost". ([Pe2
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#021)).

a more sure

Or, the word of prophecy made more sure.

dark place

Or, squalid place. ([Psa 119:105](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#105));
([Joh 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#004)); ([Joh
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009)).

[2 Peter 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pe2 1:20</span></span>

any private

Its own interpretation; that is, not isolated from all that the Word has
given elsewhere.
