### [1 Corinthians Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#001)

[1 Corinthians 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#001)

rather

The subject is still the Greek, "pneumatika". Chapter 12 described the
gifts and the Body; Chapter 13 described the love which alone gives
ministry of gift any value; Chapter 14 regulates the ministry of gift in
the primitive, apostolic assembly of saints.

\(1\) The important gift is that of prophecy ([Co1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#001))). The New Testament prophet was
not merely a preacher, but an inspired preacher, through whom, until the
New Testament was written, new revelations suited to the new
dispensation were given ([Co1
14:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#029)).

\(2\) Tongues and the sign gifts are to cease, and meantime must be used
with restraint, and only if an interpreter be present ([Co1
14:1-19](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#001)); ([Co1
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#027)); ([Co1
14:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#028)).

\(3\) In the primitive church there was liberty for the ministry of all
the gifts which might be present, but for prophecy more especially ([Co1
14:23-26](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#023)); ([Co1
14:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#031)); ([Co1
14:39](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#039)).

\(4\) In such meetings, when "the whole church" came together "in one
place," women were required to keep silence ([Co1
14:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#034)); ([Co1
11:3-16](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#003)); ([Ti1
2:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#011)).

\(5\) These injunctions are declared to be "the commandments of the
Lord" ([Co1 14:36-37](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#036)).

[1 Corinthians 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co1 14:2</span></span>

an unknown

Or, a tongue; and so in ([Co1 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#004));
([Co1 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#013)); ([Co1
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#014)); ([Co1
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#019)); ([Co1
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#027)).

[1 Corinthians 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">co1 14:20</span></span>

be not children

(Greek, "paidion", "youths").

be ye children

Babies.

[1 Corinthians 14:34](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#034)

obedience

Compare ([Gen 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#016)).
