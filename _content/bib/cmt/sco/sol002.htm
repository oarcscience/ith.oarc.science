<p>so is 
<p>
<p>How poor are the similes of the bride as compared with those of the Bridegroom. To him, she is a "lily among thorns; she can only say that he is "as the apple tree among the trees of the wood."

<p>our wall

<p>"Our wall." The bride had returned to her own home: the Bridegroom seeks her.

<p>
<p>dove 
<p>
<p>There is beautiful order here. First we have what the bride is as seen in Christ, "My dove." In herself most faulty; in Him "blameless and harmless" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#015">Phi 2:15</A>) the very character of the dove. The bride's place of safety, "in the clefts of the rock" -- hidden, so to speak, in the wounds of Christ. Thirdly, her privilege. "Stairs" speaks of access. It is not "secret places," as in A.V, but "the secret of the stairs" -- the way and privilege of access to His presence; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#018">Eph 2:18</A>); (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#001">Col 3:1</A>); (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#019">Heb 10:19-22</A>). Fourthly, the order of approach: she is to come near before she speaks, "Let me see thy countenance," then "Let me hear thy voice." Lastly, now that she is near and has spoken, He speaks a tender word of admonition: "Take us the foxes," etc.
