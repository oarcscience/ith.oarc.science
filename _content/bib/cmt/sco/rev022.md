holy

Sanctification, holiness, Summary:

\(1\) In both Testaments, the same Hebrew and Greek words are rendered
by the English works "sanctify" and "holy," in their various grammatical
forms. The one uniform meaning is, "to set apart for God."

\(2\) In both Testaments, the words are used of "things" and "persons".

\(3\) When used of things, no moral quality is implied; they are
sanctified or made holy because set apart for God.

\(4\) Sanctification, when used of persons, has a threefold meaning.

\(a\) In position, believers are eternally set apart for God by
redemption, "through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once"
([Heb 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#009)); ([Heb
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#010)). Positionally, therefore,
believers are "saints" and "holy" from the moment of believing; ([Phi
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#001)); ([Heb
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#001)).

\(b\) In experience, the believer is being sanctified by the work of the
Holy Spirit through the Scriptures ([Joh
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#017)); ([Co2
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#018)); ([Eph
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#025)); ([Eph
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#026)); ([Th1
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#023)); ([Th1
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#024)).

\(c\) In consummation, the believer's complete sanctification awaits the
appearing of the Lord ([Eph 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#027));
([Jo1 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#002)).

See "Salvation," (See Scofield) - ([Rom
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#016)).

Inspiration:

Summary. The testimony of the Bible to itself.

\(1\) The writers affirm, where they speak of the subject at all, they
speak by direct divine authority.

\(2\) They invariably testify that the words, and not the ideas merely,
are inspired. The most important passage is ([Co1
2:7-15](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#007)) which see.

\(3\) The whole attitude of Jesus Christ toward the Old Testament, as
disclosed in His words, both before His death and after His
resurrection, confirms its truth and divine origin, and He explicitly
ascribes the Pentateuch to Moses.

\(4\) In promising subsequent revelations after the predicted advent of
the Spirit ([Joh 16:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#012)) our Lord
prepared the way for the New Testament.

\(5\) The writers of the New Testament invariably treat the Old
Testament as authoritative and inspired.

(See Scofield) - ([Pe2 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#019)).

(See Scofield) - ([Co1 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#013)).

life

Eternal life, Summary of the teaching:

\(1\) The life is called "eternal" because it was from the eternity
which is past unto the eternity which is to come -- it is the life of
God revealed in Jesus Christ, who is God. ([Joh
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#004)); ([Joh
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#026)); ([Jo1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001)); ([Jo1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#002)).

\(2\) This life of God, which was revealed in Christ, is imparted in a
new birth by the Holy Spirit, acting upon the word of God, to every
believer on the Lord Jesus Christ. ([Joh
3:3-15](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#003)).

\(3\) The life thus imparted was from the beginning." But the recipient
is a "new creation". ([Co2 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#017));
([Gal 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#015)).

\(4\) The life of God which is the believer is an unsevered part of the
life which eternally was, and eternally is, in Christ Jesus -- one life,
in Him and in the believer -- Vine and branches; Head and members. ([Co1
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#017)); ([Gal
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#020)); ([Col
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#027)); ([Col
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#003)); ([Col
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#004)); ([Jo1
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#011)); ([Jo1
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#012)); ([Joh
15:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#001)); ([Co1
12:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#012)).
