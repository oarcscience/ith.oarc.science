Six Marys

Six Marys are to be distinguished in the New Testament:

\(1\) the mother of Jesus; always clearly identified by the context.

\(2\) Mary Magdalene, a woman of Magdala, "out of whom went seven
demons" ([Luk 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#002)) She is never
mentioned apart from the identifying word "Magdalene."

\(3\) The mother of James (called "the less," ([Mar
15:40](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#040)) and Joses, the apostles. A
comparison of; ([Joh 19:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#025)); ([Mat
27:56](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#056)); ([Mar
15:40](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#040)) establishes the inference that
this Mary, the mother of James the less, and of Joses was the wife of
Alphaeus (called also Cleophas), ([Joh
19:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#025)) and a sister of Mary the mother
of Jesus. Except in; ([Mat 27:61](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#061));
([Mat 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#001)) where she is called "the
other Mary (that is, "other" than her sister, Mary the Virgin); and
([Joh 19:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#025)) where she is called "of
Cleophas," she is mentioned only in connection with one or both of her
sons.

\(4\) Mary of Bethany, sister of Martha and Lazarus, mentioned by name
only in ([Luk 10:39-42](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#039)); ([Joh
11:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#001)); ([Joh
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#019)); ([Joh
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#020)); ([Joh
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#028)); ([Joh
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#031)); ([Joh
11:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#032)); ([Joh
11:45](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#045)); ([Joh
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#003)) but referred to in ([Mat
26:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#007)); ([Mar
14:3-9](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#003)).

\(5\) The mother of John Mark and sister of Barnabas ([Act
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#012)).

\(6\) A helper of Paul in Rome ([Rom
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#006)).

of whom was born

The changed expression here is important. It is no longer, "who begat,"
but, "Mary, of whom was born Jesus." Jesus was not begotten of natural
generation.

Christ

Christ (Greel, "Christos", means "anointed"), the Greek form of the
Hebrew, "Messiah" ([Dan 9:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025)) is
the official name of our Lord, as Jesus is his human name; ([Luk
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#031)); ([Luk
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#021)). The name, or title, "Christ"
connects Him with the entire Old Testament foreview

(See Scofield) - ([Zac 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#008))

of a coming prophet ([Deu 18:15-19](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#015));
Priest ([Psa 110:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#004)) and king ([Sa2
7:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#007)). As these were typically
anointed with oil; ([Kg1 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#016)); ([Exo
29:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#007)); ([Sa1
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#013)) so Jesus was anointed with the
Holy Spirit; ([Mat 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#016)); ([Mar
1:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#010)); ([Luk
3:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#021)); ([Joh
1:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#032)) thus becoming officially "the
Christ."
