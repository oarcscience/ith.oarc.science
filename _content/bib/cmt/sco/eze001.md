living creatures

The "living creatures" are identical with the Cherubim. The subject is
somewhat obscure, but from the position of the Cherubim at the gate of
Eden, upon the cover of the ark of the covenant, and in Revelation 4, it
is clearly gathered that they have to do with vindication of the
holiness of God as against the presumptuous pride of sinful man who,
despite his sin, would "put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of
life" ([Gen 3:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#022)). Upon the ark of
the covenant, of one substance with the mercy-seat, they saw the
sprinkled blood which, in type, spake of the perfect maintenance of the
divine righteousness by the sacrifice of Christ ([Exo
25:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#017)).

(See Scofield) - ([Rom 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#024)).

(See Scofield) - ([Rom 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025)).

(See Scofield) - ([Rom 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#026)).

The living creatures (or Cherubim) appear to be actual beings of the
angelic order.

(See Scofield) - ([Isa 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#002)).

The Cherubim or living creatures are not identical with the Seraphim.
([Isa 6:2-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#002)). They appear to have to
do with the holiness of God as outraged by sin; the Seraphim with
uncleanness in the people of God. The passage in Ezekiel is highly
figurative, but the effect was the revelation to the prophet of the
Shekinah glory of the Lord. Such revelations are connected invariably
with new blessing and service.

Compare ([Exo 3:2-10](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#002)); ([Isa
6:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#001)); ([Dan
10:5-14](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#005)); ([Rev
1:12-19](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#012)).
