Holy Ghost

The Holy Spirit, New Testament Summary.

See Note (See Scofield) - ([Mal 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#015)).

\(1\) The Holy Spirit is revealed as a divine Person. This is expressly
declared (for example) ([Joh 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#016));
([Joh 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#017)); ([Joh
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#026)); ([Joh
15:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#026)); ([Joh
16:7-15](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#007)); ([Mat
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#019)) and everywhere implied.

\(2\) The revelation concerning Him is progressive

\(a\) In the Old Testament,

(See Scofield) - ([Mal 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#015)),

He comes upon whom He will, apparently without reference to conditions
in them

\(b\) During His earth-life, Christ taught His disciples ([Luk
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#013)) that they might receive the
Spirit through prayer to the Father.

\(c\) At the close of His ministry He promised that He would Himself
pray the Father, and that in answer to prayer the Comforter would come
to abide ([Joh 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#016)); ([Joh
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#017)).

\(d\) On the evening of His resurrection He came to the disciples in the
upper room, and breathed on them saying, "Receive ye the Holy Ghost"
([Joh 20:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#022)) but instructed them to
wait before beginning their ministry till the Spirit should come upon
them; ([Luk 24:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#049)); ([Act
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#008)).

\(e\) On the day of Pentecost the Spirit came upon the whole body of
believers ([Act 2:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#001)).

\(f\) After Pentecost, so long as the Gospel was preached to Jews only,
the Spirit was imparted to such as believed by the laying on of hands
([Act 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#017)); ([Act
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#017)).

\(g\) When Peter opened the door of the kingdom to the Gentiles (Acts
10), the Holy Spirit, without delay, or other condition than faith, was
given to those who believed. ([Act
10:44](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#044)); ([Act
11:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#015)). This is the permanent fact
for the entire church age. Every believer is born of the Spirit; ([Joh
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#003)); ([Joh
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#006)); ([Jo1
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#001)) indwelt by the Spirit, whose
presence makes the believer's body a temple; ([Co1
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#019)); ([Rom
8:9-15](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#009)); ([Jo1
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#027)); ([Gal
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#006)) and baptized by the Spirit; ([Co1
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#012)); ([Co1
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#013)); ([Jo1
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#020)); ([Jo1
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#027)) thus sealing him for God; ([Eph
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#013)); ([Eph
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#030)).

\(3\) The New Testament distinguishes between having the Spirit, which
is true of all believers, and being filled with the Spirit, which is the
believer's privilege and duty (compare ([Act
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#004)) with ([Act
4:29-31](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#029)); ([Eph
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#013)); ([Eph
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#014)) with ([Eph
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#018)). -- "One baptism, many
fillings."

\(4\) The Holy Spirit is related to Christ in His Conception ([Mat
1:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#018)); ([Luk
1:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#035)) baptism; ([Mat
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#016)); ([Mar
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#010)); ([Luk
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#022)); ([Joh
1:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#032)); ([Joh
1:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#033)) walk and service ([Luk
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#001)); ([Luk
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#014)) resurrection ([Rom
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#011)); and as His witness throughout
this age; ([Joh 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#026)); ([Joh
16:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#008)); ([Joh
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#013)); ([Joh
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#014)).

\(5\) The Spirit forms the church ([Mat
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018)),

(See Scofield) - ([Heb 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#023)),

by baptizing all believers into the body of Christ ([Co1
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#012)); ([Co1
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#013)); imparts gifts for service to
every member of that body ([Co1
12:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#007)); ([Co1
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#027)); ([Co1
12:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#030)); guide the members in their
service; ([Luk 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#027)); ([Luk
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#001)); ([Act
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#006)); ([Act
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#007)) and is Himself the power of that
service; ([Act 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#008)); ([Act
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#004)); ([Co1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#004)).

\(6\) The Spirit abides in the company of believers who constitute a
local church, making of them, corporately, a temple ([Co1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#016)); ([Co1
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#017)).

\(7\) Christ indicates a threefold personal relationship of the Spirit
to the believer: "With", "In", "upon" ([Joh
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#017)); ([Luk
24:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#049)); ([Act
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#008)). "With" indicates the approach of
God to the soul, convicting of sin ([Joh
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#009)) presenting Christ as the object
of faith ([Joh 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#014)) imparting faith
([Eph 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#008)) and regenerating ([Joh
3:3-16](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#003)). "In" describes the abiding
presence of the Spirit in the believer's body ([Co1
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#019)) to give victory over the flesh;
([Rom 8:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#002)); ([Gal
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#016)); ([Gal
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#017)) to create the Christian
character ([Gal 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#022)); ([Gal
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#023)) to help infirmities ([Rom
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#026)) to inspire prayer ([Eph
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#018)) to give conscious access to God
([Eph 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#018)) to actualize to the
believer his sonship ([Gal 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#006)) to
apply the Scripture in cleansing and sanctification; ([Eph
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#026)); ([Th2
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#013)); ([Pe1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#002)) to comfort and intercede; ([Act
9:31](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#031)); ([Rom
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#026)) and to reveal Christ ([Joh
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#014)).

\(8\) Sins against the Spirit committed by unbelievers are: To blaspheme
([Mat 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#031)); resist ([Act
7:51](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#051)); insult ([Heb
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#029)); "despite," Literally, insult).
Believers' sins against the Spirit are: To grieve Him by allowing evil
in heart or life ([Eph 4:30](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#030)); ([Eph
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#031)) and to quench Him by
disobedience ([Th1 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#019)).

The right attitude toward the Spirit is yieldedness to His sway in walk
and service, and in constant willingness that He shall "put away"
whatever grieves Him or hinders His power ([Eph
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#031)).

\(9\) The symbols of the Spirit are:

\(a\) oil ([Joh 3:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#034)); ([Heb
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#009))

\(b\) water, ([Joh 7:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#038)); ([Joh
7:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#039)),

\(c\) wind; ([Act 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#002)); ([Joh
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#008)),

\(d\) fire ([Act 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#003)),

\(e\) a dove ([Mat 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#016)),

\(f\) a seal; ([Eph 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#013)); ([Eph
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#030)),

\(g\) an earnest or pledge ([Eph
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#014)).

said unto them

The theme of Peter's sermon at Pentecost is stated in ([Act
2:36](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#036)). It is, that Jesus is the
Messiah. No message could have been more unwelcome to the Jews who had
rejected His Messianic claims, and crucified Him. Peter, therefore, does
not announce his theme until he has covered every possible Jewish
objection. The point of difficulty with the Jews was the apparent
failure of the clear and repeated prophetic promise of a regathered
Israel established in their own land under their covenanted King (for
example, ([Isa 11:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#010)); ([Jer
23:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005)); ([Eze
37:21-18](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#021)). Instead of explaining, as
Rome first taught, followed by some Protestant commentators, that the
covenant and promises were to be fulfilled in the church in a so-called
"spiritual" sense, Peter shows ([Act
2:25-32](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#025)) from Psalm 16 that David
himself understood that the dead and risen Christ would fulfil the
covenant and sit on his throne ([Luk
1:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#032)); ([Luk
1:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#033)). In precisely the same way James
([Act 15:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#014)) met the same
difficulty.

12:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#008)).

last days

A distinction must be observed between "the last days" when the
prediction relates to Israel, and the "last days" when the prediction
relates to the church ([Ti1 4:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#001));
([Ti2 3:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#001)); ([Heb
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#001)); ([Heb
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002)); ([Pe1
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#004)); ([Pe1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#005)); ([Pe2
3:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#001)); ([Jo1
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#018)); ([Jo1
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#019)); ([Jde
1:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#017)). Also distinguish the
expression the "last days" (plural) from "the last day" (singular); the
latter expression referring to the resurrections and last judgment;
([Joh 6:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#039)); ([Joh
6:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#040)); ([Joh
6:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#044)); ([Joh
6:54](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#054)); ([Joh
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#024)); ([Joh
12:48](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#048)). The "last days" as related to
the church began with the advent of Christ ([Heb
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002)) but have especial reference to
the time of declension and apostasy at the end of this age; ([Ti2
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#001)); ([Ti2
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#004)). The "last days" as related to
Israel are the days of Israel's exaltation and blessing, and are
synonymous with the kingdom-age; ([Isa
2:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002)); ([Mic
4:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#001)). They are "last" not with
reference to this dispensation, but with reference to the whole of
Israel's history.
