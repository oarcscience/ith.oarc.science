[Revelation 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rev 1:20</span></span>

angels

The natural explanation of the "messengers" is that they were men sent
by the seven churches to ascertain the state of the aged apostle, now an
exile in Patmos (compare ([Phi 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#018))
but they figure any who bear God's messages to a church.

churches

The messages to the seven churches have a fourfold application:

\(1\) Local, to the churches actually addressed;

\(2\) Admonitory, to all churches in all time as tests by which they may
discern their true spiritual state in the sight of God;

\(3\) Personal, in the exhortations to him "that hath an ear," and in
the promise "to him that overcometh"; and

\(4\) Prophetic, as disclosing seven phases of the spiritual history of
the church from, say, A.D. 96 to the end.

It is incredible that in a prophecy covering the church period, there
should be no such foreview. These messages must contain that foreview if
it is in the book at all, for the church does not appear after ([Rev
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#022)). Again, these messages by their
very terms go beyond the local assemblies mentioned. Most conclusively
of all, these messages do present an exact foreview of the spiritual
history of the church, and in this precise order.

Ephesus gives the general state at the date of the writing; Smyrna, the
period of the great persecutions; Pergamos, the church settled down in
the world, "where Satan's throne is," after the conversion of
Constantine, say A.D. 316. Thyatira is the Papacy, developed out of the
Pergamos state: Balaamism (worldliness) and Nicolaitanism (priestly
assumption) having conquered. As Jezebel brought idolatry into Israel,
so Romanism weds Christian doctrine to pagan ceremonies. Sardis is the
Protestant Reformation, whose works were not "fulfilled." Philadelphia
is whatever bears clear testimony to the Word and the Name in the time
of self-satisfied profession represented by Laodicea.
