### [Genesis Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#001)

[Genesis 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 4:1</span></span>

Cain

Cain ("acquisition") is a type of the mere man of the earth. His
religion was destitute of any adequate sense of sin, or need of
atonement. This religious type is described in 2 Peter 2. Seven things
are said of him:

\(1\) he worships in self-will

\(2\) is angry with God

\(3\) refuses to bring a sin offering

\(4\) murders his brother

\(5\) lies to God

\(6\) becomes a vagabond

\(7\) is, nevertheless, the object of the divine solicitude.

[Genesis 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 4:2</span></span>

Abel

Abel ("exhalation," or, "that which ascends") is a type of the spiritual
man. His sacrifice, in which atoning blood was shed ([Heb
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#022)) was therefore at once his
confession of sin and the expression of his faith in the interposition
of a substitute ([Heb 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#004)).

[Genesis 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#003)

[Genesis 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 4:4</span></span>

Abel

Abel ("exhalation," or, "that which ascends") is a type of the spiritual
man. His sacrifice, in which atoning blood was shed ([Heb
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#022)) was therefore at once his
confession of sin and the expression of his faith in the interposition
of a substitute ([Heb 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#004)).

flock

Type of Christ, the Lamb of God, the most constant type of the suffering
Messiah -- "the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world" ([Joh
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#029)).

A lamb fitly symbolizes the unresisting innocency and harmlessness of
the Lord Jesus ([Isa 53:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#007)); ([Luk
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#009)); ([Mat
26:53](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#053)); ([Mat
26:54](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#054)). This type is brought into
prominence by contrast with Cain's bloodless offering of the fruit of
his own works, and proclaims, in the very infancy of the race, the
primal truth that "without shedding of blood is no remission"; ([Heb
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#022)); ([Heb
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#004)).

[Genesis 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 4:7</span></span>

sin

Or, sin-offering. In Hebrew the same word is used for "sin," and
"sin-offering," thus emphasizing in a remarkable way the complete
identification of the believer's sin with his sin offering (cf) ([Joh
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#014)); ([Co2
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#021)).

Here both meanings are brought together. "Sin lieth at the door," but so
also "a sin-offering croucheth at the tent door." It is "where sin
abounded" that "grace did much more abound" ([Rom
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#020)).

Abel's offering implies a previous instruction (cf) ([Gen
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#021)) for it was "by faith" ([Heb
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#004)) and faith is taking God at His
word; so that Cain's unbloody offering was a refusal of the divine way.
But Jehovah made a last appeal to Cain ([Gen
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#007)) even yet to bring the required
offering.

[Genesis 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gen 4:15</span></span>

mark

That is, for Cain's protection. The law of ([Gen
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#006)) was not yet enacted.

[Genesis 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gen 4:16</span></span>

Nod

Literally, wandering.

[Genesis 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">gen 4:17</span></span>

builded a city

The first civilization, that which perished in the judgment of the
Flood, was Cainitic in origin, character, and destiny. Every element of
material civilization is mentioned in verses ([Gen
4:16-22](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#016)); city and pastoral life, and
the development of arts and manufactures. Enoch, after whom the first
city was named, means "teacher." The el termination of the names of
Enoch's son and grandson shows that for a time the knowledge of Elohim
was preserved, but this soon disappears ([Rom
1:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#021)). Adah means "pleasure," or
"adornment"; Zillah, to "hide"; Lamech, "conqueror," or "wild man."
Compare ([Rom 1:21-25](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#021)).

(See Scofield) - ([Gen 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#004)).

The Cainitic civilization may have been as splendid as that of Greece or
Rome, but the divine judgment is according to the moral state, not the
material. ([Gen 6:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#005)).

[Genesis 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">gen 4:23</span></span>

to my wounding

Or, who wounded me. Cain had slain an unoffending man and yet was
protected by Jehovah; how much more Lamech, who had slain in
self-defence.

[Genesis 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">gen 4:25</span></span>

Seth

That is, "Sheth", means "appointed".

[Genesis 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">gen 4:26</span></span>

Enos

That is, mortal.

call upon the name

Or, call themselves by the name of Jehovah.

Contrast ([Gen 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#008)); ([Gen
26:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#025)).
