### [Genesis Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#001)

[Genesis 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 2:3</span></span>

sanctified

In the Old Testament The same Hebrew word (qodesh) is translated
sanctify, consecrate, dedicate, and holy. It means, set apart for the
service of God. See refs. Following "Sanctify,"

(See Scofield) - ([Gen 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#003)).

[Genesis 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#004)

Lord

LORD (Hebrew Jehovah)

\(1\) The primary meaning of the name LORD (Jehovah) is the
"self-existent One." Literally (as in ([Exo
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#014)), "He that is who He is,
therefore the eternal I AM:"

But Havah, from which Jehovah, or Yahweh, is formed, signifies also "to
become," that is, to become known, thus pointing to a continuous and
increasing self-revelation. Combining these meanings of Havah, we arrive
at the meaning of the name Jehovah. He is "the self-existent One who
reveals Himself." The name is, in itself, an advance upon the name "God"
(El, Elah, Elohim), which suggests certain attributes of Deity, as
strength, etc, rather than His essential being.

\(2\) It is significant that the first appearance of the name Jehovah in
Scripture follows the creation of man. It was God (Elohim) who said,
"Let us make man in our image" ([Gen
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#026)); but when man, as in the second
chapter of Genesis, is to fill the scene and become dominant over
creation, it is the Lord God (Jehovah Elohim) who acts. This clearly
indicates a special relation of Deity, in His Jehovah character, to man,
and all Scripture emphasizes this.

\(3\) Jehovah is distinctly the redemption name of Deity. When sin
entered and redemption became necessary, it was Jehovah Elohim who
sought the sinning ones ([Gen 3:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#009))
and clothed them with "coats of skins" ([Gen
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#021)) a beautiful type of
righteousness provided by the Lord God through sacrifice ([Rom
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#021)); ([Rom
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#022)). The first distinct revelation
of Himself by His name Jehovah was in connection with the redemption of
the covenant people out of Egypt ([Exo
3:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#013)). As Redeemer, emphasis is
laid upon those attributes of Jehovah which the sin and salvation of man
bring into exercise. These are:

\(a\) His holiness ([Lev 11:44](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#044)); ([Lev
11:45](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#045)); ([Lev
19:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#001)); ([Lev
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#026)); ([Hab
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#012)); ([Hab
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#013)).

\(b\) His hatred and judgment of sin; ([Deu
32:35-42](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#035)); ([Gen
6:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#005)); ([Psa
11:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#004)); ([Psa
66:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#018)); ([Exo
34:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#006)); ([Exo
34:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#007)).

\(c\) His love for and redemption of sinners, but always righteously;
([Gen 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#021)); ([Gen
8:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#020)); ([Exo
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#012)); ([Exo
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#013)); ([Lev
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#002)); ([Lev
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#003)); ([Isa
53:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#005)); ([Isa
53:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#010)) Salvation by Jehovah apart from
sacrifice is unknown to Scripture.

\(4\) In his redemptive relation to man, Jehovah has seven compound
names which reveal Him as meeting every need of man from his lost state
to the end. These compound names are:

\(a\) Jehovah-jireh; "the Lord will provide" ([Gen
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#013)); ([Gen
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#014)) i.e, will provide a sacrifice;

\(b\) Jehovah-rapha; "the Lord that healeth" ([Exo
15:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#026)). That this refers to physical
healing the context shows, but the deeper healing of soul malady is
implied.

\(c\) Jehovah-nissi; "the Lord our banner" ([Exo
17:8-15](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#008)). The name is interpreted by
the context. The enemy was Amalek, a type of the flesh, and the conflict
that day stands for the conflict of ([Gal
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#017)) the war of the Spirit against
the flesh. Victory was wholly due to divine help.

\(d\) Jehovah-Shalom; "the Lord our peace," or "the Lord send peace"
([Jdg 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#024)). Almost the whole ministry
of Jehovah finds expression and illustration in that chapter. Jehovah
hates and judges sin ([Gen 2:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#001)).
Jehovah loves and saves sinners ([Gen
2:7-18](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#007)) but only through sacrifice
([Gen 2:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#019)) see also; ([Rom
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#001)); ([Eph
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014)); ([Col
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#020)).

\(e\) Jehovah-ra-ah; "the Lord my shepherd" (Psa 23.). In Ps. 22 Jehovah
makes peace by the blood of the cross; in Ps 23. Jehovah is shepherding
His own who are in the world. (See Scofield) - ([Joh
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#007)).

\(f\) Jehovah-tsidkenu; "the Lord our righteousness" ([Jer
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#006)). This name of Jehovah occurs in
a prophecy concerning the future restoration and conversion of Israel.
Then Israel will hail him as Jehovah-tsidkenu -- "the Lord our
righteousness."

\(g\) Jehovah-shammah; "the Lord is present" ([Eze
48:35](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#035)). This name signifies Jehovah's
abiding presence with His people; ([Exo
33:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#014)); ([Exo
33:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#015)); ([Ch1
16:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#027)); ([Ch1
16:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#033)); ([Psa
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#011)); ([Psa
97:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#005)); ([Mat
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#020)); ([Heb
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#005))

\(5\) Lord (Jehovah) is also the distinctive name of Deity as in
covenant with Israel ([Exo 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#003));
([Exo 20:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#001)); ([Jer
31:31-34](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#031)).

\(6\) Lord God (Hebrew, Jehovah Elohim) is the first of the compound
names of Deity. Lord God is used distinctly:

\(1\) of the relation of Deity to man

\(a\) as Creator ([Gen 2:7-15](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#007))

\(b\) as morally in authority over man ([Gen
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#016)); ([Gen
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#017))

\(c\) as creating and governing the earthly relationships of man; ([Gen
2:18-24](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#018)); ([Gen
3:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#016)); ([Gen
3:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#022)) and

\(d\) as redeeming man ([Gen 3:8-15](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#008));
([Gen 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#021))

\(2\) of the relation of Deity to Israel ([Gen
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#007)); ([Gen
28:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#013)); ([Exo
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#015)); ([Exo
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#018)); ([Exo
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#005)); ([Exo
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#001)); ([Exo
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#006)); ([Deu
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#011)); ([Deu
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#021)); ([Deu
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#001)); ([Deu
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#003)); ([Deu
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#001)); ([Jos
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#013)); ([Jos
7:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#019)); ([Jos
10:40-42](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#040)); ([Jdg
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#012)); ([Sa1
2:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#030)); ([Kg1
1:48](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#048)); ([Kg2
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#006)); ([Kg2
10:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#031)); ([Ch1
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#019)); ([Ch2
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#009)); ([Ezr
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#003)); ([Isa
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#017)).
