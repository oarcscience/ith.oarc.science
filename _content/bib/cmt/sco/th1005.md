whole spirit and soul and body

Man as a trinity. That the human soul and spirit are not identical is
proved by the facts that they are divisible, ([Heb
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#012)), and that soul and spirit are
sharply distinguished in the burial and resurrection of the body. It is
sown a natural body (Greek, "soma psuchikon" meaning "soul-body"), it is
raised a spiritual body (Greek, "soma pneumatikon" meaning
"spirit-body"). ([Co1 15:44](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#044)).

To assert, therefore, that there is no difference between soul and
spirit is to assert that there is no difference between the mortal body
and the resurrection body. In Scripture use, the distinction between
spirit and soul may be traced. Briefly, that distinction is that the
spirit is that part of man which "knows" ([Co1
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#011)) his mind; the soul is the seat
of the affections, desires, and so of the emotions, and of the active
will, the self. "My soul is exceeding sorrowful" ([Mat
26:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#038)).

See also; ([Mat 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#029)); ([Joh
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#027)).

The word transliterated "soul" in the Old Testament (Hebrew, "nephesh")
is the exact equivalent of the New Testament word for soul (Greek,
"psuchē"), and the use of "soul" in the Old Testament is identical with
the use of that word in the New Testament (see, for example); ([Deu
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#005)); ([Deu
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#026)); ([Sa1
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#001)); ([Sa1
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#004)); ([Sa1
20:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#017)); ([Job
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#011)); ([Job
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#015)); ([Job
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#022)); ([Psa
42:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#006)); ([Psa
84:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#002)).

The New Testament word for spirit (Greek, "pneuma") like the Old
Testament (Hebrew, "ruach"), is translated, "air", "breath", "wind," but
predominantly "spirit," whether of God (for example); ([Gen
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#002)); ([Mat
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#016)) or of man; ([Gen
41:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#008)); ([Co1
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#005)).

Because man is "spirit", he is capable of God-consciousness, and of
communication with God; ([Job 32:8](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#008));
([Psa 18:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#028)); ([Pro
20:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#027)); because he is "soul", he has
self-consciousness; ([Psa 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#002)); ([Psa
42:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#005)); ([Psa
42:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#006)); ([Psa
42:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#011)); and, because he is "body", he
has, through his senses, world consciousness.

(See Scofield) - ([Gen 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#026)).
