### [Exodus Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#001)

[Exodus 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#001)

second month

That is, May.

according

Compare ([Joh 6:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#033)); ([Joh
6:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#041)); ([Joh
6:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#042)); ([Joh
6:52](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#052)).

Christ gives himself unreservedly, but we have no more of Him than faith
appropriates, ([Exo 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#018)); ([Exo
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#002)); ([Jos
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001)). ([Exo
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#002)) is our title. ([Exo
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#003)) is the law of possession:

[Exodus 16:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#020)

left

As we are not nourished by the memory of food, so neither can
spirituality be sustained on past appropriations of Christ.

manna

Manna, type of Christ as the "bread of life," come down from heaven to
die "for the life of the world." ([Joh
6:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#035)); ([Joh
6:48-51](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#048)). A "small" thing ([Exo
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#014)) having but the taste of "fresh
oil." ([Num 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#008)) or "wafers with
honey" ([Exo 16:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#031)); it typifies
Christ in humiliation as presented in Matthew, Mark, and Luke; "having
no form nor comeliness; . . . no beauty that we should desire him" ([Isa
53:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#002)). But as such He must be received
by faith if we would be saved ([Joh
6:53-58](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#053)). To meditate upon Christ as
He went about among men, doing not His own will but the will of the
Father ([Joh 6:38-40](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#038)) is to feed on
the manna. This is, of necessity, the spiritual food of young believers,
and answers to "milk" ([Co1 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#001));
([Co1 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#002)).

But Christ in glory, and the believer's present and eternal association
with Him there, answers to "the old corn of the land" ([Jos
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#011)) the "meat" of ([Heb
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#013)); ([Heb
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#014)) or Christ as presented in the
Epistles of Paul.

Compare ([Co2 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#016)).
