[Daniel 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">dan 9:24</span></span>

Seventy weeks

These are "weeks" or more accurately, sevens of years; seventy weeks of
seven years each. Within these "weeks" the national chastisement must be
ended and the nation re-established in everlasting righteousness ([Dan
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024)). The seventy weeks are divided
into seven = 49 years; sixty-two = 434 years; one = 7 years ([Dan
9:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025)). In the seven weeks = 49
years, Jerusalem was to be rebuilt in "troublous times." This was
fulfilled, as Ezra and Nehemiah record. Sixty-two weeks = 434 years,
thereafter Messiah was to come ([Dan
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025)). This was fulfilled in the birth
and manifestation of Christ. ([Dan
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026)); ([Dan
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026)) is obviously an indeterminate
period. The date of the crucifixion is not fixed. It is only said to be
"after" the threescore and two weeks. It is the first event in ([Dan
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026)). The second event is the
destruction of the city, fulfilled A.D. 70. Then, "unto the end," a
period not fixed, but which has already lasted nearly 2000 years. To
Daniel was revealed only that wars and desolations should continue
(Compare ([Mat 24:6-14](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#006)).

The New Testament reveals, that which was hidden from the Old Testament
prophets; ([Mat 13:11-17](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#011)); ([Eph
3:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#001)) that during this period should
be accomplished the mysteries of the kingdom of Heaven ([Mat
13:1-50](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#001)) and the out-calling of the
Church; ([Mat 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018)); ([Rom
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#025)). When the Church-age will end,
and the seventieth week begin, is nowhere revealed. Its duration can be
but seven years. To make it more violates the principle of
interpretation already confirmed by fulfilment. ([Dan
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027)) deals with the last week. The
"he" of ([Dan 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027)) is the "prince
that shall come" of ([Dan 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026)); whose
people (Rome) destroyed the temple, A.D. 70. He is the same with the
"little horn" of chapter 7. He will covenant with the Jews to restore
their temple sacrifices for one week (seven years), but in the middle of
that time he will break the covenant and fulfil; ([Dan
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#011)); ([Th2
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#003)); ([Th2
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#004)). Between the sixty-ninth week,
after which Messiah was cut off, and the seventieth week, within which
the "little horn" of Daniel 7. will run his awful course, intervenes
this entire Church-age. ([Dan 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027))
deals with the last three and a half years of the seven, which are
identical with the "great tribulation." ([Mat
24:15-28](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#015)) "time of trouble" ([Dan
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001)) hour of temptation" ([Rev
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#010)).

(see "Tribulation,"; ([Psa 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#005)); ([Rev
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#014)).

(See Scofield) - ([Psa 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#005)).

make reconciliation

There is no word in the Old Testament properly rendered reconcile. In
the A.V. The English word is found ([Sa1
29:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#004)); ([Ch2
29:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#024)); ([Lev
6:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#030)); ([Lev
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#015)); ([Lev
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#020)); ([Eze
45:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#015)); ([Eze
45:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#017)); ([Eze
45:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#020)); ([Dan
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024)) but always improperly; atonement
is invariably the meaning. Reconciliation is a New Testament doctrine
([Rom 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#010))?

(See Scofield) - ([Col 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#021)).

thy people

Compare ([Hos 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#009)).

The Jews, rejected, are "thy people," that is, Daniel's, not Jehovah's
though yet to be restored.

reconciliation

Hebrew, kaphar, atonement. See this verse note 1, and see note, ([Exo
29:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#033)) (See Scofield) - ([Exo
29:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#033)).

[Daniel 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">dan 9:25</span></span>

from the going forth of the commandment

Three decrees concerning Jerusalem are recorded, that of Cyrus, B.C. 536
(Ussher), for the restoration of the "house of the Lord God of Israel"
([Ch2 36:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#022)); ([Ch2
36:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#023)); ([Ezr
1:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001)) that of Darius ([Eze
6:3-8](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#003)) B.C. 521-486), and that of
Artaxerxes in his seventh year. ([Eze
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#007)) say, B.C. 458). Artaxerxes in his
twentieth year, B.C. 444 (Hales, Jahn), 446 (A.V.), 454 (Ussher,
Hengstenberg), gave permission for the rebuilding of the "city," i.e,
"Jerusalem" ([Neh 2:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#001)). The latter
decree is, obviously, that from which the "seven weeks" (49 years) run,
unless by "the commandment to restore," etc. Is meant the divine decree
([Dan 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#023)). In the present state of
biblical chronology the date of the decree of Artaxerxes cannot be
unanswerably fixed farther than to say that it was issued between 454
and 444 B.C. In either case we are brought to the time of Christ.
Prophetic time is invariably so near as to give full warning, so
indeterminate as to give no satisfaction to mere curiosity. (Compare
[Mat 24:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#036)); ([Act
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#007)).

The 434 years reckon, of course, from the end of the seven weeks so that
the whole time from "the going forth of the commandment to restore,"
etc, "unto the Messiah" is sixty-nine weeks of years, or 483 years.

[Daniel 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">dan 9:27</span></span>

abominations

(Compare [Mat 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#015)).

The expression occurs three times in Daniel. In; ([Dan
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027)); ([Dan
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#011)) the reference is to the
"Beast," "man of sin"; ([Th2 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#003));
([Th2 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#004)) and is identical with ([Mat
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#015)). In ([Dan
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#031)) the reference is to the act of
Antiochus Epiphanes, the prototype of the man of sin, who sacrificed a
sow upon the altar, and entered the holy of holies.
