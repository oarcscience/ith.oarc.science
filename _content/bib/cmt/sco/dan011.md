### [Daniel Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#001)

[Daniel 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">dan 11:2</span></span>

The spirit of prophecy here returns to that which more immediately
concerned Daniel and his royal masters -- the near future of the empire
in which he was so great a personage. Four kings were yet to follow in
Media-Persia. Then will come Alexander the "mighty king" of Grecia ([Dan
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#003)). The division of Alexander's
empire into four parts ([Dan 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#004)) as
already predicted ([Dan 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#022)) is
foretold. The troublous course of affairs in two parts of the
disintegrated Alexandrian empire, Syria and Egypt, is then traced down
to verse 20 ([Dan 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#020)). Here
Antiochus Epiphanes, the "little horn" of Chapter 8, occupies the vision
down to verse 36 ([Dan 11:36](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#036)). His
pollution of the sanctuary is again mentioned.

(See Scofield) - ([Dan 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#009)).

From verse 36 ([Dan 11:36](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#036)), the
interpretation is of the final "little horn" ([Dan
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#008)); ([Dan
7:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#024));

(See Scofield) - ([Dan 11:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#035)).

Ahasuerus, ([Ezr 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#006)); Artaxerxes,
([Ezr 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#007)); and Darius called
"Hystaspes" ([Ezr 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#024)).

his princes

That is, One of Alexander's princes; historically Ptolemy Lagidae.

Not the "king of the south" (Ptolemy Lagidae, to whom Egypt was given),
but the "king of the north" ([Dan
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#006)); Seleucus, to whom Syria was
given:

[Daniel 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">dan 11:6</span></span>

they shall

That is, the descendants and successors of Ptolemy Lagidae and Seleucus,
not those very personages. The prediction was fulfilled in the marriage
of Berenice, daughter of Ptolemy Philadelphus, to Antiochus Theos, third
king of Syria, B.C. 285-247.

Antiochus Epiphanes' second expedition against Egypt. Stopped by the
mandate of Rome, ([Dan 11:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#030)); he
turns against the Jews:

This is historic -- the act of Antiochus Epiphanes. ([Mat
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#015)) refers to ([Dan
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#011));

the time of the end

Here the prophetic foreview, having traced the history of the two parts
of Alexander's empire which had to do with Palestine and the Jews,
namely, Syria and Egypt, to the time of Antiochus Epiphanes, and having
described his career, overleaps the centuries to "the time of the end,"
when he of whom Antiochus Epiphanes was a type, the "little horn" of
([Dan 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#008)) the "Beast out of the sea"
of ([Rev 13:4-10](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#004)) shall appear (cf)
(See Scofield) - ([Dan 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#008)). Prophecy
does not concern itself with history as such, but only with history as
it affects Israel and the Holy Land. Antiochus Epiphanes was
insignificant as compared with historical personages whom the Bible does
not mention, but he scourged the covenant people and defiled God's
altar, thus coming into prophetic light. From verse 36 ([Dan
11:36](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#036)), the "little horn" of ([Dan
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#008)); ([Dan
7:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#024)) fills the scene. His
prosperity lasts until "the indignation" (the "time of trouble" of;
([Dan 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001)); ([Mat
24:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#021)) is accomplished ([Dan
11:36](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#036)). This is parallel with; ([Rev
17:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#010)); ([Rev
19:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#019)). ([Dan
11:37-45](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#037)) supply details not mentioned
in the New Testament The expression "God of his fathers" ([Dan
11:37](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#037)) has been held to indicate that
the "king" is an apostate Jew, but this does not accord with ([Dan
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026)) which was fulfilled by the
Gentile armies of Rome. The "little horn" is an apostate, but from
Christianity, not Judaism (compare [Jo1
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#018)); ([Jo1
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#019)). ([Dan
11:38-45](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#038)) describe his career.
Substituting "the god of forces" (that is, Forces of nature) for the
true God ([Dan 11:38](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#038)); ([Dan
11:39](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#039)), he soon presents himself as
that god (cf) ([Th2 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#003)); ([Th2
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#004)). While his career lasts he is an
irresistible conqueror ([Dan
11:40-44](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#040)). He established his palace
in Jerusalem, probably at the time of his supreme act of blasphemous
impiety; ([Dan 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027)); ([Dan
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#011)); ([Mat
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#015)); ([Th2
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#004)). From this time begins the great
tribulation; ([Dan 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001)); ([Mat
24:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#021)) which runs its course during
the last half of Daniel's seventieth week, namely, three and one half
years; ([Dan 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#025)); ([Dan
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#007)); ([Dan
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#011)); ([Rev
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#005)).
