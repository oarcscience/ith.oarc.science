<p>Book Introduction - Colossians
<p>Writer: The Apostle Paul (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#001">Col 1:1</A>). 
<p>Date: Colossians was sent by the same messenger who bore Ephesians and Philemon, and was probably written at the same time. 
<p>Theme: Epaphras, who laboured in the Word in the assembly at Colosse, was Paul's fellow-prisoner at Rome. Doubtless from him Paul learned the state of that church. As to fundamentals that state was excellent (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#003">Col 1:3-8</A>), but in a subtle way two forms of error were at work: The first was legality in its Alexandrian form of asceticism, "touch not, taste not," with a trace of the Judaic observance of "days"; the object of which was the mortification of the body (cf <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#013">Rom 8:13</A>). The second form of error was false mysticism, "intruding into those things which he hath not seen"--the result of philosophic speculation. Because these are ever present perils, Colossians was written, not for that day only, but for the warning of the church in all days. 
<p>The Epistle is in seven divisions: 
<p>1. Introduction (Colossians 1:1-8). 
<p>2. The apostolic prayer (Colossians 1:9-14). 
<p>3. The exaltation of Christ, Creator, Redeemer, Indweller (Colossians 1:15-29). 
<p>4. The Godhead incarnate in Christ, in whom the believer is complete (Colossians 2:1-23). 
<p>5. The believer's union with Christ in resurrection life and glory (Colossians 3:1-4). 
<p>6. Christian living, the fruit of union with Christ (Colossians 3:5 - 4:6). 
<p>7. Christian fellowship (Colossians 4:7-18).
