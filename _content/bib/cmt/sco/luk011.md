### [Luke Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#001)

[Luke 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#001)

teach us to pray

This is the central New Testament passage on prayer. In the Sermon on
the Mount Christ had announced the new basis of prayer, namely:
relationship ([Mat 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#009)); ([Mat
6:28-32](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#028)). The believer is a child of
God through the new birth.

(See Scofield) - ([Joh 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#003)).

The clear revelation of this fact at once establishes the reasonableness
of prayer; a reasonableness against which the argument from the apparent
uniformity of natural law shatters itself. God is more than a Creator,
bringing a universe into being, and establishing laws for it; more than
a decree-maker determining future events by an eternal fiat. Above all
this is the divine family for whom the universe with its laws exists;
([Col 1:16-20](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016)); ([Heb
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002)); ([Heb
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#010)); ([Heb
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#011)); ([Rom
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#017)).

When ye pray, say, Our Father." What God habitually does in the material
universe concerns the reverent investigator of that universe. What He
may do in His own family concerns Him, and them, and is matter for
divine promise and revelation. Science, which deals only with natural
phenomena, cannot intrude there ([Co1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#009)).

Christ's law of prayer may be thus summarized:

\(1\) He grounds prayer upon relationship, and reveals God as freely
charging himself with all the responsibilities, as His heart glows with
all the affections of a Father toward all who believe on Jesus Christ
([Mat 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#025)); ([Mat
6:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#032)); ([Mat
7:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#009)). Prayer, therefore, is a
child's petition to an all-wise, all-loving, and all-powerful,
Father-God.

\(2\) In the so-called Lord's prayer Christ gives an incomparable model
for all prayer. It teaches that right prayer begins with worship; puts
the interest of the kingdom before merely personal interest; accepts
beforehand the Father's will, whether to grant or withhold; and
petitions for present need, leaving the future to the Father's care and
love. Used as a form, the Lord's prayer is, dispensationally, upon
legal, not church ground; it is not a prayer in the name of Christ (cf)
([Joh 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#013)); ([Joh
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#014)); ([Joh
16:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#024)) and it makes human forgiveness,
as under the law it must, the condition of divine forgiveness; an order
which grace exactly reverses (compare [Eph
4:32](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#032)).

\(3\) Prayer is to be definite ([Luk
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#005)); ([Luk
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#006)) and,

\(4\) importunate, that is undiscouraged by delayed answers.

give

It is evident that none of the disciples, with the possible exception of
Mary of Bethany, asked for the Spirit in the faith of this promise. It
was a new and staggering thing to a Jew that, in advance of the
fulfilment of ([Joe 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#028)); ([Joe
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#029)) all might receive the Spirit.
Mary alone of the disciples understood Christ's repeated declaration
concerning His own death and resurrection ([Joh
12:3-7](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#003)). Save Mary, not one of the
disciples but Peter, and he only in the great confession ([Mat
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#016)) manifested a spark of spiritual
intelligence till after the resurrection of Christ and the impartation
of the Spirit; ([Joh 20:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#022)); ([Act
2:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#001)). To go back to the promise of
([Luk 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#013)); is to forget Pentecost,
and to ignore the truth that now every believer has the indwelling
Spirit; ([Rom 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#009)); ([Rom
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#015)); ([Co1
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#019)); ([Gal
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#006)); ([Jo1
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#020)); ([Jo1
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#027)).
