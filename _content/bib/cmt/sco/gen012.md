### [Genesis Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#001)

[Genesis 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 12:1</span></span>

Now the Lord

The Fourth Dispensation: Promise. For Abraham, and his descendants it is
evident that the Abrahamic Covenant (See Scofield) - ([Gen
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#018)) made a great change. They
became distinctively the heirs of promise. That covenant is wholly
gracious and unconditional. The descendants of Abraham had but to abide
in their own land to inherit every blessing. In Egypt they lost their
blessings, but not their covenant. The Dispensation of Promise ended
when Israel rashly accepted the law ([Exo
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#008)). Grace had prepared a deliverer
(Moses), provided a sacrifice for the guilty, and by divine power
brought them out of bondage ([Exo
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#004)) but at Sinai they exchanged
grace for law. The Dispensation of Promise extends from ([Gen
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#001)) to ([Exo
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#008)); and was exclusively
Israelitish. The dispensation must be distinguished from the covenant.
The former is a mode of testing; the latter is everlasting because
unconditional. The law did not abrogate the Abrahamic Covenant ([Gal
3:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#015)) but was an intermediate
disciplinary dealing "till the Seed should come to whom the promise was
made"; ([Gal 3:19-29](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#019)); ([Gal
4:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#001)). Only the dispensation, as a
testing of Israel, ended at the giving of the law.

See, for the other six dispensations:

(See Scofield) - ([Gen 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#021)).

INNOCENCE

(See Scofield) - ([Gen 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#028))

CONSCIENCE

(See Scofield) - ([Gen 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#023))

PROMISE

(See Scofield) - ([Gen 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#001))

LAW

(See Scofield) - ([Exo 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#008))

GRACE

(See Scofield) - ([Joh 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#017))

KINGDOM

(See Scofield) - ([Eph 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#010)).

[Genesis 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#002)

And

For analysis and summary of the Abrahamic Covenant,

(See Scofield) - ([Gen 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#018)).

[Genesis 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 12:7</span></span>

appeared

The theophanies. ([Gen 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#001)); ([Gen
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#007)); ([Rev
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#010)).

[Genesis 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 12:8</span></span>

Beth-el

One of the sacred places of Canaan, meaning, house of God ([Gen
28:1-22](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#001));

(See Scofield) - ([Gen 35:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#007)).

It is characteristic of all apostasy that Jeroboam chose this sacred
place in which to erect an idol ([Kg1
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#028)); ([Kg1
12:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#032)).

(compare ([Kg1 13:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#001))

and of divine judgment upon apostasy that God should decree the
destruction of Bethel, despite its sacred memories; ([Kg1
13:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#001)); ([Kg2
23:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#015)); ([Amo
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#014)); ([Amo
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#015)).

God never hesitates to cast aside that which no longer serves His
purpose ([Rev 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#005)); ([Rev
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#016)).

[Genesis 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gen 12:10</span></span>

famine

A famine was often a disciplinary testing of God's people in the land.
(Cf) ([Gen 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#001)); ([Gen
42:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#005)); ([Rut
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#001)); ([Sa2
24:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#013)); ([Psa
105:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#016)).

The resort to Egypt (the world) is typical of the tendency to substitute
for lost spiritual power the fleshly resources of the world, instead of
seeking, through confession and amendment, the restoration of God's
presence and favour.
