### [Ezekiel Chapter 37](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#001)

bones

Having announced ([Eze 36:24-38](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#024)) the
restoration of the nation, Jehovah now gives in vision and symbol the
method of its accomplishment. ([Eze
37:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#011)) gives the clue. The "bones" are
the whole house of Israel who shall then be living. The "graves" are the
nations where they dwell. The order of procedure is:

\(1\) the bringing of the people out ([Eze
37:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#012)); ([Eze
37:19-27](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#019)).

\(2\) the bringing of them in ([Eze
37:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#012));

\(3\) their conversion ([Eze 37:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#013))

\(4\) the filling with the Spirit ([Eze
37:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#014)).

The symbol follows. The two sticks are Judah and the ten tribes; united,
they are one nation ([Eze 37:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#019)).
Then follows ([Eze 37:21-27](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#021)) the plain
declaration as to Jehovah's purpose, and ([Eze
37:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#028)) implies that then Jehovah will
become known to the Gentiles in a marked way. This is also the order of
([Act 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#016)); ([Act
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#017)) and the two passages strongly
indicate the time of full Gentile conversion. See also ([Isa
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#010)).
