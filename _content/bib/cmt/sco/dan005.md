father

Nebuchadnezzar was "father" of Belshazzar in the biblical sense that
David is called "father" of Jesus, ([Luk
1:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#032)). Belshazzar was probably a
grandson.

Darius the Median

The biblical order of the monarchs of Daniel's time, and of the period
of the captivity and restoration of Judah, is as follows:

\(1\) Nebuchadnezzar (B.C. 604-561) with whom the captivity of Judah and
the "times of the Gentiles"

(See Scofield) - ([Luk 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#024)).

(See Scofield) - ([Rev 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#019)),

began, and who established the first of the four world monarchies. ([Dan
2:37](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#037)); ([Dan
2:38](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#038)); ([Dan
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#004)).

\(2\) Belshazzar (prob B.C. 556), the Bel-shar-uzzar of the
inscriptions, grandson of Nebuchadnezzar, and son of the victorious
general Nabonidus. Belshazzar seems to have reigned as viceroy.

\(3\) Darius the Mede ([Dan 5:31](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#031));
([Dan 6:1-27](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#001)); ([Dan
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#001)). Concerning this Darius secular
history awaits further discoveries, as formerly in the case of
Belshazzar. He has been conjectured to be identical with Gobryas, a
Persian general. This Darius was "the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of
the Medes, which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans" ([Dan
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#001)) "Ahasuerus," more a title than a
name, the equivalent of the modern "Majesty," is used in Scripture of at
least four personages, and is Persian rather than Median. That Darius
the Mede was the "son" (or grandson) of an Ahasuerus proves no more than
that he was, probably, through the seed of his mother, of the seed royal
not only of Media, but also of Persia. There is but one Darius in
Daniel.

See ([Dan 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#001)).)

\(4\) Cyrus, with whose rise to power came fully into existence the
Medo-Persian, second of the world-empires ([Dan
2:39](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#039)); ([Dan
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#005)).

In Daniel's vision of this empire in "the third year of the reign of
King Belshazzar" ([Dan 8:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#001)) the
Median power of Darius is seen as the lesser of the two horns of the
ram; the Persian power of Cyrus, under whom the Medo-Persian power was
consolidated, as the "higher" horn which "came up last." Under Cyrus,
who was prophetically named more than a century before his birth. ([Isa
44:28-45](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#028)); ([Isa
44:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#004)); the return to Palestine of the
Jewish remnant began. ([Ezr 1:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001)).

See ([Dan 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#002)); margin reference,

(See Scofield) - ([Dan 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#002)).
