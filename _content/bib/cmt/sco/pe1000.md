Book Introduction - 1 Peter

Writer: The Apostle Peter ([Pe1 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#001)).

Date: Probably A.D. 60. That "Babylon" refers to the former city on the
Euphrates, or to Rome, cannot be inferred from [Pe1
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#013). The text is obscure.

Theme: While Peter undoubtedly has scattered Jewish believers in mind,
his Epistles comprehend Gentile believers also ([Pe1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#010)). The present Epistle, written
from a church on Gentile ground ([Pe1
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#013)), presents all the foundational
truths of the Christian faith, with special emphasis on the atonement.
The distinctive note of First Peter is preparation for victory over
suffering. The last-name word occurs about fifteen times, and is the
key-word to the Epistle.

The Epistle is in three parts:

1\. Christian suffering and conduct in the light of full salvation (1
Peter 1:1 - 2:8)

2\. The believer's life in view of his sevenfold position, and of the
vicarious suffering of Christ (1 Peter 2:9 - 4:19).

3\. Christian service in the light of the coming of the Chief Shepherd
(1 Peter 5:1-14).
