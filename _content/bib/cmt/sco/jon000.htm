<p>Book Introduction - Jonah
<p>The historical character of the man Jonah is vouched for by Jesus Christ <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#039">Mat 12:39-41</A> as also that his preservation in the great fish was a "sign" or type of the Lord's own entombment and resurrection. Both are miraculous and both are equally credible. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#025">Kg2 14:25</A> records the fulfilment of a prophecy by Jonah. The man himself was a bigoted Jew, unwilling to testify to a Gentile city, and angry that God had spared it. Typically he foreshadows the nation of Israel out of its own land; a trouble to the Gentiles, yet witnessing to them; cast out by them, but miraculously preserved; in their future deepest distress calling upon Jehovah-Saviour, and finding deliverance, and then becoming missionaries to the Gentiles. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#007">Zac 8:7-23</A>. 
<p>He typifies Christ as the Sent One, raised from the dead, and carrying salvation to the Gentiles. The chapter divisions indicate the analysis of Jonah.
