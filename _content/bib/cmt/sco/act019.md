### [Acts Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#001)

[Acts 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 19:2</span></span>

Have

Not as in A.V, "since ye believed," but as in R.V. And margin reference,
"Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye believed?" Paul was evidently
impressed by the absence of spirituality and power in these so-called
disciples. Their answer brought out the fact that they were Jewish
proselytes, disciples of John the Baptist, looking backward to an
accomplished redemption. ([Rom 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#009));
([Co1 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#019)); ([Eph
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#013)).

[Acts 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">act 19:16</span></span>

overcame

The sons of Sceva sought to imitate a power to which they were
strangers, only to their own confusion. This striking witness from
another side caused fear to fall on all.

prevailed

([Luk 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#021)); ([Luk
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#022)); ([Jo1
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#004)).

[Acts 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 19:21</span></span>

spirit

That is, in his own mind.

(See Scofield) - ([Act 20:22](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#022)).

[Acts 19:23](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 19:23</span></span>

about the way

Concerning the Way, that is, Christ. ([Joh
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#006)).

[Acts 19:27](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">act 19:27</span></span>

world

(Greek, "oikoumenē", means "inhabited earth").

(See Scofield) - ([Luk 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#001)).

[Acts 19:28](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">act 19:28</span></span>

Diana

Greek "Artemis". Not anciently of the Greek pantheon, but an Eastern
goddess.

Compare (See Scofield) - ([Jdg 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#013)).

But "Diana of the Ephesians" was rather a particular image of Artemis,
reputed to have fallen from heaven; ([Act
19:35](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#035)).
