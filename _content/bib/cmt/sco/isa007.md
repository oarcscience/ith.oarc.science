### [Isaiah Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#001)

[Isaiah 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 7:2</span></span>

Ephraim

In the prophetic books "Ephraim" and "Israel" are the collective names
of the ten tribes who, under Jeroboam, established the northern kingdom,
subsequently called Samaria ([Kg1
16:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#024)) and were (B.C. 722) sent into
an exile which still continues. ([Kg2
17:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#001)).

They are distinguished as "the outcasts of Israel" from "the dispersed
of Judah." ([Isa 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#012)). "Hidden" in
the world ([Mat 13:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#044)) they, with
Judah, are yet to be restored to Palestine and made one nation again.
([Jer 23:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005)); ([Eze
37:11-24](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#011)).

[Isaiah 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 7:3</span></span>

Shearjashub

Meaning, a remnant shall return. ([Isa
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#003)).

[Isaiah 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 7:13</span></span>

Hear ye now

The prophecy is not addressed to the faithless Ahaz, but to the whole
"house of David." The objection that such a far-off event as the birth
of Christ could be no "sign" to Ahaz, is, therefore, puerile. It was a
continuing prophecy addressed to the Davidic family, and accounts at
once for the instant assent of Mary. ([Luk
1:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#038)).

[Isaiah 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 7:15</span></span>

Butter and honey

Indicating the plainness and simplicity of the life in which the young
Immanuel should be brought up.
