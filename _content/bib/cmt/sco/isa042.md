### [Isaiah Chapter 42](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001)

[Isaiah 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 42:1</span></span>

servant

There is a twofold account of the Coming Servant:

\(1\) he is represented as weak, despised, rejected, slain:

\(2\) and also as a mighty conqueror, taking vengeance on the nations
and restoring Israel (for example ([Isa
40:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#010)); ([Isa
63:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#001)). The former class of passages
relate to the first advent, and are fulfilled; the latter to the second
advent, and are unfulfilled.

[Isaiah 42:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#006)

for a light of the Gentiles

The prophets connect the Gentiles with Christ in a threefold way"

\(1\) as the Light He brings salvation to the Gentiles ([Luk
2:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#032)); ([Act
13:47](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#047)); ([Act
13:48](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#048)).

\(2\) as the "Root of Jesse" He is to reign over the Gentiles in His
kingdom. ([Isa 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#010)); ([Rom
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#012)). He saves the Gentiles, which
is the distinctive feature of this present age. ([Rom
11:17-24](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#017)); ([Eph
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#011)); ([Eph
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#012)) He reigns over the Gentiles in
the kingdom-age, to follow this.

See "Kingdom (Old Testament),"

([Gen 1:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#026)); ([Zac
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#008)).

\(3\) Believing Gentiles in the present age, together with believing
Jews, constitute "the church which is His body."

(See Scofield) - ([Eph 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#006)).

[Isaiah 42:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 42:9</span></span>

former things

That is, Isaiah's prediction of Sennacherib's invasion and its results,
Isaiah 10 and 37. See also, ([Isa
41:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#021)); ([Isa
43:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#008)); ([Isa
44:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#007)); ([Isa
48:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#003)); ([Isa
48:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#005)); ([Isa
48:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#016)). This appeal of the prophet to
the fulfilment of his former predictions strongly confirms the unity of
the book.
