Mary

As Martha stands for service, and Lazarus for communion, so Mary shows
us the worship of a grateful heart. Others before her had come to his
feet to have their need met; she came to give Him His due. Though two of
the evangelists record her act, John alone gives her name.

answered

He does not receive these Gentiles. A Christ in the flesh, King of the
Jews, could be no proper object of faith to the Gentiles, though the
Jews should have believed on Him as such. For Gentiles the corn of wheat
must fall into the ground and die; Christ must be lifted up on the cross
and believed in as a sacrifice for sin, as seed of Abraham, not David
([Joh 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#024)); ([Joh
12:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#032)); ([Gal
3:7-14](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#007)); ([Eph

Except

Chapters 12-17 are a progression according to the order of approach to
God in the tabernacle types: chapter 12, in which Christ speaks of His
death, answers to the brazen altar of burnt-offering, type of the cross.
Passing from the altar toward the holy of holies, the laver is next
reached ([Exo 30:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#017)); answering to
Chapter 13. With His associate priests, now purified, the High Priest
approaches and enters the holy place, in the high communion of Chapters
14-16. Entering alone the holy of holies ([Joh
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#001)); the High Priest intercedes.

Compare ([Heb 7:24-28](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#024)).

That intercession is not for the salvation, but the keeping and blessing
of those for whom He prays. His death (assumed as accomplished), ([Joh
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#004)) has saved them.

judgments

The Seven Judgments.

\(1\) Of Jesus Christ as bearing the believer's sins. The sins of
believers have been judged in the person of Jesus Christ "lifted up" on
the cross. The result was death for Christ, and justification for the
believer, who can never again be put in jeopardy.

([Joh 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#024)); ([Rom
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#009)); ([Rom
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#001)); ([Co2
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#021)); ([Gal
