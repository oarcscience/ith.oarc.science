### [Job Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#001)

[Job 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 4:1</span></span>

Eliphaz

Eliphaz is a religious dogmatist whose dogmatism rests upon a mysterious
and remarkable experience ([Job
4:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#012)). Did a spirit ever pass
before Job's face? Did Job's hair of his flesh ever stand up? Then let
him be meek while one so superior as Eliphaz declares the causes of his
misfortunes. Eliphaz says many true things (as do the others), and often
rises into eloquence, but he remains hard and cruel, a dogmatist who
must be heard because of one remarkable experience.

[Job 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#009)

1:19](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#019)); ([Job
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#030)); ([Isa
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#004)); ([Th2
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#008)).
