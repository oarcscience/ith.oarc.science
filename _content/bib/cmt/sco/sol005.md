sleep

The bride is satisfied with her washed feet while the Bridegroom, His
"head filled with dew," and His "locks with the drops of night," is
toiling for others. See ([Luk 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#012));
([Luk 14:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#021)). The state of the
bride is not one of sin, but of neglect of service. She is preoccupied
with the graces and perfections which she has in Christ through the
Spirit; ([Co1 12:4-11](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#004)); ([Gal
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#022)); ([Gal
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#023)). It is mysticism, unbalanced by
the activities of the Christian warfare. Her feet are washed, her hands
drop with sweet smelling myrrh; but He has gone on, and now she must
seek Him.

Compare ([Luk 2:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#044)); ([Luk
2:45](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#045)).

I sought him

Observe, it is now the Bridegroom Himself who occupies her heart, not
his gifts -- myrrh and washed feet ([Joh
13:2-9](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#002)).

fitly set

Hebrew, "sitting in fulness;" that is, fitly placed, and set as a
precious stone in the foil of a ring.
