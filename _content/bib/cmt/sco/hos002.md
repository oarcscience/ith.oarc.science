### [Hosea Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#001)

[Hosea 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">hos 2:2</span></span>

She is not my wife

That Israel is the wife of Jehovah ([Hos
2:16-23](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#016)); now disowned but yet to be
restored, is the clear teaching of the passages. This relationship is
not to be confounded with that of the Church of Christ.

(See Scofield) - ([Joh 3:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#029)).

In the mystery of the Divine tri-unity both are true. The New Testament
speaks of the Church as a virgin espoused to one husband ([Co2
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#001)); ([Co2
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#002)) which could never be said of an
adulterous wife, restored in grace. Israel is, then, to be the restored
and forgiven wife of Jehovah, the Church the virgin wife of the Lamb;
([Joh 3:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#029)); ([Rev
19:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#006)). Israel Jehovah's earthly wife
([Hos 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#023)); the Church the Lamb's
heavenly bride, ([Rev 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#007)).
