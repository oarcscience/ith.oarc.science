### [Galatians Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#001)

[Galatians 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gal 6:1</span></span>

fault

That is, sin.

(See Scofield) - ([Rom 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#023)).

[Galatians 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gal 6:6</span></span>

communicate

Or, share with him. ([Co1 9:7-15](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#007));
([Ti1 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#018)).

[Galatians 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gal 6:11</span></span>

large

Greek, "with how large letters ... mine own hand." The apostle was, it
appears from many considerations, afflicted with ophthalmia, a common
disease in the East, to the point almost of total blindness, (for
example), ([Gal 4:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#013)). Ordinarily,
therefore, he dictated his letters. But now, having no amanuensis at
hand, but urged by the spiritual danger of his dear Galatians, he
writes, we cannot know with what pain and difficulty, with his own hand,
in the "large letters" his darkened vision compelled him to use.

[Galatians 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gal 6:12</span></span>

constrain you to be circumcised

"Circumcision" stands here for externality in religion -- form rather
than spirit. ([Col 2:16-23](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#016)).

[Galatians 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gal 6:14</span></span>

world

Greek, "kosmos", means "world-system". ([Eph
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#002)); ([Joh
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#007)).

(See Scofield) - ([Rev 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#008)).
