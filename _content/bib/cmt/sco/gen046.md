I am God

It is important to distinguish between the directive and the permissive
will of God. In the first sense the place for the covenant family was
Canaan ([Gen 26:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#001)); ([Gen
46:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#003)) is a touching instance of the
permissive will of God. Jacob's family, broken, and in part already in
Egypt, the tenderness of Jehovah would not forbid the aged patriarch to
follow. God will take up His people and, so far as possible, bless them,
even when they are out of His best. In Israel's choice of a king ([Sa1
8:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#007)) in the turning back from Kadesh
([Deu 1:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#019)) in the sending of the
spies; in the case of Balaam -- illustrations of this principle are
seen. It is needless to say that God's permissive will never extends to
things morally wrong. The highest blessing is ever found in obedience to
His directive will.

[Genesis 46:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#026)

All the souls

(Cf) ([Gen 46:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#027)). A discrepancy has
been imagined. The "souls" that came with Jacob" were 66. The "souls of
the house of Jacob" ([Gen 46:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#027)) that
is, The entire Jacobean family) were 70, namely, The 66 which came with
Jacob, Joseph and his two sons, already in Egypt = 69; Jacob himself =
70.

(See Scofield) - ([Act 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#014)).
