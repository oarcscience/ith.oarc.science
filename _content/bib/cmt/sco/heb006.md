impossible

([Heb 6:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#004)) presents the case of
Jewish professed believers who halt short of faith in Christ after
advancing to the very threshold of salvation, even "going along with"

16:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#008)). It is not said that they had
faith. This supposed person is like the spies at Kadesh-barnea ([Deu
1:19-26](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#019)) who saw the land and had the
very fruit of it in their hands, and yet turned back.
