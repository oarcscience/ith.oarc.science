### [Genesis Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#001)

[Genesis 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 6:4</span></span>

sons of God

Some hold that these "sons of God" were the "angels which kept not their
first estate" ([Jde 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#006)). It is
asserted that the title is in the Old Testament exclusively used of
angels. But this is an error ([Isa
43:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#006)). Angels are spoken of in a
sexless way. No female angels are mentioned in Scripture, and we are
expressly told that marriage is unknown among angels. ([Mat
22:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#030)).

The uniform Hebrew and Christian interpretation has been that verse
([Gen 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#002)) marks the breaking down of
the separation between the godly line of Seth and the godless line of
Cain, and so the failure of the testimony to Jehovah committed to the
line of Seth ([Gen 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#026)). For apostasy
there is no remedy but judgment; ([Isa
1:2-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#002)); ([Isa
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#024)); ([Isa
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#025)); ([Heb
6:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#004)); ([Heb
10:26-31](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#026)). Noah, "a preacher of
righteousness," is given 120 years, but he won no convert, and the
judgment predicted by his great-grandfather fell; ([Jde
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#014)); ([Jde
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#015)); ([Gen
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#011)).

[Genesis 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 6:5</span></span>

imagination

Or, the whole imagination. The Hebrew word signifies not only the
imagination but also the purposes and desires.

[Genesis 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gen 6:6</span></span>

repented the LORD

(See Scofield); ([Zac 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#014)).

[Genesis 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 6:9</span></span>

walked

Noah and Enoch are the two antediluvians of whom it is said that they
"walked with God" ([Gen 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#024)); ([Gen
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#009)).

Enoch, "translated that he should not see death" ([Heb
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#005)) becomes a type of the saints who
will be "caught up" before the great tribulation; ([Th1
4:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#014)); ([Rev
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#010)); ([Dan
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001)); ([Mat
24:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#021)).

Noah, preserved through the Flood, is a type of the Israelitish people
who will be preserved through the tribulation ([Jer
30:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#005)). See "Tribulation"; ([Psa
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#005)); ([Rev
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#014)).

[Genesis 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gen 6:14</span></span>

ark

"Ark": type of Christ as the refuge of His people from judgment ([Heb
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#007)). In strictness of application
this speaks of the preservation through the "great tribulation" ([Mat
24:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#021)); ([Mat
24:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#022)) of the remnant of Israel who
will turn to the Lord after the Church (typified by Enoch, who was
translated to heaven before the judgment of the Flood) has been caught
up to meet the Lord; ([Gen 5:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#022));
([Th1 4:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#015)); ([Heb
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#005)); ([Isa
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#010)); ([Isa
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#011)); ([Isa
26:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#020)). But the type also has a
present reference to the position of the believer "in Christ" (Ep 1.),
etc. It should be noted that the word translated "pitch" in ([Gen
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#014)) is the same word translated
"atonement" in ([Lev 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#011)) etc. It is
atonement that keeps out the waters of judgment and makes the believer's
position "in Christ" safe and blessed.

[Genesis 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">gen 6:19</span></span>

two of every sort

Compare ([Gen 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#002)).

In addition to two animals, etc, commanded ([Gen
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#019)) to be preserved for future
increase ("they shall be male and female"), the further command was
given more than 100 years later to take of clean beasts, i.e, acceptable
for sacrifice, seven each. Exodus gives ten such beasts, or but seventy
in all. Modern ships carry hundreds of live beasts, with their food,
besides scores of human beings.
