### [Matthew Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#001)

[Matthew 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 10:2</span></span>

apostles

The word "apostle", meaning "one sent forth," is used of our Lord ([Heb
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#001)). Elsewhere it is used for the
twelve who were called to that office by our Lord during His earth
ministry; of Paul, called to the apostleship by the risen and ascended
Lord, and of Barnabas ([Act 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#014))
specially designated by the Holy Spirit ([Act
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#002)). Of Matthias, chosen by lot by
the eleven to take the place of Judas Iscariot, ([Act
1:16-26](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#016)) it is said: "And he was
numbered with the eleven." ([Act
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#026)).

The "signs" of an apostle were

\(1\) They were chosen directly by the Lord Himself, or, as in the case
of Barnabas, by the Holy Spirit ([Mat
10:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#001)); ([Mar
3:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#013)); ([Luk
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#013)); ([Act
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#006)); ([Act
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#015)); ([Act
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#002)); ([Act
22:10](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#010)); ([Act
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#014)); ([Act
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#015)); ([Rom
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#001)).

\(2\) They were endued with sign gifts, miraculous powers which were the
divine credentials of their office ([Mat
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#001)); ([Act
5:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#015)); ([Act
16:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#016)); ([Mat
28:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#008)).

\(3\) Their relation to the kingdom was that of heralds, announcing to
Israel only ([Mat 10:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#005)) the kingdom
as at hand.

(See Scofield) - ([Mat 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#017))

and manifesting kingdom powers ([Mat
10:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#007)).

\(4\) To one of them, Peter, the keys of the kingdom of heaven, viewed
as the sphere of Christian profession, as in Mat 13, were given ([Mat
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#019)).

\(5\) Their future relation to the king will be that of judges over the
twelve tribes ([Mat 19:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#028)).

\(6\) Consequent upon the rejection of the kingdom, and the revelation
of the mystery hid in God ([Mat
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018)); ([Eph
3:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#001)) the Church, the apostolic
office was invested with a new enduement, the baptism with the Holy
Spirit ([Act 2:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#001)) a new power, that
of imparting the Spirit to Jewish-Christian believers; a new relation,
that of foundation stones of the new temple ([Eph
2:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#020)) and a new function, that of
preaching the glad tidings of salvation through a crucified and risen
Lord to Jew and gentile alike.

\(7\) The indispensable qualification of an apostle was that he should
have been an eye-witness of the resurrection ([Act
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#022)); ([Co1
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#001)).

James son of Zebedee

(See Scofield) - ([Mat 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#021)).

[Matthew 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mat 10:5</span></span>

Gentiles

The kingdom was promised to the Jews. Gentiles could be blessed only
through Christ crucified and risen.

Compare ([Joh 12:20-24](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#020)).

[Matthew 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mat 10:6</span></span>

lost sheep

(Greek, "apollumi").

(See Scofield) - ([Joh 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#016)).

Also ([Mat 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#024)); ([Mat
15:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#026)); ([Act
13:46](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#046)).

[Matthew 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mat 10:8</span></span>

devils

demons.

(See Scofield) - ([Mat 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#022)).

[Matthew 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 10:9</span></span>

Provide neither gold

Compare ([Mar 6:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#008)); ([Luk
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#003)).

The central thought here, urgency, must be kept in mind. The emphasis is
upon "provide." Time is not to be taken to search for additional staves
or shoes. The disciples were to go in their ordinary sandals, with such
staff as they might have, or with none.

Compare Paul, ([Rom 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#015)).

[Matthew 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mat 10:16</span></span>

send

The scope of ([Mat 10:16-23](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#016)) reaches
beyond the personal ministry of the twelve, covering in a general sense
the sphere of service during the present age. ([Mat
10:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#023)) has in view the preaching of
the remnant. ([Isa 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#009)).

(See Scofield) - ([Rom 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#005))

in the tribulation ([Psa 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#005)).

(See Scofield) - ([Rev 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#014)).

And immediately preceding the return of Christ in glory; ([Deu
30:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#003)); ([Act
1:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#009)).

(See Scofield) - ([Act 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#011)).

The remnant then will not have gone over the cities of Israel till the
Lord comes.

[Matthew 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mat 10:19</span></span>

for it shall be given

An instruction to martyrs, not to preachers.

[Matthew 10:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mat 10:23</span></span>

Son of man

(See Scofield) - ([Mat 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#020)).

[Matthew 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mat 10:25</span></span>

Beelzebub

Beelzebul, title of a heathen deity.

[Matthew 10:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mat 10:28</span></span>

hell

(See Scofield) - ([Mat 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#022)).

[Matthew 10:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mat 10:34</span></span>

peace

Compare ([Joh 14:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#027)).

Peace is spoken of in Scripture in three ways:

\(1\) "Peace with God"; ([Rom 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#001));
this is the work of Christ into which the individual enters by faith;
([Eph 2:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014)); ([Rom
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#001)).

\(2\) "The peace of God"; ([Phi 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#007));
inward peace, the state of soul of that believer who, having entered
into peace with God through faith in Christ, has also committed to God
through prayer and supplication with thanksgiving all his anxieties;
([Luk 7:50](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#050)); ([Phi
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#006)).

\(3\) Peace "on earth"; ([Luk 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#014));
([Psa 72:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#007)); ([Psa
85:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#010)); ([Isa
9:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006)); ([Isa
11:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001)); the universal prevalency of
peace in the earth under the kingdom. ([Mat
10:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#034)) was Christ's warning that the
truth which He was proclaiming would not bring in the kingdom age of
peace, but conflict rather. ([Joh
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#027)).

[Matthew 10:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">mat 10:41</span></span>

righteous

Righteousness.

(See Scofield) - ([Rom 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#010)).
