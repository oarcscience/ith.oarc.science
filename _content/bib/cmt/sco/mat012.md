### [Matthew Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#001)

[Matthew 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 12:1</span></span>

sabbath

\(1\) The sabbath ("cessation") appears in Scripture as the day of God's
rest in the finished work of creation. ([Gen
2:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#002)). For 2500 years of human life
absolutely no mention is made of it. Then the sabbath was revealed;
([Exo 16:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#023)); ([Neh
9:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#013)); made a part of the law ([Exo
20:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#008)) and invested with the
character of a "sign" between Jehovah and Israel, and a perpetual
reminder to Israel of their separation to God ([Exo
31:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#013)). It was observed by complete
rest ([Exo 35:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#002)) and by Jehovah's
express order a man was put to death for gathering sticks on the sabbath
day. ([Num 15:32-36](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#032)). Apart from
maintaining the continued burnt-offering ([Num
28:9](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#009)); and its connection with the
annual feasts; ([Exo 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#016)); ([Lev
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#003)); ([Lev
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#008)); ([Num
28:25](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#025)) the seventh day sabbath was
never made a day of sacrifice, worship, or any manner of religious
service. It was simply and only a day of complete rest for man and
beast, a humane provision for man's needs. In Christ's words, "The
sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath." ([Mar
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#027)).

\(2\) Our Lord found the observance of the day encrusted with rabbinical
evasions ([Mat 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#002)) and restrictions,
wholly unknown to the law, so that He was Himself held to be a sabbath
breaker by the religious authorities of the time. The sabbath will be
again observed during the kingdom age ([Isa
66:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#023)).

\(3\) The Christian first day perpetuates in the dispensation of grace
the principle that one-seventh of the time is especially sacred, but in
all other respects is in contrast with the sabbath. One is the seventh
day, the other the first. The sabbath commemorates God's creation rest,
the first day Christ's resurrection. On the seventh day God rested, on
the first day Christ was ceaselessly active. The sabbath commemorates a
finished creation, the first day a finished redemption. The sabbath was
a day of legal obligation, the first day one of voluntary worship and
service. The sabbath is mentioned in the Acts only in connection with
the Jews, and in the rest of the New Testament but twice. ([Col
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#016)); ([Heb
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#004)). In these passages the seventh
day sabbath is explained to be to the Christian not a day to be
observed, but a type of the present rest into which he enters when "he
also ceases from his own works" and trusts Christ.

[Matthew 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 12:3</span></span>

what David did

Jesus' action ([Mat 12:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#001)) is highly
significant. "What David did" refers to the time of his rejection and
persecution by Saul. ([Sa1 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#006)).
Jesus here is not so much the rejected Saviour as the rejected King;
hence the reference to David.

[Matthew 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mat 12:4</span></span>

shewbread

(See Scofield) - ([Exo 25:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#030)).

[Matthew 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mat 12:18</span></span>

Gentiles

This too is most significant. The rejected King of Israel will turn to
the Gentiles.

Compare ([Mat 10:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#005)).

In fulfilment this awaited the official rejection, crucifixion, and
resurrection of Christ, and the final rejection of the risen Christ.
([Luk 24:46-47](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#046)); ([Act
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#015)); ([Act
13:46](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#046)); ([Act
28:25-28](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#025)); ([Rom
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#011)).

[Matthew 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mat 12:22</span></span>

possessed

(Greek, "daimonizomai", "demonized").

(See Scofield) - ([Mat 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#022)).

[Matthew 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mat 12:24</span></span>

devils

demons.

(See Scofield) - ([Mat 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#022)).

[Matthew 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">mat 12:31</span></span>

sin

Sin

(See Scofield) - ([Rom 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#023)).

blasphemy

Ascribing to Satan the work of the Holy Spirit.

Compare ([Mat 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#024)); ([Mat
12:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#032)); ([Mat
12:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#040)).

[Matthew 12:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mat 12:34</span></span>

generation

Progeny. ([Mat 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#007)); ([Mat
23:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#033)).

[Matthew 12:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">mat 12:41</span></span>

The men of Nineveh

Again the rejected King announces judgment.

Compare ([Mat 11:20-24](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#020)).

Israel, in the midst of the Pharisaic revival of outward religious
strictness, was like a man out of whom a demon had "gone," that is, of
his own volition. He would come back and find an empty house, etc. The
personal application is to a mere self-cleansed moralist.

Nineveh

Verses ([Jon 3:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#005)); ([Luk
11:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#032)).

(See Scofield) - ([Nah 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#001)).

[Matthew 12:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#045)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">mat 12:45</span></span>

generation

(See Scofield) - ([Mat 24:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#034)).

[Matthew 12:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#046)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">mat 12:46</span></span>

While

Rejected by Israel, His "kinsmen according to the flesh"

(compare ([Rom 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#003));

our Lord intimates the formation of the new family of faith which,
overstepping mere racial claims, receives "whosoever" will be His
disciple. ([Mat 12:49-50](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#049)); ([Joh
6:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#028)).
