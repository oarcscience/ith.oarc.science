Book Introduction - Revelation

Writer: The Apostle John (1:1).

Date: A.D. 96

Theme: The theme of the Revelation is Jesus Christ ([Rev
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#001)), presented in a threefold way:

1\. As to time: "which is, and which was, and which is to come"
(Revelation 1:4);

2\. As to relationships--the churches (Revelation 1:9 - 3:22), to the
tribulation (Revelation 4:1 - 19:21), to the kingdom (Revelation 20:1 -
22:21);

3\. In His offices--High Priest (Revelation 8:3-6), Bridegroom
(Revelation 19:7-9), King-Judge (Revelation 20:1-15).

But while Christ is thus the central theme of the book, all of the
events move toward one consummation, the bringing in of the covenanted
kingdom. The key-phrase is the prophetic declaration of the "great
voices in heaven" ([Rev 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#015)), lit,
"The world kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ has come." The book is,
therefore, a prophecy ([Rev 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#003)).

The three major divisions of Revelation must be clearly held if the
interpretation is to be sane and coherent. John was commanded to "write"
concerning three classes of "things" ([Rev
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#019)):

1\. Things past, "the things thou hast seen," i.e. the Patmos vision,
(Revelation 1:1-20).

2\. Things present, "the things which are," i.e. things then
existing--obviously the churches. The temple had been destroyed, the
Jews dispersed: the testimony of God had been committed to the Churches
([Ti1 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#015)). Accordingly we have seven
messages to seven representative churches, (Revelation 2:1 - 3:22). It
is noteworthy that the church is not mentioned in chapters 5-18.

3\. Things future, "things which shall be hereafter," lit. "after
these," i.e. after the church period ends, Revelation 4:1 - 22:21. The
third major division, as Erdman (W.J.) has pointed out, falls into a
series of six sevens, with parenthetical passages, making, with the
church division, seven sevens.

The six sevens are:

1\. The seals, (Revelation 4:1 - 8:1).

2\. The seven trumpets, (Revelation 8:2 - 11:19).

3\. The seven personages,(Revelation 12:1 - 14:20).

4\. The seven vials (bowls), Revelation Revelation 15:1 - 16:21).

5\. The seven dooms, (Revelation 17:1 - 20:15).

6\. The seven new things, (Revelation 21:1 - 22:21).

The parenthetical passages are:

1\. The Jewish remnant and the tribulation saints, (Revelation 7:1-17).

2\. The angel, the little book, the two witnesses, (Revelation 10:1 -
11:14).

3\. The Lamb, the Remnant, and the everlasting Gospel, (Revelation
14:1-13).

4\. The gathering of the kings at Armageddon, (Revelation 16:13-16).

5\. The four alleluias in heaven, (Revelation 19:1-6). These passages do
not advance the prophetic narrative. Looking backward and forward they
sum up results accomplished, and speak of results yet to come as if they
had already come. In [Rev 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#001), for
example, the Lamb and Remnant are seen prophetically on Mount Sion,
though they are not actually there till [Rev
20:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#004).

The end of the church period (Revelation 2-3) is left indeterminate. It
will end by the fulfilment of [Th1
4:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#014). Revelation 4-19 are believed
to synchronize with Daniel's Seventieth Week

See Scofield - [Dan 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024)). The great
tribulation begins at the middle of the week, and continues three and a
half years (11:3-19:21). The tribulation is brought to an end by the
appearing of the Lord and the battle of Armageddon ([Mat
24:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#029); [Rev
19:11-21](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#011)). The kingdom follows ([Rev
20:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#004)); after this the "little
season" ([Rev 20:7-15](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#007)), and then
eternity.

Interpreters of the Revelation should bear in mind two important
passages: [Pe1 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#012); [Pe2
1:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#020). Doubtless much which is
designedly obscure to us will be clear to those for whom it was written
as the time approaches.
