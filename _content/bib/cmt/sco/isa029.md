### [Isaiah Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#001)

[Isaiah 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#001)

Ariel

"Lion of God", signifies Jerusalem.

[Isaiah 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#003)

And I will camp

Here, as often in prophecy, and especially in Isaiah, the near and far
horizons blend. The near view is of Sennacherib's invasion and the
destruction of the Assyrian host by the angel of the Lord (Isaiah 36,
37); the far view is that of the final gathering of the Gentile hosts
against Jerusalem at the end of the great tribulation ([Psa
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#005)); ([Rev
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#014)) when a still greater deliverance
will be wrought. (See "Times of the Gentiles," ([Luk
21:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#024)); ([Rev
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#014)). The same remark applies also
to ([Isa 28:14-18](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#014)) where there is a
near reference to the Egyptian alliance ("we have made a covenant,"
etc.), while the reference to the stone ([Isa
29:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#016)) carries the meaning forward to
the end-time, and the covenant of unbelieving Israel with the Beast.
([Dan 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027)).

[Isaiah 29:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#022)
