### [Job Chapter 38](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#001)

[Job 38:1](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 38:1</span></span>

The Lord answered Job

The words of jehovah have the effect of bringing Job consciously into
His presence. ([Job 42:5](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#005)). Hitherto
the discussions have been about God, but He has been conceived as
absent. Now Job and the Lord are face to face. It is noteworthy that Job
does not answer Elihu. Despite his harsh judgment he has spoken so truly
about God that Job remains silent. ([Job
38:1](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#001)) might be paraphrased, "Then
Jehovah answered for or on behalf of Job."

[Job 38:7](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 38:7</span></span>

sons of God

(See Scofield) - ([Heb 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#004)).
