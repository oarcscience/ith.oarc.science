Book Introduction - 1 John

Writer: The Apostle John, as unbroken tradition affirms, and as internal
evidence and comparison with the Gospel of John prove.

Date: Probably A.D. 90

Theme: First John is a family letter from the Father to His "little
children" who are in the world. With the possible exception of the Song
of Solomon, it is the most intimate of the inspired writings. The world
is viewed as without. The sin of a believer is treated as a child's
offence against his Father, and is dealt with as a family matter ([Jo1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#009); [Jo1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#001)). The moral government of the
universe is not in question. The child's sin as an offence against the
law had been met in the Cross, and "Jesus Christ the righteous" is now
his "Advocate with the Father." John's Gospel leads across the threshold
of the Father's house; his first Epistle makes us at home there. A
tender word is used for "children," teknia, "born ones," or "bairns."
Paul is occupied with our public position as sons; John with our
nearness as born-ones of the Father.

First John is in two principal divisions.

1\. The family with the Father (1 John 1:1 - 3:24).

2\. The family and the world (1 John 4:1 - 5:21).

There is a secondary analysis in each division of which occurs the
phrase, "My little children," as follows:

1\. Introductory, the incarnation (1 John 1:1-2).

2\. The little children and fellowship (1 John 1:3 - 2:14).

3\. The little children and secular and "religious" world (1 John
2:15-28).

4\. How the little children may know each other (1 John 2:29 - 3:10).

5\. How the little children must live together (1 John 3:11-24).

6\. Parenthetic: How the little children may know false teachers (1 John
4:1-6).

7\. The little children assured and warned (1 John 4:7 - 5:21).
