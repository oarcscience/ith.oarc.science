### [Jeremiah Chapter 36](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#001)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 36:0</span></span>

([Jer 36:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#001)) Baruch is to write the
prophecies of Jeremiah.

([Jer 36:9-19](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#009)) The princes advise them
to hide themselves.

([Jer 36:20-32](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#020)) The king having heard
a part, burns the roll.

[Jeremiah 36:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 36:1</span></span>

The writing of the Scriptures was by Divine appointment. The Divine
wisdom directed to this as a proper means; if it failed, the house of
Judah would be the more without excuse. The Lord declares to sinners the
evil he purposes to do against them, that they may hear, and fear, and
return from their evil ways; and whenever any one makes this use of
God's warnings, in dependence on his promised mercy, he will find the
Lord ready to forgive his sins. All others will be left without excuse;
and the consideration that great is the anger God has pronounced against
us for sin, should quicken both our prayers and our endeavours.

[Jeremiah 36:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 36:9</span></span>

Shows of piety and devotion may be found even among those, who, though
they keep up forms of godliness, are strangers and enemies to the power
of it. The princes patiently attended the reading of the whole book.
They were in great fear. But even those who are convinced to the truth
and importance of what they hear, and are disposed to favour those who
preach it, often have difficulties and reserves about their safety,
interest, or preferment, so that they do not act according to their
convictions, and try to get rid of what they find troublesome.

[Jeremiah 36:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 36:20</span></span>

Those who despise the word of God, will soon show, as this king did,
that they hate it; and, like him, they would wish it destroyed. See what
enmity there is against God in the carnal mind, and wonder at his
patience. The princes showed some concern, till they saw how light the
king made of it. Beware of making light of God's word!
