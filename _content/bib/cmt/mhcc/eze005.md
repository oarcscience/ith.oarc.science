### [Ezekiel Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#001)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 5:0</span></span>

([Eze 5:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#001)) A type of hair, showing
the judgments about to come upon the Jews.

([Eze 5:5-17](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#005)) These awful judgments
are declared.

[Ezekiel 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 5:1</span></span>

The prophet must shave off the hair of his head and beard, which
signifies God's utter rejecting and abandoning that people. One part
must be burned in the midst of the city, denoting the multitudes that
should perish by famine and pestilence. Another part was to be cut in
pieces, representing the many who were slain by the sword. Another part
was to be scattered in the wind, denoting the carrying away of some into
the land of the conqueror, and the flight of others into the
neighbouring countries for shelter. A small quantity of the third
portion was to be bound in his shirts, as that of which he is very
careful. But few were reserved. To whatever refuge sinners flee, the
fire and sword of God's wrath will consume them.

[Ezekiel 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 5:5</span></span>

The sentence passed upon Jerusalem is very dreadful, the manner of
expression makes it still more so. Who is able to stand in God's sight
when he is angry? Those who live and die impenitent, will perish for
ever unpitied; there is a day coming when the Lord will not spare. Let
not persons or churches, who change the Lord's statutes, expect to
escape the doom of Jerusalem. Let us endeavour to adorn the doctrine of
God our Saviour in all things. Sooner or later God's word will prove
itself true.
