### [Ezekiel Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#001)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 15:0</span></span>

Jerusalem like an unfruitful vine.

[Ezekiel 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 15:1</span></span>

If a vine be fruitful, it is valuable. But if not fruitful, it is
worthless and useless, it is cast into the fire. Thus man is capable of
yielding a precious fruit, in living to God; this is the sole end of his
existence; and if he fails in this, he is of no use but to be destroyed.
What blindness then attaches to those who live in the total neglect of
God and of true religion! This similitude is applied to Jerusalem. Let
us beware of an unfruitful profession. Let us come to Christ, and seek
to abide in him, and to have his words abide in us.
