### [Esther Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#001)

[Esther](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">est 2:0</span></span>

(v. 1-20) Esther chosen queen.

([Est 2:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#021)) Mordecai discovers a
plot against the king.

[Esther 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">est 2:1</span></span>

We see to what absurd practices those came, who were destitute of Divine
revelation, and what need there was of the gospel of Christ, to purify
men from the lusts of the flesh, and to bring them back to the original
institution of marriage. Esther was preferred as queen. Those who
suggest that Esther committed sin to come at this dignity, do not
consider the custom of those times and countries. Every one that the
king took was married to him, and was his wife, though of a lower rank.
But how low is human nature sunk, when such as these are the leading
pursuits and highest worldly happiness of men! Disappointment and
vexation must follow; and he most wisely consults his enjoyment, even in
this present life, who most exactly obeys the precepts of the Divine
law. But let us turn to consider the wise and merciful providence of
God, carrying on his deep but holy designs in the midst of all this. And
let no change in our condition be a pretext for forgetting our duties to
parents, or the friends who have stood in their place.

[Esther 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">est 2:21</span></span>

Good subjects must not conceal any bad design they know of against the
prince, or the public peace. Mordecai was not rewarded at the time, but
a remembrance was written. Thus, with respect to those who serve Christ,
though their recompence is not till the resurrection of the just, yet an
account is kept of their work of faith and labour of love, which God is
not unrighteous to forget. The servant of God must be faithful to every
trust, and watchful for those who employ him. If he appear to be
neglected now, he will be remembered hereafter. None of our actions can
be forgotten; even our most secret thoughts are written in lasting
registers, [Rev 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#012).
