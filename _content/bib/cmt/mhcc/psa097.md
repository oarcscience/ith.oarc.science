### [Psalms Chapter 97](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 97:0</span></span>

([Psa 97:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#001)) The Lord Jesus reigns in
power that cannot be resisted.

([Psa 97:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#008)) His care of his people,
and his provision for them.

[Psalms 97:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 97:1</span></span>

Though many have been made happy in Christ, still there is room. And all
have reason to rejoice in Christ's government. There is a depth in his
counsels, which we must not pretend to fathom; but still righteousness
and judgment are the habitation of his throne. Christ's government,
though it might be matter of joy to all, will yet be matter of terror to
some; but it is their own fault that it is so. The most resolute and
daring opposition will be baffled at the presence of the Lord. And the
Lord Jesus will ere long come, and put an end to idol worship of every
kind.

[Psalms 97:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 97:8</span></span>

The faithful servants of God may well rejoice and be glad, because he is
glorified; and whatever tends to his honour, is his people's pleasure.
Care is taken for their safety. But something more is meant than their
lives. The Lord will preserve the souls of his saints from sin, from
apostacy, and despair, under their greatest trials. He will deliver them
out of the hands of the wicked one, and preserve them safe to his
heavenly kingdom. And those that rejoice in Christ Jesus, and in his
exaltation, have fountains of joy prepared for them. Those that sow in
tears, shall reap in joy. Gladness is sure to the upright in heart; the
joy of the hypocrite is but for a moment. Sinners tremble, but saints
rejoice at God's holiness. As he hates sin, yet freely loves the person
of the repentant sinner who believes in Christ, he will make a final
separation between the person he loves and the sin he hates, and
sanctify his people wholly, body, soul, and spirit.
