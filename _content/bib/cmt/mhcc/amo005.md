### [Amos Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#001)

[Amos](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">amo 5:0</span></span>

([Amo 5:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#001)) Israel is called to seek
the Lord.

([Amo 5:7-17](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#007)) Earnest exhortations to
repentance.

([Amo 5:18-27](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#018)) Threatenings respecting
idolatries.

[Amos 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">amo 5:1</span></span>

The convincing, awakening word must be heard and heeded, as well as
words of comfort and peace; for whether we hear or forbear, the word of
God shall take effect. The Lord still proclaims mercy to men, but they
often expect deliverance from such self-invented forms as make their
condemnation sure. While they refuse to come to Christ and to seek mercy
in and by him, that they may live, the fire of Divine wrath breaks forth
upon them. Men may make an idol of the world, but will find it cannot
protect.

[Amos 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">amo 5:7</span></span>

The same almighty power can, for repenting sinners, easily turn
affliction and sorrow into prosperity and joy, and as easily turn the
prosperity of daring sinners into utter darkness. Evil times will not
bear plain dealing; that is, evil men will not. And these men were evil
men indeed, when wise and good men thought it in vain even to speak to
them. Those who will seek and love that which is good, may help to save
the land from ruin. It behoves us to plead God's spiritual promises, to
beseech him to create in us a clean heart, and to renew a right spirit
within us. The Lord is ever ready to be gracious to the souls that seek
him; and then piety and every duty will be attended to. But as for
sinful Israel, God's judgments had often passed by them, now they shall
pass through them.

[Amos 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">amo 5:18</span></span>

Woe unto those that desire the day of the Lord's judgments, that wish
for times of war and confusion; as some who long for changes, hoping to
rise upon the ruins of their country! but this should be so great a
desolation, that nobody could gain by it. The day of the Lord will be a
dark, dismal, gloomy day to all impenitent sinners. When God makes a day
dark, all the world cannot make it light. Those who are not reformed by
the judgments of God, will be pursued by them; if they escape one,
another stands ready to seize them. A pretence of piety is double
iniquity, and so it will be found. The people of Israel copied the
crimes of their forefathers. The law of worshipping the Lord our God,
is, Him only we must serve. Professors thrive so little, because they
have little or no communion with God in their duties. They were led
captive by Satan into idolatry, therefore God caused them to go into
captivity among idolaters.
