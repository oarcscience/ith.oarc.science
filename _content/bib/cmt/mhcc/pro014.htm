<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#001">Proverbs 14:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">pro 14:1</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>A woman who has no fear of God, who is wilful and wasteful, and indulges her ease, will as certainly ruin her family, as if she plucked her house down. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#002">Proverbs 14:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">pro 14:2</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Here are grace and sin in their true colours. Those that despise God's precepts and promises, despise God and all his power and mercy. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#003">Proverbs 14:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">pro 14:3</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Pride grows from that root of bitterness which is in the heart. The root must be plucked up, or we cannot conquer this branch. The prudent words of wise men get them out of difficulties. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#004">Proverbs 14:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">pro 14:4</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>There can be no advantage without something which, though of little moment, will affright the indolent. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#005">Proverbs 14:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">pro 14:5</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>A conscientious witness will not dare to represent anything otherwise than according to his knowledge. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#006">Proverbs 14:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">pro 14:6</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>A scorner treats Divine things with contempt. He that feels his ignorance and unworthiness will search the Scriptures in a humble spirit. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#007">Proverbs 14:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">pro 14:7</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>We discover a wicked man if there is no savour of piety in his discourse. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#008">Proverbs 14:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">pro 14:8</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>We are travellers, whose concern is, not to spy out wonders, but to get to their journey's end; to understand the rules we are to walk by, also the ends we are to walk toward. The bad man cheats himself, and goes on in his mistake. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#009">Proverbs 14:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">pro 14:9</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Foolish and profane men consider sin a mere trifle, to be made light of rather than mourned over. Fools mock at the sin-offering; but those that make light of sin, make light of Christ. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#010">Proverbs 14:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">pro 14:10</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>We do not know what stings of conscience, or consuming passions, torment the prosperous sinner. Nor does the world know the peace of mind a serious Christian enjoys, even in poverty and sickness. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#011">Proverbs 14:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">pro 14:11</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Sin ruins many great families; whilst righteousness often raises and strengthens even mean families. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#012">Proverbs 14:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">pro 14:12</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The ways of carelessness, of worldliness, and of sensuality, seem right to those that walk in them; but self-deceivers prove self-destroyers. See the vanity of carnal mirth. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#014">Proverbs 14:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">pro 14:14</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Of all sinners backsliders will have the most terror when they reflect on their own ways. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#015">Proverbs 14:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">pro 14:15</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Eager readiness to believe what others say, has ever proved mischievous. The whole world was thus ruined at first. The man who is spiritually wise, depends on the Saviour alone for acceptance. He is watchful against the enemies of his salvation, by taking heed to God's word. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#016">Proverbs 14:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">pro 14:16</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Holy fear guards against every thing unholy. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#017">Proverbs 14:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">pro 14:17</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>An angry man is to be pitied as well as blamed; but the revengeful is more hateful. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#018">Proverbs 14:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">pro 14:18</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Sin is the shame of sinners; but wisdom is the honour of the wise. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#019">Proverbs 14:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">pro 14:19</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Even bad men acknowledge the excellency of God's people. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#020">Proverbs 14:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">pro 14:20</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Friendship in the world is governed by self-interest. It is good to have God our Friend; he will not desert us. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#021">Proverbs 14:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">pro 14:21</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>To despise a man for his employment or appearance is a sin. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#022">Proverbs 14:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">pro 14:22</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>How wisely those consult their own interest, who not only do good, but devise it! 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#023">Proverbs 14:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">pro 14:23</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Labour of the head, or of the hand, will turn to some good account. But if men's religion runs all out in talk and noise, they will come to nothing. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#024">Proverbs 14:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">pro 14:24</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The riches of men of wisdom and piety enlarge their usefulness.

<p>An upright man will venture the displeasure of the greatest, to bring truth to light. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#026">Proverbs 14:26</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_026">pro 14:26</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Those who fear the Lord so as to obey and serve him, have a strong ground of confidence, and will be preserved. Let us seek to this Fountain of life, that we may escape the snares of death. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#028">Proverbs 14:28</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_028">pro 14:28</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Let all that wish well to the kingdom of Christ, do what they can, that many may be added to his church. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#029">Proverbs 14:29</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_029">pro 14:29</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>A mild, patient man is one that learns of Christ, who is Wisdom itself. Unbridled passion is folly made known. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#030">Proverbs 14:30</A></p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_032">pro 14:32</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The wicked man has his soul forced from him; he dies in his sins, under the guilt and power of them. But godly men, though they have pain and some dread of death, have the blessed hope, which God, who cannot lie, has given them. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#033">Proverbs 14:33</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_033">pro 14:33</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Wisdom possesses the heart, and thus regulates the affections and tempers. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#034">Proverbs 14:34</A></p>
