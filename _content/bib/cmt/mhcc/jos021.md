### [Joshua Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#001)

[Joshua](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jos 21:0</span></span>

([Jos 21:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#001)) Cities for the Levites.

(v. 9-42) The cities allotted to the Levites.

([Jos 21:43-45](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#043)) God gave the land and
rest to the Israelites, according to his promise.

[Joshua 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 21:1</span></span>

The Levites waited till the other tribes were provided for, before they
preferred their claim to Joshua. They build their claim upon a very good
foundation; not their own merits or services, but the Divine precept.
The maintenance of ministers is not a thing left merely to the will of
the people, that they may let them starve if they please; they which
preach the gospel should live by the gospel, and should live
comfortably.

[Joshua 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jos 21:9</span></span>

By mixing the Levites with the other tribes, they were made to see that
the eyes of all Israel were upon them, and therefore it was their
concern to walk so that their ministry might not be blamed. Every tribe
had its share of Levites' cities. Thus did God graciously provide for
keeping up religion among them, and that they might have the word in all
parts of the land. Yet, blessed be God, we have the gospel more diffused
amongst us.

[Joshua 21:43](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">jos 21:43</span></span>

God promised to give to the seed of Abraham the land of Canaan for a
possession, and now they possessed it, and dwelt therein. And the
promise of the heavenly Canaan is as sure to all God's spiritual Israel;
for it is the promise of Him that cannot lie. There stood not a man
before them. The after-prevalence of the Canaanites was the effect of
Israel's slothfulness, and the punishment of their sinful inclination to
the idolatries and abominations of the heathen whom they harboured and
indulged. There failed not aught of any good thing, which the Lord had
spoken to the house of Israel. In due season all his promises will be
accomplished; then will his people acknowledge that the Lord has
exceeded their largest expectations, and made them more than conquerors,
and brought them to their desired rest.
