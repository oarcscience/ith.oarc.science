### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#001)

[4 Kings (2 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">kg2 15:0</span></span>

([Kg2 15:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#001)) Reign of Azariah, or
Uzziah, king of Judah.

(v. 8-31) The latter kings of Israel.

(v. 32-38) Jotham, king of Judah.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 15:1</span></span>

Uzziah did for the most part that which was right. It was happy for the
kingdom that a good reign was a long one.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 15:8</span></span>

This history shows Israel in confusion. Though Judah was not without
troubles, yet that kingdom was happy, compared with the state of Israel.
The imperfections of true believers are very different from the allowed
wickedness of ungodly men. Such is human nature, such are our hearts, if
left to themselves, deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked.
We have reason to be thankful for restraints, for being kept out of
temptation, and should beg of God to renew a right spirit within us.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">kg2 15:32</span></span>

Jotham showed great respect to the temple. If magistrates cannot do all
they would, for the suppressing of vice and profaneness, let them do the
more to support and advance piety and virtue.
