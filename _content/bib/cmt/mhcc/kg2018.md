### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#001)

[4 Kings (2 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">kg2 18:0</span></span>

([Kg2 18:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#001)) Good reign of Hezekiah
in Judah, Idolatry.

([Kg2 18:9-16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#009)) Sennacherib invades
Judah.

(v. 17-37) Rabshakeh's blasphemies.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 18:1</span></span>

Hezekiah was a true son of David. Some others did that which was right,
but not like David. Let us not suppose that when times and men are bad,
they must needs grow worse and worse; that does not follow: after many
bad kings, God raised one up like David himself. The brazen serpent had
been carefully preserved, as a memorial of God's goodness to their
fathers in the wilderness; but it was idle and wicked to burn incense to
it. All helps to devotion, not warranted by the word of God, interrupt
the exercise of faith; they always lead to superstition and other
dangerous evils. Human nature perverts every thing of this kind. True
faith needs not such aids; the word of God, daily thought upon and
prayed over, is all the outward help we need.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg2 18:9</span></span>

The descent Sennacherib made upon Judah, was a great calamity to that
kingdom, by which God would try the faith of Hezekiah, and chastise the
people. The secret dislike, the hypocrisy, and lukewarmness of numbers,
require correction; such trials purify the faith and hope of the
upright, and bring them to simple dependence on God.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg2 18:17</span></span>

Rabshakeh tries to convince the Jews, that it was to no purpose for them
to stand it out. What confidence is this wherein thou trustest? It were
well if sinners would submit to the force of this argument, in seeking
peace with God. It is, therefore, our wisdom to yield to him, because it
is in vain to contend with him: what confidence is that which those
trust in who stand out against him? A great deal of art there is in this
speech of Rabshakeh; but a great deal of pride, malice, falsehood, and
blasphemy. Hezekiah's nobles held their peace. There is a time to keep
silence, as well as a time to speak; and there are those to whom to
offer any thing religious or rational, is to cast pearls before swine.
Their silence made Rabshakeh yet more proud and secure. It is often best
to leave such persons to rail and blaspheme; a decided expression of
abhorrence is the best testimony against them. The matter must be left
to the Lord, who has all hearts in his hands, committing ourselves unto
him in humble submission, believing hope, and fervent prayer.
