### [2 Chronicles Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001)

Asa's piety, He strengthens his kingdom.

[2 Chronicles 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 14:1</span></span>

Asa aimed at pleasing God, and studied to approve himself to him. Happy
those that walk by this rule, not to do that which is right in their own
eyes, or in the eye of the world, but which is so in God's sight. We
find by experience that it is good to seek the Lord; it gives us rest;
while we pursue the world, we meet with nothing but vexation. Asa
consulted with his people how to make a good use of the peace they
enjoyed; and concluded with them that they must not be idle, nor secure.
A formidable army of Ethiopians invaded Asa's kingdom. This evil came
upon them, that their faith in God might be tried. Asa's prayer is
short, but it is the real language of faith and expectation from God.
When we go forth in God's name, we cannot but prosper, and all things
work together for the good of those whom he favours.
