### [Ezra Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#001)

[Ezra](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ezr 4:0</span></span>

([Ezr 4:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#001)) The adversaries of the
temple.

(v. 6-24) The building of the temple is hindered.

[Ezra 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ezr 4:1</span></span>

Every attempt to revive true religion will stir up the opposition of
Satan, and of those in whom he works. The adversaries were the
Samaritans, who had been planted in the land of Israel, 2 Kings 17. It
was plain that they did not mean to unite in the worship of the Lord,
according to his word. Let those who discourage a good work, and weaken
them that are employed in it, see whose pattern they follow.

[Ezra 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ezr 4:6</span></span>

It is an old slander, that the prosperity of the church would be hurtful
to kings and princes. Nothing can be more false, for true godliness
teaches us to honour and obey our sovereign. But where the command of
God requires one thing and the law of the land another, we must obey God
rather than man, and patiently submit to the consequences. All who love
the gospel should avoid all appearance of evil, lest they should
encourage the adversaries of the church. The world is ever ready to
believe any accusation against the people of God, and refuses to listen
to them. The king suffered himself to be imposed upon by these frauds
and falsehoods. Princes see and hear with other men's eyes and ears, and
judge things as represented to them, which are often done falsely. But
God's judgment is just; he sees things as they are.
