### [Ezekiel Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#001)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 4:0</span></span>

([Eze 4:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#001)) The siege of Jerusalem.

([Eze 4:9-17](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#009)) The famine the
inhabitants would suffer.

[Ezekiel 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 4:1</span></span>

The prophet was to represent the siege of Jerusalem by signs. He was to
lie on his left side for a number of days, supposed to be equal to the
years from the establishment of idolatry. All that the prophet sets
before the children of his people, about the destruction of Jerusalem,
is to show that sin is the provoking cause of the ruin of that once
flourishing city.

[Ezekiel 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 4:9</span></span>

The bread which was Ezekiel's support, was to be made of coarse grain
and pulse mixed together, seldom used except in times of urgent
scarcity, and of this he was only to take a small quantity. Thus was
figured the extremity to which the Jews were to be reduced during the
siege and captivity. Ezekiel does not plead, Lord, from my youth I have
been brought up delicately, and never used to any thing like this; but
that he had been brought up conscientiously, and never had eaten any
thing forbidden by the law. It will be comfortable when we are brought
to suffer hardships, if our hearts can witness that we have always been
careful to keep even from the appearance of evil. See what woful work
sin makes, and acknowledge the righteousness of God herein. Their plenty
having been abused to luxury and excess, they were justly punished by
famine. When men serve not God with cheerfulness in the abundance of all
things, God will make them serve their enemies in the want of all
things.
