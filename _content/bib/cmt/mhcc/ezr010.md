### [Ezra Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#001)

[Ezra](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ezr 10:0</span></span>

([Ezr 10:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#001)) Ezra encourages to
reformation.

([Ezr 10:6-14](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#006)) He assembles the
people.

(v. 15-44) Reformation effected.

[Ezra 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ezr 10:1</span></span>

Shechaniah owned the national guilt. The case is sad, but it is not
desperate; the disease threatening, but not incurable. Now that the
people begin to lament, a spirit of repentance seems to be poured out;
now there is hope that God will forgive, and have mercy. The sin that
rightly troubles us, shall not ruin us. In melancholy times we must
observe what makes for us, as well as against us. And there may be good
hopes through grace, even where there is the sense of great guilt before
God. The case is plain; what has been done amiss, must be undone again
as far as possible; nothing less than this is true repentance. Sin must
be put away, with a resolution never to have any thing more to do with
it. What has been unjustly got, must be restored. Arise, be of good
courage. Weeping, in this case, is good, but reforming is better. As to
being unequally yoked with unbelievers, such marriages, it is certain,
are sinful, and ought not to be made; but now they are not null, as they
were before the gospel did away the separation between Jews and
Gentiles.

[Ezra 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ezr 10:6</span></span>

There is hope concerning people, when they are convinced, not only that
it is good to part with their sins, but that it is necessary; we must do
it, or we are undone. So rich is the mercy, and so plenteous the
redemption of God, that there is hope for the vilest who hear the
gospel, and are willing to accept of free salvation. When sinners mourn
for their sins, and tremble at the word of God, there is hope that they
will forsake them. To affect others with godly sorrow or love to God, we
must ourselves be affected. It was carefully agreed how this affair
should be carried on. That which is hastily resolved on seldom proves
lasting.

[Ezra 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ezr 10:15</span></span>

The best reformers can but do their endeavour; when the Redeemer himself
shall come to Zion, he shall effectually turn away ungodliness from
Jacob. And when sin is repented of and forsaken, God will forgive it;
but the blood of Christ, our Sin-offering, is the only atonement which
takes away our guilt. No seeming repentance or amendment will benefit
those who reject Him, for self-dependence proves them still unhumbled.
All the names written in the book of life, are those of penitent
sinners, not of self-righteous persons, who think they have no need of
repentance.
