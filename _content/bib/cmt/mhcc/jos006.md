### [Joshua Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#001)

[Joshua](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jos 6:0</span></span>

([Jos 6:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#001)) The siege of Jericho.

([Jos 6:6-16](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#006)) The city is compassed.

([Jos 6:17-27](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#017)) Jericho is taken, Rahab
and her family are saved.

[Joshua 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 6:1</span></span>

Jericho resolves Israel shall not be its master. It shut itself up,
being strongly fortified both by art and nature. Thus were they foolish,
and their hearts hardened to their destruction; the miserable case of
all that strengthen themselves against the Almighty. God resolves Israel
shall be its master, and that quickly. No warlike preparations were to
be made. By the uncommon method of besieging the city, the Lord honoured
the ark, as the symbol of his presence, and showed that all the
victories were from him. The faith and patience of the people were
proved and increased.

[Joshua 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jos 6:6</span></span>

Wherever the ark went, the people attended it. God's ministers, by the
trumpet of the everlasting gospel, which proclaims liberty and victory,
must encourage the followers of Christ in their spiritual warfare. As
promised deliverances must be expected in God's way, so they must be
expected in his time. At last the people were to shout: they did so, and
the walls fell. This was a shout of faith; they believed the walls of
Jericho would fall. It was a shout of prayer; they cry to Heaven for
help, and help came.

[Joshua 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jos 6:17</span></span>

Jericho was to be a solemn and awful sacrifice to the justice of God,
upon those who had filled up the measure of their sins. So He appoints,
from whom, as creatures, they received their lives, and to whom, as
sinners, they had forfeited them. Rahab perished not with them that
believed not, [Heb 11:31](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#031). All her
kindred were saved with her; thus faith in Christ brings salvation to
the house, [Act 16:31](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#031). She, and they
with her, were plucked as brands from the burning. With Rahab, or with
the men of Jericho; our portion must be assigned, as we posses or
disregard the sign of salvation; even faith in Christ, which worketh by
love. Let us remember what depends upon our choice, and let us choose
accordingly. God shows the weight of a Divine curse; where it rests
there is no getting from under it; for it brings ruin without remedy.
