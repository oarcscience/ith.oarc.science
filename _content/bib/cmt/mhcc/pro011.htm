<p>Riches will stand men in no stead in the day of death. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#005">Proverbs 11:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">pro 11:5</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The ways of wickedness are dangerous. And sin will be its own punishment. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#007">Proverbs 11:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">pro 11:7</A></FONT></span></p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">pro 11:13</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>A faithful man will not disclose what he is trusted with, unless the honour of God and the real good of society require it. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#014">Proverbs 11:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">pro 11:14</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>We shall often find it to our advantage to advise with others. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#015">Proverbs 11:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">pro 11:15</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The welfare of our families, our own peace, and our ability to pay just debts, must not be brought into danger. But here especially let us consider the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ in becoming Surety even for enemies. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#016">Proverbs 11:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">pro 11:16</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>A pious and discreet woman will keep esteem and respect, as strong men keep possession of wealth. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#017">Proverbs 11:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">pro 11:17</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>A cruel, froward, ill-natured man, is vexatious to those that are, and should be to him as his own flesh, and punishes himself. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#018">Proverbs 11:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">pro 11:18</A></FONT></span></p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">pro 11:19</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>True holiness is true happiness. The more violent a man is in sinful pursuits, the more he hastens his own destruction. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#020">Proverbs 11:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">pro 11:20</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Nothing is more hateful to God, than hypocrisy and double dealing, which are here signified. God delights in such as aim and act with uprightness. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#021">Proverbs 11:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">pro 11:21</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Joining together in sin shall not protect the sinners. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#022">Proverbs 11:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">pro 11:22</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Beauty is abused by those who have not discretion or modesty with it. This is true of all bodily endowments. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#023">Proverbs 11:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">pro 11:23</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The wicked desire mischief to others, but it shall return upon themselves. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#024">Proverbs 11:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">pro 11:24</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>A man may grow poor by not paying just debts, not relieving the poor, not allowing needful expenses. Let men be ever so saving of what they have, if God appoints, it comes to nothing. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#025">Proverbs 11:25</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_025">pro 11:25</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Both in temporal and spiritual things, God commonly deals with his people according to the measure by which they deal with their brethren. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#026">Proverbs 11:26</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_026">pro 11:26</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>We must not hoard up the gifts of God's bounty, merely for our own advantage. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#027">Proverbs 11:27</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_027">pro 11:27</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Seeking mischief is here set against seeking good; for those that are not doing good are doing hurt, even to themselves. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#028">Proverbs 11:28</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_028">pro 11:28</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The true believer is a branch of the living Vine. When those that take root in the world wither, those who are grafted into Christ shall be fruitful. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#029">Proverbs 11:29</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_029">pro 11:29</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>He that brings trouble upon himself and his family, by carelessness, or by wickedness, shall be unable to keep and enjoy what he gets, as a man is unable to hold the wind, or to satisfy himself with it. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#030">Proverbs 11:30</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_030">pro 11:30</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The righteous are as trees of life; and their influence upon earth, like the fruits of that tree, support and nourish the spiritual life in many. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#031">Proverbs 11:31</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_031">pro 11:31</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Even the righteous, when they offend on earth, shall meet with sharp corrections; much more will the wicked meet the due reward of their sins. Let us then seek those blessings which our Surety purchased by his sufferings and death; let us seek to copy his example, and to keep his commandments.
