### [Amos Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#001)

[Amos](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">amo 4:0</span></span>

([Amo 4:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#001)) Israel is reproved.

([Amo 4:6-13](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#006)) Their impenitence shown.

[Amos 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">amo 4:1</span></span>

What is got by extortion is commonly used to provide for the flesh, and
to fulfil the lusts thereof. What is got by oppression cannot be enjoyed
with satisfaction. How miserable are those whose confidence in
unscriptural observances only prove that they believe a lie! Let us see
to it that our faith, hope, and worship, are warranted by the Divine
word.

[Amos 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">amo 4:6</span></span>

See the folly of carnal hearts; they wander from one creature to
another, seeking for something to satisfy, and labour for that which
satisfies not; yet, after all, they will not incline their ear to Him in
whom they might find all they can want. Preaching the gospel is as rain,
and every thing withers where this rain is wanting. It were well if
people were as wise for their souls as they are for their bodies; and,
when they have not this rain near, would go and seek it where it is to
be had. As the Israelites persisted in rebellion and idolatry, the Lord
was coming against them as an adversary. Ere long, we must meet our God
in judgment; but we shall not be able to stand before him, if he tries
us according to our doings. If we would prepare to meet our God with
comfort, at the awful period of his coming, we must now meet him in
Christ Jesus, the eternal Son of the Father, who came to save lost
sinners. We must seek him while he is to be found.
