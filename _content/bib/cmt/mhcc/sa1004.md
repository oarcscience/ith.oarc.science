### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#001)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa1 4:0</span></span>

([Sa1 4:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#001)) The Israelites overcome
by the Philistines.

([Sa1 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#010), [Sa1
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#011)) The ark taken.

([Sa1 4:12-18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#012)) The death of Eli.

([Sa1 4:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#019)) The birth of Ichabod.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 4:1</span></span>

Israel is smitten before the Philistines. Sin, the accursed thing, was
in the camp, and gave their enemies all the advantage they could wish
for. They own the hand of God in their trouble; but, instead of
submitting, they speak angrily, as not aware of any just provocation
they had given him. The foolishness of man perverts his way, and then
his heart frets against the Lord, [Pro
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#003), and finds fault with him. They
supposed that they could oblige God to appear for them, by bringing the
ark into their camp. Those who have gone back in the life of religion,
sometimes discover great fondness for the outward observances of it, as
if those would save them; and as if the ark, God's throne, in the camp,
would bring them to heaven, though the world and the flesh are on the
throne in the heart.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa1 4:10</span></span>

The taking of the ark was a great judgment upon Israel, and a certain
token of God's displeasure. Let none think to shelter themselves from
the wrath of God, under the cloak of outward profession.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa1 4:12</span></span>

The defeat of the army was very grievous to Eli as a judge; the tidings
of the death of his two sons, to whom he had been so indulgent, and who,
as he had reason to fear, died impenitent, touched him as a father; yet
there was a greater concern on his spirit. And when the messenger
concluded his story with, "The ark of God is taken," he is struck to the
heart, and died immediately. A man may die miserably, yet not die
eternally; may come to an untimely end, yet the end be peace.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa1 4:19</span></span>

The wife of Phinehas seems to have been a person of piety. Her dying
regret was for the loss of the ark, and the departure of the glory from
Israel. What is any earthly joy to her that feels herself dying? No joy
but that which is spiritual and divine, will stand in any stead then;
death is too serious a thing to admit the relish of any earthly joy.
What is it to one that is lamenting the loss of the ark? What pleasure
can we take in our creature comforts and enjoyments, if we want God's
word and ordinances; especially if we want the comfort of his gracious
presence, and the light of his countenance? If God go, the glory goes,
and all good goes. Woe unto us if he depart! But though the glory is
withdrawn from one sinful nation, city, or village after another, yet it
shall never depart altogether, but shines forth in one place when
eclipsed in another.
