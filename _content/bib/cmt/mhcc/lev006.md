### [Leviticus Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#001)

[Leviticus](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">lev 6:0</span></span>

([Lev 6:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#001)) Concerning trespasses
against our neighbour.

([Lev 6:8-13](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#008)) Concerning the
burnt-offering.

([Lev 6:14-23](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#014)) Concerning the
meat-offering.

([Lev 6:24-30](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#024)) Concerning the
sin-offering.

[Leviticus 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 6:1</span></span>

Though all the instances relate to our neighbour, yet it is called a
trespass against the Lord. Though the person injured be mean, and even
despicable, yet the injury reflects upon that God who has made the
command of loving our neighbour next to that of loving himself. Human
laws make a difference as to punishments; but all methods of doing wrong
to others, are alike violations of the Divine law, even keeping what is
found, when the owner can be discovered. Frauds are generally
accompanied with lies, often with false oaths. If the offender would
escape the vengeance of God, he must make ample restitution, according
to his power, and seek forgiveness by faith in that one Offering which
taketh away the sin of the world. The trespasses here mentioned, still
are trespasses against the law of Christ, which insists as much upon
justice and truth, as the law of nature, or the law of Moses.

[Leviticus 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">lev 6:8</span></span>

The daily sacrifice of a lamb is chiefly referred to. The priest must
take care of the fire upon the altar. The first fire upon the altar came
from heaven, [Lev 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#024); by keeping
that up continually, all their sacrifices might be said to be consumed
with the fire from heaven, in token of God's acceptance. Thus should the
fire of our holy affections, the exercise of our faith and love, of
prayer and praise, be without ceasing.

[Leviticus 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lev 6:14</span></span>

The law of the burnt-offerings put upon the priests a great deal of care
and work; the flesh was wholly burnt, and the priests had nothing but
the skin. But most of the meat-offering was their own. It is God's will
that his ministers should be provided with what is needful.

[Leviticus 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">lev 6:24</span></span>

The blood of the sin-offering was to be washed out of the clothes on
which it should happen to be sprinkled, which signified the regard we
ought to have to the blood of Christ, not counting it a common thing.
The vessel in which the flesh of the sin-offering was boiled must be
broken, if it were an earthen one; but if a brazen one, well washed.
This showed that the defilement was not wholly taken away by the
offering; but the blood of Christ thoroughly cleanses from all sin. All
these rules set forth the polluting nature of sin, and the removal of
guilt from the sinner to the sacrifice. Behold and wonder at Christ's
love, in that he was content to be made a sin-offering for us, and so to
procure our pardon for continual sins and failings. He that knew no sin
was made sin (that is, a sin-offering) for us, [Co2
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#021). Hence we have pardon, and not
only pardon, but power also, against sin, [Rom
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#003).
