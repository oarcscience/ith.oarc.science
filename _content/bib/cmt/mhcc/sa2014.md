### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#001)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa2 14:0</span></span>

(v. 1-20) Joab procures Absalom's recall.

([Sa2 14:21-24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#021)) Absalom recalled.

([Sa2 14:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#025)) His personal beauty.

([Sa2 14:28-33](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#028)) He is admitted to his
father's presence.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 14:1</span></span>

We may notice here, how this widow pleads God's mercy, and his clemency
toward poor guilty sinners. The state of sinners is a state of
banishment from God. God pardons none to the dishonour of his law and
justice, nor any who are impenitent; nor to the encouragement of crimes,
or the hurt of others.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa2 14:21</span></span>

David was inclined to favour Absalom, yet, for the honour of his
justice, he could not do it but upon application made for him, which may
show the methods of Divine grace. It is true that God has thoughts of
compassion toward poor sinners, not willing that any should perish; yet
he is only reconciled to them through a Mediator, who pleads on their
behalf. God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, and Christ
came to this land of our banishment, to bring us to God.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">sa2 14:25</span></span>

Nothing is said of Absalom's wisdom and piety. All here said of him is,
that he was very handsome. A poor commendation for a man that had
nothing else in him valuable. Many a polluted, deformed soul dwells in a
fair and comely body. And we read that he had a very fine head of hair.
It was a burden to him, but he would not cut it as long as he could bear
the weight. That which feeds and gratifies pride, is not complained of,
though uneasy. May the Lord grant us the beauty of holiness, and the
adorning of a meek and quiet spirit! Only those who fear God are truly
happy.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 14:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">sa2 14:28</span></span>

By his insolent carriage toward Joab, Absalom brought Joab to plead for
him. By his insolent message to the king, he gained his wishes. When
parents and rulers countenance such characters, they will soon suffer
the most fatal effects. But did the compassion of a father prevail to
reconcile him to an impenitent son, and shall penitent sinners question
the compassion of Him who is the Father of mercies?
