### [Lamentations Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#001)

[Lamentations](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">lam 2:0</span></span>

Lamentation for the misery of Jerusalem.

[Lamentations 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lam 2:1</span></span>

A sad representation is here made of the state of God's church, of Jacob
and Israel; but the notice seems mostly to refer to the hand of the Lord
in their calamities. Yet God is not an enemy to his people, when he is
angry with them and corrects them. And gates and bars stand in no stead
when God withdraws his protection. It is just with God to cast down
those by judgments, who debase themselves by sin; and to deprive those
of the benefit and comfort of sabbaths and ordinances, who have not duly
valued nor observed them. What should they do with Bibles, who make no
improvement of them? Those who misuse God's prophets, justly lose them.
It becomes necessary, though painful, to turn the thoughts of the
afflicted to the hand of God lifted up against them, and to their sins
as the source of their miseries.

[Lamentations 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">lam 2:10</span></span>

Causes for lamentation are described. Multitudes perished by famine.
Even little children were slain by their mother's hands, and eaten,
according to the threatening, [Deu
28:53](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#053). Multitudes fell by the sword.
Their false prophets deceived them. And their neighbours laughed at
them. It is a great sin to jest at others' miseries, and adds much
affliction to the afflicted. Their enemies triumphed over them. The
enemies of the church are apt to take its shocks for its ruins; but they
will find themselves deceived. Calls to lamentation are given; and
comforts for the cure of these lamentations are sought. Prayer is a
salve for every sore, even the sorest; a remedy for every malady, even
the most grievous. Our business in prayer is to refer our case to the
Lord, and leave it with him. His will be done. Let us fear God, and walk
humbly before him, and take heed lest we fall.
