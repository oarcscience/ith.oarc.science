### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#001)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa2 22:0</span></span>

David's psalm of thanksgiving.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 22:1</span></span>

This chapter is a psalm of praise; we find it afterwards nearly as
Psalms 18. They that trust God in the way of duty, shall find him a
present help in their greatest dangers: David did so. Remarkable
preservations should be particularly mentioned in our praises. We shall
never be delivered from all enemies till we get to heaven. God will
preserve all his people, [Ti2 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#018).
Those who receive signal mercies from God, ought to give him the glory.
In the day that God delivered David, he sang this song. While the mercy
is fresh, and we are most affected with it, let the thank-offering be
brought, to be kindled with the fire of that affection. All his joys and
hopes close, as all our hopes should do, in the great Redeemer.
