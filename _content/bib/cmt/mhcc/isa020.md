### [Isaiah Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#001)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 20:0</span></span>

The invasion and conquest of Egypt and Ethiopia.

[Isaiah 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 20:1</span></span>

Isaiah was a sign to the people by his unusual dress, when he walked
abroad. He commonly wore sackcloth as a prophet, to show himself
mortified to the world. He was to loose this from his loins; to wear no
upper garments, and to go barefooted. This sign was to signify, that the
Egyptians and Ethiopians should be led away captives by the king of
Assyria, thus stripped. The world will often deem believers foolish,
when singular in obedience to God. But the Lord will support his
servants under the most trying effects of their obedience; and what they
are called upon to suffer for his sake, commonly is light, compared with
what numbers groan under from year to year from sin. Those who make any
creature their expectation and glory, and so put it in the place of God,
will, sooner or later, be ashamed of it. But disappointment in
creature-confidences, instead of driving us to despair, should drive us
to God, and our expectation shall not be in vain. The same lesson is in
force now; and where shall we look for aid in the hour of necessity, but
to the Lord our Righteousness?
