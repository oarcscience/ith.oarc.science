[Daniel](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">dan 0:0</span></span>

Daniel was of noble birth, if not one of the royal family of Judah. He
was carried captive to Babylon in the fourth year of Jehoiachin, B. C.
606, when a youth. He was there taught the learning of the Chaldeans,
and held high offices, both under the Babylonian and Persian empires. He
was persecuted for his religion, but was miraculously delivered; and
lived to a great age, as he must have been about ninety-four years old
at the time of the last of his visions. The book of Daniel is partly
historical, relating various circumstances which befell himself and the
Jews, at Babylon; but is chiefly prophetical, detailing visions and
prophecies which foretell numerous important events relative to the four
great empires of the world, the coming and death of the Messiah, the
restoration of the Jews, and the conversion of the Gentiles. Though
there are considerable difficulties in explaining the prophetical
meaning of some passages in this book, we always find encouragement to
faith and hope, examples worthy of imitation, and something to direct
our thoughts to Christ Jesus upon the cross and on his glorious throne.
