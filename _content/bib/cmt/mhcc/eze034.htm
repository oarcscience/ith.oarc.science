<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#001">Eze 34:1-6</A>) The rulers reproved.
<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#007">Eze 34:7-16</A>) The people are to be restored to their own land.
<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#017">Eze 34:17-31</A>) The kingdom of Christ. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#001">Ezekiel 34:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">eze 34:1</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The people became as sheep without a shepherd, were given up as a prey to their enemies, and the land was utterly desolated. No rank or office can exempt from the reproofs of God's word, men who neglect their duty, and abuse the trust reposed in them. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#007">Ezekiel 34:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">eze 34:7</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The Lord declared that he intended mercy towards the scattered flock. Doubtless this, in the first place, had reference to the restoration of the Jews. It also represented the good Shepherd's tender care of the souls of his people. He finds them in their days of darkness and ignorance, and brings them to his fold. He comes to their relief in times of persecution and temptation. He leads them in the ways of righteousness, and causes them to rest on his love and faithfulness. The proud and self-sufficient, are enemies of the true gospel and of believers; against such we must guard. He has rest for disquieted saints, and terror for presumptuous sinners. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#017">Ezekiel 34:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">eze 34:17</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The whole nation seemed to be the Lord's flock, yet they were very different characters; but he knew how to distinguish between them. By good pastures and deep waters, are meant the pure word of God and the dispensing of justice. The latter verses, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#023">Eze 34:23-31</A>, prophesy of Christ, and of the most glorious times of his church on earth. Under Him, as the good Shepherd, the church would be a blessing to all around. Christ, though excellent in himself, was as a tender plant out of a dry ground. Being the Tree of life, bearing all the fruits of salvation, he yields spiritual food to the souls of his people. Our constant desire and prayer should be, that there may be showers of blessings in every place where the truth of Christ is preached; and that all who profess the gospel may be filled with fruits of righteousness.
