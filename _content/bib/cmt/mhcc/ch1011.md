### [1 Chronicles Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#001)

[1 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch1 11:0</span></span>

([Ch1 11:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#001)) David raised to the
throne.

(v. 10-47) A list of David's mighty men.

[1 Chronicles 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 11:1</span></span>

David was brought to possess the throne of Israel after he had reigned
seven years in Hebron, over Judah only. God's counsels will be fulfilled
at last, whatever difficulties lie in the way. The way to be truly
great, is to be really useful, to devote all our talents to the Lord.

[1 Chronicles 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch1 11:10</span></span>

An account is given of David's worthies, the great men who served him.
Yet David reckoned his success, not as from the mighty men that were
with him, but from the mighty God, whose presence is all in all. In
strengthening him, they strengthened themselves and their own interest,
for his advancement was theirs. We shall gain by what we do in our
places for the support of the kingdom of the Son of David; and those
that are faithful to Him, shall find their names registered much more to
their honour, than these are in the records of fame.
