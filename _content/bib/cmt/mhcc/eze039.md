### [Ezekiel Chapter 39](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#001)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 39:0</span></span>

([Eze 39:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#001)) The destruction of Gog.

([Eze 39:11-22](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#011)) Its extent.

([Eze 39:23-29](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#023)) Israel again favoured.

[Ezekiel 39:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 39:1</span></span>

The Lord will make the most careless and hardened transgressors know his
holy name, either by his righteous anger, or by the riches of his mercy
and grace. The weapons formed against Zion shall not prosper. Though
this prophecy is to be fulfilled in the latter days, it is certain. From
the language used, it seems that the army of Gog will be destroyed by
miracle.

[Ezekiel 39:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 39:11</span></span>

How numerous the enemies which God destroyed for the defence of his
people Israel! Times of great deliverances should be times of
reformation. Every one should help the utmost he can, toward cleansing
the land from reproach. Sin is an enemy every man should strive against.
Those engaged in public work, especially of cleansing and reforming a
land, ought to be men who will go through with what they undertake, who
will be always employed. When good work is to be done, every one should
further it. Having received special favours from God, let us cleanse
ourselves from all evil. It is a work which will require persevering
diligence, that search may be made into the secret recesses of sin. The
judgments of the Lord, brought upon sin and sinners, are a sacrifice to
the justice of God, and a feast to the faith and hope of God's people.
See how evil pursues sinners, even after death. After all that ambitious
and covetous men do and look for, "a place of graves" is all the Lord
gives them on earth, while their guilty souls are doomed to misery in
another world.

[Ezekiel 39:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eze 39:23</span></span>

When the Lord shall have mercy on the whole house of Israel, by
converting them to Christianity, and when they shall have borne the
shame of being cast off for their sins, then the nations shall learn to
know, worship, and serve him. Then Israel also shall know the Lord, as
revealed in and by Christ. Past events do not answer to these
predictions. The pouring out of the Spirit is a pledge that God's favour
will continue. He will hide his face no more from those on whom he has
poured out his Spirit. When we pray that God would never cast us from
his presence, we must as earnestly pray that, in order thereto, he would
never take his Holy Spirit from us.
