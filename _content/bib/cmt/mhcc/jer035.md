### [Jeremiah Chapter 35](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#001)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 35:0</span></span>

([Jer 35:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#001)) The obedience of the
Rechabites.

([Jer 35:12-19](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#012)) The Jews' disobedience
to the Lord.

[Jeremiah 35:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#001)

Jonadab was famous for wisdom and piety. He lived nearly 300 years
before, [Kg2 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#015). Jonadab charged
his posterity not to drink wine. He also appointed them to dwell in
tents, or movable dwelling: this would teach them not to think of
settling any where in this world. To keep low, would be the way to
continue long in the land where they were strangers. Humility and
contentment are always the best policy, and men's surest protection.
Also, that they might not run into unlawful pleasures, they were to deny
themselves even lawful delights. The consideration that we are strangers
and pilgrims should oblige us to abstain from all fleshly lusts. Let
them have little to lose, and then losing times would be the less
dreadful: let them set loose to what they had, and then they might with
less pain be stript of it. Those are in the best frame to meet
sufferings who live a life of self-denial, and who despise the vanities
of the world. Jonadab's posterity observed these rules strictly, only
using proper means for their safety in a time of general suffering.

[Jeremiah 35:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 35:12</span></span>

The trial of the Rechabites' constancy was for a sign; it made the
disobedience of the Jews to God the more marked. The Rechabites were
obedient to one who was but a man like themselves, and Jonadab never did
for his seed what God has done for his people. Mercy is promised to the
Rechabites. We are not told respecting the performance of this promise;
but doubtless it was performed, and travellers say the Rechabites may be
found a separate people to this day. Let us follow the counsels of our
pious forefathers, and we shall find good in so doing.
