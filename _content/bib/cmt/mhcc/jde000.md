### [Jude Introduction](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#001)

[Jude](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jde 0:0</span></span>

This epistle is addressed to all believers in the gospel. Its design
appears to be to guard believers against the false teachers who had
begun to creep into the Christian church, and to scatter dangerous
tenets, by attempting to lower all Christianity into a merely nominal
belief and outward profession of the gospel. Having thus denied the
obligations of personal holiness, they taught their disciples to live in
sinful courses, at the same time flattering them with the hope of
eternal life. The vile character of these seducers is shown, and their
sentence is denounced, and the epistle concludes with warnings,
admonitions, and counsels to believers.
