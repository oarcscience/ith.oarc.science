<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#001">Proverbs 27:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">pro 27:1</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>We know not what a day may bring forth. This does not forbid preparing for to-morrow, but presuming upon to-morrow. We must not put off the great work of conversion, that one thing needful. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#002">Proverbs 27:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">pro 27:2</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>There may be occasion for us to justify ourselves, but not to praise ourselves. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#003">Proverbs 27:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">pro 27:3</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Those who have no command of their passions, sink under the load. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#005">Proverbs 27:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">pro 27:5</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Plain and faithful rebukes are better, not only than secret hatred, but than love which compliments in sin, to the hurt of the soul. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#007">Proverbs 27:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">pro 27:7</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The poor have a better relish of their enjoyments, and are often more thankful for them, than the rich. In like manner the proud and self-sufficient disdain the gospel; but those who hunger and thirst after righteousness, find comfort from the meanest book or sermon that testifies of Christ Jesus. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#008">Proverbs 27:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">pro 27:8</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Every man has his proper place in society, where he may be safe and comfortable. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#009">Proverbs 27:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">pro 27:9</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Depend not for relief upon a kinsman, merely for kindred's sake; apply to those who are at hand, and will help in need. But there is a Friend that sticketh closer than a brother, and let us place entire confidence in him. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#011">Proverbs 27:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">pro 27:11</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>An affectionate parent urges his son to prudent conduct that should gladden his heart. The good conduct of Christians is the best answer to all who find fault with the gospel. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#012">Proverbs 27:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">pro 27:12</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Where there is temptation, if we thrust ourselves into it, there will be sin, and punishment will follow. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#013">Proverbs 27:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">pro 27:13</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>An honest man may be made a beggar, but he is not honest that makes himself one. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#014">Proverbs 27:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">pro 27:14</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>It is folly to be fond of being praised; it is a temptation to pride. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#015">Proverbs 27:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">pro 27:15</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The contentions of a neighbour may be like a sharp shower, troublesome for a time; the contentions of a wife are like constant rain. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#017">Proverbs 27:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">pro 27:17</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>We are cautioned to take heed whom we converse with. And directed to have in view, in conversation, to make one another wiser and better. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#018">Proverbs 27:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">pro 27:18</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Though a calling be laborious and despised, yet those who keep to it, will find there is something to be got by it. God is a Master who has engaged to honour those who serve him faithfully. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#019">Proverbs 27:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">pro 27:19</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>One corrupt heart is like another; so are sanctified hearts: the former bear the same image of the earthly, the latter the same image of the heavenly. Let us carefully watch our own hearts, comparing them with the word of God. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#020">Proverbs 27:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">pro 27:20</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Two things are here said to be never satisfied, death and sin. The appetites of the carnal mind for profit or pleasure are always desiring more. Those whose eyes are ever toward the Lord, are satisfied in him, and shall for ever be so. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#021">Proverbs 27:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">pro 27:21</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Silver and gold are tried by putting them into the furnace and fining-pot; so is a man tried by praising him. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#022">Proverbs 27:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">pro 27:22</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Some are so bad, that even severe methods do not answer the end; what remains but that they should be rejected? The new-creating power of God's grace alone is able to make a change. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#023">Proverbs 27:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">pro 27:23</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>We ought to have some business to do in this world, and not to live in idleness, and not to meddle with what we do not understand. We must be diligent and take pains. Let us do what we can, still the world cannot be secured to us, therefore we must choose a more lasting portion; but by the blessing of God upon our honest labours, we may expect to enjoy as much of earthly blessings as is good for us.
