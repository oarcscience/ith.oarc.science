[Deuteronomy](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">deu 0:0</span></span>

This book repeats much of the history and of the laws contained in the
three foregoing books: Moses delivered it to Israel a little before his
death, both by word of mouth, that it might affect, and by writing, that
it might abide. The men of that generation to which the law was first
given were all dead, and a new generation was sprung up, to whom God
would have it repeated by Moses himself, now they were going to possess
the land of Canaan. The wonderful love of God to his church is set forth
in this book; how he ever preserved his church for his own mercies sake,
and would still have his name called upon among them. Such are the
general outlines of this book, the whole of which shows Moses' love for
Israel, and marks him an eminent type of the Lord Jesus Christ. Let us
apply the exhortations and persuasions to our own consciences, to excite
our minds to a believing, grateful obedience to the commands of God.
