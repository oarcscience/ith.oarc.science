### [2 Chronicles Chapter 34](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001)

Josiah's good reign in Judah.

[2 Chronicles 34:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 34:1</span></span>

As the years of infancy cannot be useful to our fellow-creatures, our
earliest youth should be dedicated to God, that we may not waste any of
the remaining short space of life. Happy and wise are those who seek the
Lord and prepare for usefulness at an early age, when others are
pursuing sinful pleasures, contracting bad habits, and forming ruinous
connexions. Who can express the anguish prevented by early piety, and
its blessed effects? Diligent self-examination and watchfulness will
convince us of the deceitfulness and wickedness of our own hearts, and
the sinfulness of our lives. We are here encouraged to humble ourselves
before God, and to seek unto him, as Josiah did. And believers are here
taught, not to fear death, but to welcome it, when it takes them away
from the evil to come. Nothing hastens the ruin of a people, nor ripens
them for it, more than their disregard of the attempts made for their
reformation. Be not deceived, God is not mocked. The current and tide of
affections only turns at the command of Him who raises up those that are
dead in trespasses and sins. We behold peculiar loveliness, in the grace
the Lord bestows on those, who in tender years seek to know and to love
the Saviour. Hath Jesus, the Day-spring from on high, visited you? Can
you trace your knowledge of this light and life of man, like Josiah,
from your youth? Oh the unspeakable happiness of becoming acquainted
with Jesus from our earliest years!
