### [Ezekiel Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#001)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 25:0</span></span>

([Eze 25:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#001)) Judgments against the
Ammonites.

([Eze 25:8-17](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#008)) Against the Moabites,
Edomites, and Philistines.

[Ezekiel 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 25:1</span></span>

It is wicked to be glad at the calamities of any, especially of God's
people; it is a sin for which he will surely reckon. God will make it
appear that he is the God of Israel, though he suffers them for a time
to be captives in Babylon. It is better to know Him, and to be poor,
than to be rich and ignorant of him.

[Ezekiel 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 25:8</span></span>

Though one event seem to the righteous and wicked, it is vastly
different. Those who glory in any other defence and protection than the
Divine power, providence, and promise, will, sooner or later, be ashamed
of their glorying. Those who will not leave it to God to take vengeance
for them, may expect that he will take vengeance on them. The equity of
the Lord's judgments is to be observed, when he not only avenges
injuries upon those that did them, but by those against whom they were
done. Those who treasure up old hatred, and watch for the opportunity of
manifesting it, are treasuring up for themselves wrath against the day
of wrath.
