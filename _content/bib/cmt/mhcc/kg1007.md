### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#001)

[3 Kings (1 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">kg1 7:0</span></span>

([Kg1 7:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#001)) Solomon's buildings.

(v. 13-47) Furniture of the temple.

([Kg1 7:48-51](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#048)) Vessels of gold.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 7:1</span></span>

All Solomon's buildings, though beautiful, were intended for use.
Solomon began with the temple; he built for God first, and then his
other buildings. The surest foundations of lasting prosperity are laid
in early piety. He was thirteen years building his house, yet he built
the temple in little more than seven years; not that he was more exact,
but less eager in building his own house, than in building God's. We
ought to prefer God's honour before our own ease and satisfaction.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg1 7:13</span></span>

The two brazen pillars in the porch of the temple, some think, were to
teach those that came to worship, to depend upon God only, for strength
and establishment in all their religious exercises. "Jachin," God will
fix this roving mind. It is good that the heart be established with
grace. "Boaz," In him is our strength, who works in us both to will and
to do. Spiritual strength and stability are found at the door of God's
temple, where we must wait for the gifts of grace, in use of the means
of grace. Spiritual priests and spiritual sacrifices must be washed in
the laver of Christ's blood, and of regeneration. We must wash often,
for we daily contract pollution. There are full means provided for our
cleansing; so that if we have our lot for ever among the unclean it will
be our own fault. Let us bless God for the fountain opened by the
sacrifice of Christ for sin and for uncleanness.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:48](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#048)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">kg1 7:48</span></span>

Christ is now the Temple and the Builder; the Altar and the Sacrifice;
the Light of our souls, and the Bread of life; able to supply all the
wants of all that have applied or shall apply to him. Outward images
cannot represent, words cannot express, the heart cannot conceive, his
preciousness or his love. Let us come to him, and wash away our sins in
his blood; let us seek for the purifying grace of his Spirit; let us
maintain communion with the Father through his intercession, and yield
up ourselves and all we have to his service. Being strengthened by him,
we shall be accepted, useful, and happy.
