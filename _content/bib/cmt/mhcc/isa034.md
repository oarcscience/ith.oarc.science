### [Isaiah Chapter 34](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#001)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 34:0</span></span>

([Isa 34:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#001)) God's vengeance against
the enemies of his church.

([Isa 34:9-17](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#009)) Their desolation.

[Isaiah 34:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 34:1</span></span>

Here is a prophecy of the wars of the Lord, all which are both righteous
and successful. All nations are concerned. And as they have all had the
benefit of his patience, so all must expect to feel his resentment. The
description of bloodshed suggests tremendous ideas of the Divine
judgments. Idumea here denotes the nations at enmity with the church;
also the kingdom of antichrist. Our thoughts cannot reach the horrors of
that awful season, to those found opposing the church of Christ. There
is a time fixed in the Divine counsels for the deliverance of the
church, and the destruction of her enemies. We must patiently wait till
then, and judge nothing before the time. Through Christ, mercy is
exercised to every believer, consistently with justice, and his name is
glorified.

[Isaiah 34:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 34:9</span></span>

Those who aim to ruin the church, can never do that, but will ruin
themselves. What dismal changes sin can make! It turns a fruitful land
into barrenness, a crowded city into a wilderness. Let us compare all we
discover in the book of the Lord, with the dealings of providence around
us, that we may be more diligent in seeking the kingdom of God and his
righteousness. What the mouth of the Lord has commanded, his Spirit will
perform. And let us observe how the evidences of the truth continually
increase, as one prophecy after another is fulfilled, until these awful
scenes bring in more happy days. As Israel was a figure of the Christian
church, so the Edomites, their bitter enemies, represent the enemies of
the kingdom of Christ. God's Jerusalem may be laid in ruins for a time,
but the enemies of the church shall be desolate for ever.
