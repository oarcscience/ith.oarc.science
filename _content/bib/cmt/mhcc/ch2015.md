### [2 Chronicles Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 15:0</span></span>

The people make a solemn covenant with God.

[2 Chronicles 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 15:1</span></span>

The work of complete reformation appeared so difficult, that Asa had not
courage to attempt it, till assured of Divine assistance and acceptance.
He and his people offered sacrifices to God; thanksgiving for the
favours they had received, and supplication for further favours. Prayers
and praises are now our spiritual sacrifices. The people, of their own
will, covenanted to seek the Lord, each for himself, with earnestness.
What is religion but seeking God, inquiring after him, applying to him
upon all occasions? We make nothing of our religion, if we do not make
heart-work of it; God will have all the heart, or none. Our devotedness
to God our Saviour, should be avowed and shown in the most solemn and
public manner. What is done in hypocrisy is a mere drudgery.
