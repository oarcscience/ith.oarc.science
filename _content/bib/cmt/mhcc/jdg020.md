### [Judges Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#001)

[Judges](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jdg 20:0</span></span>

The tribe of Benjamin nearly extirpated.

[Judges 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 20:1</span></span>

The Israelites' abhorrence of the crime committed at Gibeah, and their
resolution to punish the criminals, were right; but they formed their
resolves with too much haste and self-confidence. The eternal ruin of
souls will be worse, and more fearful, than these desolations of a
tribe.
