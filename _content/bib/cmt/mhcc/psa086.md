### [Psalms Chapter 86](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 86:0</span></span>

([Psa 86:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#001)) The psalmist pleads his
earnestness, and the mercy of God, as reasons why his prayer should be
heard.

([Psa 86:8-17](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#008)) He renews his requests
for help and comfort.

[Psalms 86:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 86:1</span></span>

Our poverty and wretchedness, when felt, powerfully plead in our behalf
at the throne of grace. The best self-preservation is to commit
ourselves to God's keeping. I am one whom thou favourest, hast set apart
for thyself, and made partaker of sanctifying grace. It is a great
encouragement to prayer, to feel that we have received the converting
grace of God, have learned to trust in him, and to be his servants. We
may expect comfort from God, when we keep up our communion with God.
God's goodness appears in two things, in giving and forgiving. Whatever
others do, let us call upon God, and commit our case to him; we shall
not seek in vain.

[Psalms 86:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 86:8</span></span>

Our God alone possesses almighty power and infinite love. Christ is the
way and the truth. And the believing soul will be more desirous to be
taught the way and the truth. And the believing soul will be more
desirous to be taught the way and the truth of God, in order to walk
therein, than to be delivered out of earthly distress. Those who set not
the Lord before them, seek after believers' souls; but the compassion,
mercy, and truth of God, will be their refuge and consolation. And those
whose parents were the servants of the Lord, may urge this as a plea why
he should hear and help them. In considering David's experience, and
that of the believer, we must not lose sight of Him, who though he was
rich, for our sakes became poor, that we through his poverty might be
rich.
