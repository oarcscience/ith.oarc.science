<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#001">Jos 15:1-12</A>) The borders of the lot of Judah.
<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#013">Jos 15:13-19</A>) Caleb's portion, His daughter's blessing.
<p>(v. 20-63) The cities of Judah.

<p>Joshua allotted to Judah, Ephraim, and the half of Manasseh, their inheritances before they left Gilgal. Afterwards removing to Shiloh, another survey was made, and the other tribes had their portion assigned. In due time all God's people are settled. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#013">Joshua 15:13</A></p>

<p>Achsah obtained some land by Caleb's free grant. He gave her a south land. Land indeed, but a south land, dry and apt to be parched. She obtained more, on her request, and he gave the upper and the nether springs. Those who understand it but of one field, watered both with the rain of heaven, and the springs that issued out of the earth, countenance the allusion commonly made to this, when we pray for spiritual and heavenly blessings which relate to our souls, as blessings of the upper springs, and those which relate to the body and the life that now is, as blessings of the nether springs. All the blessings, both of the upper and the nether springs, belong to the children of God. As related to Christ, they have them freely given of the Father, for the lot of their inheritance.

<p>Here is a list of the cities of Judah. But we do not here find Bethlehem, afterwards the city of David, and ennobled by the birth of our Lord Jesus in it. That city, which, at the best, was but little among the thousands of Judah, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#002">Mic 5:2</A>, except that it was thus honoured, was now so little as not to be accounted one of the cities.
