### [Jeremiah Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#001)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 26:0</span></span>

([Jer 26:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#001)) The destruction of the
temple and city foretold.

([Jer 26:7-15](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#007)) Jeremiah's life is
threatened.

([Jer 26:16-24](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#016)) He is defended by the
elders.

[Jeremiah 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 26:1</span></span>

God's ambassadors must not seek to please men, or to save themselves
from harm. See how God waits to be gracious. If they persisted in
disobedience, it would ruin their city and temple. Can any thing else be
expected? Those who will not be subject to the commands of God, make
themselves subject to the curse of God.

[Jeremiah 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 26:7</span></span>

The priests and prophets charged Jeremiah as deserving death, and bore
false witness against him. The elders of Israel came to inquire into
this matter. Jeremiah declares that the Lord sent him to prophesy thus.
As long as ministers keep close to the word they have from God, they
need not fear. And those are very unjust who complain of ministers for
preaching of hell and damnation; for it is from a desire to bring them
to heaven and salvation. Jeremiah warns them of their danger if they go
on against him. All men may know, that to hurt, or put to death, or to
show hatred to their faithful reprovers, will hasten and increase their
own punishment.

[Jeremiah 26:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 26:16</span></span>

When secure sinners are threatened with taking away the Spirit of God,
and the kingdom of God, it is what is warranted from the word of God.
Hezekiah who protected Micah, prospered. Did Jehoiakim, who slew Urijah,
prosper? The examples of bad men, and the bad consequences of their
sins, should deter from what is evil. Urijah was faithful in delivering
his message, but faulty in leaving his work. And the Lord was pleased to
permit him to lose his life, while Jeremiah was protected in danger.
Those are safest who most simply trust in the Lord, whatever their
outward circumstances may be; and that He has all men's hearts in his
hands, encourages us to trust him in the way of duty. He will honour and
recompense those who show kindness to such as are persecuted for his
sake.
