### [Ezekiel Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#001)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 22:0</span></span>

(v. 1-16) The sins of Jerusalem.

([Eze 22:17-22](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#017)) Israel is condemned as
dross.

([Eze 22:23-31](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#023)) As the corruption is
general, so shall be the punishment.

[Ezekiel 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 22:1</span></span>

The prophet is to judge the bloody city; the city of bloods. Jerusalem
is so called, because of her crimes. The sins which Jerusalem stands
charged with, are exceeding sinful. Murder, idolatry, disobedience to
parents, oppression and extortion, profanation of the sabbath and holy
things, seventh commandment sins, lewdness and adultery. Unmindfulness
of God was at the bottom of all this wickedness. Sinners provoke God
because they forget him. Jerusalem has filled the measure of her sins.
Those who give up themselves to be ruled by their lusts, will justly be
given up to be portioned by them. Those who resolve to be their own
masters, let them expect no other happiness than their own hands can
furnish; and a miserable portion it will prove.

[Ezekiel 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 22:17</span></span>

Israel, compared with other nations, had been as the gold and silver
compared with baser metals. But they were now as the refuse that is
consumed in the furnace, or thrown away when the silver is refined.
Sinners, especially backsliding professors, are, in God's account,
useless and fit for nothing. When God brings his own people into the
furnace, he sits by them as the refiner by his gold, to see that they
are not continued there any longer than is fitting and needful. The
dross shall be wholly separated, and the good metal purified. Let those
who suffer pains, or lingering sickness, and find that their hearts can
scarcely bear these light and momentary afflictions, take warning to
flee from the wrath to come; for if these trials are not sanctified by
the power of the Holy Spirit, to the cleansing their hearts and hands
from sin, far worse things will come upon them.

[Ezekiel 22:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eze 22:23</span></span>

All orders and degrees of men had helped to fill the measure of the
nation's guilt. The people that had any power abused it, and even the
buyers and sellers find some way to oppress one another. It bodes ill to
a people when judgments are breaking in upon them, and the spirit of
prayer is restrained. Let all who fear God, unite to promote his truth
and righteousness; as wicked men of every rank and profession plot
together to run them down.
