### [Psalms Chapter 75](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 75:0</span></span>

([Psa 75:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#001)) The psalmist declares
his resolution of executing judgment.

([Psa 75:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#006)) He rebukes the wicked,
and concludes with resolutions to praise God.

[Psalms 75:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 75:1</span></span>

We often pray for mercy, when in pursuit of it; and shall we only once
or twice give thanks, when we obtain it? God shows that he is nigh to us
in what we call upon him for. Public trusts are to be managed uprightly.
This may well be applied to Christ and his government. Man's sin
threatened to destroy the whole creation; but Christ saved the world
from utter ruin. He who is made of God to us wisdom, bids us be wise. To
the proud, daring sinners he says, Boast not of your power, persist not
in contempt. All the present hopes and future happiness of the human
race spring from the Son of God.

[Psalms 75:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 75:6</span></span>

No second causes will raise men to preferment without the First Cause.
It comes neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south.
He mentions not the north; the same word that signifies the north,
signifies the secret place; and from the secret of God's counsel it does
come. From God alone all must receive their doom. There are mixtures of
mercy and grace in the cup of affliction, when it is put into the hands
of God's people; mixtures of the curse, when it is put into the hands of
the wicked. God's people have their share in common calamities, but the
dregs of the cup are for the wicked. The exaltation of the Son of David
will be the subject of the saints' everlasting praises. Then let sinners
submit to the King of righteousness, and let believers rejoice in and
obey him.
