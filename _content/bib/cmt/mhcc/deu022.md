### [Deuteronomy Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#001)

[Deuteronomy](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">deu 22:0</span></span>

([Deu 22:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#001)) Of humanity towards
brethren.

([Deu 22:5-12](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#005)) Various precepts.

(v. 13-30) Against impurity.

[Deuteronomy 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 22:1</span></span>

If we duly regard the golden rule of "doing to others as we would they
should do unto us," many particular precepts might be omitted. We can
have no property in any thing that we find. Religion teaches us to be
neighbourly, and to be ready to do all good offices to all men. We know
not how soon we may have occasion for help.

[Deuteronomy 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">deu 22:5</span></span>

God's providence extends itself to the smallest affairs, and his
precepts do so, that even in them we may be in the fear of the Lord, as
we are under his eye and care. Yet the tendency of these laws, which
seem little, is such, that being found among the things of God's law,
they are to be accounted great things. If we would prove ourselves to be
God's people, we must have respect to his will and to his glory, and not
to the vain fashions of the world. Even in putting on our garments, as
in eating or in drinking, all must be done with a serious regard to
preserve our own and others' purity in heart and actions. Our eye should
be single, our heart simple, and our behaviour all of a piece.

[Deuteronomy 22:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">deu 22:13</span></span>

These and the like regulations might be needful then, and yet it is not
necessary that we should curiously examine respecting them. The laws
relate to the seventh commandment, laying a restraint upon fleshly lusts
which war against the soul.
