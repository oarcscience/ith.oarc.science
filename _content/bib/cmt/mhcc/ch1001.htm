<p>This chapter, and many that follow, repeat the genealogies, or lists of fathers and children in the Bible history, and put them together, with many added. When compared with other places, there are some differences found; yet we must not therefore stumble at the word, but bless God that the things necessary to salvation are plain enough. The original of the Jewish nation is here traced from the first man that God created, and is thereby distinguished from the obscure, fabulous, and absurd origins assigned to other nations. But the nations now are all so mingled with one another, that no one nation, nor the greatest part of any, is descended entirely from any of one nation, nor the greatest part of any, is descended entirely from any of these fountains. Only this we are sure of, that God has created of one blood all nations of men; they are all descended from one Adam, one Noah. Have we not all one father? Has not one God created us? <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#010">Mal 2:10</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#028">1 Chronicles 1:28</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_028">ch1 1:28</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The genealogy is from hence confined to the posterity of Abraham. Let us take occasion from reading these lists of names, to think of the multitudes that have gone through this world, have done their parts in it, and then quitted it. As one generation, even of sinful men, passes away, another comes. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#004">Ecc 1:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#014">Num 32:14</A>, and will do so while the earth remains. Short is our passage through time into eternity. May we be distinguished as the Lord's people.
