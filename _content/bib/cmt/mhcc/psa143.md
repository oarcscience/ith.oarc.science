### [Psalms Chapter 143](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 143:0</span></span>

([Psa 143:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#001)) David complains of his
enemies and distresses.

([Psa 143:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#007)) He prays for comfort,
guidance, and deliverance.

[Psalms 143:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 143:1</span></span>

We have no righteousness of our own to plead, therefore must plead God's
righteousness, and the word of promise which he has freely given us, and
caused us to hope in. David, before he prays for the removal of his
trouble, prays for the pardon of his sin, and depends upon mercy alone
for it. He bemoans the weight upon his mind from outward troubles. But
he looks back, and remembers God's former appearance for his afflicted
people, and for him in particular. He looks round, and notices the works
of God. The more we consider the power of God, the less we shall fear
the face or force of man. He looks up with earnest desires towards God
and his favour. This is the best course we can take, when our spirits
are overwhelmed. The believer will not forget, that in his best actions
he is a sinner. Meditation and prayer will recover us from distresses;
and then the mourning soul strives to return to the Lord as the infant
stretches out its hands to the indulgent mother, and thirsts for his
consolations as the parched ground for refreshing rain.

[Psalms 143:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 143:7</span></span>

David prays that God would be well pleased with him, and let him know
that he was so. He pleads the wretchedness of his case, if God withdrew
from him. But the night of distress and discouragement shall end in a
morning of consolation and praise. He prays that he might be enlightened
with the knowledge of God's will; and this is the first work of the
Spirit. A good man does not ask the way in which is the most pleasant
walking, but what is the right way. Not only show me what thy will is,
but teach me how to do it. Those who have the Lord for their God, have
his Spirit for their Guide; they are led by the Spirit. He prays that he
might be enlivened to do God's will. But we should especially seek the
destruction of our sins, our worst enemies, that we may be devotedly
God's servants.
