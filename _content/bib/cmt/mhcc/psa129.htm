<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#001">Psa 129:1-4</A>) Thankfulness for former deliverances.
<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#005">Psa 129:5-8</A>) A believing prospect of the destruction of the enemies of Zion. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#001">Psalms 129:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">psa 129:1</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The enemies of God's people have very barbarously endeavoured to wear out the saints of the Most High. But the church has been always graciously delivered. Christ has built his church upon a rock. And the Lord has many ways of disabling wicked men from doing the mischief they design against his church. The Lord is righteous in not suffering Israel to be ruined; he has promised to preserve a people to himself. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#005">Psalms 129:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">psa 129:5</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>While God's people shall flourish as the loaded palm-tree, or the green and fruitful olive, their enemies shall wither as the grass upon the house-tops, which in eastern countries are flat, and what grows there never ripens; so it is with the designs of God's enemies. No wise man will pray the Lord to bless these mowers or reapers. And when we remember how Jesus arose and reigns; how his people have been supported, like the burning but unconsumed bush, we shall not fear.
