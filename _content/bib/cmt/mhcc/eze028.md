### [Ezekiel Chapter 28](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#001)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 28:0</span></span>

(v. 1-19) The sentence against the prince or king of Tyre.

([Eze 28:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#020)) The fall of Zidon.

([Eze 28:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#024)) The restoration of
Israel.

[Ezekiel 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 28:1</span></span>

Ethbaal, or Ithobal, was the prince or king of Tyre; and being lifted up
with excessive pride, he claimed Divine honours. Pride is peculiarly the
sin of our fallen nature. Nor can any wisdom, except that which the Lord
gives, lead to happiness in this world or in that which is to come. The
haughty prince of Tyre thought he was able to protect his people by his
own power, and considered himself as equal to the inhabitants of heaven.
If it were possible to dwell in the garden of Eden, or even to enter
heaven, no solid happiness could be enjoyed without a humble, holy, and
spiritual mind. Especially all spiritual pride is of the devil. Those
who indulge therein must expect to perish.

[Ezekiel 28:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 28:20</span></span>

The Zidonians were borderers upon the land of Israel, and they might
have learned to glorify the Lord; but, instead of that, they seduced
Israel to the worship of their idols. War and pestilence are God's
messengers; but he will be glorified in the restoring his people to
their former safety and prosperity. God will cure them of their sins,
and ease them of their troubles. This promise will at length fully come
to pass in the heavenly Canaan: when all the saints shall be gathered
together, every thing that offends shall be removed, all griefs and
fears for ever banished. Happy, then, is the church of God, and every
living member of it, though poor, afflicted, and despised; for the Lord
will display his truth, power, and mercy, in the salvation and happiness
of his redeemed people.
