<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#001">Jos 17:1-6</A>) The lot of Manasseh.
<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#007">Jos 17:7-13</A>) The boundaries of Manasseh, The Canaanites not driven out.
<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#014">Jos 17:14-18</A>) Joseph desires a larger portion.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">jos 17:1</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Manasseh was but half of the tribe of Joseph, yet it was divided into two parts. The daughters of Zelophehad now reaped the benefit of their pious zeal and prudent forecast. Those who take care in the wilderness of this world, to make sure to themselves a place in the inheritance of the saints in light, will have the comfort of it in the other world; while those who neglect it now, will lose it for ever. Lord, teach us here to believe and obey, and give us an inheritance among thy saints, in glory everlasting. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#007">Joshua 17:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">jos 17:7</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>There was great communication between Manasseh and Ephraim. Though each tribe had its inheritance, yet they should intermix one with another, to do good offices one to another, as became those, who, though of different tribes, were all one Israel, and were bound to love as brethren. But they suffered the Canaanites to live among them, against the command of God, to serve their own ends. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#014">Joshua 17:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">jos 17:14</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Joshua, as a public person, had no more regard to his own tribe than to any other, but would govern without favour or affection; wherein he has left a good example to all in public trusts. Joshua tells them, that what was fallen to their share would be a sufficient lot for them, if they would but work and fight. Men excuse themselves from labour by any pretence; and nothing serves the purpose better than having rich and powerful relations, able to provide for them; and they are apt to desire a partial and unfaithful disposal of what is intrusted to those they think able to give such help. But there is more real kindness in pointing out the advantages within reach, and in encouraging men to make the best of them, than in granting indulgences to sloth and extravagance. True religion gives no countenance to these evils. The rule is, They shall not eat who will not work; and many of our "cannots" are only the language of idleness, which magnifies every difficulty and danger. This is especially the case in our spiritual work and warfare. Without Christ we can do nothing, but we are apt to sit still and attempt nothing. if we belong to Him, he will stir us up to our best endeavours, and to cry to him for help. Then our coast will be enlarged, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#009">Ch1 4:9</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#010">Ch1 4:10</A>, and complainings silenced, or rather, turned into joyful thanksgivings.
