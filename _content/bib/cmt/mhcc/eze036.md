### [Ezekiel Chapter 36](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#001)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 36:0</span></span>

([Eze 36:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#001)) The land shall be
delivered from heathen oppressors.

([Eze 36:16-24](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#016)) The people are
reminded of former sins, and promised deliverance.

([Eze 36:25-38](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#025)) Also holiness, and
gospel blessings.

[Ezekiel 36:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 36:1</span></span>

Those who put contempt and reproach on God's people, will have them
turned on themselves. God promises favour to his Israel. We have no
reason to complain, if the more unkind men are, the more kind God is.
They shall come again to their own border. It was a type of the heavenly
Canaan, of which all God's children are heirs, and into which they all
shall be brought together. And when God returns in mercy to a people who
return to him in duty, all their grievances will be set right. The full
completion of this prophecy must be in some future event.

[Ezekiel 36:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 36:16</span></span>

The restoration of that people, being typical of our redemption by
Christ, shows that the end aimed at in our salvation is the glory of
God. The sin of a people defiles their land; renders it abominable to
God, and uncomfortable to themselves. God's holy name is his great name;
his holiness is his greatness, nor does any thing else make a man truly
great.

[Ezekiel 36:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">eze 36:25</span></span>

Water is an emblem of the cleansing our polluted souls from sin. But no
water can do more than take away the filth of the flesh. Water seems in
general the sacramental sign of the sanctifying influences of the Holy
Ghost; yet this is always connected with the atoning blood of Christ.
When the latter is applied by faith to the conscience, to cleanse it
from evil works, the former is always applied to the powers of the soul,
to purify it from the pollution of sin. All that have an interest in the
new covenant, have a new heart and a new spirit, in order to their
walking in newness of life. God would give a heart of flesh, a soft and
tender heart, complying with his holy will. Renewing grace works as
great a change in the soul, as the turning a dead stone into living
flesh. God will put his Spirit within, as a Teacher, Guide, and
Sanctifier. The promise of God's grace to fit us for our duty, should
quicken our constant care and endeavour to do our duty. These are
promises to be pleaded by, and will be fulfilled to, all true believers
in every age.
