<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#001">Jos 20:1-6</A>) The law concerning the cities of refuge.
<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#007">Jos 20:7-9</A>) The cities appointed as refuges. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#001">Joshua 20:1</A></p>

<p>When the Israelites were settled in their promised inheritance, they were reminded to set apart the cities of refuge, whose use and typical meaning have been explained, Numbers 35; Deuteronomy 19. God's spiritual Israel have, and shall have in Christ and heaven, not only rest to repose in, but refuge to secure themselves in. These cities were designed to typify the relief which the gospel provides for penitent sinners, and their protection from the curse of the law and the wrath of God, in our Lord Jesus, to whom believers flee for refuge, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#018">Heb 6:18</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#007">Joshua 20:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">jos 20:7</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>These cities, as those also on the other side Jordan, stood so that a man might in half a day reach one of them from any part of the country. God is ever a Refuge at hand. They were all Levites' cities. It was kindness to the poor fugitive, that when he might not go up to the house of the Lord, yet he had the servants of God with him, to instruct him, and pray for him, and to help to make up the want of public ordinances. Some observe a significance in the names of these cities with application to Christ our Refuge. Kedesh signifies holy, and our Refuge is the holy Jesus. Shechem, a shoulder, and the government is upon his shoulder. Hebron, fellowship, and believers are called into the fellowship of Christ Jesus our Lord. Bezer, a fortification, for he is a strong hold to all those that trust in him. Ramoth, high or exalted, for Him hath God exalted with his own right hand. Golan, joy or exultation, for in Him all the saints are justified, and shall glory.
