### [Psalms Chapter 92](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 92:0</span></span>

([Psa 92:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#001)) Praise is the business
of the sabbath.

([Psa 92:7-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#007)) The wicked shall
perish, but God's people shall be exalted.

[Psalms 92:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 92:1</span></span>

It is a privilege that we are admitted to praise the Lord, and hope to
be accepted in the morning, and every night; not only on sabbath days,
but every day; not only in public, but in private, and in our families.
Let us give thanks every morning for the mercies of the night, and every
night for the mercies of the day; going out, and coming in, let us bless
God. As He makes us glad, through the works of his providence for us,
and of his grace in us, and both through the great work of redemption,
let us hence be encouraged. As there are many who know not the designs
of Providence, nor care to know them, those who through grace do so,
have the more reason to be thankful. And if distant views of the great
Deliverer so animated believers of old, how should we abound in love and
praise!

[Psalms 92:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 92:7</span></span>

God sometimes grants prosperity to wicked men in displeasure; yet they
flourish but for a moment. Let us seek for ourselves the salvation and
grace of the gospel, that being daily anointed by the Holy Spirit, we
may behold and share the Redeemer's glory. It is from his grace, by his
word and Spirit, that believers receive all the virtue that keeps them
alive, and makes them fruitful. Other trees, when old, leave off
bearing, but in God's trees the strength of grace does not fail with the
strength of nature. The last days of the saints are sometimes their best
days, and their last work their best work: perseverance is sure evidence
of sincerity. And may every sabbath, while it shows forth the Divine
faithfulness, find our souls resting more and more upon the Lord our
righteousness.
