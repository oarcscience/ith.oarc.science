### [Deuteronomy Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#001)

[Deuteronomy](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">deu 19:0</span></span>

([Deu 19:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#001)) The cities of refuge,
The man-slayer, The murderer.

([Deu 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#014)) Landmarks not to be
removed.

([Deu 19:15-21](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#015)) The punishment of
false witnesses.

[Deuteronomy 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 19:1</span></span>

Here is the law settled between the blood of the murdered, and the blood
of the murderer; provision is made, that the cities of refuge should be
a protection, so that a man should not die for that as a crime, which
was not his willing act. In Christ, the Lord our Righteousness, refuge
is provided for those who by faith flee unto him. But there is no refuge
in Jesus Christ for presumptuous sinners, who go on still in their
trespasses. Those who flee to Christ from their sins, shall be safe in
him, but not those who expect to be sheltered by him in their sins.

[Deuteronomy 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">deu 19:14</span></span>

Direction is given to fix landmarks in Canaan. It is the will of God
that every one should know his own; and that means should be used to
hinder the doing and suffering of wrong. This, without doubt, is a moral
precept, and still binding. Let every man be content with his own lot,
and be just to his neighbours in all things.

[Deuteronomy 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">deu 19:15</span></span>

Sentence should never be passed upon the testimony of one witness alone.
A false witness should suffer the same punishment which he sought to
have inflicted upon the person he accused. Nor could any law be more
just. Let all Christians not only be cautious in bearing witness in
public, but be careful not to join in private slanders; and let all
whose consciences accuse them of crime, without delay flee for refuge to
the hope set before them in Jesus Christ.
