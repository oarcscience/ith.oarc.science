### [Deuteronomy Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#001)

[Deuteronomy](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">deu 15:0</span></span>

([Deu 15:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#001)) The year of release.

([Deu 15:12-18](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#012)) Concerning the release
of servants.

([Deu 15:19-23](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#019)) Respecting the
firstlings of cattle.

[Deuteronomy 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 15:1</span></span>

This year of release typified the grace of the gospel, in which is
proclaimed the acceptable year of the Lord; and by which we obtain the
release of our debts, that is, the pardon of our sins. The law is
spiritual, and lays restraints upon the thoughts of the heart. We
mistake, if we think thoughts are free from God's knowledge and check.
That is a wicked heart indeed, which raises evil thoughts from the good
law of God, as theirs did, who, because God had obliged them to the
charity of forgiving, denied the charity of giving. Those who would keep
from the act of sin, must keep out of their minds the very thought of
sin. It is a dreadful thing to have the cry of the poor justly against
us. Grudge not a kindness to thy brother; distrust not the providence of
God. What thou doest, do freely, for God loves a cheerful giver, [Co2
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#007).

[Deuteronomy 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">deu 15:12</span></span>

Here the law concerning Hebrew servants is repeated. There is an
addition, requiring the masters to put some small stock into their
servants' hands to set up with for themselves, when sent out of their
servitude, wherein they had received no wages. We may expect family
blessings, the springs of family prosperity, when we make conscience of
our duty to our family relations. We are to remember that we are debtors
to Divine justice, and have nothing to pay with. That we are slaves,
poor, and perishing. But the Lord Jesus Christ, by becoming poor, and by
shedding his blood, has made a full and free provision for the payment
of our debts, the ransom of our souls, and the supply of all our wants.
When the gospel is clearly preached, the acceptable year of the Lord is
proclaimed; the year of release of our debts, of the deliverance of our
souls, and of obtaining rest in him. And as faith in Christ and love to
him prevail, they will triumph over the selfishness of the heart, and
over the unkindness of the world, doing away the excuses that rise from
unbelief, distrust, and covetousness.

[Deuteronomy 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">deu 15:19</span></span>

Here is a direction what to do with the firstlings. We are not now
limited as the Israelites were; we make no difference between a first
calf, or lamb, and the rest. Let us then look to the gospel meaning of
this law, devoting ourselves and the first of our time and strength to
God; and using all our comforts and enjoyments to his praise, and under
the direction of his law, as we have them all by his gift.
