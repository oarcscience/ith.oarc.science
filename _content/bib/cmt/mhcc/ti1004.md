### [1 Timothy Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#001)

[1 Timothy](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ti1 4:0</span></span>

([Ti1 4:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#001)) Of departures from the
faith that began already to appear.

([Ti1 4:6-16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#006)) Several directions, with
motives for due discharge of duties.

[1 Timothy 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ti1 4:1</span></span>

The Holy Spirit, both in the Old and the New Testament, spoke of a
general turning from the faith of Christ, and the pure worship of God.
This should come during the Christian dispensation, for those are called
the latter days. False teachers forbid as evil what God has allowed, and
command as a duty what he has left indifferent. We find exercise for
watchfulness and self-denial, in attending to the requirements of God's
law, without being tasked to imaginary duties, which reject what he has
allowed. But nothing justifies an intemperate or improper use of things;
and nothing will be good to us, unless we seek by prayer for the Lord's
blessing upon it.

[1 Timothy 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ti1 4:6</span></span>

Outward acts of self-denial profit little. What will it avail us to
mortify the body, if we do not mortify sin? No diligence in mere outward
things could be of much use. The gain of godliness lies much in the
promise; and the promises to godly people relate partly to the life that
now is, but especially to the life which is to come: though we lose for
Christ, we shall not lose by him. If Christ be thus the Saviour of all
men, then much more will he be the Rewarder of those who seek and serve
him; he will provide well for those whom he has made new creatures.

[1 Timothy 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ti1 4:11</span></span>

Men's youth will not be despised, if they keep from vanities and
follies. Those who teach by their doctrine, must teach by their life.
Their discourse must be edifying; their conversation must be holy; they
must be examples of love to God and all good men, examples of
spiritual-mindedness. Ministers must mind these things as their
principal work and business. By this means their profiting will appear
in all things, as well as to all persons; this is the way to profit in
knowledge and grace, and also to profit others. The doctrine of a
minister of Christ must be scriptural, clear, evangelical, and
practical; well stated, explained, defended, and applied. But these
duties leave no leisure for wordly pleasures, trifling visits, or idle
conversation, and but little for what is mere amusement, and only
ornamental. May every believer be enabled to let his profiting appear
unto all men; seeking to experience the power of the gospel in his own
soul, and to bring forth its fruits in his life.
