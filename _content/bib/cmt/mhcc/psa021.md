### [Psalms Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 21:0</span></span>

([Psa 21:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#001)) Thanksgiving for
victory.

([Psa 21:7-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#007)) Confidence of further
success.

[Psalms 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 21:1</span></span>

Happy the people whose king makes God's strength his confidence, and
God's salvation his joy; who is pleased with all the advancements of God
kingdom, and trusts God to support him in all he does for the service of
it. All our blessings are blessings of goodness, and are owing, not to
any merit of ours, but only to God's goodness. But when God's blessings
come sooner, and prove richer than we imagine; when they are given
before we prayed for them, before we were ready for them, nay, when we
feared the contrary; then it may be truly said that he prevented, or
went before us, with them. Nothing indeed prevented, or went before
Christ, but to mankind never was any favour more preventing than our
redemption by Christ. Thou hast made him to be a universal, everlasting
blessing to the world, in whom the families of the earth are, and shall
be blessed; and so thou hast made him exceeding glad with the
countenance thou hast given to his undertaking, and to him in the
prosecution of it. The Spirit of prophecy rises from what related to the
king, to that which is peculiar to Christ; none other is blessed for
ever, much less a blessing for ever.

[Psalms 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 21:7</span></span>

The psalmist teaches to look forward with faith, and hope, and prayer
upon what God would further do. The success with which God blessed
David, was a type of the total overthrow of all Christ's enemies. Those
who might have had Christ to rule and save them, but rejected him and
fought against him, shall find the remembrance of it a worm that dies
not. God makes sinners willing by his grace, receives them to his
favour, and delivers them from the wrath to come. May he exalt himself,
by his all-powerful grace, in our hearts, destroying all the
strong-holds of sin and Satan. How great should be our joy and praise to
behold our Brother and Friend upon the throne, and for all the blessings
we may expect from him! yet he delights in his exalted state, as
enabling him to confer happiness and glory on poor sinners, who are
taught to love and trust in him.
