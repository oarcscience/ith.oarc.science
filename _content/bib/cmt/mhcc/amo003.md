### [Amos Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#001)

[Amos](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">amo 3:0</span></span>

([Amo 3:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#001)) Judgments against Israel.

([Amo 3:9-15](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#009)) The like to other
nations.

[Amos 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">amo 3:1</span></span>

The distinguishing favours of God to us, if they do not restrain from
sin, shall not exempt from punishment. They could not expect communion
with God, unless they first sought peace with him. Where there is not
friendship, there can be no fellowship. God and man cannot walk
together, except they are agreed. Unless we seek his glory, we cannot
walk with him. Let us not presume on outward privileges, without
special, sanctifying grace. The threatenings of the word and providence
of God against the sin of man are certain, and certainly show that the
judgments of God are at hand. Nor will God remove the affliction he has
sent, till it has done its work. The evil of sin is from ourselves, it
is our own doing; but the evil of trouble is from God, and is his doing,
whoever are the instruments. This should engage us patiently to bear
public troubles, and to study to answer God's meaning in them. The whole
of the passage shows that natural evil, or troubles, and not moral evil,
or sin, is here meant. The warning given to a careless world will
increase its condemnation another day. Oh the amazing stupidity of an
unbelieving world, that will not be wrought upon by the terrors of the
Lord, and that despise his mercies!

[Amos 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">amo 3:9</span></span>

That power which is an instrument of unrighteousness, will justly be
brought down and broken. What is got and kept wrongfully, will not be
kept long. Some are at ease, but there will come a day of visitation,
and in that day, all they are proud of, and put confidence in, shall
fail them. God will inquire into the sins of which they have been guilty
in their houses, the robbery they have stored up, and the luxury in
which they lived. The pomp and pleasantness of men's houses, do not
fortify against God's judgments, but make sufferings the more grievous
and vexatious. Yet a remnant, according to the election of grace, will
be secured by our great and good Shepherd, as from the jaws of
destruction, in the worst times.
