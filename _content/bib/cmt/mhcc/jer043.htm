<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#001">Jer 43:1-7</A>) The leaders carry the people to Egypt.
<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#008">Jer 43:8-13</A>) Jeremiah foretells the conquest of Egypt. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#001">Jeremiah 43:1</A></p>

<p>Only by pride comes contention, both with God and man. They preferred their own wisdom to the revealed will of God. Men deny the Scriptures to be the word of God, because they are resolved not to conform themselves to Scripture rules. When men will persist in sin, they charge the best actions to bad motives. These Jews deserted their own land, and threw themselves out of God's protection. It is the folly of men, that they often ruin themselves by wrong endeavours to mend their situation. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#008">Jeremiah 43:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">jer 43:8</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>God can find his people wherever they are. The Spirit of prophecy was not confined to the land of Israel. It is foretold that Nebuchadnezzar should destroy and carry into captivity many of the Egyptians. Thus God makes one wicked man, or wicked nation, a scourge and plague to another. He will punish those who deceive his professing people, or tempt them to rebellion.
