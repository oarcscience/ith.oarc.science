<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#001">Jos 18:1</A>) The tabernacle set up at Shiloh.
<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#002">Jos 18:2-10</A>) The remainder of the land described and divided.
<p>(v. 11-28) The boundaries of Benjamin.

<p>Shiloh was in the lot of Ephraim, the tribe to which Joshua belonged, and it was proper that the tabernacle should be near the residence of the chief governor. The name of this city is the same as that by which Jacob prophesied of the Messiah, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010">Gen 49:10</A>. It is supposed by some that the city was thus called, when it was chosen for the resting-place of the ark, which typified our great Peace-maker, and the way by him to a reconciled God. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#002">Joshua 18:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">jos 18:2</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>After a year or more, Joshua blamed their slackness, and told them how to proceed. God, by his grace, has given us a title to a good land, the heavenly Canaan, but we are slack to take possession of it; we enter not into that rest, as we might by faith, and hope, and holy joy. How long shall it be thus with us? How long shall we thus stand in our own light, and forsake our own mercies for lying vanities? Joshua stirs the Israelites up to take possession of their lots. He is ready to do his part, if they will do theirs. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#011">Joshua 18:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">jos 18:11</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The boundaries of each portion were distinctly drawn, and the inheritance of each tribe settled. All contests and selfish claims were prevented by the wise appointment of God, who allotted the hill and the valley, the corn and pasture, the brooks and rivers, the towns and cities. Is the lot of any servant of Christ cast in affliction and sorrow? It is the Lord; let him do what seemeth him good. Are we in prosperity and peace? It is from above. Be humbled when you compare the gift with your own unworthiness. Forget not Him that gave the good, and always be ready to resign it at his command.
