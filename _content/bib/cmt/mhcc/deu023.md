### [Deuteronomy Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#001)

[Deuteronomy](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">deu 23:0</span></span>

([Deu 23:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#001)) Who are shut out from
the congregation.

([Deu 23:15-25](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#015)) Cleanliness enjoined.

([Deu 23:9-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#009)) Of fugitive servants,
Usury, and other precepts.

[Deuteronomy 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 23:1</span></span>

We ought to value the privileges of God's people, both for ourselves and
for our children, above all other advantages. No personal blemishes, no
crimes of our forefathers, no difference of nation, shuts us out under
the Christian dispensation. But an unsound heart will deprive us of
blessings; and a bad example, or an unsuitable marriage, may shut our
children from them.

[Deuteronomy 23:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 23:9</span></span>

The camp of the Lord must have nothing offensive in it. If there must be
this care taken to preserve the body clean, much more should we be
careful to keep the mind pure.

[Deuteronomy 23:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">deu 23:15</span></span>

It is honourable to shelter and protect the weak, provided they are not
wicked. Proselytes and converts to the truth, should be treated with
particular tenderness, that they may have no temptation to return to the
world. We cannot honour God with our substance, unless it be honestly
and honourably come by. It must not only be considered what we give, but
how we got it. Where the borrower gets, or hopes to get, it is just that
the lender should share the gain; but to him that borrows for necessary
food, pity must be showed. That which is gone out of thy lips, as a
solemn and deliberate vow, must not be recalled, but thou shalt keep and
perform it punctually and fully. They were allowed to pluck and eat of
the corn or grapes that grew by the road side; only they must not carry
any away. This law intimated what great plenty of corn and wine they
should have in Canaan. It provided for the support of poor travellers,
and teaches us to be kind to such, teaches us to be ready to distribute,
and not to think every thing lost that is given away. Yet it forbids us
to abuse the kindness of friends, or to take advantage of what is
allowed. Faithfulness to their engagements should mark the people of
God; and they should never encroach upon others.
