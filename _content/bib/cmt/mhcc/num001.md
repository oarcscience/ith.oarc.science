### [Numbers Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001)

(v. 1-43) The numbering of the Israelites.

([Num 1:44-46](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#044)) The number of the
people.

([Num 1:47-54](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#047)) The Levites not
numbered with the rest.

[Numbers 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 1:1</span></span>

The people were numbered to show God's faithfulness in thus increasing
the seed of Jacob, that they might be the better trained for the wars
and conquest of Canaan, and to ascertain their families in order to the
division of the land. It is said of each tribe, that those were numbered
who were able to go forth to war; they had wars before them, though now
they met with no opposition. Let the believer be prepared to withstand
the enemies of his soul, though all may appear to be peace.

[Numbers 1:44](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">num 1:44</span></span>

We have here the sum total. How much was required to maintain all these
in the wilderness! They were all provided for by God every day. When we
observe the faithfulness of God, however unlikely the performance of his
promise may appear, we may take courage as to those which yet remain to
be fulfilled to the church of God.

[Numbers 1:47](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#047)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">num 1:47</span></span>

Care is here taken to distinguish the tribe of Levi, which, in the
matter of the golden calf, had distinguished itself. Singular services
shall be recompensed by singular honours. It was to the honour of the
Levites, that to them was committed the care of the tabernacle and its
treasures, in their camps and in their marches. It was for the honour of
the holy things that none should see them, or touch them, but those who
were called of God to the service. We all are unfit and unworthy to have
fellowship with God, till called by his grace into the fellowship of his
Son Jesus Christ our Lord; and so, being the spiritual seed of that
great High Priest, we are made priests to our God. Great care must be
taken to prevent sin, for preventing sin is preventing wrath. Being a
holy tribe, they were not reckoned among other Israelites. They that
minister about holy things, should neither entangle themselves, nor be
entangled, in worldly affairs. And let every believer seek to do what
the Lord has commanded.
