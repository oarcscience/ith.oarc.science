### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 30](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#001)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa1 30:0</span></span>

([Sa1 30:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#001)) Ziklag spoiled by the
Amalekites.

([Sa1 30:7-15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#007)) David overtakes the
Amalekites.

([Sa1 30:16-20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#016)) He recovers what had
been lost.

([Sa1 30:21-31](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#021)) David's distribution
of the spoil.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 30:1</span></span>

When we go abroad in the way of our duty, we may comfortably hope that
God will take care of our families in our absence, but not otherwise.
If, when we come off a journey, we find our abode in peace, and not laid
waste, as David here found his, let the Lord be praised for it. David's
men murmured against him. Great faith must expect such severe trials.
But, observe, that David was brought thus low, only just before he was
raised to the throne. When things are at the worst with the church and
people of God, then they begin to mend. David encouraged himself in the
Lord his God. His men fretted at their loss, the soul of the people was
bitter; their own discontent and impatience added to the affliction and
misery. But David bore it better, though he had more reason than any of
them to lament it. They gave liberty to their passions, but he set his
graces to work; and while they dispirited each other, he, by encouraging
himself in God, kept his spirit calm. Those who have taken the Lord for
their God, may take encouragement from him in the worst times.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa1 30:7</span></span>

If in all our ways, even when, as in this case, there can be no doubt
they are just, we acknowledge God, we may expect that he will direct our
steps, as he did those of David. David, in tenderness to his men, would
by no means urge them beyond their strength. The Son of David thus
considers the frames of his followers, who are not all alike strong and
vigorous in their spiritual pursuits and conflicts; but, where we are
weak, there he is kind; nay more, there he is strong, [Co2
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#009), [Co2
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#010). A poor Egyptian lad, scarcely
alive, is made the means of a great deal of good to David. Justly did
Providence make this poor servant, who was basely used by his master, an
instrument in the destruction of the Amalekites; for God hears the cry
of the oppressed. Those are unworthy the name of true Israelites, who
shut up their compassion from persons in distress. We should neither do
an injury nor deny a kindness to any man; some time or other it may be
in the power of the lowest to return a kindness or an injury.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa1 30:16</span></span>

Sinners are nearest to ruin, when they cry, Peace and safety, and put
the evil day far from them. Nor does any thing give our spiritual
enemies more advantage than sensuality and indulgence. Eating and
drinking, and dancing, have been the soft and pleasant way in which many
have gone down to the congregation of the dead. The spoil was recovered,
and brought off; nothing was lost, but a great deal gained.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa1 30:21</span></span>

What God gives us, he designs we should do good with. In distributing
the spoil, David was just and kind. Those are men of Belial indeed, who
delight in putting hardships upon their brethren, and care not who is
starved, so that they may be fed to the full. David was generous and
kind to all his friends. Those who consider the Lord as the Giver of
their abundance, will dispose of it with fairness and liberality.
