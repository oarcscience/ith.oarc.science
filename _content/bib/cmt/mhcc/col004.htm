<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#001">Col 4:1</A>) Masters to do their duty towards servants.
<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#002">Col 4:2-6</A>) Persons of all ranks to persevere in prayer, and Christian prudence.
<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#007">Col 4:7-9</A>) The apostle refers to others for an account of his affairs.
<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#010">Col 4:10-18</A>) Sends greetings; and concludes with a blessing.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">col 4:1</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The apostle proceeds with the duty of masters to their servants. Not only justice is required of them, but strict equity and kindness. Let them deal with servants as they expect God should deal with themselves. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#002">Colossians 4:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">col 4:2</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>No duties can be done aright, unless we persevere in fervent prayer, and watch therein with thanksgiving. The people are to pray particularly for their ministers. Believers are exhorted to right conduct towards unbelievers. Be careful in all converse with them, to do them good, and recommend religion by all fit means. Diligence in redeeming time, commends religion to the good opinion of others. Even what is only carelessness may cause a lasting prejudice against the truth. Let all discourse be discreet and seasonable, as becomes Christians. Though it be not always of grace, it must always be with grace. Though our discourse be of that which is common, yet it must be in a Christian manner. Grace is the salt which seasons our discourse, and keeps it from corrupting. It is not enough to answer what is asked, unless we answer aright also. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#007">Colossians 4:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">col 4:7</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Ministers are servants to Christ, and fellow-servants to one another. They have one Lord, though they have different stations and powers for service. It is a great comfort under the troubles and difficulties of life, to have fellow Christians caring for us. Circumstances of life make no difference in the spiritual relation among sincere Christians; they partake of the same privileges, and are entitled to the same regards. What amazing changes Divine grace makes! Faithless servants become faithful and beloved brethren, and some who had done wrong, become fellow-workers of good. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#010">Colossians 4:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">col 4:10</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Paul had differed with Barnabas, on the account of this Mark, yet he is not only reconciled, but recommends him to the churches; an example of a truly Christian and forgiving spirit. If men have been guilty of a fault, it must not always be remembered against them. We must forget as well as forgive. The apostle had comfort in the communion of saints and ministers. One is his fellow-servant, another his fellow-prisoner, and all his fellow-workers, working out their own salvation, and endeavouring to promote the salvation of others. The effectual, fervent prayer is the prevailing prayer, and availeth much. The smiles, flatteries, or frowns of the world, the spirit of error, or the working of self-love, leads many to a way of preaching and living which comes far short of fulfilling their ministry. But those who preach the same doctrine as Paul, and follow his example, may expect the Divine favour and blessing.
