### [Psalms Chapter 135](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 135:0</span></span>

([Psa 135:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#001)) God to be praised for
his mercy.

([Psa 135:5-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#005)) For his power and
judgments.

([Psa 135:15-21](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#015)) The vanity of idols.

[Psalms 135:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 135:1</span></span>

The subject-matter of praise, is the blessings of grace flowing from the
everlasting love of God. The name of God as a covenant God and Father in
Christ, blessing us with all spiritual blessings in him, is to be loved
and praised. The Lord chose a people to himself, that they might be unto
him for a name and a praise. If they do not praise him for this
distinguishing favour, they are the most unworthy and ungrateful of all
people.

[Psalms 135:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 135:5</span></span>

God is, and will be always, the same to his church, a gracious,
faithful, wonder-working God. And his church is, and will be, the same
to him, a thankful, praising people: thus his name endures for ever. He
will return in ways of mercy to them, and will delight to do them good.

[Psalms 135:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 135:15</span></span>

These verses arm believers against idolatry and all false worship, by
showing what sort of gods the heathen worshipped. And the more
deplorable the condition of the Gentile nations that worship idols, the
more are we to be thankful that we know better. Let us pity, and pray
for, and seek to benefit benighted heathens and deluded sinners. Let us
endeavour to glorify his name, and recommend his truth, not only with
our lips, but by holy lives, copying the example of Christ's goodness
and truth.
