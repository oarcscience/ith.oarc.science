<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#001">Ch1 11:1-9</A>) David raised to the throne.
<p>(v. 10-47) A list of David's mighty men. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#001">1 Chronicles 11:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">ch1 11:1</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>David was brought to possess the throne of Israel after he had reigned seven years in Hebron, over Judah only. God's counsels will be fulfilled at last, whatever difficulties lie in the way. The way to be truly great, is to be really useful, to devote all our talents to the Lord. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#010">1 Chronicles 11:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">ch1 11:10</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>An account is given of David's worthies, the great men who served him. Yet David reckoned his success, not as from the mighty men that were with him, but from the mighty God, whose presence is all in all. In strengthening him, they strengthened themselves and their own interest, for his advancement was theirs. We shall gain by what we do in our places for the support of the kingdom of the Son of David; and those that are faithful to Him, shall find their names registered much more to their honour, than these are in the records of fame.
