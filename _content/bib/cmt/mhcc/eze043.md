### [Ezekiel Chapter 43](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#001)

After Ezekiel had surveyed the temple of God, he had a vision of the
glory of God. When Christ crucified, and the things freely given to us
of God, through Him, are shown to us by the Holy Ghost, they make us
ashamed for our sins. This frame of mind prepares us for fuller
discoveries of the mysteries of redeeming love; and the whole of the
Scriptures should be opened and applied, that men may see their sins,
and repent of them. We are not now to offer any atoning sacrifices, for
by one offering Christ has perfected for ever those that are sanctified,
[Heb 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#014); but the sprinkling of his
blood is needful in all our approaches to God the Father. Our best
services can be accepted only as sprinkled with the blood which cleanses
from all sin.
