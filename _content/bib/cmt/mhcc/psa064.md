### [Psalms Chapter 64](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 64:0</span></span>

([Psa 64:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#001)) Prayer for deliverance.

([Psa 64:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#007)) The destruction of the
wicked, encouragement to the righteous.

[Psalms 64:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 64:1</span></span>

The psalmist earnestly begs of God to preserve him from disquieting
fear. The tongue is a little member, but it boasts great things. The
upright man is the mark at which the wicked aim, they cannot speak
peaceably either of him or to him. There is no guard against a false
tongue. It is bad to do wrong, but worse to encourage ourselves and one
another in it. It is a sign that the heart is hardened to the greatest
degree, when it is thus fully set to do evil. A practical disbelief of
God's knowledge of all things, is at the bottom of every wickedness. The
benefit of a good cause and a good conscience, appears most when nothing
can help a man against his enemies, save God alone, who is always a
present help.

[Psalms 64:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 64:7</span></span>

When God brings upon men the mischiefs they have desired on others, it
is weight enough to sink a man to the lowest hell. Those who love
cursing, it shall come upon them. Those who behold this shall
understand, and observe God's hand in all; unless we do so, we are not
likely to profit by the dispensations of Providence. The righteous shall
be glad in the Lord; not glad of the misery and ruin of their
fellow-creatures, but glad that God is glorified, and his word
fulfilled, and the cause of injured innocence pleaded effectually. They
rejoice not in men, nor in themselves, nor in any creature, or creature
enjoyments, nor in their wisdom, strength, riches, or righteousness; but
in Christ, in whom all the seed of Israel are justified and glory, and
in what he is to them, and has done for them.
