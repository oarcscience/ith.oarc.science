### [Jeremiah Chapter 39](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#001)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 39:0</span></span>

([Jer 39:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#001)) The taking of
Jerusalem.

([Jer 39:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#011)) Jeremiah used well.

([Jer 39:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#015)) Promises of safety to
Ebed-melech.

[Jeremiah 39:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 39:1</span></span>

Jerusalem was so strong, that the inhabitants believed the enemy could
never enter it. But sin provoked God to withdraw his protection, and
then it was as weak as other cities. Zedekiah had his eyes put out; so
he was condemned to darkness who had shut his eyes against the clear
light of God's word. Those who will not believe God's words, will be
convinced by the event. Observe the wonderful changes of Providence, how
uncertain are earthly possessions; and see the just dealings of
Providence: but whether the Lord makes men poor or rich, nothing will
profit them while they cleave to their sins.

[Jeremiah 39:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 39:11</span></span>

The servants of God alone are prepared for all events; and they are
delivered and comforted, while the wicked suffer. They often meet with
more kindness from the profane, than from hypocritical professors of
godliness. The Lord will raise them up friends, do them good, and
perform all his promises.

[Jeremiah 39:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 39:15</span></span>

Here is a message to assure Ebed-melech of a recompence for his great
kindness to Jeremiah. Because thou hast put thy trust in me, saith the
Lord. God recompenses men's services according to their principles.
Those who trust God in the way of duty, as this good man did, will find
that their hope shall not fail in times of the greatest danger.
