### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#001)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa1 24:0</span></span>

([Sa1 24:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#001)) David spares Saul's
life.

([Sa1 24:8-15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#008)) David shows his
innocence.

([Sa1 24:16-22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#016)) Saul acknowledges his
fault.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 24:1</span></span>

God delivered Saul into David's hand. It was an opportunity given to
David to exercise faith and patience. He had a promise of the kingdom,
but no command to slay the king. He reasons strongly, both with himself
and with his men, against doing Saul any hurt. Sin is a thing which it
becomes us to startle at, and to resist temptations thereto. He not only
would not do this bad thing himself, but he would not suffer those about
him to do it. Thus he rendered good for evil, to him from whom he
received evil for good; and was herein an example to all who are called
Christians, not to be overcome of evil, but to overcome evil with good.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 24:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa1 24:8</span></span>

David was falsely charged with seeking Saul's hurt; he shows Saul that
God's providence had given him opportunity to do it. And it was upon a
good principle that he refused to do it. He declares his fixed
resolution never to be his own avenger. If men wrong us, God will right
us, at farthest, in the judgment of the great day.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa1 24:16</span></span>

Saul speaks as quite overcome with David's kindness. Many mourn for
their sins, who do not truly repent of them; weep bitterly for them, yet
continue in love and in league with them. Now God made good to David
that word on which he had caused him to hope, that he would bring forth
his righteousness as the light, [Psa
37:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#006). Those who take care to keep a
good conscience, may leave it to God to secure them the credit of it.
Sooner or later, God will force even those who are of the synagogue of
Satan to know and to own those whom he has loved. They parted in peace.
Saul went home convinced, but not converted; ashamed of his envy to
David, yet retaining in his breast that root of bitterness; vexed that
when at last he had found David, he could not find in his heart to
destroy him, as he had designed. Malice often seems dead when it is only
asleep, and will revive with double force. Yet, whether the Lord bind
men's hands, or affect their hearts, so that they do not hurt us, the
deliverance is equally from him; it is an evidence of his love, and an
earnest of our salvation, and should make us thankful.
