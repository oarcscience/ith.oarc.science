### [Nehemiah Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#001)

[Nehemiah](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#001)

The rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem.

[Nehemiah 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">neh 3:1</span></span>

The work was divided, so that every one might know what he had to do,
and mind it, with a desire to excel; yet without contention, or separate
interests. No strife appears among them, but which should do most for
the public good. Every Israelite should lend a hand toward the building
up of Jerusalem. Let not nobles think any thing below them, by which
they may advance the good of their country. Even some females helped
forward the work. Some repaired over against their houses, and one
repaired over against his chamber. When a general good work is to be
done, each should apply himself to that part which is within his reach.
If every one will sweep before his own door, the street will be clean;
if every one will mend one, we shall all be mended. Some that had first
done helped their fellows. The walls of Jerusalem, in heaps of rubbish,
represent the desperate state of the world around, while the number and
malice of those who hindered the building, give some faint idea of the
enemies we have to contend with, while executing the work of God. Every
one must begin at home; for it is by getting the work of God advanced in
our own souls that we shall best contribute to the good of the church of
Christ. May the Lord thus stir up the hearts of his people, to lay aside
their petty disputes, and to disregard their worldly interests, compared
with building the walls of Jerusalem, and defending the cause of truth
and godliness against the assaults of avowed enemies.
