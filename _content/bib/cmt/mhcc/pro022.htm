<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#001">Proverbs 22:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">pro 22:1</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>We should be more careful to do that by which we may get and keep a good name, than to raise or add unto a great estate. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#002">Proverbs 22:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">pro 22:2</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Divine Providence has so ordered it, that some are rich, and others poor, but all are guilty before God; and at the throne of God's grace the poor are as welcome as the rich. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#003">Proverbs 22:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">pro 22:3</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Faith foresees the evil coming upon sinners, and looks to Jesus Christ as the sure refuge from the storm. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#004">Proverbs 22:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">pro 22:4</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Where the fear of God is, there will be humility. And much is to be enjoyed by it; spiritual riches, and eternal life at last. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#005">Proverbs 22:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">pro 22:5</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The way of sin is vexatious and dangerous. But the way of duty is safe and easy. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#006">Proverbs 22:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">pro 22:6</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Train children, not in the way they would go, that of their corrupt hearts, but in the way they should go; in which, if you love them, you would have them go. As soon as possible every child should be led to the knowledge of the Saviour. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#007">Proverbs 22:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">pro 22:7</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>This shows how important it is for every man to keep out of debt. As to the things of this life, there is a difference between the rich and the poor; but let the poor remember, it is the Lord that made the difference. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#008">Proverbs 22:8</A></p>

<p>The power which many abuse, will soon fail them.

<p>He that seeks to relieve the wants and miseries of others shall be blessed. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#010">Proverbs 22:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">pro 22:10</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Profane scoffers and revilers disturb the peace. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#011">Proverbs 22:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">pro 22:11</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>God will be the Friend of a man in whose spirit there is no guile; this honour have all the saints.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">pro 22:12</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>God turns the counsels and designs of treacherous men to their own confusion. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#013">Proverbs 22:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">pro 22:13</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The slothful man talks of a lion without, but considers not his real danger from the devil, that roaring lion within, and from his own slothfulness, which kills him. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#014">Proverbs 22:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">pro 22:14</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The vile sin of licentiousness commonly besots the mind beyond recovery. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#015">Proverbs 22:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">pro 22:15</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Sin is foolishness, it is in the heart, there is an inward inclination to sin: children bring it into the world with them; and it cleaves close to the soul. We all need to be corrected by our heavenly Father. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#016">Proverbs 22:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">pro 22:16</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>We are but stewards, and must distribute what God intrusts to our care, according to his will. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#017">Proverbs 22:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">pro 22:17</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>To these words, to this knowledge, the ear must be bowed down, and the heart applied by faith and love. To live a life of delight in God and dependence on him, is the foundation of all practical religion. The way to know the certainty of the word of truth, is to make conscience of our duty. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#022">Proverbs 22:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">pro 22:22</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>He that robs and oppresses the poor, does so at his peril. And if men will not appear for them, God will. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#024">Proverbs 22:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">pro 22:24</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Our corrupt hearts have so much tinder in them, that it is dangerous to have to do with those that throw about the sparks of their passion. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#026">Proverbs 22:26</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_026">pro 22:26</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Every man ought to be just to himself, and his family; those are not so, who, by folly or other carelessness, waste what they have. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#028">Proverbs 22:28</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_028">pro 22:28</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>We are taught not to trespass on another man's right. And it is hard to find a truly industrious man. Such a man will rise. Seest thou a man diligent in the business of religion? He is likely to excel. Let us then be diligent in God's work.
