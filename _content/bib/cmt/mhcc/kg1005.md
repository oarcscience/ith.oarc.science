### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#001)

[3 Kings (1 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">kg1 5:0</span></span>

([Kg1 5:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#001)) Solomon's agreement with
Hiram.

([Kg1 5:10-18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#010)) Solomon's workmen for
the temple.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 5:1</span></span>

Here is Solomon's design to build a temple. There is no adversary, no
Satan, so the word is; no instrument of Satan to oppose it, or to divert
from it. Satan does all he can, to hinder temple work. When there is no
evil abroad, then let us be ready and active in that which is good, and
get forward. Let God's promises quicken our endeavours. And all outward
skill and advantages should be made serviceable to the interests of
Christ's kingdom. It Tyre supplies Israel with craftsmen, Israel will
supply Tyre with corn, [Eze 27:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#017).
Thus, by the wise disposal of Providence, one country has need of
another, and is benefitted by another, that there may be dependence on
one another, to the glory of God.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg1 5:10</span></span>

The temple was chiefly built by the riches and labour of Gentiles, which
typified their being called into the church. Solomon commanded, and they
brought costly stones for the foundation. Christ, who is laid for a
Foundation, is a chosen and precious Stone. We should lay our foundation
firm, and bestow most pains on that part of our religion which lies out
of the sight of men. And happy those who, as lively stones, are built up
a spiritual house, for a habitation of God through the Spirit. Who among
us will build in the house of the Lord?
