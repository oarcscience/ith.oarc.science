<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 29:1</span></span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 29:2</span></span>

The people have cause to rejoice or mourn, as their rulers are righteous
or wicked.

[Proverbs 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 29:3</span></span>

Divine wisdom best keeps us from ruinous lusts.

[Proverbs 29:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#004)

The Lord Jesus is the King who will minister true judgment to the
people.

[Proverbs 29:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 29:5</span></span>

Flatterers put men off their guard, which betrays them into foolish
conduct.

[Proverbs 29:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 29:6</span></span>

and walk in safety.

[Proverbs 29:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 29:7</span></span>

This verse is applicable to compassion for the distress of the poor, and

[Proverbs 29:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 29:8</span></span>

The scornful mock at things sacred and serious. Men who promote

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 29:10</span></span>

Christ told his disciples that they should be hated of all men. The
just, whom the blood-thirsty hate, gladly do any thing for their
salvation.

[Proverbs 29:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 29:11</span></span>

He is a fool who tells every thing he knows, and can keep no counsel.

[Proverbs 29:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 29:12</span></span>

One who loves flatterers, and hearkens to slanderers, causes his
servants to become liars and false accusers.

[Proverbs 29:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 29:13</span></span>

Some are poor, others have a great deal of deceitful riches. They meet
in the business of this world; the Lord gives to both the comforts of
this life. To some of both sorts he gives his grace.

[Proverbs 29:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 29:14</span></span>

The rich will look to themselves, but the poor and needy the prince must
defend and plead for.

Let not the righteous have their faith and hope shocked by the increase
of sin and sinners, but let them wait with patience.

[Proverbs 29:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 29:17</span></span>

Children must not be suffered to go without rebuke when they do amiss.

[Proverbs 29:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 29:18</span></span>

How bare does a place look without Bibles and ministers! and what an
easy prey is it to the enemy of souls! That gospel is an open vision,
which holds forth Christ, which humbles the sinner and exalts the
Saviour, which promotes holiness in the life and conversation: and these
are precious truths to keep the soul alive, and prevent it from
perishing.

[Proverbs 29:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 29:19</span></span>

Here is an unprofitable, slothful, wicked servant; one that serves not
from conscience, or love, but from fear.

[Proverbs 29:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pro 29:20</span></span>

When a man is self-conceited, rash, and given to wrangling, there is
more hope of the ignorant and profligate.

[Proverbs 29:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 29:21</span></span>

Good usage to a servant does not mean indulgence, which would ruin even
a child. The body is a servant to the soul; those that humour it, and
are over-tender of it, will find it forget its place.

[Proverbs 29:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 29:22</span></span>

An angry, passionate disposition makes men provoking to one another, and
provoking to God.

[Proverbs 29:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 29:23</span></span>

Only those who humble themselves shall be exalted and established.

[Proverbs 29:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 29:24</span></span>

The receiver is as bad as the thief.

[Proverbs 29:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">pro 29:25</span></span>

Many are ashamed to own Christ now; and he will not own them in the day
of judgment. But he that trusts in the Lord will be saved from this
snare.

[Proverbs 29:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">pro 29:26</span></span>

The wisest course is, to look to God, and seek the favour of the Ruler
of rulers; for every creature is that to us which God makes it to be.

[Proverbs 29:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 29:27</span></span>

The just man abhors the sins of the wicked, and shuns their company.
Christ exposed the wickedness of men, yet prayed for the wicked when
they were crucifying him. Hatred to sin in ourselves and others, is a
needful branch of the Christian temper. But all that are unholy, have
rooted hatred to godliness.
