### [Deuteronomy Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#001)

[Deuteronomy](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">deu 25:0</span></span>

([Deu 25:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#001)) Extent of punishment.

([Deu 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#004)) The ox that treadeth the
corn.

([Deu 25:5-12](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#005)) Marriage of a brother's
wife.

([Deu 25:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#013)) Of unjust weights.

([Deu 25:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#017)) War against Amalek.

[Deuteronomy 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 25:1</span></span>

Every punishment should be with solemnity, that those who see it may be
filled with dread, and be warned not to offend in like manner. And
though the criminals must be shamed as well as put to pain, for their
warning and disgrace, yet care should be taken that they do not appear
totally vile. Happy those who are chastened of the Lord to humble them,
that they should not be condemned with the world to destruction.

[Deuteronomy 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">deu 25:4</span></span>

This is a charge to husbandmen. It teaches us to make much of the
animals that serve us. But we must learn, not only to be just, but kind
to all who are employed for the good of our better part, our souls, [Co1
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#009).

[Deuteronomy 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">deu 25:5</span></span>

The custom here regulated seems to have been in the Jewish law in order
to keep inheritances distinct; now it is unlawful.

[Deuteronomy 25:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">deu 25:13</span></span>

Dishonest gain always brings a curse on men's property, families, and
souls. Happy those who judge themselves, repent of and forsake their
sins, and put away evil things, that they may not be condemned of the
Lord.

[Deuteronomy 25:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">deu 25:17</span></span>

Let every persecutor and injurer of God's people take warning from the
case of the Amalekites. The longer it is before judgement comes, the
more dreadful will it be at last. Amalek may remind us of the foes of
our souls. May we be enabled to slay all our lusts, all the corruptions
both within and without, all the powers of darkness and of the world,
which oppose our way to the blessed Saviour.
