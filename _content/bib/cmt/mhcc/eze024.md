### [Ezekiel Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#001)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 24:0</span></span>

([Eze 24:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#001)) The fate of Jerusalem.

([Eze 24:15-27](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#015)) The extent of the
sufferings of the Jews.

[Ezekiel 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 24:1</span></span>

The pot on the fire represented Jerusalem besieged by the Chaldeans: all
orders and ranks were within the walls, prepared as a prey for the
enemy. They ought to have put away their transgressions, as the scum,
which rises by the heat of the fire, is taken from the top of the pot.
But they grew worse, and their miseries increased. Jerusalem was to be
levelled with the ground. The time appointed for the punishment of
wicked men may seem to come slowly, but it will come surely. It is sad
to think how many there are, on whom ordinances and providences are all
lost.

[Ezekiel 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 24:15</span></span>

Though mourning for the dead is a duty, yet it must be kept under by
religion and right reason: we must not sorrow as men that have no hope.
Believers must not copy the language and expressions of those who know
not God. The people asked the meaning of the sign. God takes from them
all that was dearest to them. And as Ezekiel wept not for his
affliction, so neither should they weep for theirs. Blessed be God, we
need not pine away under our afflictions; for should all comforts fail,
and all sorrows be united, yet the broken heart and the mourner's prayer
are always acceptable before God.
