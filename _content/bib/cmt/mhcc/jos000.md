[Joshua](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jos 0:0</span></span>

Here is the history of Israel's passing into the land of Canaan,
conquering and dividing it, under the command of Joshua, and their
history until his death. The power and truth of God in fulfilling his
promises to Israel, and in executing his justly threatened vengeance on
the Canaanites, are wonderfully displayed. This should teach us to
regard the tremendous curses denounced in the word of God against
impenitent sinners, and to seek refuge in Christ Jesus.
