### [Ezekiel Chapter 48](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#001)

Here is a description of the several portions of the land belonging to
each tribe. In gospel times, behold all things are become new. Much is
wrapped up in emblems and numbers. This method God has used to state
mysterious truths in his word, not to be more clearly revealed till the
proper time and season. But into the church of Christ, both in its state
of warfare and triumph, there is free access by faith, from every side.
Christ has opened the kingdom of heaven for all believers. Whoever will,
may come, and take of the water of life, of the tree of life, freely.
The Lord is there, in his church, to be nigh unto them in all they call
upon him for. This is true of every real Christian; whatever soul has in
it a living principle of grace, it may truly be said, The Lord is there.
May we be found citizens of this holy city, and act agreeably to that
character; and have the benefit of the Lord's presence with us, in life,
in death, and for evermore.
