### [Numbers Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#001)

[Numbers](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">num 8:0</span></span>

([Num 8:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#001)) The lamps of the
sanctuary.

(v. 5-26) Consecration of the Levites, and their service.

[Numbers 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 8:1</span></span>

Aaron himself lighted the lamps, thus representing his Divine Master.
The Scripture is a light shining in a dark place, [Pe2
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#019). A dark place even the church
would be without it; as the tabernacle, which had no window, would have
been without the lamps. The work of ministers is to light these lamps,
by expounding and applying the word of God. Jesus Christ is the only
Light of our dark, sinful world; and by his atonement, by his word and
the Holy Spirit, he diffuses light around.

[Numbers 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">num 8:5</span></span>

Here we have directions for the solemn ordination of the Levites. All
Israel must know that they took not this honour to themselves, but were
called of God to it; nor was it enough that they were distinguished from
others. All who are employed for God, must be dedicated to him,
according to the employment. Christians must be baptized, ministers must
be ordained; we must first give ourselves unto the Lord, and then our
services. The Levites must be cleansed. They must be clean that bear the
vessels of the Lord. Moses must sprinkle the water of purifying upon
them. This signifies the application of the blood of Christ to our souls
by faith, that we may be fit to serve the living God. God declares his
acceptance of them. All who expect to share in the privileges of the
tabernacle, must resolve to do the service of the tabernacle. As, on the
one hand, none of God's creatures are his necessary servants, he needs
not the service of any of them; so none are merely honorary servants, to
do nothing. All whom God owns, he employs; angels themselves have their
services.
