### [Zephaniah Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#001)

[Zephaniah](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">zep 2:0</span></span>

([Zep 2:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#001)) An exhortation to
repentance.

([Zep 2:4-15](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#004)) Judgments upon other
nations.

[Zephaniah 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">zep 2:1</span></span>

The prophet calls to national repentance, as the only way to prevent
national ruin. A nation not desiring, that has not desires toward God,
is not desirous of his favour and grace, has no mind to repent and
reform. Or, not desirable, not having any thing to recommend them to
God; to whom God might justly say, Depart from me; but he says, Gather
together to me that you may seek my face. We know what God's decree will
bring against impenitent sinners, therefore it highly concerns all to
repent in the accepted time. How careful should we all be to seek peace
with God, before the Holy Spirit withdraws from us, or ceases to strive
with us; before the day of grace is over, or the day of life; before our
everlasting state is determined! Let the poor, despised, and afflicted,
seek the Lord, and seek to understand and keep his commandments better,
that they may be more humbled for their sins. The chief hope of
deliverance from national judgments rests upon prayer.

[Zephaniah 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">zep 2:4</span></span>

Those are really in a woful condition who have the word of the Lord
against them, for no word of his shall fall to the ground. God will
restore his people to their rights, though long kept from them. It has
been the common lot of God's people, in all ages, to be reproached and
reviled. God shall be worshipped, not only by all Israel, and the
strangers who join them, but by the heathen. Remote nations must be
reckoned with for the wrongs done to God's people. The sufferings of the
insolent and haughty in prosperity, are unpitied and unlamented. But all
the desolations of flourishing nations will make way for the overturning
Satan's kingdom. Let us improve our advantages, and expect the
performance of every promise, praying that our Father's name may be
hallowed every where, over all the earth.
