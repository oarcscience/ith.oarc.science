### [1 Chronicles Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#001)

[1 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch1 12:0</span></span>

(v. 1-22) Those who came to David at Ziklag.

(v. 23-40) Those who came to Hebron.

[1 Chronicles 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 12:1</span></span>

Here is an account of those who appeared and acted as David's friends,
while he was persecuted. No difficulties or dangers should keep the
sinner from coming to the Savior, nor drive the believer from the path
of duty. Those who break through, and overcome in these attempts, will
find abundant recompence. From the words of Amasai we may learn how to
testify our affection and allegiance to the Lord Jesus; his we must be
throughly; on his side we must be forward to appear and act. If we are
under the influence of the Spirit, we shall desire to have our lot among
them, and to declare ourselves on their side; if in faith and love we
embrace the cause of Christ, he will receive, employ, and advance us.

[1 Chronicles 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ch1 12:23</span></span>

When the throne of Christ is set up in a soul, there is, or ought to be,
great joy in that soul; and provision is made, not as here, for a few
days, but for the whole life, and for eternity. Happy are those who
wisely perceive it to be their duty and interest, to submit to the
Saviour Jesus Christ, the Son of David; who renounce for his sake all
that is not consistent; whose earnest endeavours to do good are directed
by the wisdom that God giveth, through acquaintance with his word,
experience, and observation. If any man lack this wisdom, let him ask it
of God, who giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not, and it
shall be given him.
