### [Job Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#001)

[Job](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">job 27:0</span></span>

([Job 27:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#001)) Job protests his
sincerity.

([Job 27:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#007)) The hypocrite is
without hope.

([Job 27:11-23](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#011)) The miserable end of
the wicked.

[Job 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 27:1</span></span>

Job's friends now suffered him to speak, and he proceeded in a grave and
useful manner. Job had confidence in the goodness both of his cause and
of his God; and cheerfully committed his cause to him. But Job had not
due reverence when he spake of God as taking away his judgment, and
vexing his soul. To resolve that our hearts shall not reproach us, while
we hold fast our integrity, baffles the designs of the evil spirit.

[Job 27:7](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 27:7</span></span>

Job looked upon the condition of a hypocrite and a wicked man, to be
most miserable. If they gained through life by their profession, and
kept up their presumptuous hope till death, what would that avail when
God required their souls? The more comfort we find in our religion, the
more closely we shall cleave to it. Those who have no delight in God,
are easily drawn away by the pleasures, and easily overcome by the
crosses of this life.

[Job 27:11](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 27:11</span></span>

Job's friends, on the same subject, spoke of the misery of wicked men
before death as proportioned to their crimes; Job considered that if it
were not so, still the consequences of their death would be dreadful.
Job undertook to set this matter in a true light. Death to a godly man,
is like a fair gale of wind to convey him to the heavenly country; but,
to a wicked man, it is like a storm, that hurries him away to
destruction. While he lived, he had the benefit of sparing mercy; but
now the day of God's patience is over, and he will pour out upon him his
wrath. When God casts down a man, there is no flying from, nor bearing
up under his anger. Those who will not now flee to the arms of Divine
grace, which are stretched out to receive them, will not be able to flee
from the arms of Divine wrath, which will shortly be stretched out to
destroy them. And what is a man profited if he gain the whole world, and
thus lose his own soul?
