### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#001)

[4 Kings (2 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">kg2 12:0</span></span>

(v. 1-16) Jehoash orders the repair of the temple.

([Kg2 12:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#017)) He is slain by his
servants.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 12:1</span></span>

It is a great mercy to young people, especially to all young men of
rank, like Jehoash, to have those about them who will instruct them to
do what is right in the sight of the Lord; and they do wisely and well
for themselves, when willing to be counselled and ruled. The temple was
out of repair; Jehoash orders the repair of the temple. The king was
zealous. God requires those who have power, to use it for the support of
religion, the redress of grievances, and repairing of decays. The king
employed the priests to manage, as most likely to be hearty in the work.
But nothing was done effectually till the twenty-third year of his
reign. Another method was therefore taken. When public distributions are
made faithfully, public contributions will be made cheerfully. While
they were getting all they could for the repair of the temple, they did
not break in upon the stated maintenance of the priests. Let not the
servants of the temple be starved, under colour of repairing the
breaches of it. Those that were intrusted did the business carefully and
faithfully. They did not lay it out in ornaments for the temple, till
the other work was completed; hence we may learn, in all our expenses,
to prefer that which is most needful, and, in dealing for the public, to
deal as we would for ourselves.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg2 12:17</span></span>

Let us review the character of Jehoash, and consider what we may learn
from it. When we see what a sad conclusion there was to so promising a
beginning, it ought to make us seek into our spiritual declinings. If we
know any thing of Christ as the foundation of our faith and hope, let us
desire to know nothing but Christ. May the work of the blessed Spirit on
our souls be manifest; may we see, feel, and be earnest, in seeking
after Jesus in all his fulness, suitableness, and grace, that our souls
may be brought over from dead works to serve the living and true God.
