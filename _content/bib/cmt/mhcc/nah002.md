### [Nahum Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#001)

[Nahum](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">nah 2:0</span></span>

([Nah 2:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#001)) Nineveh's destruction
foretold.

([Nah 2:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#011)) The true cause, their
sinning against God, and his appearing against them.

[Nahum 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">nah 2:1</span></span>

Nineveh shall not put aside this judgment; there is no counsel or
strength against the Lord. God looks upon proud cities, and brings them
down. Particular account is given of the terrors wherein the invading
enemy shall appear against Nineveh. The empire of Assyria is represented
as a queen, about to be led captive to Babylon. Guilt in the conscience
fills men with terror in an evil day; and what will treasures or glory
do for us in times of distress, or in the day of wrath? Yet for such
things how many lose their souls!

[Nahum 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">nah 2:11</span></span>

The kings of Assyria had long been terrible and cruel to their
neighbours, but the Lord would destroy their power. Many plead as an
excuse for rapine and fraud, that they have families to provide for; but
what is thus obtained will never do them any good. Those that fear the
Lord, and get honestly what they have, shall not want for themselves and
theirs. It is just with God to deprive those of children, or of comfort
in them, who take sinful courses to enrich them. Those are not worthy to
be heard again, that have spoken reproachfully of God. Let us then come
to God upon his mercy-seat, that having peace with him through our Lord
Jesus Christ, we may know that he is for us, and that all things shall
work together for our everlasting good.
