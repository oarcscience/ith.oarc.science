[2 Corinthians](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#001)

The second epistle to the Corinthians probably was written about a year
after the first. Its contents are closely connected with those of the
former epistle. The manner in which the letter St. Paul formerly wrote
had been received, is particularly noticed; this was such as to fill his
heart with gratitude to God, who enabled him fully to discharge his duty
towards them. Many had shown marks of repentance, and amended their
conduct, but others still followed their false teachers; and as the
apostle delayed his visit, from his unwillingness to treat them with
severity, they charged him with levity and change of conduct. Also, with
pride, vain-glory, and severity, and they spake of him with contempt. In
this epistle we find the same ardent affection towards the disciples at
Corinth, as in the former, the same zeal for the honour of the gospel,
and the same boldness in giving Christian reproof. The first six
chapters are chiefly practical: the rest have more reference to the
state of the Corinthian church, but they contain many rules of general
application.
