### [Jeremiah Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#001)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 7:0</span></span>

(v. 1-16) Confidence in the temple is vain.

([Jer 7:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#017)) The provocation by
persisting in idolatry.

([Jer 7:21-28](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#021)) God justifies his
dealings with them.

([Jer 7:29-34](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#029)) And threatens
vengeance.

[Jeremiah 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 7:1</span></span>

No observances, professions, or supposed revelations, will profit, if
men do not amend their ways and their doings. None can claim an interest
in free salvation, who allow themselves in the practice of known sin, or
live in the neglect of known duty. They thought that the temple they
profaned would be their protection. But all who continue in sin because
grace has abounded, or that grace may abound, make Christ the minister
of sin; and the cross of Christ, rightly understood, forms the most
effectual remedy to such poisonous sentiments. The Son of God gave
himself for our transgressions, to show the excellence of the Divine
law, and the evil of sin. Never let us think we may do wickedness
without suffering for it.

[Jeremiah 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 7:17</span></span>

The Jews took pride in showing zeal for their idols. Let us learn to be
earnest in the service of our God, even from this bad example. Let us
think it an honour to be employed in any work for God. Let us be as
diligent ourselves, and as careful to teach our children the truths of
God, as many are to teach the mysteries of iniquity. The direct tendency
of this sin is malice against God, but it will hurt themselves. And they
shall find there is no escaping. God's wrath is fire unquenchable.

[Jeremiah 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 7:21</span></span>

God shows that obedience was required of them. That which God commanded
was, Hearken diligently to the voice of the Lord thy God. The promise is
very encouraging. Let God's will be your rule, and his favour shall be
your happiness. God was displeased with disobedience. We understand the
gospel as little as the Jews understood the law, if we think that even
the sacrifice of Christ lessens our obligation to obey.

[Jeremiah 7:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jer 7:29</span></span>

In token both of sorrow and of slavery, Jerusalem must be degraded, and
separated from God, as she had been separated to him. The heart is the
place in which God has chosen to put his name; but if sin has the
innermost and uppermost place there, we pollute the temple of the Lord.
The destruction of Jerusalem appears here very terrible. The slain shall
be many; they having made it the place of their sin. Evil pursues
sinners, even after death. Those who will not, by the grace of God, be
cured of vain mirth, shall, by the justice of God, be deprived of all
mirth. How many ruin their health and property without complaining, when
engaged in Satan's service! May we learn to relish holy joys, and to sit
loose to all others though lawful.
