### [Zechariah Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#001)

[Zechariah](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">zac 10:0</span></span>

([Zac 10:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#001)) Blessings to be sought
from the Lord.

([Zac 10:6-12](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#006)) God will restore his
people.

[Zechariah 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">zac 10:1</span></span>

Spiritual blessings had been promised under figurative allusions to
earthly plenty. Seasonable rain is a great mercy, which we may ask of
God when there is most need of it, and we may look for it to come. We
must in our prayers ask for mercies in their proper time. The Lord would
make bright clouds, and give showers of rain. This may be an exhortation
to seek the influences of the Holy Spirit, in faith and by prayer,
through which the blessings held forth in the promises are obtained and
enjoyed. The prophet shows the folly of making addresses to idols, as
their fathers had done. The Lord visited the remnant of his flock in
mercy, and was about to renew their courage and strength for conflict
and victory. Every creature is to us what God makes it to be. Every one
raised to support the nation, as a corner-stone does the building, or to
unite those that differ, as nails join the different timbers, must come
from the Lord; and those employed to overcome their enemies, must have
strength and success from him. This may be applied to Christ; to him we
must look to raise up persons to unite, support, and defend his people.
He never will say, Seek ye me in vain.

[Zechariah 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">zac 10:6</span></span>

Here are precious promises to the people of God, which look to the state
of the Jews, and even to the latter days of the church. Preaching the
gospel is God's call for souls to come to Jesus Christ. Those whom
Christ redeemed by his blood, God will gather by his grace. Difficulties
shall be got over easily, and effectually, as those in the way of the
deliverance out of Egypt. God himself will be their strength, and their
song. When we resist, and so overcome our spiritual enemies, then our
hearts shall rejoice. If God strengthen us, we must bestir ourselves in
all the duties of the Christian life, must be active in the work of God;
and we must do all in the name of the Lord Jesus.
