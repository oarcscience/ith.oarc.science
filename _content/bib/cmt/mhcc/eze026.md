### [Ezekiel Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#001)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 26:0</span></span>

A prophecy against Tyre.

[Ezekiel 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 26:1</span></span>

To be secretly pleased with the death or decay of others, when we are
likely to get by it; or with their fall, when we may thrive upon it, is
a sin that easily besets us, yet is not thought so bad as really it is.
But it comes from a selfish, covetous principle, and from that love of
the world as our happiness, which the love of God expressly forbids. He
often blasts the projects of those who would raise themselves on the
ruin of others. The maxims most current in the trading world, are
directly opposed to the law of God. But he will show himself against the
money-loving, selfish traders, whose hearts, like those of Tyre, are
hardened by the love of riches. Men have little cause to glory in things
which stir up the envy and rapacity of others, and which are continually
shifting from one to another; and in getting, keeping, and spending
which, men provoke that God whose wrath turns joyous cities into ruinous
heaps.

[Ezekiel 26:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 26:15</span></span>

See how high, how great Tyre had been. See how low Tyre is made. The
fall of others should awaken us out of security. Every discovery of the
fulfilment of a Scripture prophecy, is like a miracle to confirm our
faith. All that is earthly is vanity and vexation. Those who now have
the most established prosperity, will soon be out of sight and
forgotten.
