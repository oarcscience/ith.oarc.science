<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001">Isaiah</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_000">isa 62:0</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#001">Isa 62:1-5</A>) God's care of his church and people.
<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#006">Isa 62:6-9</A>) The office of ministers in preaching the gospel.
<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#010">Isa 62:10-12</A>) Every hinderance shall be removed from the way of salvation. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#001">Isaiah 62:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">isa 62:1</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The Son of God here assures his church of his unfailing love, and his pleading for her under all trails and difficulties. She shall be called by a new name, a pleasant name, such as she was never called by before. The state of true religion in the world, before the preaching of the gospel, no man seemed to have any real concern for. God, by his grace, has wrought that in his church, which makes her his delight. Let us thence learn motives to holiness. If the Lord rejoices over us, we should rejoice in his service. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#006">Isaiah 62:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">isa 62:6</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>God's professing people must be a praying people. He is not displeased with us for being earnest, as men commonly are; he bids us to cry after him, and give him no rest, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#005">Luk 11:5</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#006">Luk 11:6</A>. It is a sign that God is coming to a people in mercy, when he pours out a spirit of prayer upon them. See how uncertain our creature-comforts are. See also God's mercy in giving plenty, and peace to enjoy it. Let us delight in attending the courts of the Lord, that we may enjoy the consolations of his Spirit. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#010">Isaiah 62:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">isa 62:10</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Way shall be made for Christ's salvation; all difficulties shall be removed. He brings a reward of comfort and peace with him; but a work of humiliation and reformation before him; and they shall be called, The holy people, and, The redeemed of the Lord. Holiness puts honour and beauty upon any place or person, makes them admired, beloved, and sought after. Many events may have been part fulfilments of this, as earnests of more glorious times yet to come. The close connexion between the blessedness of the Jews and of the Gentiles, runs through the Scriptures. The Lord Jesus will complete his work, and he never will forsake one whom he has redeemed and sanctified.
