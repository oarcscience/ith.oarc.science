### [1 Chronicles Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#001)

[1 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch1 22:0</span></span>

([Ch1 22:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#001)) David's preparations for
the temple.

([Ch1 22:6-16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#006)) David's instructions to
Solomon.

([Ch1 22:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#017)) The prices commanded
to assist.

[1 Chronicles 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 22:1</span></span>

On occasion of the terrible judgment inflicted on Israel for the sin of
David, God pointed out the place where he would have the temple built;
upon which, David was excited to make preparations for the great work.
David must not build, but he would do all he could; he prepared
abundantly before his death. What our hands find to do for God, and our
souls, and those round us, let us do it with all our might, before our
death; for after death there is no device nor working. And when the Lord
refuses to employ us in those services which we desired, we must not be
discouraged or idle, but do what we can, though in a humbler sphere.

[1 Chronicles 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 22:6</span></span>

David gives Solomon the reason why he should build the temple. Because
God named him. Nothing is more powerful to engage us in any service for
God, than to know that we are appointed thereto. Because he would have
leisure and opportunity to do it. He should have peace and quietness.
Where God gives rest, he expects work. Because God had promised to
establish his kingdom. God's gracious promises should quicken and
strengthen our religious service. David delivered to Solomon an account
of the vast preparations he had made for this building; not from pride
and vain-glory, but to encourage Solomon to engage cheerfully in the
great work. He must not think, by building the temple, to purchase a
dispensation to sin; on the contrary, his doing that would not be
accepted, if he did not take heed to fulfil the statutes of the Lord. In
our spiritual work, as well as in our spiritual warfare, we have need of
courage and resolution.

[1 Chronicles 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch1 22:17</span></span>

Whatever is done towards rendering the word of God generally known and
attended to, is like bringing a stone, or an ingot of gold, towards
erecting the temple. This should encourage us when we grieve that we do
not see more fruit of our labours; much good may appear after our death,
which we never thought of. Let us not then be weary of well doing. The
work is in the hands of the Prince of peace. As he, the Author and
Finisher of the work, is pleased to employ us as his instruments, let us
arise and be doing, encouraging and helping one another; working by his
rule, after his example, in dependence on his grace, assured that he
will be with us, and that our labour shall not be in vain in the Lord.
