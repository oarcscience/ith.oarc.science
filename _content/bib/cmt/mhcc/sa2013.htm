<p>(v. 1-20) Ammon's violence to his sister.
<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#021">Sa2 13:21-29</A>) Absalom murders his brother Ammon.
<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#030">Sa2 13:30-39</A>) David's grief, Absalom flees to Geshur. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#001">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">sa2 13:1</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>From henceforward David was followed with one trouble after another. Adultery and murder were David's sins, the like sins among his children were the beginnings of his punishment: he was too indulgent to his children. Thus David might trace the sins of his children to his own misconduct, which must have made the anguish of the chastisement worse. Let no one ever expect good treatment from those who are capable of attempting their seduction; but it is better to suffer the greatest wrong than to commit the least sin.

<p>Observe the aggravations of Absalom's sin: he would have Ammon slain, when least fit to go out of the world. He engaged his servants in the guilt. Those servants are ill-taught who obey wicked masters, against God's commands. Indulged children always prove crosses to godly parents, whose foolish love leads them to neglect their duty to God.

<p>Jonadab was as guilty of Ammon's death, as of his sin; such false friends do they prove, who counsel us to do wickedly. Instead of loathing Absalom as a murderer, David, after a time, longed to go forth to him. This was David's infirmity: God saw something in his heart that made a difference, else we should have thought that he, as much as Eli, honoured his sons more than God.
