### [Deuteronomy Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#001)

[Deuteronomy](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">deu 17:0</span></span>

([Deu 17:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#001)) All sacrifices to be
perfect, Idolaters must be slain.

([Deu 17:8-13](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#008)) Difficult
controversies.

([Deu 17:14-20](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#014)) The choice of a king,
His duties.

[Deuteronomy 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 17:1</span></span>

No creature which had any blemish was to be offered in sacrifice to God.
We are thus called to remember the perfect, pure, and spotless sacrifice
of Christ, and reminded to serve God with the best of our abilities,
time, and possession, or our pretended obedience will be hateful to him.
So great a punishment as death, so remarkable a death as stoning, must
be inflicted on the Jewish idolater. Let all who in our day set up idols
in their hearts, remember how God punished this crime in Israel.

[Deuteronomy 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">deu 17:8</span></span>

Courts of judgment were to be set up in every city. Though their
judgment had not the Divine authority of an oracle, it was the judgment
of wise, prudent, experienced men, and had the advantage of a Divine
promise.

[Deuteronomy 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">deu 17:14</span></span>

God himself was in a particular manner Israel's King; and if they set
another over them, it was necessary that he should choose the person.
Accordingly, when the people desired a king, they applied to Samuel, a
prophet of the Lord. In all cases, God's choice, if we can but know it,
should direct, determine, and overrule ours. Laws are given for the
prince that should be elected. He must carefully avoid every thing that
would turn him from God and religion. Riches, honours, and pleasures,
are three great hinderances of godliness, (the lusts of the flesh, the
lusts of the eye, and the pride of life,) especially to those in high
stations; against these the king is here warned. The king must carefully
study the law of God, and make that his rule; and having a copy of the
Scriptures of his own writing, must read therein all the days of his
life. It is not enough to have Bibles, but we must use them, use them
daily, as long as we live. Christ's scholars never learn above their
Bibles, but will have constant occasion for them, till they come to that
world where knowledge and love will be made perfect. The king's writing
and reading were as nothing, if he did not practise what he wrote and
read. And those who fear God and keep his commandments, will fare the
better for it even in this world.
