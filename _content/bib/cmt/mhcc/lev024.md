### [Leviticus Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#001)

[Leviticus](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">lev 24:0</span></span>

([Lev 24:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#001)) Oil for the lamps, The
shew-bread.

([Lev 24:10-23](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#010)) The law of blasphemy,
blasphemer is stoned.

[Leviticus 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 24:1</span></span>

The loaves of bread typify Christ as the Bread of life, and the food of
the souls of his people. He is the Light of his church, the Light of the
world; in and through his word this light shines. By this light we
discern the food prepared for our souls; and we should daily, but
especially from sabbath to sabbath, feed thereon in our hearts with
thanksgiving. And as the loaves were left in the sanctuary, so should we
abide with God till he dismiss us.

[Leviticus 24:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">lev 24:10</span></span>

This offender was the son of an Egyptian father, and an Israelitish
mother. The notice of his parents shows the common ill effect of mixed
marriages. A standing law for the stoning of blasphemers was made upon
this occasion. Great stress is laid upon this law. It extends to the
strangers among them, as well as to those born in the land. Strangers,
as well as native Israelites, should be entitled to the benefit of the
law, so as not to suffer wrong; and should be liable to the penalty of
this law, in case they did wrong. If those who profane the name of God
escape punishment from men, yet the Lord our God will not suffer them to
escape his righteous judgments. What enmity against God must be in the
heart of man, when blasphemies against God proceed out of his mouth. If
he that despised Moses' law, died without mercy, of what punishment will
they be worthy, who despise and abuse the gospel of the Son of God! Let
us watch against anger, do no evil, avoid all connexions with wicked
people, and reverence that holy name which sinners blaspheme.
