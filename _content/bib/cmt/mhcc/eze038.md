### [Ezekiel Chapter 38](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#001)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 38:0</span></span>

([Eze 38:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#001)) The army and malice of
Gog.

([Eze 38:14-23](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#014)) God's judgments.

[Ezekiel 38:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 38:1</span></span>

These events will be in the latter days. It is supposed these enemies
will come together to invade the land of Judea, and God will defeat
them. God not only sees who are now the enemies of his church, but he
foresees who will be so, and lets them know by his word that he is
against them; though they join together, the wicked shall not be
unpunished.

[Ezekiel 38:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 38:14</span></span>

The enemy should make a formidable descent upon the land of Israel. When
Israel dwell safely under the Divine protection, shalt not thou be made
to know it by finding that endeavours to destroy them are made in vain?
Promises of security are treasured up in the word of God, against the
troubles and dangers the church may be brought into in the latter days.
In the destruction of sinners, God makes it appear that he is a great
and holy God. We should desire and pray daily. Father, glorify thine own
name.
