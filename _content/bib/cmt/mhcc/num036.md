### [Numbers Chapter 36](../../../bib/kjv/num036.htm#001)

[Numbers](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">num 36:0</span></span>

([Num 36:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/num036.htm#001)) The inheritance of the
daughters of Zelophehad.

([Num 36:5-12](../../../bib/kjv/num036.htm#005)) The daughters of
Zelophehad are to marry in their own tribe.

([Num 36:13](../../../bib/kjv/num036.htm#013)) Conclusion.

[Numbers 36:1](../../../bib/kjv/num036.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 36:1</span></span>

The heads of the tribe of Manasseh represent the evil which might
follow, if the daughters of Zelophehad should marry into any other
tribes. They sought to preserve the Divine appointment of inheritances,
and that contests and quarrels should not rise among those who should
come afterwards. It is the wisdom and duty of those who have estates in
the world, to settle them, and to dispose of them, so that no strife and
contention may arise.

[Numbers 36:5](../../../bib/kjv/num036.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">num 36:5</span></span>

Those who consult the oracles of God, concerning the making of their
heavenly inheritance sure, shall not only be directed what to do, but
their inquiries shall be graciously accepted. God would not have one
tribe enriched at the expense of another. Each tribe was to keep to its
own inheritance. The daughters of Zelophehad submitted to this
appointment. How could they fail to marry well, when God himself
directed them? Let the people of God learn how suitable and proper it
is, like the daughters of Israel, to be united only to their own people.
Ought not every true believer Israel, to be united only to their own
people. Ought not every true believer in Jesus, to be very attentive in
the near and tender relations of life, to be united only to such as are
united to the Lord? All our intentions and inclinations ought to be
subjected to the will of God, when that is made known to us, and
especially in contracting marriage. Although the word of God allows
affection and preference in this important relation, it does not
sanction that foolish, ungovernable, and idolatrous passion, which cares
not what may be the end; but in defiance of authority, determines upon
self-gratification. All such conduct, however disguised, is against
common sense, the interests of society, the happiness of the marriage
relation, and, what is still more evil, against the religion of Christ.

[Numbers 36:13](../../../bib/kjv/num036.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">num 36:13</span></span>

These are the judgments the Lord commanded in the plains of Moab. Most
of them related to the settlement in Canaan, into which the Israelites
were now entering. Whatever new condition God, by his providence, brings
us into, we must beg him to teach us the duties of it, and to enable us
to do them, that we may do the work of the day in its day, the duty of a
place in its place.
