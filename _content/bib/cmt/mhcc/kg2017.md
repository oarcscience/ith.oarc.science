### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#001)

[4 Kings (2 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">kg2 17:0</span></span>

([Kg2 17:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#001)) Reign of Hoshea in
Israel, The israelites carried captives by the Assyrians.

(v. 7-23) Captivity of the Israelites.

(v. 24-41) The nations placed in the land of Israel.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 17:1</span></span>

When the measure of sin is filled up, the Lord will forbear no longer.
The inhabitants of Samaria must have endured great affliction. Some of
the poor Israelites were left in the land. Those who were carried
captives to a great distance, were mostly lost among the nations.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg2 17:7</span></span>

Though the destruction of the kingdom of the ten tribes was but briefly
related, it is in these verses largely commented upon, and the reasons
of it given. It was destruction from the Almighty: the Assyrian was but
the rod of his anger, [Isa 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005). Those
that bring sin into a country or family, bring a plague into it, and
will have to answer for all the mischief that follows. And vast as the
outward wickedness of the world is, the secret sins, evil thoughts,
desires, and purposes of mankind are much greater. There are outward
sins which are marked by infamy; but ingratitude, neglect, and enmity to
God, and the idolatry and impiety which proceed therefrom, are far more
malignant. Without turning from every evil way, and keeping God's
statutes, there can be no true godliness; but this must spring from
belief of his testimony, as to wrath against all ungodliness and
unrighteousness, and his mercy in Christ Jesus.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 17:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg2 17:24</span></span>

The terror of the Almighty will sometimes produce a forced or feigned
submission in unconverted men; like those brought from different
countries to inhabit Israel. But such will form unworthy thoughts of
God, will expect to please him by outward forms, and will vainly try to
reconcile his service with the love of the world and the indulgence of
their lusts. May that fear of the Lord, which is the beginning of
wisdom, possess our hearts, and influence our conduct, that we may be
ready for every change. Wordly settlements are uncertain; we know not
whither we may be driven before we die, and we must soon leave the
world; but the righteous hath chosen that good part which shall not be
taken from him.
