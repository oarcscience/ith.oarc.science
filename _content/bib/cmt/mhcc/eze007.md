### [Ezekiel Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#001)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 7:0</span></span>

([Eze 7:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#001)) The desolation of the
land.

([Eze 7:16-22](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#016)) The distress of the few
who should escape.

([Eze 7:23-27](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#023)) The captivity.

[Ezekiel 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 7:1</span></span>

The abruptness of this prophecy, and the many repetitions, show that the
prophet was deeply affected by the prospect of these calamities. Such
will the destruction of sinners be; for none can avoid it. Oh that the
wickedness of the wicked might end before it bring them to an end!
Trouble is to the impenitent only an evil, it hardens their hearts, and
stirs up their corruptions; but there are those to whom it is sanctified
by the grace of God, and made a means of much good. The day of real
trouble is near, not a mere echo or rumour of troubles. Whatever are the
fruits of God's judgments, our sin is the root of them. These judgments
shall be universal. And God will be glorified in all. Now is the day of
the Lord's patience and mercy, but the time of the sinner's trouble is
at hand.

[Ezekiel 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 7:16</span></span>

Sooner or later, sin will cause sorrow; and those who will not repent of
their sin, may justly be left to pine away in it. There are many whose
wealth is their snare and ruin; and the gaining the world is the losing
of their souls. Riches profit not in the day of wrath. The wealth of
this world has not that in it which will answer the desires of the soul,
or be any satisfaction to it in a day of distress. God's temple shall
stand them in no stead. Those are unworthy to be honoured with the form
of godliness, who will not be governed by its power.

[Ezekiel 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eze 7:23</span></span>

Whoever break the bands of God's law, will find themselves bound and
held by the chains of his judgments. Since they encouraged one another
to sin, God would dishearten them. All must needs be in trouble, when
God comes to judge them according to their deserts. May the Lord enable
us to seek that good part which shall not be taken away.
