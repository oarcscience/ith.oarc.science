<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#001">Lam 1:1-11</A>) The miserable state of Jerusalem, the just consequences of its sins.
<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#012">Lam 1:12-22</A>) Jerusalem represented as a captive female, lamenting, and seeking the mercy of God. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#001">Lamentations 1:1</A></p>

<p>The prophet sometimes speaks in his own person; at other times Jerusalem, as a distressed female, is the speaker, or some of the Jews. The description shows the miseries of the Jewish nation. Jerusalem became a captive and a slave, by reason of the greatness of her sins; and had no rest from suffering. If we allow sin, our greatest adversary, to have dominion over us, justly will other enemies also be suffered to have dominion. The people endured the extremities of famine and distress. In this sad condition Jerusalem acknowledged her sin, and entreated the Lord to look upon her case. This is the only way to make ourselves easy under our burdens; for it is the just anger of the Lord for man's transgressions, that has filled the earth with sorrows, lamentations, sickness, and death. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#012">Lamentations 1:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">lam 1:12</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Jerusalem, sitting dejected on the ground, calls on those that passed by, to consider whether her example did not concern them. Her outward sufferings were great, but her inward sufferings were harder to bear, through the sense of guilt. Sorrow for sin must be great sorrow, and must affect the soul. Here we see the evil of sin, and may take warning to flee from the wrath to come. Whatever may be learned from the sufferings of Jerusalem, far more may be learned from the sufferings of Christ. Does he not from the cross speak to every one of us? Does he not say, Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? Let all our sorrows lead us to the cross of Christ, lead us to mark his example, and cheerfully to follow him.
