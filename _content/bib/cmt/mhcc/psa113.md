### [Psalms Chapter 113](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 113:0</span></span>

An exhortation to praise God.

[Psalms 113:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 113:1</span></span>

God has praise from his own people. They have most reason to praise him;
for those who attend him as his servants, know him best, and receive
most of his favours, and it is easy, pleasant work to speak well of
their Master. God's name ought to be praised in every place, from east
to west. Within this wide space the Lord's name is to be praised; it
ought to be so, though it is not. Ere long it will be, when all nations
shall come and worship before him. God is exalted above all blessing and
praise. We must therefore say, with holy admiration, Who is like unto
the Lord our God? How condescending in him to behold the things in the
earth! And what amazing condescension was it for the Son of God to come
from heaven to earth, and take our nature upon him, that he might seek
and save those that were lost! How vast his love in taking upon him the
nature of man, to ransom guilty souls! God sometimes makes glorious his
own wisdom and power, when, having some great work to do, he employs
those least likely, and least thought of for it by themselves or others.
The apostles were sent from fishing to be fishers of men. And this is
God's constant method in his kingdom of grace. He takes men, by nature
beggars, and even traitors, to be his favourites, his children, kings
and priests unto him; and numbers them with the princes of his chosen
people. He gives us all our comforts, which are generally the more
welcome when long delayed, and no longer expected. Let us pray that
those lands which are yet barren, may speedily become fruitful, and
produce many converts to join in praising the Lord.
