### [2 Chronicles Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 27:0</span></span>

Jotham's reign in Judah.

[2 Chronicles 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 27:1</span></span>

The people did corruptly. Perhaps Jotham was wanting towards the
reformation of the land. Men may be very good, and yet not have courage
and zeal to do what they might. It certainly casts blame upon the
people. Jotham prospered, and became mighty. The more stedfast we are in
religion, the more mighty we are, both to resist evil, and to do good.
The Lord often removes wise and pious rulers, and sends others, whose
follies and vices punish a people that valued not their mercies.
