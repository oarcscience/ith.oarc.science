### [Leviticus Introduction](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#001)

[Leviticus](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">lev 0:0</span></span>

God ordained divers kinds of oblations and sacrifices, to assure his
people of the forgiveness of their offences, if they offered them in
true faith and obedience. Also he appointed the priests and Levites,
their apparel, offices, conduct, and portion. He showed what feasts they
should observe, and at what times. He declared by these sacrifices and
ceremonies, that the reward of sin is death, and that without the blood
of Christ, the innocent Lamb of God, there can be no forgiveness of
sins.
