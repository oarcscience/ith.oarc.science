### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#001)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa2 13:0</span></span>

(v. 1-20) Ammon's violence to his sister.

([Sa2 13:21-29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#021)) Absalom murders his
brother Ammon.

([Sa2 13:30-39](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#030)) David's grief, Absalom
flees to Geshur.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 13:1</span></span>

From henceforward David was followed with one trouble after another.
Adultery and murder were David's sins, the like sins among his children
were the beginnings of his punishment: he was too indulgent to his
children. Thus David might trace the sins of his children to his own
misconduct, which must have made the anguish of the chastisement worse.
Let no one ever expect good treatment from those who are capable of
attempting their seduction; but it is better to suffer the greatest
wrong than to commit the least sin.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa2 13:21</span></span>

Observe the aggravations of Absalom's sin: he would have Ammon slain,
when least fit to go out of the world. He engaged his servants in the
guilt. Those servants are ill-taught who obey wicked masters, against
God's commands. Indulged children always prove crosses to godly parents,
whose foolish love leads them to neglect their duty to God.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">sa2 13:30</span></span>

Jonadab was as guilty of Ammon's death, as of his sin; such false
friends do they prove, who counsel us to do wickedly. Instead of
loathing Absalom as a murderer, David, after a time, longed to go forth
to him. This was David's infirmity: God saw something in his heart that
made a difference, else we should have thought that he, as much as Eli,
honoured his sons more than God.
