### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#001)

[3 Kings (1 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">kg1 11:0</span></span>

([Kg1 11:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#001)) Solomon's wives and

([Kg1 11:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#009)) God's anger.

([Kg1 11:14-25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#014)) Solomon's adversaries.

([Kg1 11:26-40](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#026)) Jeroboam's promotion.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 11:1</span></span>

There is not a more melancholy and astonishing instance of human
depravity in the sacred Scriptures, than that here recorded. Solomon
became a public worshipper of abominable idols! Probably he by degrees
gave way to pride and luxury, and thus lost his relish for true wisdom.
Nothing forms in itself a security against the deceitfulness and
depravity of the human heart. Nor will old age cure the heart of any
evil propensity. If our sinful passions are not crucified and mortified
by the grace of God, they never will die of themselves, but will last
even when opportunities to gratify them are taken away. Let him that
thinks he stands, take heed lest he fall. We see how weak we are of
ourselves, without the grace of God; let us therefore live in constant
dependence on that grace. Let us watch and be sober: ours is a dangerous
warfare, and in an enemy's country, while our worst foes are the
traitors in our own hearts.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg1 11:9</span></span>

The Lord told Solomon, it is likely by a prophet, what he must expect
for his apostacy. Though we have reason to hope that he repented, and
found mercy, yet the Holy Ghost did not expressly record it, but left it
doubtful, as a warning to others not to sin. The guilt may be taken
away, but not the reproach; that will remain. Thus it must remain
uncertain to us till the day of judgment, whether or not Solomon was
left to suffer the everlasting displeasure of an offended God.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg1 11:14</span></span>

While Solomon kept close to God and to his duty, there was no enemy to
give him uneasiness; but here we have an account of two. If against us,
he can make us fear even the least, and the very grasshopper shall be a
burden. Though they were moved by principles of ambition or revenge, God
used them to correct Solomon.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg1 11:26</span></span>

In telling the reason why God rent the kingdom from the house of
Solomon, Ahijah warned Jeroboam to take heed of sinning away his
preferment. Yet the house of David must be supported; out of it the
Messiah would arise. Solomon sought to kill his successor. Had not he
taught others, that whatever devices are in men's hearts, the counsel of
the Lord shall stand? Yet he himself thinks to defeat that counsel.
Jeroboam withdrew into Egypt, and was content to live in exile and
obscurity for awhile, being sure of a kingdom at last. Shall not we be
content, who have a better kingdom in reserve?

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:41](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">kg1 11:41</span></span>

Solomon's reign was as long as his father's, but his life was not so.
Sin shortened his days. If the world, with all its advantages, could
satisfy the soul, and afford real joy, Solomon would have found it so.
But he was disappointed in all, and to warn us, has left this record of
all earthly enjoyments, "Vanity and vexation of spirit." The New
Testament declares that one greater than Solomon is come to reign over
us, and to possess the throne of his father David. May we not see
something of Christ's excellency faintly represented to us in this
figure?
