<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#001">Psa 87:1-3</A>) The glory of the church.
<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#004">Psa 87:4-7</A>) It is filled with the Divine blessing. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#001">Psalms 87:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">psa 87:1</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Christ himself is the Foundation of the church, which God has laid. Holiness is the strength and firmness of the church. Let us not be ashamed of the church of Christ in its meanest condition, nor of those that belong to it, since such glorious things are spoken of it. Other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, even Jesus Christ. The glorious things spoken of Zion by the Spirit, were all typical of Christ, and his work and offices; of the gospel church, its privileges and members; of heaven, its glory and perfect happiness. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#004">Psalms 87:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">psa 87:4</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The church of Christ is more glorious and excellent than the nations of the earth. In the records of heaven, the meanest of those who are born again stand registered. When God renders to every man according to his works, he shall observe who enjoyed the privileges of his sanctuary. To them much was given, and of them much will be required. Let those that dwell in Zion, mark this, and live up to their profession. Zion's songs shall be sung with joy and triumph. The springs of the joy of a carnal worldling are in wealth and pleasure; but of a gracious soul, in the word of God and prayer. All grace and consolation are derived from Christ, through his ordinances, to the souls of believers.
