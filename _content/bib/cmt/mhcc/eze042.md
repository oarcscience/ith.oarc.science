### [Ezekiel Chapter 42](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#001)

In this chapter are described the priests' chambers, their use, and the
dimensions of the holy mount on which the temple stood. These chambers
were many. Jesus said, In my Father's house are many mansions: in his
house on earth there are many; multitudes, by faith, are lodging in his
sanctuary, and yet there is room. These chambers, though private, were
near the temple. Our religious services in our chambers, must prepare
for public devotions, and further us in improving them, as our
opportunities are.
