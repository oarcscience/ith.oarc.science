### [Psalms Chapter 111](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 111:0</span></span>

The Lord is to be praised for his works.

[Psalms 111:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 111:1</span></span>

The psalmist resolves to praise God himself. Our exhortations and our
examples should agree together. He recommends the works of the Lord, as
the proper subject, when we are praising him; and the dealings of his
providence toward the world, the church, and particular persons. All the
works of the Lord are spoken of as one, it is his work; so admirably do
all the dispensations of his providence centre in one design. The works
of God, humbly and diligently sought into, shall all be found just and
holy. God's pardoning sin is the most wonderful of all his works, and
ought to be remembered to his glory. He will ever be mindful of his
covenant; he has ever been so, and he ever will be so. His works of
providence were done according to the truth of the Divine promises and
prophecies, and so were verity, or truth; and by him who has a right to
dispose of the earth as he pleases, and so are judgment, or righteous:
and this holds good of the work of grace upon the heart of man, [Psa
111:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#007), [Psa
111:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#008). All God's commandments are
sure; all have been fulfilled by Christ, and remain with him for a rule
of walk and conversation to us. He sent redemption unto his people, out
of Egypt at first, and often afterwards; and these were typical of the
great redemption, which in the fulness of time was to be wrought out by
the Lord Jesus. Here his everlasting righteousness shines forth in union
with his boundless mercy. No man is wise who does not fear the Lord; no
man acts wisely except as influenced by that fear. This fear will lead
to repentance, to faith in Christ, to watchfulness and obedience. Such
persons are of a good understanding, however poor, unlearned, or
despised.
