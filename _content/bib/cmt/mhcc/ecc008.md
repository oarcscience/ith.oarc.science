### [Ecclesiastes Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#001)

[Ecclesiastes](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ecc 8:0</span></span>

([Ecc 8:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#001)) Commendations of wisdom.

([Ecc 8:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#006)) To prepare for sudden
evils and death.

([Ecc 8:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#009)) It shall be well with
the righteous, and ill with the wicked.

([Ecc 8:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#014)) Mysteries of
Providence.

[Ecclesiastes 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ecc 8:1</span></span>

None of the rich, the powerful, the honourable, or the accomplished of
the sons of men, are so excellent, useful, or happy, as the wise man.
Who else can interpret the words of God, or teach aright from his truths
and dispensations? What madness must it be for weak and dependent
creatures to rebel against the Almighty! What numbers form wrong
judgments, and bring misery on themselves, in this life and that to
come!

[Ecclesiastes 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ecc 8:6</span></span>

God has, in wisdom, kept away from us the knowledge of future events,
that we may be always ready for changes. We must all die, no flight or
hiding-place can save us, nor are there any weapons of effectual
resistance. Ninety thousand die every day, upwards of sixty every
minute, and one every moment. How solemn the thought! Oh that men were
wise, that they understood these things, that they would consider their
latter end! The believer alone is prepared to meet the solemn summons.
Wickedness, by which men often escape human justice, cannot secure from
death.

[Ecclesiastes 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ecc 8:9</span></span>

Solomon observed, that many a time one man rules over another to his
hurt, and that prosperity hardens them in their wickedness. Sinners
herein deceive themselves. Vengeance comes slowly, but it comes surely.
A good man's days have some substance; he lives to a good purpose: a
wicked man's days are all as a shadow, empty and worthless. Let us pray
that we may view eternal things as near, real, and all-important.

[Ecclesiastes 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ecc 8:14</span></span>

Faith alone can establish the heart in this mixed scene, where the
righteous often suffer, and the wicked prosper. Solomon commended joy,
and holy security of mind, arising from confidence in God, because a man
has no better thing under the sun, though a good man has much better
things above the sun, than soberly and thankfully to use the things of
this life according to his rank. He would not have us try to give a
reason for what God does. But, leaving the Lord to clear up all
difficulties in his own time, we may cheerfully enjoy the comforts, and
bear up under the trials of life; while peace of conscience and joy in
the Holy Ghost will abide in us through all outward changes, and when
flesh and heart shall fail.
