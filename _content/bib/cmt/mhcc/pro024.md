### [Proverbs Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#001)

[Proverbs 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 24:1</span></span>

Envy not sinners. And let not a desire ever come into thy mind, Oh that
I could shake off restraints!

[Proverbs 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 24:3</span></span>

Piety and prudence in outward affairs, both go together to complete a
wise man. By knowledge the soul is filled with the graces and comforts
of the spirit, those precious and pleasant riches. The spirit is
strengthened for the spiritual work and the spiritual warfare, by true
wisdom.

[Proverbs 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 24:7</span></span>

A weak man thinks wisdom is too high for him, therefore he will take no
pains for it. It is bad to do evil, but worse to devise it. Even the
first risings of sin in the heart are sin, and must be repented of.
Those that strive to make others hateful, make themselves so.

[Proverbs 24:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 24:10</span></span>

Under troubles we are apt to despair of relief. But be of good courage,
and God shall strengthen thy heart.

[Proverbs 24:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 24:11</span></span>

If a man know that his neighbour is in danger by any unjust proceeding,
he is bound to do all in his power to deliver him. And what is it to
suffer immortal souls to perish, when our persuasions and example may be
the means of preventing it?

[Proverbs 24:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 24:13</span></span>

We are quickened to the study of wisdom by considering both the pleasure
and the profit of it. All men relish things that are sweet to the
palate; but many have no relish for the things that are sweet to the
purified soul, and that make us wise unto salvation.

[Proverbs 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 24:15</span></span>

The sincere soul falls as a traveller may do, by stumbling at some stone
in his path; but gets up, and goes on his way with more care and speed.
This is rather to be understood of falls into affliction, than falls
into actual sin.

[Proverbs 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 24:17</span></span>

The pleasure we are apt to take in the troubles of an enemy is
forbidden.

[Proverbs 24:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 24:19</span></span>

Envy not the wicked their prosperity; be sure there is no true happiness
in it.

[Proverbs 24:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 24:21</span></span>

The godly in the land, will be quiet in the land. There may be cause to
change for the better, but have nothing to do with them that are given
change.

[Proverbs 24:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 24:23</span></span>

The wisdom God giveth, renders a man fit for his station. Every one who
finds the benefit of the right answer, will be attached to him that gave
it.

[Proverbs 24:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 24:27</span></span>

We must prefer necessaries before conveniences, and not go in debt.

[Proverbs 24:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">pro 24:28</span></span>

There are three defaults in a witness pointed out.

[Proverbs 24:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">pro 24:30</span></span>

See what a blessing the husbandman's calling is, and what a wilderness
this earth would be without it. See what great difference there is in
the management even of worldly affairs. Sloth and self-indulgence are
the bane of all good. When we see fields overgrown with thorns and
thistles, and the fences broken down, we see an emblem of the far more
deplorable state of many souls. Every vile affection grows in men's
hearts; yet they compose themselves to sleep. Let us show wisdom by
doubling our diligence in every good thing.
