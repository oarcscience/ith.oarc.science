<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001">Psa 1:1-3</A>) The holiness and happiness of a godly man.
<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#004">Psa 1:4-6</A>) The sinfulness and misery of a wicked man, The ground and reason of both. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001">Psalms 1:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">psa 1:1</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>To meditate in God's word, is to discourse with ourselves concerning the great things contained in it, with close application of mind and fixedness of thought. We must have constant regard to the word of God, as the rule of our actions, and the spring of our comforts; and have it in our thoughts night and day. For this purpose no time is amiss. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#004">Psalms 1:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">psa 1:4</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The ungodly are the reverse of the righteous, both in character and condition. The ungodly are not so, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#004">Psa 1:4</A>; they are led by the counsel of the wicked, in the way of sinners, to the seat of the scornful; they have no delight in the law of God; they bring forth no fruit but what is evil. The righteous are like useful, fruitful trees: the ungodly are like the chaff which the wind drives away: the dust which the owner of the floor desires to have driven away, as not being of any use. They are of no worth in God's account, how highly soever they may value themselves. They are easily driven to and fro by every wind of temptation. The chaff may be, for a while, among the wheat, but He is coming, whose fan is in his hand, and who will thoroughly purge his floor. Those that, by their own sin and folly, make themselves as chaff, will be found so before the whirlwind and fire of Divine wrath. The doom of the ungodly is fixed, but whenever the sinner becomes sensible of this guilt and misery, he may be admitted into the company of the righteous by Christ the living way, and become in Christ a new creature. He has new desires, new pleasures, hopes, fears, sorrows, companions, and employments. His thoughts, words, and actions are changed. He enters on a new state, and bears a new character. Behold, all things are become new by Divine grace, which changes his soul into the image of the Redeemer. How different the character and end of the ungodly!
