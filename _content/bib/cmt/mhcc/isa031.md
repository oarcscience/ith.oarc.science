### [Isaiah Chapter 31](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#001)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 31:0</span></span>

([Isa 31:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#001)) The sin and folly of
seeking help from Egypt.

([Isa 31:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#006)) God's care for
Jerusalem.

[Isaiah 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 31:1</span></span>

God will oppose the help sought from workers of iniquity. Sinners may be
convicted of folly by plain and self-evident truths, which they cannot
deny, but will not believe. There is no escaping the judgments of God;
and evil pursues sinners. The Lord of hosts will come down to fight for
Mount Zion. The Lion of the tribe of Judah will appear for the defence
of his church. And as birds hovering over their young ones to protect
them, with such compassion and affection will the Lord of hosts defend
Jerusalem. He will so defend it, as to secure its safety.

[Isaiah 31:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 31:6</span></span>

They have been backsliding children, yet children; let them return, and
their backslidings shall be healed, though they have sunk deep into
misery, and cannot easily recover. Many make an idol of their silver and
gold, and by the love of that are drawn from God; but those who turn to
God, will be ready to part with it. Then, when they have cast away their
idols, shall the Assyrian fall by the sword of an angel, who strikes
more strongly than a mighty man, yet more secretly than a mean man. God
can make the stoutest heart to tremble. But if we keep up the fire of
holy love and devotion in our hearts and houses, we may depend upon God
to protect us and them.
