### [Hosea Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#001)

[Hosea](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">hos 10:0</span></span>

([Hos 10:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#001)) The idolatry of Israel.

([Hos 10:9-15](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#009)) They are exhorted to
repentance.

[Hosea 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hos 10:1</span></span>

A vine is only valuable for its fruit; but Israel now brought no fruit
to perfection. Their hearts were divided. God is the Sovereign of the
heart; he will have all, or none. Were the stream of the heart wholly
after God, it would run strongly, and bear down all before it. Their
pretences to covenant with God were false. Even the proceeding of
justice was as poisonous hemlock. Alas, how empty a vine is the visible
church even at this day! But all earthly prosperity is but a collection
of bubbles, soon destroyed like foam upon the water. Sinners will in
vain seek shelter from that Judge, whom they now despise as a Saviour.

[Hosea 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">hos 10:9</span></span>

Because God does not desire the death and ruin of sinners, therefore in
mercy he desires their chastisement. The children of iniquity still
remained in Israel. The enemies would be gathered against them. It is
just with God to make those know what hardships mean, who indulge
themselves in ease and pleasure. Let them cleanse their hearts from all
corrupt affections and lusts, and be a broken and contrite spirit. Let
them abound in works of piety towards God, and of justice and charity
towards one another: herein let them sow to the Spirit. Seeking the Lord
is to be every day's work, but there are special occasions when to seek
him. Christ shall come as the Lord our righteousness, and grant us of it
abundantly. If we sow in righteousness, we shall reap according to
mercy; a reward not of debt, but of grace. Even the gains of sin yield
the sinner no satisfaction. As our comforts, so our confidences in the
service of sin will certainly fail us. Come and seek the Lord, and thy
hope in him shall not deceive thee. See what cruel work war makes.
Whatever mischief is done, it is sin that does it. What miseries men's
sins bring on them, even in this world!
