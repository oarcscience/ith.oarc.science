### [Amos Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#001)

[Amos](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">amo 9:0</span></span>

([Amo 9:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#001)) The ruin of Israel.

([Amo 9:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#011)) The restoration of the
Jews and the gospel blessing.

[Amos 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">amo 9:1</span></span>

The prophet, in vision, saw the Lord standing upon the idolatrous altar
at Bethel. Wherever sinners flee from God's justice, it will overtake
them. Those whom God brings to heaven by his grace, shall never be cast
down; but those who seek to climb thither by vain confidence in
themselves, will be cast down and filled with shame. That which makes
escape impossible and ruin sure, is, that God will set his eyes upon
them for evil, not for good. Wretched must those be on whom the Lord
looks for evil, and not for good. The Lord would scatter the Jews, and
visit them with calamities, as the corn is shaken in a sieve; but he
would save some from among them. The astonishing preservation of the
Jews as a distinct people, seems here foretold. If professors make
themselves like the world, God will level them with the world. The
sinners who thus flatter themselves, shall find that their profession
will not protect them.

[Amos 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">amo 9:11</span></span>

Christ died to gather together the children of God that were scattered
abroad, here said to be those who were called by his name. The Lord
saith this, who doeth this, who can do it, who has determined to do it,
the power of whose grace is engaged for doing it. [Amo
9:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#013) may refer to the early times
of Christianity, but will receive a more glorious fulfilment in the
events which all the prophets more or less foretold, and may be
understood of the happy state when the fulness both of the Jews and the
Gentiles come into the church. Let us continue earnest in prayer for the
fulfilment of these prophecies, in the peace, purity, and the beauty of
the church. God marvellously preserves his elect amidst the most fearful
confusions and miseries. When all seems desperate, he wonderfully
revives his church, and blesses her with all spiritual blessings in
Christ Jesus. And great shall be the glory of that period, in which not
one good thing promised shall remain unfulfilled.
