### [Psalms Chapter 32](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 32:0</span></span>

([Psa 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001), [Psa
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#002)) The happiness of a pardoned
sinner.

([Psa 32:3-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#003)) The misery that went
before, and the comfort that followed the confession of sins.

([Psa 32:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#008)) Sinners instructed,
believers encouraged.

[Psalms 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 32:1</span></span>

Sin is the cause of our misery; but the true believer's transgressions
of the Divine law are all forgiven, being covered with the atonement.
Christ bare his sins, therefore they are not imputed to him. The
righteousness of Christ being reckoned to us, and we being made the
righteousness of God in him, our iniquity is not imputed, God having
laid upon him the iniquity of us all, and made him a sin-offering for
us. Not to impute sin, is God's act, for he is the Judge. It is God that
justifies. Notice the character of him whose sins are pardoned; he is
sincere, and seeks sanctification by the power of the Holy Ghost. He
does not profess to repent, with an intention to indulge in sin, because
the Lord is ready to forgive. He will not abuse the doctrine of free
grace. And to the man whose iniquity is forgiven, all manner of
blessings are promised.

[Psalms 32:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 32:3</span></span>

It is very difficult to bring sinful man humbly to accept free mercy,
with a full confession of his sins and self-condemnation. But the true
and only way to peace of conscience, is, to confess our sins, that they
may be forgiven; to declare them that we may be justified. Although
repentance and confession do not merit the pardon of transgression, they
are needful to the real enjoyment of forgiving mercy. And what tongue
can tell the happiness of that hour, when the soul, oppressed by sin, is
enabled freely to pour forth its sorrows before God, and to take hold of
his covenanted mercy in Christ Jesus! Those that would speed in prayer,
must seek the Lord, when, by his providence, he calls them to seek him,
and, by his Spirit, stirs them up to seek him. In a time of finding,
when the heart is softened with grief, and burdened with guilt; when all
human refuge fails; when no rest can be found to the troubled mind, then
it is that God applies the healing balm by his Spirit.

[Psalms 32:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 32:8</span></span>

God teaches by his word, and guides with the secret intimations of his
will. David gives a word of caution to sinners. The reason for this
caution is, that the way of sin will certainly end in sorrow. Here is a
word of comfort to saints. They may see that a life of communion with
God is far the most pleasant and comfortable. Let us rejoice, O Lord
Jesus, in thee, and in thy salvation; so shall we rejoice indeed.
