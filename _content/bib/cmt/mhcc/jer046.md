### [Jeremiah Chapter 46](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#001)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 46:0</span></span>

([Jer 46:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#001)) The defeat of the
Egyptians.

([Jer 46:13-26](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#013)) Their overthrow after
the siege of Tyre.

([Jer 46:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#027), [Jer
46:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#028)) A promise of comfort to the
Jews.

[Jeremiah 46:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 46:1</span></span>

The whole word of God is against those who obey not the gospel of
Christ; but it is for those, even of the Gentiles, who turn to Him. The
prophecy begins with Egypt. Let them strengthen themselves with all the
art and interest they have, yet it shall be all in vain. The wounds God
inflicts on his enemies, cannot be healed by medicines. Power and
prosperity soon pass from one to another in this changing world.

[Jeremiah 46:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 46:13</span></span>

Those who encroached on others, shall now be themselves encroached on.
Egypt is now like a very fair heifer, not accustomed to the yoke of
subjection; but destruction comes out of the north: the Chaldeans shall
come. Comfort and peace are spoken to the Israel of God, designed to
encourage them when the judgments of God were abroad among the nations.
He will be with them, and only correct them in measure; and will not
punish them with everlasting destruction from his presence.
