### [Ecclesiastes Introduction](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#001)

[Ecclesiastes](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ecc 0:0</span></span>

The name of this book signifies "The Preacher." The wisdom of God here
preaches to us, speaking by Solomon, who it is evident was the author.
At the close of his life, being made sensible of his sin and folly, he
recorded here his experience for the benefit of others, as the book of
his repentance; and he pronounced all earthly good to be "vanity and
vexation of spirit." It convinces us of the vanity of the world, and
that it cannot make us happy; of the vileness of sin, and its certain
tendency to make us miserable. It shows that no created good can satisfy
the soul, and that happiness is to be found in God alone; and this
doctrine must, under the blessed Spirit's teaching, lead the heart to
Christ Jesus.
