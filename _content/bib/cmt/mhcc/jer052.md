### [Jeremiah Chapter 52](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#001)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 52:0</span></span>

([Jer 52:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#001)) The fate of Zedekiah.

([Jer 52:12-23](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#012)) The destruction of
Jerusalem.

([Jer 52:24-30](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#024)) The captivities.

([Jer 52:31-34](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#031)) The advancement of
Jehoiachin.

[Jeremiah 52:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 52:1</span></span>

This fruit of sin we should pray against above any thing; Cast me not
away from thy presence, [Psa 51:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#011).
None are cast out of God's presence but those who by sin have first
thrown themselves out. Zedekiah's flight was in vain, for there is no
escaping the judgments of God; they come upon the sinner, and overtake
him, let him flee where he will.

[Jeremiah 52:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 52:12</span></span>

The Chaldean army made woful havoc. But nothing is so particularly
related here, as the carrying away of the articles in the temple. The
remembrance of their beauty and value shows us the more the evil of sin.

[Jeremiah 52:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jer 52:24</span></span>

The leaders of the Jews caused them to err; but now they are, in
particular, made monuments of Divine justice. Here is an account of two
earlier captivities. This people often were wonders both of judgment and
mercy.

[Jeremiah 52:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">jer 52:31</span></span>

See this history of king Jehoiachin in [Kg2
25:27-30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#027). Those under oppression will
find it is not in vain for them to hope and quietly to wait for the
salvation of the Lord. Our times are in God's hand, for the hearts of
all we have to deal with are so. May we be enabled, more and more, to
rest on the Rock of Ages, and to look forward with holy faith to that
hour, when the Lord will bring again Zion, and overthrow all the enemies
of the church.
