<p>Nahash had been an enemy to Israel, yet had showed kindness to David. David therefore resolves gratefully to return it. If a Pharisee gives alms in pride, though God will not reward it, yet he that receives the alms ought to return thanks for it. Those who bear ill-will to their neighbours, are resolved not to believe that their neighbours bear any good-will to them. There is nothing so well meant, but it may be ill interpreted, and is wont to be so, by men who love nobody but themselves. The best men must not think it strange if they are thus misrepresented. Charity thinketh no evil. According to the usages of those days and countries, Hanun treated David's ambassadors in the most contemptuous manner. David showed much concern for his servants. Let us learn not to lay unjust reproaches to heart; they will wear off, and turn only to the shame of those who utter or do them; while the reputation wrongfully hurt in a little time grows again, as these beards did. God will bring forth thy righteousness as the light, therefore wait patiently for him, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#006">Psa 37:6</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#007">Psa 37:7</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#006">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 10:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">sa2 10:6</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>They that are at war with the Son of David, not only give the provocation, but begin the war. God has forces to send against those that set his wrath at defiance, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#019">Isa 5:19</A>, which will convince them that none ever hardened his heart against God, and prospered. Christ's soldiers should strengthen one another's hands in their spiritual warfare. Let nothing be wanting in us, whatever the success be. When we make conscience of doing our duty, we may, with satisfaction, leave the event with God, assuredly hoping for his salvation in his own way and time. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#015">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 10:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">sa2 10:15</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Here is a new attempt of the Syrians. Even the baffled cause will make head as long as there is any life in it; the enemies of the Son of David do so. But now the promise made to Abraham, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#018">Gen 15:18</A>, and repeated to Joshua, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#004">Jos 1:4</A>, that the borders of Israel should extend to the river Euphrates, was performed. Learn hence, that it is dangerous to help those who have God against them; for when they fall, their helpers will fall with them.
