### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#001)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa2 17:0</span></span>

(v. 1-21) Ahithophel's counsel overthrown.

([Sa2 17:22-29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#022)) He hangs himself,
Absalom pursues David.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 17:1</span></span>

Here was a wonderful effect of Divine Providence blinding Absalom's mind
and influencing his heart, that he could not rest in Ahithophel's
counsel, and that he should desire Hushai's advice. But there is no
contending with that God who can arm a man against himself, and destroy
him by his own mistakes and passions. Ahithophel's former counsel was
followed, for God intended to correct David; but his latter counsel was
not followed, for God meant not to destroy him. He can overrule all
counsels. Whatever wisdom or help any man employs or affords, the
success is from God alone, who will not let his people perish.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 17:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">sa2 17:22</span></span>

Ahithophel hanged himself for vexation that his counsel was not
followed. That will break a proud man's heart which will not break a
humble man's sleep. He thought himself in danger, concluding, that,
because his counsel was not followed, Absalom's cause would fail; and to
prevent a possible public execution, he does justice upon himself. Thus
the breath is stopped, and the head laid low, from which nothing could
be expected but mischief. Absalom chased his father. But observe how God
sometimes makes up to his people that comfort from strangers, which they
are disappointed of in their own families. Our King needs not our help;
but he assures us, that what we do for the least of his brethren, who
are sick, poor, and destitute, shall be accepted and recompensed as if
done to himself.
