<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#001">Kg1 1:1-4</A>) David's declining age.
<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#005">Kg1 1:5-10</A>) Adonijah aspires to the throne.
<p>(v. 11-31) David makes Solomon king.
<p>(v. 32-53) Solomon is anointed king, and Adonijah's usurpation stopped.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">kg1 1:1</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>We have David sinking under infirmities. He was chastised for his recent sins, and felt the effects of his former toils and hardships. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#005">3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">kg1 1:5</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Indulgent parents are often chastised with disobedient children, who are anxious to possess their estates. No worldly wisdom, nor experience, nor sacredness of character, can insure the continuance in any former course of those who remain under the power of self-love. But we may well wonder by what arts Joab and Abiathar could be drawn aside. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#011">3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">kg1 1:11</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Observe Nathan's address to Bathsheba. Let me give thee counsel how to save thy own life, and the life of thy son. Such as this is the counsel Christ's ministers give us in his name, to give all diligence, not only that no man take our crown, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#011">Rev 3:11</A>, but that we save our lives, even the lives of our souls. David made a solemn declaration of his firm cleaving to his former resolution, that Solomon should be his successor. Even the recollection of the distresses from which the Lord redeemed him, increased his comfort, inspired his hopes, and animated him to his duty, under the decays of nature and the approach of death. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#032">3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:32</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_032">kg1 1:32</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The people expressed great joy and satisfaction in the elevation of Solomon. Every true Israelite rejoices in the exaltation of the Son of David. Combinations formed upon evil principles will soon be dissolved, when self-interest calls another way. How can those who do evil deeds expect to have good tidings? Adonijah had despised Solomon, but soon dreaded him. We see here, as in a glass, Jesus, the Son of David and the Son of God, exalted to the throne of glory, notwithstanding all his enemies. His kingdom is far greater than that of his father David, and therein all the true people of God cordially rejoice. The prosperity of his cause is vexation and terror to his enemies. No horns of the altar, nor forms of godliness, nor pretences to religion, can profit those who will not submit to His authority, and accept of his salvation; and if their submission be hypocritical, they shall perish without remedy.
