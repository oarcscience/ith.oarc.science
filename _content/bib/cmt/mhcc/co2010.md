### [2 Corinthians Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#001)

[2 Corinthians](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">co2 10:0</span></span>

([Co2 10:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#001)) The apostle states his
authority with meekness and humility.

([Co2 10:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#007)) Reasons with the
Corinthians.

([Co2 10:12-18](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#012)) Seeks the glory of
God, and to be approved of him.

[2 Corinthians 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co2 10:1</span></span>

While others thought meanly, and spake scornfully of the apostle, he had
low thoughts, and spake humbly of himself. We should be aware of our own
infirmities, and think humbly of ourselves, even when men reproach us.
The work of the ministry is a spiritual warfare with spiritual enemies,
and for spiritual purposes. Outward force is not the method of the
gospel, but strong persuasions, by the power of truth and the meekness
of wisdom. Conscience is accountable to God only; and people must be
persuaded to God and their duty, not driven by force. Thus the weapons
of our warfare are very powerful; the evidence of truth is convincing.
What opposition is made against the gospel, by the powers of sin and
Satan in the hearts of men! But observe the conquest the word of God
gains. The appointed means, however feeble they appear to some, will be
mighty through God. And the preaching of the cross, by men of faith and
prayer, has always been fatal to idolatry, impiety, and wickedness.

[2 Corinthians 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co2 10:7</span></span>

In outward appearance, Paul was mean and despised in the eyes of some,
but this was a false rule to judge by. We must not think that none
outward appearance, as if the want of such things proved a man not to be
a real Christian, or an able, faithful minister of the lowly Saviour.

[2 Corinthians 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co2 10:12</span></span>

If we would compare ourselves with others who excel us, this would be a
good method to keep us humble. The apostle fixes a good rule for his
conduct; namely, not to boast of things without his measure, which was
the measure God had distributed to him. There is not a more fruitful
source of error, than to judge of persons and opinions by our own
prejudices. How common is it for persons to judge of their own religious
character, by the opinions and maxims of the world around them! But how
different is the rule of God's word! And of all flattery, self-flattery
is the worst. Therefore, instead of praising ourselves, we should strive
to approve ourselves to God. In a word, let us glory in the Lord our
salvation, and in all other things only as evidences of his love, or
means of promoting his glory. Instead of praising ourselves, or seeking
the praise of men, let us desire that honour which cometh from God only.
