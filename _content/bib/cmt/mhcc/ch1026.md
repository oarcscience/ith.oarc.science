The offices of the Levites.

[1 Chronicles 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 26:1</span></span>

The porters and treasurers of the temple, had occasion for strength and
valour to oppose those who wrongly attempted to enter the sanctuary, and
to guard the sacred treasures. Much was expended daily upon the altar;
flour, wine, oil, salt, fuel, beside the lamps; quantities of these were
kept beforehand, besides the sacred vestments and utensils. These were
the treasures of the house of God. These treasures typified the plenty
there is in our heavenly Father's house, enough and to spare. From those
sacred treasuries, the unsearchable riches of Christ, all our wants are
supplied; and receiving from his fulness, we must give him the glory,
and endeavour to dispose of our abilities and substance according to his
will. We have an account of those employed as officers and judges. The
magistracy is an ordinance of God for the good of the church, as truly
as the ministry, and must not be neglected. None of the Levites who were
employed in the service of the sanctuary, none of the singers or
porters, were concerned in this outward business; one duty was enough to
engage the whole man. Wisdom, courage, strength of faith, holy
affections, and constancy of mind in doing our duty, are requisite or
useful for every station.
