### [Ezekiel Chapter 35](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#001)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 35:0</span></span>

A prophecy against Edom.

[Ezekiel 35:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 35:1</span></span>

All who have God against them, have the word of God against them. Those
that have a constant hatred to God and his people, as the carnal mind
has, can only expect to be made desolate for ever.

[Ezekiel 35:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 35:10</span></span>

When we see the vanity of the world in the disappointments, losses, and
crosses, which others meet with, instead of showing ourselves greedy of
worldly things, we should sit more loose to them. In the multitude of
words, not one is unknown to God; not the most idle word; and the most
daring is not above his rebuke. In the destruction of the enemies of the
church, God designs his own glory; and we may be sure that he will not
come short of his design. And when the fulness of the Jews and Gentiles
shall come into the church, all antichristian opposers shall be
destroyed.
