### [Jeremiah Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#001)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 5:0</span></span>

([Jer 5:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#001)) The Jews' profession of
religion was hypocritical.

([Jer 5:10-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#010)) The cruel proceedings
of their enemies.

([Jer 5:19-31](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#019)) Their apostacy and
idolatry.

[Jeremiah 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 5:1</span></span>

None could be found who behaved as upright and godly men. But the Lord
saw the true character of the people through all their disguises. The
poor were ignorant, and therefore they were wicked. What can be expected
but works of darkness, from people that know nothing of God and
religion? There are God's poor, who, notwithstanding poverty, know the
way of the Lord, walk in it, and do their duty; but these were willingly
ignorant, and their ignorance would not be their excuse. The rich were
insolent and haughty, and the abuse of God's favours made their sin
worse.

[Jeremiah 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 5:10</span></span>

Multitudes are ruined by believing that God will not be so strict as his
word says he will; by this artifice Satan undid mankind. Sinners are not
willing to own any thing to be God's word, that tends to part them from,
or to disquiet them in, their sins. Mocking and misusing the Lord's
messengers, filled the measure of their iniquity. God can bring trouble
upon us from places and causes very remote. He has mercy in store for
his people, therefore will set bounds to this desolating judgment. Let
us not overlook the "nevertheless," [Jer
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#018). This is the Lord's covenant with
Israel. He thereby proclaims his holiness, and his utter displeasure
against sin while sparing the sinner, [Psa
89:30-35](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#030).

[Jeremiah 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 5:19</span></span>

Unhumbled hearts are ready to charge God with being unjust in their
afflictions. But they may read their sin in their punishment. If men
will inquire wherefore the Lord doeth hard things unto them, let them
think of their sins. The restless waves obeyed the Divine decree, that
they should not pass the sandy shores, which were as much a restraint as
lofty mountains; but they burst all restraints of God's law, and were
wholly gone into wickedness. Neither did they consider their interest.
While the Lord, year after year, reserves to us the appointed weeks of
harvest, men live on his bounty; yet they transgress against him. Sin
deprives us of God's blessings; it makes the heaven as brass, and the
earth as iron. Certainly the things of this world are not the best
things; and we are not to think, that, because evil men prosper, God
allows their practices. Though sentence against evil works is not
executed speedily, it will be executed. Shall I not visit for these
things? This speaks the certainty and the necessity of God's judgments.
Let those who walk in bad ways consider that an end will come, and there
will be bitterness in the latter end.
