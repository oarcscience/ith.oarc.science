### [Psalms Chapter 58](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 58:0</span></span>

([Psa 58:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#001)) Wicked judges described
and reproved.

([Psa 58:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#006)) A prayer that they may
be disabled, and their ruin predicted.

[Psalms 58:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 58:1</span></span>

When wrong is done under the form of law, it is worse than any other;
especially it is grievous to behold those who profess to be children of
God, joining together against any of his people. We should thank the
Lord for merciful restraints; we should be more earnest in seeking
renewing grace, more watchful over ourselves, and more patient under the
effects of fallen nature in others. The corruption of their nature was
the root of bitterness. We may see in children the wickedness of the
world beginning. They go astray from God and their duty as soon as
possibly they can. And how soon will little children tell lies! It is
our duty to take pains to teach them, and above all, earnestly to pray
for converting grace to make our children new creatures. Though the
poison be within, much of it may be kept from breaking forth to injure
others. When the Saviour's words are duly regarded, the serpent becomes
harmless. But those who refuse to hear heavenly wisdom, must perish
miserably, for ever.

[Psalms 58:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 58:6</span></span>

David prayed that the enemies of God's church and people might be
disabled to do further mischief. We may, in faith, pray against the
designs of the enemies of the church. He foretells their ruin. And who
knows the power of God's anger? The victories of the Just One, in his
own person and that of his servants, over the enemies of man's
salvation, produce a joy which springs not from revenge, but from a view
of the Divine mercy, justice, and truth, shown in the redemption of the
elect, the punishment of the ungodly, and the fulfilment of the
promises. Whoever duly considers these things, will diligently seek the
reward of righteousness, and adore the Providence which orders all thing
aright in heaven and in earth.
