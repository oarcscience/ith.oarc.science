[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 0:0</span></span>

Jeremiah was a priest, a native of Anathoth, in the tribe of Benjamin.
He was called to the prophetic office when very young, about seventy
years after the death of Isaiah, and exercised it for about forty years
with great faithfulness, till the sins of the Jewish nation came to
their full measure and destruction followed. The prophecies of Jeremiah
do not stand as they were delivered. Blayney has endeavoured to arrange
them in more regular order, namely, ch. 1-20; 22; 23; 25; 26; 35; 36;
[Jer 45:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/jer045.htm#001); [Jer
24:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#001); 29; 30; 31; 27; 28; [Jer
21:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#001); 34; 37; 32; 33; 38; 39; ([Jer
39:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#015), [Jer
39:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#001).) 40-44; 46-52. The general
subject of his prophecies is the idolatry and other sins of the Jews;
the judgments by which they were threatened, with references to their
future restoration and deliverance, and promises of the Messiah. They
are remarkable for plain and faithful reproofs, affectionate
expostulations, and awful warnings.
