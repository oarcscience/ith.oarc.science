### [Jeremiah Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#001)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 14:0</span></span>

([Jer 14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#001)) A drought upon the land
of Judah.

([Jer 14:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#008)) A confession of sin in
the name of the people.

([Jer 14:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#010)) The Divine purpose to
punish is declared.

([Jer 14:17-22](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#017)) The people supplicate.

[Jeremiah 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 14:1</span></span>

The people were in tears. But it was rather the cry of their trouble,
and of their sin, than of their prayer. Let us be thankful for the mercy
of water, that we may not be taught to value it by feeling the want of
it. See what dependence husbandmen have upon the Divine providence. They
cannot plough nor sow in hope, unless God water their furrows. The case
even of the wild beasts was very pitiable. The people are not forward to
pray, but the prophet prays for them. Sin is humbly confessed. Our sins
not only accuse us, but answer against us. Our best pleas in prayer are
those fetched from the glory of God's own name. We should dread God's
departure, more than the removal of our creature-comforts. He has given
Israel his word to hope in. It becomes us in prayer to show ourselves
more concerned for God's glory than for our own comfort. And if we now
return to the Lord, he will save us to the glory of his grace.

[Jeremiah 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 14:10</span></span>

The Lord calls the Jews "this people," not "his people." They had
forsaken his service, therefore he would punish them according to their
sins. He forbade Jeremiah to plead for them. The false prophets were the
most criminal. The Lord pronounces condemnation on them; but as the
people loved to have it so, they were not to escape judgments. False
teachers encourage men to expect peace and salvation, without
repentance, faith, conversion, and holiness of life. But those who
believe a lie must not plead if for an excuse. They shall feel what they
say they will not fear.

[Jeremiah 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 14:17</span></span>

Jeremiah acknowledged his own sins, and those of the people, but pleaded
with the Lord to remember his covenant. In their distress none of the
idols of the Gentiles could help them, nor could the heavens give rain
of themselves. The Lord will always have a people to plead with him at
his mercy-seat. He will heal every truly repenting sinner. Should he not
see fit to hear our prayers on behalf of our guilty land, he will
certainly bless with salvation all who confess their sins and seek his
mercy.
