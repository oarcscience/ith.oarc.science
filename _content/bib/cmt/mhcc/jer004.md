### [Jeremiah Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#001)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 4:0</span></span>

([Jer 4:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#001)) Exhortations and
promises.

([Jer 4:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#003)) Judah exhorted to
repentance.

([Jer 4:5-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#005)) Judgements denounced.

([Jer 4:19-31](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#019)) The approaching ruin of
Judah.

[Jeremiah 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 4:1</span></span>

The first two verses should be read with the last chapter. Sin must be
put away out of the heart, else it is not put away out of God's sight,
for the heart is open before him.

[Jeremiah 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 4:3</span></span>

An unhumbled heart is like ground untilled. It is ground which may be
improved; it is our ground let out to us; but it is fallow; it is
over-grown with thorns and weeds, the natural product of the corrupt
heart. Let us entreat the Lord to create in us a clean heart, and to
renew a right spirit within us; for except a man be born again, he
cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven.

[Jeremiah 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 4:5</span></span>

The fierce conqueror of the neighbouring nations was to make Judah
desolate. The prophet was afflicted to see the people lulled into
security by false prophets. The approach of the enemy is described. Some
attention was paid in Jerusalem to outward reformation; but it was
necessary that their hearts should be washed, in the exercise of true
repentance and faith, from the love and pollution of sin. When lesser
calamities do not rouse sinners and reform nations, sentence will be
given against them. The Lord's voice declares that misery is
approaching, especially against wicked professors of the gospel; when it
overtakes them, it will be plainly seen that the fruit of wickedness is
bitter, and the end is fatal.

[Jeremiah 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 4:19</span></span>

The prophet had no pleasure in delivering messages of wrath. He is shown
in a vision the whole land in confusion. Compared with what it was,
every thing is out of order; but the ruin of the Jewish nation would not
be final. Every end of our comforts is not a full end. Though the Lord
may correct his people very severely, yet he will not cast them off.
Ornaments and false colouring would be of no avail. No outward
privileges or profession, no contrivances would prevent destruction. How
wretched the state of those who are like foolish children in the
concerns of their souls! Whatever we are ignorant of, may the Lord make
of good understanding in the ways of godliness. As sin will find out the
sinner, so sorrow will, sooner or later, find out the secure.
