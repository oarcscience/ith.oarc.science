### [Psalms Chapter 126](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 126:0</span></span>

([Psa 126:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#001)) Those returned out of
captivity are to be thankful.

([Psa 126:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#004)) Those yet in captivity
are encouraged.

[Psalms 126:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 126:1</span></span>

It is good to observe how God's deliverances of the church are for us,
that we may rejoice in them. And how ought redemption from the wrath to
come, from the power of sin and of Satan, to be valued! The sinner
convinced of his guilt and danger, when by looking to a crucified
Saviour he receives peace to his conscience, and power to break off his
sins, often can scarcely believe that the prospect which opens to him is
a reality.

[Psalms 126:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 126:4</span></span>

The beginnings of mercies encourage us to pray for the completion of
them. And while we are in this world there will be matter for prayer,
even when we are most furnished with matter for praise. Suffering saints
are often in tears; they share the calamities of human life, and
commonly have a greater share than others. But they sow in tears; they
do the duty of an afflicted state. Weeping must not hinder sowing; we
must get good from times of affliction. And they that sow, in the tears
of godly sorrow, to the Spirit, shall of the Spirit reap life
everlasting; and that will be a joyful harvest indeed. Blessed are those
that mourn, for they shall be for ever comforted. When we mourn for our
sins, or suffer for Christ's sake, we are sowing in tears, to reap in
joy. And remember that God is not mocked; for whatever a man soweth that
shall he reap, [Gal 6:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#007). Here, O
disciple of Jesus, behold an emblem of thy present labour and future
reward; the day is coming when thou shalt reap in joy, plentiful shall
be thy harvest, and great shall be thy joy in the Lord.
