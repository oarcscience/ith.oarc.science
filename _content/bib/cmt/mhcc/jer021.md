### [Jeremiah Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#001)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 21:0</span></span>

([Jer 21:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#001)) The only way of
deliverance is to be surrendering to the Babylonians.

([Jer 21:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#011)) The wickedness of the
king and his household.

[Jeremiah 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 21:1</span></span>

When the siege had begun, Zedekiah sent to ask of Jeremiah respecting
the event. In times of distress and danger, men often seek those to
counsel and pray for them, whom, at other times, they despise and
oppose; but they only seek deliverance from punishment. When professors
continue in disobedience, presuming upon outward privileges, let them be
told that the Lord will prosper his open enemies against them. As the
king and his princes would not surrender, the people are exhorted to do
so. No sinner on earth is left without a Refuge, who really desires one;
but the way of life is humbling, it requires self-denial, and exposes to
difficulties.

[Jeremiah 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 21:11</span></span>

The wickedness of the king and his family was the worse because of their
relation to David. They were urged to act with justice, at once, lest
the Lord's anger should be unquenchable. If God be for us, who can be
against us? But if he be against us, who can do any thing for us?
