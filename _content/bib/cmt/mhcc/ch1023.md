### [1 Chronicles Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#001)

[1 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch1 23:0</span></span>

(v. 1-23) David declares Solomon his successor.

([Ch1 23:24-32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#024)) The office of the
Levites.

[1 Chronicles 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 23:1</span></span>

David, having given charge concerning the building of the temple,
settles the method of the temple service, and orders the officers of it.
When those of the same family were employed together, it would engage
them to love and assist one another.

[1 Chronicles 23:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ch1 23:24</span></span>

Now the people of Israel were so many, there should be more employed in
the temple service, that every Israelite who brought an offering might
find a Levite ready to help him. When more work is to be done, it is
pity but there should be more workmen. A new heart, a spiritual mind,
which delights greatly in God's commandments, and can find a refreshing
feast in his ordinances, forms the great distinction between the true
Christian and all other men in the world. To the spiritual man every
service will yield satisfaction. He will be ever abounding in the work
of the Lord; being never so happy as when employed for such a good
Master, in so pleasant a service. He will not regard whether he is
called to take the lead, or to keep the charge of others who are placed
over him. May we seek and serve the Lord uprightly, and leave all the
rest to his disposal, by faith in his word.
