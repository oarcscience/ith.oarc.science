### [Leviticus Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#001)

[Leviticus](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#001)

Laws concerning the priests.

[Leviticus 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 21:1</span></span>

As these priests were types of Christ, so all ministers must be
followers of him, that their example may teach others to imitate the
Saviour. Without blemish, and separate from sinners, He executed his
priestly office on earth. What manner of persons then should his
ministers be! But all are, if Christians, spiritual priests; the
minister especially is called to set a good example, that the people may
follow it. Our bodily infirmities, blessed be God, cannot now shut us
out from his service, from these privileges, or from his heavenly glory.
Many a healthful, beautiful soul is lodged in a feeble, deformed body.
And those who may not be suited for the work of the ministry, may serve
God with comfort in other duties in his church.
