### [Ezra Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#001)

[Ezra](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ezr 5:0</span></span>

([Ezr 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#001), [Ezr
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#002)) The leaders forward the building
of the temple.

([Ezr 5:3-17](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#003)) Letter against the Jews.

[Ezra 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ezr 5:1</span></span>

The building of the temple was stopped about fifteen years. Then they
had two good ministers, who urged them to go on with the work. It is a
sign that God has mercy in store for a people, when he raises up
prophets to be helpers in the way and work of God, as guides, overseers,
and rulers. In Haggai, we see what great things God does by his word,
which he magnifies above all his name, and by his Spirit working with
it.

[Ezra 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ezr 5:3</span></span>

While employed in God's work, we are under his special protection; his
eye is upon us for good. This should keep us to our duty, and encourage
us therein, when difficulties are ever so discouraging. The elders of
the Jews gave the Samaritans an account of their proceedings. Let us
learn hence, with meekness and fear, to give a reason of the hope that
is in us; let us rightly understand, and then readily declare, what we
do in God's service, and why we do it. And while in this world, we
always shall have to confess, that our sins have provoked the wrath of
God. All our sufferings spring from thence, and all our comforts from
his unmerited mercy. However the work may seem to be hindered, yet the
Lord Jesus Christ is carrying it on, his people are growing unto a holy
temple in the Lord, for a habitation of God through the Spirit.
