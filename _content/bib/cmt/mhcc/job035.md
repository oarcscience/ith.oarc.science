### [Job Chapter 35](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#001)

[Job](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">job 35:0</span></span>

([Job 35:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#001)) Elihu speaks of man's
conduct.

([Job 35:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#009)) Why those who cry out
under afflictions are not regarded.

([Job 35:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#014)) Elihu reproves Job's
impatience.

[Job 35:1](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 35:1</span></span>

Elihu reproves Job for justifying himself more than God, and called his
attention to the heavens. They are far above us, and God is far above
them; how much then is he out of the reach, either of our sins or of our
services! We have no reason to complain if we have not what we expect,
but should be thankful that we have better than we deserve.

[Job 35:9](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 35:9</span></span>

Job complained that God did not regard the cries of the oppressed
against their oppressors. This he knew not how to reconcile the justice
of God and his government. Elihu solves the difficulty. Men do not
notice the mercies they enjoy in and under their afflictions, nor are
thankful for them, therefore they cannot expect that God should deliver
them out of affliction. He gives songs in the night; when our condition
is dark and melancholy, there is that in God's providence and promise,
which is sufficient to support us, and to enable us even to rejoice in
tribulation. When we only pore upon our afflictions, and neglect the
consolations of God which are treasured up for us, it is just in God to
reject our prayers. Even the things that will kill the body, cannot hurt
the soul. If we cry to God for the removal of an affliction, and it is
not removed, the reason is, not because the Lord's hand is shortened, or
his ear heavy; but because we are not sufficiently humbled.

[Job 35:14](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 35:14</span></span>

As in prosperity we are ready to think our mountain will never be
brought low; so when in adversity, we are ready to think our valley will
never be filled up. But to conclude that to-morrow must be as this day,
is as absurd as to think that the weather, when either fair or foul,
will be always so. When Job looked up to God, he had no reason to speak
despairingly. There is a day of judgment, when all that seems amiss will
be found to be right, and all that seems dark and difficult will be
cleared up and set straight. And if there is Divine wrath in our
troubles, it is because we quarrel with God, are fretful, and distrust
Divine Providence. This was Job's case. Elihu was directed by God to
humble Job, for as to some things he had both opened his mouth in vain,
and had multiplied words without knowledge. Let us be admonished, in our
afflictions, not so much to set forth the greatness of our suffering, as
the greatness of the mercy of God.
