### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#001)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa2 10:0</span></span>

([Sa2 10:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#001)) David's messengers
ill-treated by Hanun.

([Sa2 10:6-14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#006)) The Ammonites defeated.

([Sa2 10:15-19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#015)) The Syrians defeated.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 10:1</span></span>

Nahash had been an enemy to Israel, yet had showed kindness to David.
David therefore resolves gratefully to return it. If a Pharisee gives
alms in pride, though God will not reward it, yet he that receives the
alms ought to return thanks for it. Those who bear ill-will to their
neighbours, are resolved not to believe that their neighbours bear any
good-will to them. There is nothing so well meant, but it may be ill
interpreted, and is wont to be so, by men who love nobody but
themselves. The best men must not think it strange if they are thus
misrepresented. Charity thinketh no evil. According to the usages of
those days and countries, Hanun treated David's ambassadors in the most
contemptuous manner. David showed much concern for his servants. Let us
learn not to lay unjust reproaches to heart; they will wear off, and
turn only to the shame of those who utter or do them; while the
reputation wrongfully hurt in a little time grows again, as these beards
did. God will bring forth thy righteousness as the light, therefore wait
patiently for him, [Psa 37:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#006), [Psa
37:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#007).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa2 10:6</span></span>

They that are at war with the Son of David, not only give the
provocation, but begin the war. God has forces to send against those
that set his wrath at defiance, [Isa
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#019), which will convince them that
none ever hardened his heart against God, and prospered. Christ's
soldiers should strengthen one another's hands in their spiritual
warfare. Let nothing be wanting in us, whatever the success be. When we
make conscience of doing our duty, we may, with satisfaction, leave the
event with God, assuredly hoping for his salvation in his own way and
time.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa2 10:15</span></span>

Here is a new attempt of the Syrians. Even the baffled cause will make
head as long as there is any life in it; the enemies of the Son of David
do so. But now the promise made to Abraham, [Gen
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#018), and repeated to Joshua, [Jos
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#004), that the borders of Israel should
extend to the river Euphrates, was performed. Learn hence, that it is
dangerous to help those who have God against them; for when they fall,
their helpers will fall with them.
