<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#001">Ch2 5:1-10</A>) The ark placed in the temple.
<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#011">Ch2 5:11-14</A>) The temple filled with glory.

<p>The ark was a type of Christ, and, as such, a token of the presence of God. That gracious promise, Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world, does, in effect, bring the ark into our religious assemblies, if we by faith and prayer plead that promise; and this we should be most earnest for. When Christ is formed in a soul, the law written in the heart, the ark of the covenant settled there, so that it becomes the temple of the Holy Ghost, there is true satisfaction in that soul. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#011">2 Chronicles 5:11</A></p>

<p>God took possession of the temple; he filled it with a cloud. Thus he signified his acceptance of this temple, to be the same to him that the tabernacle of Moses was, and assured his people that he would be the same in it. Would we have God dwell in our hearts, we must leave room for him; every thing else must give way. The Word was made flesh; and when he comes to his temple, like a refiner's fire, who may abide the day of his coming? May he prepare us for that day.
