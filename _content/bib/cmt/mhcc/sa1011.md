### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#001)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa1 11:0</span></span>

([Sa1 11:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#001)) Jabesh-gilead
delivered.

([Sa1 11:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#012)) Saul confirmed in his
kingdom.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 11:1</span></span>

The first fruit of Saul's government was the rescue of Jabesh-gilead
from the Ammonites. To save their lives, men will part with liberty, and
even consent to have their eyes put out; is it then no wisdom to part
with that sin which is as dear to us as our right eye, rather than to be
cast into hell-fire? See the faith and confidence of Saul, and, grounded
thereon, his courage and resolution. See also his activity in this
business. When the Spirit of the Lord comes upon men, it will make them
expert, even without experience. When zeal for the glory of God, and
love for the brethren, urge men to earnest efforts, and when God is
pleased to help, great effects may speedily be produced.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa1 11:12</span></span>

They now honoured Saul whom they had despised; and if an enemy be made a
friend, that is more to our advantage than to have him slain. The once
despised Saviour will at length be acknowledged by all as the Lord's own
anointed king. As yet, upon his mercy-seat, he receives the submission
of rebels, and even pleads their cause; but shortly, from his righteous
tribunal, he will condemn all who persist in opposing him.
