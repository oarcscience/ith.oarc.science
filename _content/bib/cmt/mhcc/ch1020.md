David's wars.

[1 Chronicles 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1020.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 20:1</span></span>

Though the Lord will severely correct the sins of his believing people,
he will not leave them in the hands of their enemies. His assistance
will overcome all advantages of number and strength of those that defy
his Israel. All that trust in Christ, shall be made more than conquerors
through him that loveth them.
