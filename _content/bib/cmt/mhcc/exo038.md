### [Exodus Chapter 38](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#001)

[Exodus](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">exo 38:0</span></span>

([Exo 38:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#001)) The brazen altar and
laver.

([Exo 38:9-20](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#009)) The court.

([Exo 38:21-31](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#021)) The offerings of the
people.

[Exodus 38:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 38:1</span></span>

In all ages of the church there have been some persons more devoted to
God, more constant in their attendance upon his ordinances, and more
willing to part even with lawful things, for his sake, than others. Some
women, devoted to God and zealous for the tabernacle worship, expressed
zeal by parting with their mirrors, which were polished plates of brass.
Before the invention of looking-glasses, these served the same purposes.

[Exodus 38:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">exo 38:9</span></span>

The walls of the court being of curtains only, intimated that the state
of the Jewish church itself was movable and changeable; and in due time
to be taken down and folded up, when the place of the tent should be
enlarged, and its cords lengthened, to make room for the Gentile world.

[Exodus 38:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">exo 38:21</span></span>

The foundation of massy pieces of silver showed the solidity and purity
of the truth upon which the church is founded. Let us regard the Lord
Jesus Christ while reading of the furniture of the tabernacle. While
looking at the altar of burnt-offering, let us see Jesus. In him, his
righteousness, and salvation, is a full and sufficient offering for sin.
In the laver of regeneration, by his Holy Spirit, let our souls be
washed, and they shall be clean; and as the people offered willingly, so
may our souls be made willing. Let us be ready to part with any thing,
and count all but loss to win Christ.
