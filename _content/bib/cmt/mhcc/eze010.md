### [Ezekiel Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#001)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 10:0</span></span>

([Eze 10:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#001)) A vision of the burning
of the city.

([Eze 10:8-22](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#008)) The Divine glory
departing from the temple.

[Ezekiel 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 10:1</span></span>

The fire being taken from between the wheels, under the cherubim, [Eze
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#013), seems to have signified the
wrath of God to be executed upon Jerusalem. It intimated that the fire
of Divine wrath, which kindles judgment upon a people, is just and holy;
and in the great day, the earth, and all the works that are therein,
will be burnt up.

[Ezekiel 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 10:8</span></span>

Ezekiel sees the working of Divine providence in the government of the
lower world, and the affairs of it. When God is leaving a people in
displeasure, angels above, and all events below, further his departure.
The Spirit of life, the Spirit of God, directs all creatures, in heaven
and on earth, so as to make them serve the Divine purpose. God removes
by degrees from a provoking people; and, when ready to depart, would
return to them, if they were a repenting, praying people. Let this warn
sinners to seek the Lord while he may be found, and to call on him while
he is near, and cause us all to walk humbly and watchfully with our God.
