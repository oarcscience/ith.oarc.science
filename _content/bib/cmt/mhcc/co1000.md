[1 Corinthians](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#001)

The Corinthian church contained some Jews, but more Gentiles, and the
apostle had to contend with the superstition of the one, and the sinful
conduct of the other. The peace of this church was disturbed by false
teachers, who undermined the influence of the apostle. Two parties were
the result; one contending earnestly for the Jewish ceremonies, the
other indulging in excesses contrary to the gospel, to which they were
especially led by the luxury and the sins which prevailed around them.
This epistle was written to rebuke some disorderly conduct, of which the
apostle had been apprized, and to give advice as to some points whereon
his judgment was requested by the Corinthians. Thus the scope was
twofold. 1. To apply suitable remedies to the disorders and abuses which
prevailed among them. 2. To give satisfactory answers on all the points
upon which his advice had been desired. The address, and Christian
mildness, yet firmness, with which the apostle writes, and goes on from
general truths directly to oppose the errors and evil conduct of the
Corinthians, is very remarkable. He states the truth and the will of
God, as to various matters, with great force of argument and animation
of style.
