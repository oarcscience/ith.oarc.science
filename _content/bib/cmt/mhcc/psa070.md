### [Psalms Chapter 70](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 70:0</span></span>

The speedy destruction of the wicked, and the preservation of the godly.

[Psalms 70:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 70:1</span></span>

This psalm is almost the same as the last five verses of Psalms 40.
While here we behold Jesus Christ set forth in poverty and distress, we
also see him denouncing just and fearful punishment on his Jewish,
heathen, and antichristian enemies; and pleading for the joy and
happiness of his friends, to his Father's honour. Let us apply these
things to our own troubled circumstances, and in a believing manner
bring them, and the sinful causes thereof, to our remembrance. Urgent
trials should always awake fervent prayers.
