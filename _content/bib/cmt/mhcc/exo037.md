### [Exodus Chapter 37](../../../bib/kjv/exo037.htm#001)

[Exodus](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">exo 37:0</span></span>

The making of the ark, and the furniture of the tabernacle.

[Exodus 37:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo037.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 37:1</span></span>

In the furniture of the tabernacle were emblems of a spiritual and
acceptable service. The incense represented the prayers of the saints.
The sacrifice of the alter represented the Lamb of God that taketh away
the sins of the world. The golden pot with manna, or bread from heaven,
the flesh of Jesus Christ, which he gave for the life of the world. The
candlestick, with its lights, the teaching and enlightening of the Holy
Spirit. The shew-bread represented that provision for those who hunger
and thirst after righteousness, which the gospel, the ordinances and the
sacraments of the house of prayer, abundantly bestow. The exactness of
the workmen to their rule, should be followed by us; seeking for the
influences of the Holy Spirit, that we may rejoice in and glorify God
while in this world, and at length be with him for ever.
