<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#001">Jdg 4:1-3</A>) Israel again revolts, and is oppressed by Jabin.
<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#004">Jdg 4:4-9</A>) Deborah concerts their deliverance with Barak.
<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#010">Jdg 4:10-16</A>) Sisera defeated.
<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#017">Jdg 4:17-24</A>) Sisera put to death by Jael. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#001">Judges 4:1</A></p>

<p>The land had rest for eighty years, which should have confirmed them in their religion; but it made them secure, and indulge their lusts. Thus the prosperity of fools destroys them. Jabin and his general Sisera, mightily oppressed Israel. This enemy was nearer than any of the former. Israel cried unto the Lord, when distress drove them to him, and they saw no other way of relief. Those who slight God in prosperity, will find themselves under a necessity of seeking him in trouble. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#004">Judges 4:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">jdg 4:4</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Deborah was a prophetess; one instructed in Divine knowledge by the inspiration of the Spirit of God. She judged Israel as God's mouth to them; correcting abuses, and redressing grievances. By God's direction, she ordered Barak to raise an army, and engage Jabin's forces. Barak insisted much upon her presence. Deborah promised to go with him. She would not send him where she would not go herself. Those who in God's name call others to their duty, should be ready to assist them in it. Barak values the satisfaction of his mind, and the good success of his enterprise, more than mere honour. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#010">Judges 4:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">jdg 4:10</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Sisera's confidence was chiefly in his chariots. But if we have ground to hope that God goes before us, we may go on with courage and cheerfulness. Be not dismayed at the difficulties thou meetest with in resisting Satan, in serving God, or suffering for him; for is not the Lord gone before thee? Follow him then fully. Barak went down, though upon the plain the iron chariots would have advantage against him: he quitted the mountain in dependence on the Divine power; for in the Lord alone is the salvation of his people, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#023">Jer 3:23</A>. He was not deceived in his confidence. When God goes before us in our spiritual conflicts, we must bestir ourselves; and when, by his grace, he gives us some success against the enemies of our souls, we must improve it by watchfulness and resolution. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#017">Judges 4:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">jdg 4:17</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Sisera's chariots had been his pride and his confidence. Thus are those disappointed who rest on the creature; like a broken reed, it not only breaks under them, but pierces them with many sorrows. The idol may quickly become a burden, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#001">Isa 46:1</A>; what we were sick for, God can make us sick of. It is probable that Jael really intended kindness to Sisera; but by a Divine impulse she was afterwards led to consider him as the determined enemy of the Lord and of his people, and to destroy him. All our connexions with God's enemies must be broken off, if we would have the Lord for our God, and his people for our people. He that had thought to have destroyed Israel with his many iron chariots, is himself destroyed with one iron nail. Thus the weak things of the world confound the mighty. The Israelites would have prevented much mischief, if they had sooner destroyed the Canaanites, as God commanded and enabled them: but better be wise late, and buy wisdom by experience, than never be wise.
