### [Job Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#001)

[Job](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">job 26:0</span></span>

([Job 26:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#001)) Job reproves Bildad.

([Job 26:5-14](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#005)) Job acknowledges the
power of God.

[Job 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 26:1</span></span>

Job derided Bildad's answer; his words were a mixture of peevishness and
self-preference. Bildad ought to have laid before Job the consolations,
rather than the terrors of the Almighty. Christ knows how to speak what
is proper for the weary, [Isa 50:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#004);
and his ministers should not grieve those whom God would not have made
sad. We are often disappointed in our expectations from our friends who
should comfort us; but the Comforter, the Holy Ghost, never mistakes,
nor fails of his end.

[Job 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 26:5</span></span>

Many striking instances are here given of the wisdom and power of God,
in the creation and preservation of the world. If we look about us, to
the earth and waters here below, we see his almighty power. If we
consider hell beneath, though out of our sight, yet we may conceive the
discoveries of God's power there. If we look up to heaven above, we see
displays of God's almighty power. By his Spirit, the eternal Spirit that
moved upon the face of the waters, the breath of his mouth, [Psa
33:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#006), he has not only made the
heavens, but beautified them. By redemption, all the other wonderful
works of the Lord are eclipsed; and we may draw near, and taste his
grace, learn to love him, and walk with delight in his ways. The ground
of the controversy between Job and the other disputants was, that they
unjustly thought from his afflictions that he must have been guilty of
heinous crimes. They appear not to have duly considered the evil and
just desert of original sin; nor did they take into account the gracious
designs of God in purifying his people. Job also darkened counsel by
words without knowledge. But his views were more distinct. He does not
appear to have alleged his personal righteousness as the ground of his
hope towards God. Yet what he admitted in a general view of his case, he
in effect denied, while he complained of his sufferings as unmerited and
severe; that very complaint proving the necessity for their being sent,
in order to his being further humbled in the sight of God.
