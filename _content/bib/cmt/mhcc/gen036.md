### [Genesis Chapter 36](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#001)

[Genesis](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001)

Esau and his descendants.

[Genesis 36:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 36:1</span></span>

The registers in this chapter show the faithfulness of God to his
promise to Abraham. Esau is here called Edom, that name which kept up
the remembrance of his selling his birth-right for a mess of pottage.
Esau continued the same profane despiser of heavenly things. In outward
prosperity and honour, the children of the covenant are often behind,
and those that are out of the covenant get the start. We may suppose it
a trial to the faith of God's Israel, to hear of the pomp and power of
the kings of Edom, while they were bond-slaves in Egypt; but those that
look for great things from God, must be content to wait for them; God's
time is the best time. Mount Seir is called the land of their
possession. Canaan was at this time only the land of promise. Seir was
in the possession of the Edomites. The children of this world have their
all in hand, and nothing in hope, [Luk
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#025); while the children of God have
their all in hope, and next to nothing in hand. But, all things
considered, it is beyond compare better to have Canaan in promise, than
mount Seir in possession.
