### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#001)

[4 Kings (2 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">kg2 11:0</span></span>

([Kg2 11:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#001)) Athaliah usurps the
government of Judah, Jehoash made king.

([Kg2 11:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#013)) Athaliah put to death.

([Kg2 11:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#017)) The worship of the
Lord restored.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 11:1</span></span>

Athaliah destroyed all she knew to be akin to the crown. Jehoash, one of
the king's sons, was hid. Now was the promise made to David bound up in
one life only, and yet it did not fail. Thus to the Son of David, the
Lord, according to his promise, will secure a spiritual seed, hidden
sometimes, and unseen, but hidden in God's pavilion, and unhurt. Six
years Athaliah tyrannized. Then the king was brought forward. A child
indeed, but he had a good guardian, and, what was better, a good God to
go to With such joy and satisfaction must the kingdom of Christ be
welcomed into our hearts, when his throne is set up there, and Satan the
usurper is cast out. Say, Let the King, even Jesus, live, for ever live
and reign in my soul, and in all the world.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg2 11:13</span></span>

Athaliah hastened her own destruction. She herself was the greatest
traitor, and yet was first and loudest in crying, Treason, treason! The
most guilty are commonly the most forward to reproach others.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg2 11:17</span></span>

King and people would cleave most firmly to each other, when both had
joined themselves to the Lord. It is well with a people, when all the
changes that pass over them help to revive, strengthen, and advance the
interests of religion among them. Covenants are of use, both to remind
us of, and bind us to, the duties already binding on us. They
immediately abolished idolatry; and, pursuant to the covenant with one
another, they expressed mutual readiness to help each other. The people
rejoiced, and Jerusalem was quiet. The way for people to be joyful and
at peace, is to engage fully in the service of God; for the voice of joy
and thanksgiving is in the dwellings of the righteous, but there is no
peace for the wicked.
