### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#001)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa1 20:0</span></span>

([Sa1 20:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#001)) David consults
Jonathan.

([Sa1 20:11-23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#011)) Jonathan's covenant
with David.

([Sa1 20:24-34](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#024)) Saul, missing David,
seeks to kill Jonathan.

([Sa1 20:35-42](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#035)) Jonathan takes leave
of David.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 20:1</span></span>

The trials David met with, prepared him for future advancement. Thus the
Lord deals with those whom he prepares unto glory. He does not put them
into immediate possession of the kingdom, but leads them to it through
much tribulation, which he makes the means of fitting them for it. Let
them not murmur at his gracious appointment, nor distrust his care; but
let them look forward with joyful expectation to the crown which is laid
up for them. Sometimes it appears to us that there is but a step between
us and death; at all times it may be so, and we should prepare for the
event. But though dangers appear most threatening, we cannot die till
the purpose of God concerning us is accomplished; nor till we have
served our generation according to his will, if we are believers.
Jonathan generously offers David his services. This is true friendship.
Thus Christ testifies his love to us, Ask, and it shall be done for you;
and we must testify our love to him, by keeping his commandments.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa1 20:11</span></span>

Jonathan faithfully promises that he would let David know how he found
his father affected towards him. It will be kindness to ourselves and to
ours, to secure an interest in those whom God favours, and to make his
friends ours. True friendship rests on a firm basis, and is able to
silence ambition, self-love, and undue regard for others. But who can
fully understand the love of Jesus, who gave himself as a sacrifice for
rebellious, polluted sinners! how great then ought to be the force and
effects of our love to him, to his cause, and his people!

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">sa1 20:24</span></span>

None were more constant than David in attending holy duties; nor had he
been absent, but self-preservation obliged him to withdraw. In great
peril present opportunities for Divine ordinances may be waved. But it
is bad for us, except in case of necessity, to omit any opportunity of
statedly attending on them. Jonathan did wisely and well for himself and
family, to secure an interest in David, yet for this he is blamed. It is
good to take God's people for our people. It will prove to our advantage
at last, however it may now be thought against our interest. Saul was
outrageous. What savage beasts, and worse, does anger make men!

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 20:35](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">sa1 20:35</span></span>

The separation of two such faithful friends was grievous to both, but
David's case was the more deplorable, for David was leaving all his
comforts, even those of God's sanctuary. Christians need not sorrow, as
men without hope; but being one with Christ, they are one with each
other, and will meet in his presence ere long, to part no more; to meet
where all tears shall be wiped from their eyes.
