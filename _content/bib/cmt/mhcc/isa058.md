### [Isaiah Chapter 58](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#001)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 58:0</span></span>

([Isa 58:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#001), [Isa
58:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#002)) Hypocrisy reproved.

([Isa 58:3-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#003)) A counterfeit and a
true fast, with promises to real godliness, and.

([Isa 58:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#013), [Isa
58:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#014)) To the keeping the sabbath.

[Isaiah 58:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 58:1</span></span>

The Holy Spirit had hypocrites of every age in view. Self-love and timid
Christians may say, Spare thyself; dislike to the cross and other
motives will say, "Spare the rich and powerful;" but God says, "Spare
not:" and we must obey God, not men. We all need earnestly to pray for
God's assistance in examining ourselves. Men may go far toward heaven,
yet come short; and they may go to hell with a good reputation.

[Isaiah 58:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 58:3</span></span>

A fast is a day to afflict the soul; if it does not express true sorrow
for sin, and does not promote the putting away of sin, it is not a fast.
These professors had shown sorrow on stated or occasioned fasts. But
they indulged pride, covetousness, and malignant passions. To be liberal
and merciful is more acceptable to God than mere fasting, which, without
them, is vain and hypocritical. Many who seem humble in God's house, are
hard at home, and harass their families. But no man's faith justifies,
which does not work by love. Yet persons, families, neighbourhoods,
churches, or nations, show repentance and sorrow for sin, by keeping a
fast sincerely, and, from right motives, repenting, and doing good
works. The heavy yoke of sin and oppression must be removed. As sin and
sorrow dry the bones and weaken the strongest human constitution; so the
duties of kindness and charity strengthen and refresh both body and
mind. Those who do justly and love mercy, shall have the comfort, even
in this world. Good works will bring the blessing of God, provided they
are done from love to God and man, and wrought in the soul by the Holy
Spirit.

[Isaiah 58:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 58:13</span></span>

The sabbath is a sign between God and his professing people; his
appointing it is a sign of his favour to them; and their observing it is
a sign of their obedience to him. We must turn from travelling on that
day; from doing our pleasure on that holy day, without the control and
restraint of conscience; or from indulging in the pleasures of sense. On
sabbath days we must not follow our callings, or our pleasures. In all
we say and do, we must put a difference between this day and other days.
Even in Old Testament times the sabbath was called the Lord's day, and
is fitly called so still; and for a further reason, it is the Lord
Christ's day, [Rev 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#010). If we thus
remember the sabbath day to keep it holy, we shall have the comfort and
profit of it, and have reason to say, It is good to draw near to God.
