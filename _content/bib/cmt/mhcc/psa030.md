### [Psalms Chapter 30](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 30:0</span></span>

([Psa 30:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#001)) Praise to God for
deliverance.

([Psa 30:6-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#006)) Others encouraged by
his example.

[Psalms 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 30:1</span></span>

The great things the Lord has done for us, both by his providence and by
his grace, bind us in gratitude to do all we can to advance his kingdom
among men, though the most we can do is but little. God's saints in
heaven sing to him; why should not those on earth do the same? Not one
of all God's perfections carries in it more terror to the wicked, or
more comfort to the godly, than his holiness. It is a good sign that we
are in some measure partakers of his holiness, if we can heartily
rejoice at the remembrance of it. Our happiness is bound up in the
Divine favour; if we have that, we have enough, whatever else we want;
but as long as God's anger continues, so long the saints' weeping
continues.

[Psalms 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 30:6</span></span>

When things are well with us, we are very apt to think that they will
always be so. When we see our mistake, it becomes us to think with shame
upon our carnal security as our folly. If God hide his face, a good man
is troubled, though no other calamity befall him. But if God, in wisdom
and justice, turn from us, it will be the greatest folly if we turn from
him. No; let us learn to pray in the dark. The sanctified spirit, which
returns to God, shall praise him, shall be still praising him; but the
services of God's house cannot be performed by the dust; it cannot
praise him; there is none of that device or working in the grave, for it
is the land of silence. We ask aright for life, when we do so that we
may live to praise him. In due time God delivered the psalmist out of
his troubles. Our tongue is our glory, and never more so than when
employed in praising God. He would persevere to the end in praise,
hoping that he should shortly be where this would be the everlasting
work. But let all beware of carnal security. Neither outward prosperity,
nor inward peace, here, are sure and lasting. The Lord, in his favour,
has fixed the believer's safety firm as the deep-rooted mountains, but
he must expect to meet with temptations and afflictions. When we grow
careless, we fall into sin, the Lord hides his face, our comforts droop,
and troubles assail us.
