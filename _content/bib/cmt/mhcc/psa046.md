### [Psalms Chapter 46](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 46:0</span></span>

([Psa 46:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#001)) Confidence in God.

([Psa 46:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#006)) An exhortation to
behold it.

[Psalms 46:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 46:1</span></span>

This psalm encourages to hope and trust in God; in his power and
providence, and his gracious presence with his church in the worst of
times. We may apply it to spiritual enemies, and the encouragement we
have that, through Christ, we shall be conquerors over them. He is a
Help, a present Help, a Help found, one whom we have found to be so; a
Help at hand, one that is always near; we cannot desire a better, nor
shall we ever find the like in any creature. Let those be troubled at
the troubling of the waters, who build their confidence on a floating
foundation; but let not those be alarmed who are led to the Rock, and
there find firm footing. Here is joy to the church, even in sorrowful
times. The river alludes to the graces and consolations of the Holy
Spirit, which flow through every part of the church, and through God's
sacred ordinances, gladdening the heart of every believer. It is
promised that the church shall not be moved. If God be in our hearts, by
his word dwelling richly in us, we shall be established, we shall be
helped; let us trust and not be afraid.

[Psalms 46:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 46:6</span></span>

Come and see the effects of desolating judgments, and stand in awe of
God. This shows the perfect security of the church, and is an assurance
of lasting peace. Let us pray for the speedy approach of these glorious
days, and in silent submission let us worship and trust in our almighty
Sovereign. Let all believers triumph in this, that the Lord of hosts,
the God of Jacob, has been, is, and will be with us; and will be our
Refuge. Mark this, take the comfort, and say, If God be for us, who can
be against us? With this, through life and in death, let us answer every
fear.
