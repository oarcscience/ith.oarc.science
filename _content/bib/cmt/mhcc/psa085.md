### [Psalms Chapter 85](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 85:0</span></span>

([Psa 85:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#001)) Prayers for the
continuance of former mercies.

([Psa 85:8-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#008)) Trust in God's
goodness.

[Psalms 85:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 85:1</span></span>

The sense of present afflictions should not do away the remembrance of
former mercies. The favour of God is the fountain of happiness to
nations, as well as to particular persons. When God forgives sin, he
covers it; and when he covers the sin of his people, he covers it all.
See what the pardon of sin is. In compassion to us, when Christ our
Intercessor has stood before thee, thou hast turned away thine anger.
When we are reconciled to God, then, and not till then, we may expect
the comfort of his being reconciled to us. He shows mercy to those to
whom he grants salvation; for salvation is of mere mercy. The Lord's
people may expect sharp and tedious afflictions when they commit sin;
but when they return to him with humble prayer, he will make them again
to rejoice in him.

[Psalms 85:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 85:8</span></span>

Sooner or later, God will speak peace to his people. If he do not
command outward peace, yet he will suggest inward peace; speaking to
their hearts by his Spirit. Peace is spoken only to those who turn from
sin. All sin is folly, especially backsliding; it is the greatest folly
to return to sin. Surely God's salvation is nigh, whatever our
difficulties and distresses are. Also, his honour is secured, that glory
may dwell in our land. And the truth of the promises is shown by the
Divine mercy in sending the Redeemer. The Divine justice is now
satisfied by the great atonement. Christ, the way, truth, and life,
sprang out of the earth when he took our nature upon him, and Divine
justice looked upon him well pleased and satisfied. For his sake all
good things, especially his Holy Spirit, are given to those who ask him.
Through Christ, the pardoned sinner becomes fruitful in good works, and
by looking to and trusting in the Saviour's righteousness, finds his
feet set in the way of his steps. Righteousness is a sure guide, both in
meeting God, and in following him.
