### [1 Chronicles Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#001)

[1 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001)

David's numbering the people.

[1 Chronicles 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 21:1</span></span>

No mention is made in this book of David's sin in the matter of Uriah,
neither of the troubles that followed it: they had no needful connexion
with the subjects here noted. But David's sin, in numbering the people,
is related: in the atonement made for that sin, there was notice of the
place on which the temple should be built. The command to David to build
an altar, was a blessed token of reconciliation. God testified his
acceptance of David's offerings on this altar. Thus Christ was made sin,
and a curse for us; it pleased the Lord to bruise him, that through him,
God might be to us, not a consuming Fire, but a reconciled God. It is
good to continue attendance on those ordinances in which we have
experienced the tokens of God's presence, and have found that he is with
us of a truth. Here God graciously met me, therefore I will still expect
to meet him.
