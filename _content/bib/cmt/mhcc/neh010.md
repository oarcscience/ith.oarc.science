### [Nehemiah Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#001)

[Nehemiah](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#001)

(v. 1-31) The covenant, Those who signed it.

([Neh 10:32-39](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#032)) Their engagement to
sacred rites.

[Nehemiah 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">neh 10:1</span></span>

Conversion is separating from the course and custom of this world,
devoting ourselves to the conduct directed by the word of God. When we
bind ourselves to do the commandments of God, it is to do all his
commandments, and to look to him as the Lord, and our Lord.

[Nehemiah 10:32](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">neh 10:32</span></span>

Having covenanted against the sins of which they had been guilty, they
obliged themselves to observe the duties they had neglected. We must not
only cease to do evil, but learn to do well. Let not any people expect
the blessing of God, unless they keep up public worship. It is likely to
go well with our houses, when care is taken that the work of God's house
goes on well. When every one helps, and every one gives, though but
little, toward a good work, the whole will come to be a large sum. We
must do what we can in works of piety and charity; and whatever state we
are placed in, cheerfully perform our duty to God, which will be the
surest way to ease and liberty. As the ordinances of God are the
appointed means of support to our souls, the believer will not grudge
the expense; yet most people leave their souls to starve.
