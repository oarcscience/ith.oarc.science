### [Joshua Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#001)

[Joshua](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jos 4:0</span></span>

([Jos 4:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#001)) Stones taken out of
Jordan.

([Jos 4:10-19](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#010)) The people pass through
Jordan.

([Jos 4:20-24](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#020)) The twelve stones
placed in Gilgal.

[Joshua 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 4:1</span></span>

The works of the Lord are so worthy of remembrance, and the heart of man
is so prone to forget them, that various methods are needful to refresh
our memories, for the glory of God, our advantage, and that of our
children. God gave orders for preparing this memorial.

[Joshua 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jos 4:10</span></span>

The priests with the ark did not stir till ordered to move. Let none be
weary of waiting, while they have the tokens of God's presence with
them, even the ark of the covenant, though it be in the depths of
adversity. Notice is taken of the honour put upon Joshua. Those are
feared in the best manner, and to the best purpose, who make it appear
that God is with them, and that they set him before them.

[Joshua 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jos 4:20</span></span>

It is the duty of parents to tell their children betimes of the words
and works of God, that they may be trained up in the way they should go.
In all the instruction parents give their children, they should teach
them to fear God. Serious godliness is the best learning. Are we not
called, as much as the Israelites, to praise the loving-kindness of our
God? Shall we not raise a pillar to our God, who has brought us through
dangers and distresses in so wonderful a way? For hitherto the Lord hath
helped us, as much as he did his saints of old. How great the stupidity
and ingratitude of men, who perceive not His hand, and will not
acknowledge his goodness, in their frequent deliverances!
