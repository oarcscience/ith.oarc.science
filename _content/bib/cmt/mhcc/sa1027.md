### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#001)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa1 27:0</span></span>

([Sa1 27:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#001)) David retires to Gath.

([Sa1 27:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#008)) David deceives Achish.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 27:1</span></span>

Unbelief is a sin that easily besets even good men, when without are
fightings, and within are fears; and it is a hard matter to get over
them. Lord, increase our faith! We may blush to think that the word of a
Philistine should go further than the word of an Israelite, and that the
city of Gath should be a place of refuge for a good man, when the cities
of Israel refuse him a safe abode. David gained a comfortable
settlement, not only at a distance from Gath, but bordering upon Israel,
where he might keep up a correspondence with his own countrymen.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 27:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa1 27:8</span></span>

While David was in the land of the Philistines, he attacked some remains
of the devoted nations. The people whom he cut off were long before
doomed to destruction. It is often wisdom to shun public notice, but we
must in no situation be idle. We must always try to do somewhat in the
cause of God. This expedition David hid from Achish. But an equivocation
which serves the purpose of a lie, is as like to it as a hypocrite is to
a profane person, it is only better in appearance, therefore more
dangerous. Yet, though believers often manifest imperfections, they can
never be prevailed upon to renounce the service of God, and to unite
interests with his enemies, or finally to become the servants of sin and
Satan. But what a train of evils follow from unbelief! When we forget
the Lord's past mercies, and his gracious assurances, we shall be
overwhelmed with desponding fears, and probably be led to adopt some
dishonourable method to get rid of our troubles. Nothing can so
effectually establish us in holy tempers and practices, and preserve us
from perplexities, as firm, unshaken dependence upon the promises of God
in Christ Jesus.
