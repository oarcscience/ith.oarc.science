### [Job Chapter 30](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#001)

[Job](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">job 30:0</span></span>

([Job 30:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#001)) Job's honour is turned
into contempt.

(v. 15-31) Job a burden to himself.

[Job 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 30:1</span></span>

Job contrasts his present condition with his former honour and
authority. What little cause have men to be ambitious or proud of that
which may be so easily lost, and what little confidence is to be put in
it! We should not be cast down if we are despised, reviled, and hated by
wicked men. We should look to Jesus, who endured the contradiction of
sinners.

[Job 30:15](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 30:15</span></span>

Job complains a great deal. Harbouring hard thoughts of God was the sin
which did, at this time, most easily beset Job. When inward temptations
join with outward calamities, the soul is hurried as in a tempest, and
is filled with confusion. But woe be to those who really have God for an
enemy! Compared with the awful state of ungodly men, what are all
outward, or even inward temporal afflictions? There is something with
which Job comforts himself, yet it is but a little. He foresees that
death will be the end of all his troubles. God's wrath might bring him
to death; but his soul would be safe and happy in the world of spirits.
If none pity us, yet our God, who corrects, pities us, even as a father
pitieth his own children. And let us look more to the things of
eternity: then the believer will cease from mourning, and joyfully
praise redeeming love.
