<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#001">Eze 13:1-9</A>) Heavy judgments against lying prophets.
<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#010">Eze 13:10-16</A>) The insufficiency of their work.
<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#017">Eze 13:17-23</A>) Woes against false prophetesses. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#001">Ezekiel 13:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">eze 13:1</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Where God gives a warrant to do any thing, he gives wisdom. What they delivered was not what they had seen or heard, as that is which the ministers of Christ deliver. They were not praying prophets, had no intercourse with Heaven; they contrived how to please people, not how to do them good; they stood not against sin. They flattered people into vain hopes. Such widen the breach, by causing men to think themselves deserving of eternal life, when the wrath of God abides upon them. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#010">Ezekiel 13:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">eze 13:10</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>One false prophet built the wall, set up the notion that Jerusalem should be victorious, and made himself acceptable by it. Others made the matter yet more plausible and promising; they daubed the wall which the first had built; but they would, ere long, be undeceived when their work was beaten down by the storm of God's just wrath; when the Chaldean army desolated the land. Hopes of peace and happiness, not warranted by the word of God, will cheat men; like a wall well daubed, but ill built. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#017">Ezekiel 13:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">eze 13:17</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>It is ill with those who had rather hear pleasing lies than unpleasing truths. The false prophetesses tried to make people secure, signified by laying them at ease, and to make them proud, signified by the finery laid on their heads. They shall be confounded in their attempts, and God's people shall be delivered out of their hands. It behoves Christians to keep close to the word of God, and in every thing to seek the teaching of the Holy Spirit. Let us so trust the promises of God as to keep his commandments.
