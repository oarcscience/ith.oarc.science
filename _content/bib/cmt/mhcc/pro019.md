<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 19:1</span></span>

A poor man who fears God, is more honourable and happy, than a man
without wisdom and grace, however rich or advanced in rank.

[Proverbs 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 19:2</span></span>

What good can the soul do, if without knowledge? And he sins who will
not take time to ponder the path of his feet.

[Proverbs 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 19:3</span></span>

Men run into troubles by their own folly, and then fret at the
appointments of God.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 19:6</span></span>

We are without excuse if we do not love God with all our hearts. His
gifts to us are past number, and all the gifts of men to us are fruits
of his bounty.

[Proverbs 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 19:7</span></span>

Christ was left by all his disciples; but the Father was with him. It
encourages our faith that he had so large an experience of the sorrows
of poverty.

[Proverbs 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 19:8</span></span>

evil with good.

[Proverbs 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 19:12</span></span>

Christ is a King, whose wrath against his enemies will be as the roaring
of a lion, and his favour to his people as the refreshing dew.

griefs where we promise ourselves the greatest comfort.

And this applies both to the present life and that which is to come.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 19:16</span></span>

If we keep God's word, God's word will keep us from every thing really
hurtful. We abuse the doctrine of free grace, if we think that it does
away the necessity and advantage of obedience. Those that live at random
must die. This truth is clearly taught in words enough to alarm the
stoutest sinner.

[Proverbs 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#017)

his kingdom.

[Proverbs 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#018)

Those that would be wise in their latter end, must be taught and ruled
when young.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 19:21</span></span>

What should we desire, but that all our purposes may agree with God's
holy will?

[Proverbs 19:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 19:22</span></span>

than to have ability for it, and want a heart to it.

The young man who wastes his father's substance, or makes his aged
mother destitute, is hateful, and will come to disgrace.

[Proverbs 19:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 19:27</span></span>

It is the wisdom of young men to dread hearing such talk as puts loose
and evil principles into the mind.

[Proverbs 19:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">pro 19:28</span></span>
