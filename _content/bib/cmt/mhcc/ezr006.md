### [Ezra Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#001)

[Ezra](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ezr 6:0</span></span>

([Ezr 6:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#001)) The decree for
completing the temple.

([Ezr 6:13-22](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#013)) The temple is finished.

[Ezra 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ezr 6:1</span></span>

When God's time is come for fulfilling his gracious purposes concerning
his church, he will raise up instruments to do it, from whom such good
service was not expected. While our thoughts are directed to this event,
we are led by Zechariah to fix our regard on a nobler, a spiritual
building. The Lord Jesus Christ continues to lay one stone upon another:
let us assist the great design. Difficulties delay the progress of this
sacred edifice. Yet let not opposition discourage us, for in due season
it will be completed to his abundant praise. He shall bring forth the
head-stone thereof with shoutings, crying, Grace, grace unto it.

[Ezra 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ezr 6:13</span></span>

The gospel church, that spiritual temple, is long in the building, but
it will be finished at last, when the mystical body is completed. Every
believer is a living temple, building up himself in his most holy faith:
much opposition is given to this work by Satan and our own corruptions.
We trifle, and proceed in it with many stops and pauses; but He that has
begun the good work, will see it performed. Then spirits of just men
will be made perfect. By getting their sins taken away, the Jews would
free themselves from the sting of their late troubles. Their service was
with joy. Let us welcome holy ordinances with joy, and serve the Lord
with gladness.
