<P><A NAME="fn_22"></A><A HREF="bap19.htm#fr_22">79:1</A> III. 2. <I>fin</I>. See the variants, which are difficult to explain. If the reading <I>et in manibus eorum scelera non extinguebantur</I> is right, the clause would be better placed after <I>opera malignitatum</I> in the next verse. "And God saw that in all the inhabiters of the earth works of wickedness were fulfilled, and in their hands," etc. I have preferred the other reading, the whole sentence will then refer to the new race who are to arise after the Flood, and especially to Moses (see IX. 8 <I>fin</I>.): the last preceding words ("their years shall be 120") do certainly apply to them and to him. The antediluvians are to perish utterly. See on XVI. 3.</P>
