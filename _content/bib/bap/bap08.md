### 7. FORM.

7\. As to the FORM, I suggest that the chief model which the author set
before himself was the Biblical *Book of Chronicles*. He begins
abruptly, as that does, with genealogies and with Adam: he introduces
from time to time short pieces of narrative, which rapidly increase in
importance until they occupy the whole field: he devotes much space to
speeches and prayers, and is fond of statements of numbers. His aim is
to supplement existing narratives, and he wholly passes over large
tracts of the history, occasionally referring to the Biblical books in
which further details are to be found: and it is to be noted that he
seems to place his own work on a level with them. "Are not these things
written in the book of" the Judges, or the Kings, is his formula, and it
is that of the Bible also. In all these respects he follows the
Chronicler: only, as has been said, we miss in him the liturgical and
priestly interest of that writer. Like the Chronicler, too, he is, and I
believe was from the first, anonymous; I can find no trace of an attempt
to personate any individual prophet, priest or scribe.
