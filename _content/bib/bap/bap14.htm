<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>There is more than one plausible way of dividing the book into episodes. The simplest is this--</P>
<P>1. Adam to the descent into Egypt, cc. I.-VIII.</P>
<P>2. Moses, IX.-XIX.</P>
<P>3. Joshua, XX.-XXIV.</P>
<P>4. The judges, XXV.-XLVIII.</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">. Samuel, Saul and David, XLIV-LXV.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_72"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 72</FONT></A></P>
<P>A more elaborate subdivision would be-</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Adam to Lamech, I.-II.<BR>
Noah and his descendants, III.-V.<BR>
Abraham to the death of Joseph, VI.-VIII.<BR>
The life of Moses, IX.-XIX.<BR>
Joshua, XX.-XXIV.<BR>
The Judges, the chief figures being--</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Kenaz, XXV.-XXVIII.<BR>
Zebul, XXIX.<BR>
Deborah, XXX.-XXXIII.<BR>
Aod, XXXIV.<BR>
Gideon, XXXV.-XXXVI.<BR>
Jair, XXXVIII.<BR>
Jephthah, XXXIX.-XL.<BR>
Abdon, Elon, XLI.<BR>
Samson, XLII.-XLIII.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>The events of the last chapters of the Book of Judges, XLIV.-XLVIII.<BR>
Life of Samuel, to the return of the ark, XLIX.-LV.<BR>
Saul's career, LVI.-LXV., David entering upon the scene in LIX.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>A third and more artificial method of division (which is followed to some extent by the MS. R) is into portions corresponding to the Biblical books, viz.--</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Genesis, I.-VIII.<BR>
Exodus, IX.-XIII.<BR>
Leviticus, part of XIII.<BR>
Numbers, XIV.-XVIII.<BR>
Deuteronomy, XIX.<BR>
Joshua, XX.-XXIV.<BR>
Judges, XXV.-XLVIII.<BR>
1 Samuel, XLIX.-LXV.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>The space allotted to the period of the Judges emerges as the striking feature. It is rather greater than that given to the Pentateuch and Joshua, and more than double the share of 1 Samuel. And of it almost a third part is devoted to the doings of a person practically unknown to the Bible, namely, Kenaz.</P>
