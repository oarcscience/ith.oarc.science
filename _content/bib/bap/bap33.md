| Num. 17 |

choosing of a tribe, and it was said unto Moses: *Take throughout every
tribe one rod and put them in the tabernacle, and then shall the rod of
him* to whomsoever my glory shall speak, *flourish, and I will take away
the murmuring from my people*. 2. And Moses did so and set 12 rods, and
the rod of Aaron came out, and put forth *blossom and yielded seed of
almonds*. 3. And this likeness which was born there was like unto the
work which Israel wrought while he was in Mesopotamia with Laban the
Syrian, when he took rods of almond, and put them at the gathering of
waters, and the cattle came to drink and were divided among the peeled
rods, and brought forth \[kids\] white and speckled and parti-coloured.

fore was the synagogue of the people made like unto a flock of sheep,
and as the cattle brought forth according to the almond rods, so was the
priesthood established by means of the almond rods.
