### 9. UNITY. CONTENTS.

9\. I have not raised the question of the UNITY of the book. No one has
as yet suggested that it is composite, and I am content to wait until, a
theory is broached. That there are inconsistencies in it I do not deny
(for instance, the story of Korah is told in two ways in XVI. and in
LVII.), but they are not of a kind that suggest a plurality of writers.
It may be that their presence here will furnish an argument against
dissection of other books based on the existence of similar
discrepancies.

As to the INTEGRITY of the text: We know that it is imperfect, and this
matter will be discussed at a later stage.

The CONTENTS will be found summarized in a synopsis at the end of the
Introduction.
