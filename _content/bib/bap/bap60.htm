Haste and go out hence, and come into my house wherein I dwell, and abide there to-day, and the, Lord shall shut up their heart before us, as he shut up the men of Sodom before the face of Lot. And he entered into the city and abode there that night. <TABLE ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="10%" CELLPADDING=8>

And he went out unto them and said to them: Are not they our brethren? Let us not deal evilly with them, lest our sins be multiplied against us.

And they entered in with violence and took out him and his concubine and cast them forth, and they, 'Let the man go, but they abused his concubine until she died; for she had transgressed against her husband at one time by sinning with the Amalekites, and therefore did the Lord God deliver her into the hands of sinners.</P>

And therefore because they were not provoked to anger, let their counsel <I>now</I> be vain and their heart moved, that they who allow evil may be consumed as well as the sinners.</P>
