<P><FONT SIZE="-1">A passage in Origen <I>On Romans</I> (IV. 12, p. 646) deserves to be quoted as being very much in the manner of Philo. "We have found," he says, "in a certain apocryphal book (in quodam secretiore libello) mention of an angel of grace who takes his name from grace, being called Ananchel, <I>i.e</I>. the grace of God: and the writing in question says that this angel was sent by God to Esther to give her favour in the sight of the king." just so in Philo appropriate angels are sent to Kenaz and to David and intervene to save the victims of Jair. I think it worth suggesting that the story of Esther found a place in <I>Philo</I>, and that this was the <I>secretior libellus</I> to which Origen refers.</FONT></P>
