<P>5. The ORIGINAL LANGUAGE of the book, its date, its form and its purpose, must now be discussed.</P>

<P>Original Language.--The Latin version, in which alone we possess the work, is quite obviously a translation from Greek. The forms of proper names, the occurrence of Greek words which puzzled the translator, <I>ometocea</I>, <I>pammixia</I>, <I>epomis</I>, etc., make this abundantly clear. It is hardly less plain that the Greek was a translation from Hebrew. As Dr. Cohn has pointed out, the whole complexion, and especially the connecting links of the narrative, are strongly Hebraic, and there is a marked absence of the Greek use of particles, or of any attempt to link sentences together save by the bald "et," which occurs an incredible number of times.</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Some statistics may be given: <I>Et factum est</I> occurs at least 33 times; <I>Et tum</I> (usually of the past) 37; <I>Tunc</I> 25; <I>Et nunc</I> (of present or future) 85; <I>In tempore illo</I> 18; <I>In diebus illis</I> (and the like) 10; <I>Et post haec</I>, or <I>postea</I> 30; <I>Ecce</I> 105; <I>Ecce nunc</I> 47; <I>Et ideo</I> 27; <I>Et erit cum</I>, or <I>si</I> 24. Other common links which I have not counted are <I>Et u</I>t (<I>uidit</I>, etc.), <I>Et cum</I>, <I>His dictis</I>, <I>Propterea</I>.</P>
<P>The leading Hebraisms are present: <I>adiicere</I>, or <I>apponere</I> with another verb, meaning "he did so yet again," 9 times at least; the intensive participle and verb (<I>Illuminans illuminaui</I>) 15 times. We have <I>Si</I> introducing a question 4 times; <I>a uiro usque ad mulierem</I> and the like (XXX. 4; XLVII. 10); ad uictoriam, in uictoria (= &#1500;&#1502;&#1504;&#1510;&#1495;, "Utterly"); IX. 3; XII. 6; XLIX. 6.</FONT></P>
<P>Hebraists, among whom I cannot reckon myself, may probably detect the presence of plays upon words, passages written in poetical form (some of which are indeed obvious), and mistranslations.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_10"></A><A HREF="#fn_10"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></P>

<P>From what has just been said it will be rightly gathered that the literary style of <I>Philo</I> is not its strong point. Indeed, it is exceedingly monotonous, full of repetitions and catchwords. The author's one device for obtaining an "effect" is to string together a number of high-sounding clauses, as he does, for example, in his repeated descriptions of the giving of the Law. As a narrator, he has another trick. An incident is often compared to another in the past (or future) history of Israel, and many times is an episode from that history related in a speech or prayer.</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Some of the recurrent phrases are: <I>I spake of old saying</I> about 25 times; <I>in vain</I>, or <I>not in vain</I> 14; <I>it is better for us to do</I> this <I>than</I> . . . 7; <I>not for our sakes, but for</I> . . . about 5 times; <I>who knoweth whether</I> 4; <I>dost thou not remember</I> 3; <I>To thy seed will I give this land</I> (or the like) 7-9; <I>the covenant which he made</I> 5-8; <I>I know that the people will sin</I> 8-9; <I>God's anger will not endure for ever</I> 10; <I>The Gentiles will say</I> 4-8; <I>I call heaven and earth to witness</I> 4-5; <I>in the last days</I> 4; <I>make straight your ways</I> 5-6; <I>corrupt</I> (your ways, etc.) 18; <I>remember or visit the world</I> 6; <I>be for a testimony</I> 10. Of single words <I>accipere</I> occurs 88 times in the first half of the text; <I>habitare</I>, <I>inhabitare</I> about 80 times in the whole text; <I>iniquitas</I> 33; <I>disponere</I> 37; <I>testamentum</I> 47; <I>ambulare</I> 21; <I>uia</I>, <I>uiae</I> 25; <I>adducere</I> 19; <I>seducere</I> 21; <I>saeculum</I> 27; <I>sempiternus</I> 15; <I>constituere</I> 20; <I>expugnare</I> 27; <I>zelari</I> 14; <I>illuminare</I> 12; <I>renunciare</I> 15.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_9"></A><A HREF="bap05.htm#fr_9">27:1</A> Pitra thought that the Latin versions of these were by the same hand: I cannot confirm this idea, and indeed incline to question its correctness.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_10"></A><A HREF="bap06.htm#fr_10">28:1</A> Of mistranslations I can only point to one. In VIII. 13 Visui appears as a proper name. It seems clearly to be a mistake for "and Isui." The error implies a Hebrew original: it is not found in the LXX. See the Appendix on Readings <I>in loc</I>.</P>
