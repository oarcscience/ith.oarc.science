<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">9. UNITY. CONTENTS.</H3>
<P>9. I have not raised the question of the UNITY of the book. No one has as yet suggested that it is composite, and I am content to wait until, a theory is broached. That there are inconsistencies in it I do not deny (for instance, the story of Korah is told in two ways in XVI. and in LVII.), but they are not of a kind that suggest a plurality of writers. It may be that their presence here will furnish an argument against dissection of other books based on the existence of similar discrepancies.</P>
<P>As to the INTEGRITY of the text: We know that it is imperfect, and this matter will be discussed at a later stage.</P>
<P>The CONTENTS will be found summarized in a synopsis at the end of the Introduction.</P>
