<p>LVI. (1) When the ten plagues with which the Egyptians were smitten commenced, &#7778;iqrops fled from Egypt to the city of Aqt&#275;s, in Greece, which he built as the Metropolis. There he established the throne of the kingdom of the So&#8216;anites, and became the first king of the Atinisim (Athenians)&#8212;<i>i.e.</i>, the &#7778;o&#8216;anites. After him there reigned seventeen kings and nineteen princes, until the reign of Cambyses, the son of Cyrus, King of Persia. (2) At the end of the Book of Joshua it is written, 'So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.' Joseph ben Gorion asserts in his book that when the heathen made a covenant, after shedding the blood of the calf and sprinkling it upon the ground, they used to say, 'Thus shall the blood of him who breaks this covenant which we have made be shed.' Joshua then issued a decree to the Israelites that they should pour water upon the ground instead of blood, to fulfil the command, 'Thou shalt not do according to their deeds.'</p>

<p>(4) Now, Danaus had fifty sons, and they took to them the fifty daughters of Egisates, their brother. But one day one of the brothers arose, and, killing all the others, reigned in their stead. (5) At that time, in the days of Othniel, Cadmus reigned in Thebes, and the city of Bi&#7789;anya (###) was built by Ta&#7717;pan&#7717;es. He first introduced the letters of the Greek writing. The city of Epira (###), now called Corinthus, was also then built by Sisipo. Minos, the son of Eoripi (###), reigned then in Crete</p>
