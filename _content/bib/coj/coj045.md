XLI\. (1) I also find that during the first temple, in the time of
Jotham, King of Judah, two brothers, Remus and Romilus, arose who were
the first kings of Rome. They reigned thirty-eight years. (2) I also
find in 'Ṣoḥer Tob' that their mother from the pains of travail died at
their birth, and that God appointed a she-wolf to suckle them until they
were grown up. Romulus built the city of Roma. He, the first king, then
appointed 100 elders as

counsellers. He also built a temple in Rome, and erected the walls of
Rome. (3) After him, Huma (Numa) Pompilios (\#\#\#) reigned for
forty-one years. This Huma Pompilios added two months to the year, viz.,
Januarius and Febrius (\#\#\#), for the Romans had originally but ten
months to the year. After him Tullus Ostilius (\#\#\#) reigned for
thirty-two years. This Tullus, King of Rome, was the first to clothe
himself in purple robes. (4) These are the seven kings that reigned in
Rome: 1. Romulus; 2. Numa Pompilius; 3. Tullus Ostilius; 4. Ancus
Marcus; 5. Tarquinius Priscus; 6. Servius (\#\#\#); 7. Tarquinus
(\#\#\#). Their rule over Rome lasted altogether 240 years. After them
Rome remained without a king for 464 years until the reign of Julius
Caesar.

\[Here finishes the 'Book of Genealogies.' I now commence the
'Chronicles of Moses, our Teacher.'
