*Chronicles of Jerahmeel*, by M. Gaster \[1899\], at Intangible Textual
Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

V. On the fifth day He brought forth from the waters all manner of
winged birds, male and female, all manner of locusts, and also the
Leviathan, a serpent which holds all the dwellers of the lower waters
between his two fins. The centre of the earth rests upon the huge
serpents, which form food for the Leviathan. Every day he opens his
mouth, and a huge serpent comes every day to feed him. It flies and
flutters and enters the mouth of Leviathan, while God sports with it, as
it is said, 'Thou hast created this Leviathan to sport with it.'
