XIX\. (1) The sages tell that the dead have a large habitation, in front
of which there flows a brook from the Garden of Eden, and by the side of
this brook is a field. On every Sabbath eve between the afternoon and
evening services the souls of the dead go forth from their secret abode
and eat on this field and drink from this brook, (2) and every Israelite
who drinks water between the afternoon and evening services of the
Sabbath robs the dead. When the congregation on Sabbath eve exclaim,
'Bless the Lord, who is blessed,' they return to their graves, and God
revives them, and causes them to stand upon their feet alive; (3) and
all the dead of Israel rest on the Sabbath, and all stand up alive from
their graves, and great multitudes come before God and sing praises unto
Him upon their graves, and going to the synagogues, prostrate

themselves before Him, as it is said, 'The pious exult in honour, and
they sing upon their resting-places.'

\(4\) Every Sabbath and every new moon they rise from their graves, and
coming before the Divine Presence, prostrate themselves before Him, as
it is said, 'And the people of the earth shall worship Me, on Sabbaths
and on the new moons.' What is meant by the people of the earth? Those
who are hidden in the earth, as it is written, 'And it shall come to
pass that on each new moon and upon each Sabbath all flesh shall come to
worship Me.'
