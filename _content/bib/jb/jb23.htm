<p align="center"><small><i>Parable of the Sower</i>.</small></p>  
<p>THE same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side.</p>  
<p>2 And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he went into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore.</p>  
<p><a name="page_59"><font size="1" color="green">p. 59</font></A></p>  
<p>3 And he spoke many things unto them in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went forth to sow;</p>  
<p>4 And when he sowed, some <i>seeds</i> fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up:</p>  
<p>5 Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth:</p>  
<p>6 And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.</p>  
<p>7 And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them:</p>  
<p>8 But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.</p>  
<p>9 Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>  
<p>10 &para; And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable.</p>  
<p>11 &para; Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.</p>  
<p>12 When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth <i>it</i> not, then cometh the</p>  
<p><a name="page_60"><font size="1" color="green">p. 60</font></A></p>  
<p>wicked <i>one</i>, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side.</p>  
<p>13 But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it;</p>  
<p>14 Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while; for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended.</p>  
<p>15 He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.</p>  
<p>16 But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth <i>it;</i> which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.</p>
