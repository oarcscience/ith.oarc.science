<p>THEN said he unto the disciples, it is impossible but that offences will come: but woe <i>unto him</i>, through whom they come!</p>  
<p><a name="page_104"><font size="1" color="green">p. 104</font></A></p>  
<p>2 It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones.</p>  
<p>3 &para; Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.</p>  
<p>4 And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee. saying, T repent; thou shalt forgive him.</p>  
<p>5 But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat?</p>  
<p>6 And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?</p>  
<p>7 Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I trow not.</p>  
<p>8 So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do.</p>  
<p>9 &para; And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he</p>  
<p><a name="page_105"><font size="1" color="green">p. 105</font></A></p>  
<p>answered them and said, The Kingdom of God cometh not with observation.</p>  
<p>10 And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.</p>  
<p>11 They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.</p>  
<p>12 Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;</p>  
<p>13 But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed <i>them</i> all.</p>  
<p>14 Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.</p>  
<p>15 In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his staff in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back.</p>  
<p>16 Remember Lot's wife.</p>  
<p>17 Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.</p>  
<p><a name="page_106"><font size="1" color="green">p. 106</font></A></p>  
<p>18 I tell you, in that night there shall be two <i>men</i> in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.</p>  
<p>19 Two <i>women</i> shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other left.</p>  
<p>20 Two <i>men</i> shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.</p>
