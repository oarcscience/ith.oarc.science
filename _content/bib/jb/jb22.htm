<p>AND as he spake a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with him: and he went in, and sat down to meat.</p>  
<p><a name="page_57"><font size="1" color="green">p. 57</font></A></p>  
<p>2 And when the Pharisee saw <i>it</i>, he marvelled that he had not first washed before dinner.</p>  
<p>3 And the Lord said unto him, Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness.</p>  
<p>4 <i>Ye</i> fools, did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also?</p>  
<p>5 But rather give alms of such things as ye have; and, behold, all things are clean unto you.</p>  
<p>6 But woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of God: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.</p>  
<p>7 Woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets.</p>  
<p>8 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are as graves which appear not, and the men that walk over <i>them</i> are not aware <i>of them</i>.</p>  
<p>9 Then answered one of the lawyers, and said unto him, Master, thus saying thou reproachest us also.</p>  
<p><a name="page_58"><font size="1" color="green">p. 58</font></A></p>  
<p>10 And he said, Woe unto you also, <i>ye</i> lawyers! for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers.</p>  
<p>11 Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered.</p>  
<p>12 And as he said these things unto them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to urge <i>him</i> vehemently, and to provoke him to speak of many things:</p>  
<p>13 Laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something out of his mouth, that they might accuse him.</p>
