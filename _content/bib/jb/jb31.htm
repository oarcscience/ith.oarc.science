<p align="center"><small><i>Parable of the Wicked Servant</i>.</small></p>  
<p>THEREFORE is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take ac count of his servants.</p>  
<p>2 And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents.</p>  
<p>3 But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.</p>  
<p>4 The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.</p>  
<p>5 Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt.</p>  
<p>6 But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellow-servants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took <i>him</i> by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest.</p>  
<p><a name="page_78"><font size="1" color="green">p. 78</font></A></p>  
<p>7 And his fellow-servant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.</p>  
<p>8 And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt.</p>  
<p>9 So when his fellow-servants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done.</p>  
<p>10 Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me;</p>  
<p>11 Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellow-servant, even as I had pity on thee?</p>  
<p>12 And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him.</p>  
<p>13 So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.</p>
