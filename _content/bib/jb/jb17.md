### XIII.

<span class="small">*A Woman Annointeth Him*.</span>

AND one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he
went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to meat.

2 And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew
that *Jesus* sat at meat in

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,

3 And stood at his feet behind *him* weeping, and began to wash his feet
with tears, and did wipe *them* with the hairs of her head, and kissed
his feet, and anointed *them* with the ointment.

4 Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw *it*, he spake within
himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who
and what manner of woman *this is* that toucheth him: for she is a
sinner.

5 And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto
thee. And he saith, Master, say on.

6 There was a. certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five
hundred pence, and the other fifty.

7 And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell
me therefore, which of them will love him most?

8 Simon [answered](errata.htm#1) and said, I suppose that he to whom he
forgave most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged.

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

9 And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this
woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet:
but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped *them* with the hairs
of her head.

10 Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath
not ceased to kiss my feet.

11 My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed
my feet with ointment.

12 Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven;
for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, *the same* loveth
little.

13 And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.

14 And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves,
Who is this that forgiveth sins also?

15 And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.
