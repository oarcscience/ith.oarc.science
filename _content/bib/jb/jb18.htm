<p>THERE came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing without, sent unto him, calling him.</p>  
<p>2 And the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee.</p>  
<p>3 And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, or my brethren?</p>

<p>13 &para; And one of the company said unto him, Master, speak to my brother, that he divide the inheritance with me.</p>  
<p>14 And he said unto him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?</p>
