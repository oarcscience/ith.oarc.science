### XII.

<span class="small">*Exhorts*.</span>

WHEN he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him.

2 And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round about
the villages, teaching.

3 ¶ Come unto me, all *ye* that labour and are heavy laden, and I will
give you rest.

4 Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in
heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.

5 For my yoke *is* easy, and my burden is light.
