### III.

<span class="small">*At Twelve Years of Age He Accompanies his Parents
to Jerusalem and Returns*.</span>

AND the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and
the grace of God was upon him.

2 And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the
custom of the feast.

3 And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child
Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not
*of it*.

4 But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day's
journey; and they sought him among *their* kinsfolk and acquaintance.

5 And when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem,
seeking him.

6 And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the
temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and
asking them questions.

7 And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and
answers.

8 And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto him,
Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have
sought thee sorrowing.

9 And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto
them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.

10 And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and
man.
