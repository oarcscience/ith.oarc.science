<p>THERE was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen and fared sumptuously every day:</p>  
<p>2 And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,</p>  
<p>3 And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.</p>  
<p>4 And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;</p>  
<p>5 And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.</p>  
<p>6 And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.</p>

<p>9 Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house:</p>  
<p>10 For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.</p>  
<p>11. Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.</p>  
<p>12 And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.</p>  
<p>13 And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.</p>
