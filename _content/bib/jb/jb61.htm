<p>THEN shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.</p>  
<p>2 And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.</p>  
<p>3 They that <i>were</i> foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:</p>  
<p>4 But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.</p>  
<p>5 While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.</p>  
<p>6 And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.</p>  
<p>7 Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.</p>  
<p>8 And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.</p>  
<p>9 But the wise answered, saying, <i>Not so;</i> lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.</p>

<p>10 And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.</p>  
<p>11 Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.</p>  
<p>12 But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.</p>  
<p>13 Watch, therefore, for ye know neither the clay nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.</p>
