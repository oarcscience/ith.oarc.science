<p>AND on the morrow, when they were come from Bethany, he was hungry:</p>  
<p>2 And they came to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money changers, and the seats of them that sold doves;</p>  
<p>3 And would not suffer that any man should carry <i>any</i> vessel through the temple.</p>  
<p>4 And he taught, saying unto them, Is it not written, My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer? but ye have made it a den of thieves.</p>  
<p>5 And the scribes and chief priests heard <i>it</i>, and sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, because all the people was astonished at his doctrine.</p>  
<p>6 And when even was come, he went out of the city.</p>
