THERE came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing without, sent
unto him, calling him.

2 And the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him, Behold, thy
mother and thy brethren without seek for thee.

3 And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, or my brethren?

4 And he looked round about on them which sat about him, and said,
Behold my mother and my brethren!

5 For whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and my
sister, and mother.

6 In the mean time, when there were gathered together an innumerable
multitude of people, insomuch that they trode one upon another, he began
to say unto his disciples first of all, Beware ye of the leaven of the

7 For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid,
that shall not be known.

8 Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the
light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be
proclaimed upon the housetops.

9 And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill the
body, and after that have no more that they can do.

10 But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which after he
hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him.

forgotten before God?

12 But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not
therefore; ye are of more value than many sparrows.

13 ¶ And one of the company said unto him, Master, speak to my brother,
that he divide the inheritance with me.

14 And he said unto him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?

15 And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a
man's life consisteth

not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.
