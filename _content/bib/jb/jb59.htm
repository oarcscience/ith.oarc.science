<p>AND ND Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his disciples came to <i>him</i> for to shew him the buildings of the temple.</p>  
<p><a name="page_134"><font size="1" color="green">p. 134</font></A></p>  
<p>2 And Jesus said unto them, See ye not all these things? verily I say unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.</p>  
<p>3 Then let them which be in Judea flee into the mountains:</p>  
<p>4 Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house:</p>  
<p>5 Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes.</p>  
<p>6 And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!</p>  
<p>7 But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day:</p>  
<p>8 For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.</p>  
<p>9 &para; Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer <i>is</i> nigh:</p>  
<p>10 So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near <i>even</i> at the doors.</p>  
<p>11 &para; But of that day and hour knoweth no <i>man</i>, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.</p>  
<p><a name="page_135"><font size="1" color="green">p. 135</font></A></p>  
<p>12 But as the days of Noe <i>were</i>, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.</p>  
<p>13 For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage until the day that Noe entered into the ark,</p>  
<p>14 And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.</p>  
<p>15 Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.</p>  
<p>16 <i>Two women shall be</i> grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left.</p>  
<p>17 Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.</p>  
<p>18 But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up.</p>  
<p>19 Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.</p>
