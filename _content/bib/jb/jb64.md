<span class="small">*A Woman Anointeth Him*.</span>

and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by
craft, and put *him* to death.

2 But they said, Not on the feast *day*, lest there be an uproar of the
people.

3 ¶ And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at
meat, there came a

woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious;
and she brake the box, and poured *it* on his head.

4 And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said,
Why was this waste of the ointment made?

5 For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, and
have been given to the poor. And they murmured against her.

6 And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a
good work on me.

7 For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do
them good: but me ye have not always.

8 She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my body
to the burying.
