<p align="center"><small><i>Parable of the Vineyard and Husbandmen</i>.</small></p>  
<p>HEAR another parable: There was a certain householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a wine-press in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country:</p>  
<p>2 And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husband-men of the fruit of the vineyard.</p>  
<p>3 And they caught <i>him</i>, and beat him, and sent <i>him</i> away empty.</p>  
<p>4 And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast stones, and wounded <i>him</i> in the head, and sent <i>him</i> away shamefully handled.</p>  
<p>5 And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others; beating some, and killing some.</p>  
<p>6 Having yet therefore one son, his well-beloved, he sent him also last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son.</p>  
<p><a name="page_123"><font size="1" color="green">p. 123</font></A></p>  
<p>7 But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours.</p>  
<p>8 And they took him, and killed <i>him</i> and cast <i>him</i> out of the vineyard.</p>  
<p>9 What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others.</p>  
<p>10 And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they perceived that he spake of them.</p>  
<p>11 But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude, because they took him for a prophet.</p>
