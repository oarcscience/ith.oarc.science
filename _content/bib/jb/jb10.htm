<p>AFTER this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.</p>  
<p>2 &para; And the Jews&#8217; passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem;</p>  
<p>3 And found in the temple those hat sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:</p>  
<p>4 And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers&#8217; money, and overthrew the tables;</p>  
<p>5 And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise.</p>
