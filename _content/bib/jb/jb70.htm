<p>WHEN Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilean.</p>  
<p>2 And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.</p>  
<p>3 &para; And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long <i>season</i>, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.</p>  
<p>4 Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.</p>  
<p>5 And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.</p>  
<p>6 And Herod with his men of war set him at naught, and mocked <i>him</i>, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.</p>  
<p>7 And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.</p>
