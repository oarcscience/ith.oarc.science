<p align="center"><i>Parable of the Talents</i>.</p>  
<p>FOR <i>the kingdom of heaven</i> is as a man travelling into a far country, <i>who</i> called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.</p>  
<p>2 And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.</p>  
<p>3 Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made <i>them</i> other five talents.</p>  
<p><a name="page_139"><font size="1" color="green">p. 139</font></A></p>  
<p>4 And likewise he that <i>had received</i> two, he also gained other two.</p>  
<p>5 But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money.</p>  
<p>6 After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.</p>  
<p>7 And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.</p>  
<p>8 His lord said unto him, Well done, <i>thou</i> good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</p>  
<p>9 He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.</p>  
<p>10 His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things; enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</p>  
<p>11 Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an</p>  
<p><a name="page_140"><font size="1" color="green">p. 140</font></A></p>  
<p>hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:</p>  
<p>12 And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, <i>there</i> thou hast <i>that is</i> thine.</p>  
<p>13 His lord answered and said unto him, <i>Thou</i> wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed:</p>  
<p>14 Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and <i>then</i> at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.</p>  
<p>15 Take therefore the talent from him, and give <i>it</i> unto him which hath ten talents.</p>  
<p>16 For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.</p>  
<p>17 And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</p>
