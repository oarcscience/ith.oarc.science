<p>AND he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;</p>  
<p>2 And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.</p>  
<p>3 For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.</p>  
<p>4 But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.</p>  
<p>5 &para; And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?</p>  
<p>6 <i>It is</i> like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:</p>  
<p>7 But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.</p>

<p>8 And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear it.</p>  
<p>9 But without a parable spake he not unto them; and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.</p>  
<p>10 &para; And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain <i>man</i> said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.</p>  
<p>11 And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air <i>have</i> nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay <i>his</i> head.</p>  
<p>12 And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.</p>  
<p>13 Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God.</p>  
<p>14 And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house.</p>  
<p>15 And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.</p>  
<p>16 &para; And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto him, Follow me.</p>  
<p><a name="page_67"><font size="1" color="green">p. 67</font></A></p>  
<p>17 And he left all, rose up, and followed him.</p>  
<p>18 And Levi made him a great feast in his own house; and it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at meat in his house, many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him.</p>  
<p>19 And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners?</p>  
<p>20 When Jesus heard <i>it</i>, he saith unto them, They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</p>
