<p align="center"><small><i>Parable of the Labourers in the Vineyard</i>.</small></p>  
<p>FOR the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man <i>that is</i> an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard.</p>  
<p>2 And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard.</p>  
<p>3 And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace,</p>  
<p>4 And said unto them: Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their way.</p>  
<p>5 Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise.</p>  
<p><a name="page_113"><font size="1" color="green">p. 113</font></A></p>  
<p>6 And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?</p>  
<p>7 They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, <i>that</i> shall ye receive.</p>  
<p>8 So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the labourers, and give them <i>their</i> hire, beginning from the last unto the first.</p>  
<p>9 And when they came that <i>were hired</i> about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny.</p>  
<p>10 But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny.</p>  
<p>11 And when they had received <i>it</i>, they murmured against the goodman of the house,</p>  
<p>12 Saying, These last have wrought <i>but</i> one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day.</p>  
<p><a name="page_114"><font size="1" color="green">p. 114</font></A></p>  
<p>13 But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong; didst thou not agree with me for a penny?</p>  
<p>14 Take <i>that</i> thine <i>is</i> and go thy way: I will give unto this last, even as unto thee.</p>  
<p>15 Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good?</p>  
<p>16 So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen.</p>
