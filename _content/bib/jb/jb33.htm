<p align="center"><small><i>The Feast of the Tabernacles</i>.</small></p>  
<p>NOW the Jews' feast of tabernacles was at hand.</p>  
<p>2 His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.</p>  
<p>3 For <i>there is</i> no man <i>that</i> doeth any thing in secret and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world.</p>  
<p>4 For neither did his brethren believe in him.</p>  
<p>5 Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready.</p>  
<p><a name="page_81"><font size="1" color="green">p. 81</font></A></p>  
<p>6 The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.</p>  
<p>7 Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast; for my time is not yet full come.</p>  
<p>8 When he had said these words unto them, he abode <i>still</i> in Galilee.</p>  
<p>9 &para; But when his brethren were gone up, then, went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.</p>  
<p>10 Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?</p>  
<p>11 And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people.</p>  
<p>12 Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.</p>  
<p>13 &para; Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.</p>  
<p>14 And the Jews marveled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?</p>  
<p>15 Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.</p>  
<p><a name="page_82"><font size="1" color="green">p. 82</font></A></p>  
<p>16 Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me?</p>  
<p>17 The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee?</p>  
<p>18 Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel.</p>  
<p>19 Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man.</p>  
<p>20 If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?</p>  
<p>21 Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.</p>  
<p>22 Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?</p>  
<p>23 But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?</p>  
<p>24 &para; The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.</p>  
<p><a name="page_83"><font size="1" color="green">p. 83</font></A></p>  
<p>25 So there was a division among the people because of him.</p>  
<p>26 And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.</p>  
<p>27 &para; Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?</p>  
<p>28 The officers answered, Never man spake like this man.</p>  
<p>29 Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?</p>  
<p>30 Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?</p>  
<p>31 But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.</p>  
<p>32 Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,)</p>  
<p>33 Doth our law judge <i>any</i> man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?</p>  
<p>34 They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.</p>  
<p>35 And every man went unto his own house.</p>
