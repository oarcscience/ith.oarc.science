<p align="center"><small><i>Mission of the Seventy</i>.</small></p>  
<p>AFTER these things the Lord appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, whither he himself would come.</p>  
<p>2 Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly <i>is</i> great, but the labourers <i>are</i> few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest.</p>  
<p>3 Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves.</p>  
<p>4 Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes: and salute no man by the way.</p>  
<p>5 And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to this house.</p>  
<p>6 And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it: if not, it shall turn to you again.</p>  
<p>7 And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the labourer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house.</p>  
<p>8 And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you:</p>  
<p><a name="page_80"><font size="1" color="green">p. 80</font></A></p>  
<p>9 But into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you not, go your ways out into the streets of the same, and say,</p>  
<p>10 Even the very dust of your city, which cleaveth on us, we do wipe off against you: notwithstanding be ye sure of this, that the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.</p>  
<p>11 But I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city.</p>
