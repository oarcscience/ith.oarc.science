<p>BUT when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd.</p>  
<p>2 &para; And he called <i>unto him</i> the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits;</p>  
<p>3 These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into <i>any</i> city of the Samaritans enter ye not:</p>  
<p>4 But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</p>  
<p>5 Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses,</p>  
<p><a name="page_70"><font size="1" color="green">p. 70</font></A></p>  
<p>6 Nor scrip for <i>your</i> journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat.</p>  
<p>7 And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, enquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence.</p>  
<p>8 And when you come into an house, salute it.</p>  
<p>9 And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.</p>  
<p>10 And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet.</p>  
<p>11 Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment, than for that city.</p>  
<p>12 &para; Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.</p>  
<p>13 But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues;</p>  
<p><a name="page_71"><font size="1" color="green">p. 71</font></A></p>  
<p>14 And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles.</p>  
<p>15 But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.</p>  
<p>16 Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.</p>  
<p>17 What I tell you in darkness, <i>that</i> speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the housetops.</p>  
<p>18 And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.</p>  
<p>19 Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.</p>  
<p>20 But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.</p>  
<p>21 Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.</p>  
<p><a name="page_72"><font size="1" color="green">p. 72</font></A></p>  
<p>22 And they went out, and preached that men should repent.</p>  
<p>23 &para; And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught.</p>
