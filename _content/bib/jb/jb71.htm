<p>AND Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,</p>  
<p>2 Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined <i>him</i> before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:</p>  
<p>3 No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.</p>  
<p>4 I will therefore chastise him, and release him.</p>  
<p>5 &para; Now at <i>that</i> feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would.</p>  
<p>6 And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.</p>  
<p>7 Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?</p>  
<p>8 For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.</p>

<p>9 &para; When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.</p>  
<p>10 But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.</p>  
<p>11 The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas.</p>  
<p>12 Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ? <i>They</i> all say unto him, Let him be crucified.</p>  
<p>13 And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.</p>  
<p>14 Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered <i>him</i> to be crucified.</p>
