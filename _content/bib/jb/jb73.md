### LXIX.

<span class="small">*His Burial*.</span>

THE Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies
should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath
day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken,
and *that* they might be taken away.

2 Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the
other which was crucified with him.

3 But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they
brake not his legs:

4 But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith
came there out blood and water.

5 ¶ And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but
secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away
the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave *him* leave. He came therefore, and
took the body of Jesus.

6 And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by
night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound
*weight*.

7 Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with
the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.

8 Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the
garden a new sepulchre, wherein never man yet laid.

9 There laid they Jesus: and rolled a great stone to the door of the
sepulchre, and departed.
