### XXVIII.

<span class="small">*Mission of the Seventy*.</span>

AFTER these things the Lord appointed other seventy also, and sent them
two and two before his face into every city and place, whither he
himself would come.

2 Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly *is* great, but the
labourers *are* few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he
would send forth labourers into his harvest.

3 Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves.

4 Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes: and salute no man by the
way.

5 And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to this house.

6 And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it: if
not, it shall turn to you again.

7 And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they
give: for the labourer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to
house.

8 And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such
things as are set before you:

9 But into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you not, go your
ways out into the streets of the same, and say,

10 Even the very dust of your city, which cleaveth on us, we do wipe off
against you: notwithstanding be ye sure of this, that the kingdom of God
is come nigh unto you.

11 But I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable in that day for
Sodom, than for that city.
