<p>THEN went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him in <i>his</i> talk.</p>  
<p>2 And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any <i>man:</i> for thou regardest not the person of men.</p>  
<p>3 Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not?</p>  
<p><a name="page_126"><font size="1" color="green">p. 126</font></A></p>  
<p>4 But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, <i>ye</i> hypocrites?</p>  
<p>5 Shew me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny.</p>  
<p>6 And he saith unto them, Whose <i>is</i> this image and superscription?</p>  
<p>7 They say unto him, Caesar's. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's.</p>  
<p>8 When they had heard <i>these words</i>, they marvelled, and left him and went their way.</p>  
<p>9 The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection, and asked him,</p>  
<p>10 Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.</p>  
<p>11 Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto his brother:</p>  
<p>12 Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh.</p>  
<p><a name="page_127"><font size="1" color="green">p. 127</font></A></p>  
<p>13 And last of all the woman died also.</p>  
<p>14 Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.</p>  
<p>15 Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.</p>  
<p>16 For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.</p>  
<p>17 But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,</p>  
<p>18 I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.</p>  
<p>19 And when the multitude heard <i>this</i>, they were astonished at his doctrine.</p>
