<p align="center"><small><i>His Crucifixion, Death, and Burial</i>.</small></p>  
<p>THEN the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of <i>soldiers</i>.</p>  
<p>2 And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put <i>it</i> upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!</p>  
<p>3 And they spit upon him, and took the reed and smote him on the head.</p>  
<p>4 And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify <i>him</i>.</p>  
<p>5 &para;j Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,</p>  
<p>6 Saying, I have sinned in that. I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What <i>is that</i> to us? see thou <i>to that</i>.</p>  
<p><a name="page_163"><font size="1" color="green">p. 163</font></A></p>  
<p>7 And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself.</p>  
<p>8 And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.</p>  
<p>9 And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in.</p>  
<p>10 Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day.</p>  
<p>11 &para; And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear <i>it</i> after Jesus.</p>  
<p>12 And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.</p>  
<p>13 But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.</p>  
<p>14 For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed <i>are</i> the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck.</p>  
<p><a name="page_164"><font size="1" color="green">p. 164</font></A></p>  
<p>15 Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.</p>  
<p>16 For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?</p>  
<p>17 &para; And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.</p>  
<p>18 And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called <i>the place</i> of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew, Golgotha:</p>  
<p>19 Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.</p>  
<p>20 &para; And Pilate wrote a title, and put <i>it</i> on the cross. And the writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.</p>  
<p>21 This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, <i>and</i> Greek, <i>and</i> Latin.</p>  
<p>22 Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.</p>  
<p>23 Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.</p>  
<p><a name="page_165"><font size="1" color="green">p. 165</font></A></p>  
<p>24 &para; Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also <i>his</i> coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.</p>  
<p>25 They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.</p>  
<p>26 &para; And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,</p>  
<p>27 And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest <i>it</i> in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.</p>  
<p>28 Likewise also the chief priests mocking <i>him</i>, with the scribes and elders, said,</p>  
<p>29 He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, add we will believe him.</p>  
<p>30 He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.</p>  
<p><a name="page_166"><font size="1" color="green">p. 166</font></A></p>  
<p>31 &para; And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.</p>  
<p>32 But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?</p>  
<p>33 And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.</p>  
<p>34 Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.</p>  
<p>35 &para; Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the <i>wife</i> of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.</p>  
<p>36 When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!</p>  
<p>37 Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own <i>home</i>.</p>  
<p>38 And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</p>  
<p><a name="page_167"><font size="1" color="green">p. 167</font></A></p>  
<p>39 Some of them that stood there, when they heard <i>that</i>, said, This <i>man</i> calleth for Elias.</p>  
<p>40 And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled <i>it</i> with vinegar, and put <i>it</i> on a reed, and gave him to drink.</p>  
<p>41 The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him.</p>  
<p>42 &para; Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.</p>  
<p>43 And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:</p>  
<p>44 Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's children.</p>
