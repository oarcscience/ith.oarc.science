# Septuagint

This is the main index for the Septuagint, the oldest Greek version of
the Jewish Bible. To view this section properly, you need to have a
Unicode font installed which has full polytonic Greek support. For more
information, refer to [this page](../../unicode).

This electronic text is derived from a version posted
[here](https://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/gopher/text/religion/biblical/lxxmorph/).
This was converted into Unicode at Intangible Textual Heritage using a
custom C program. The numbering in this text in some cases has gaps
between verses or chapters; this is so it will cross-reference correctly
with modern versions. [There is an automatically generated list of these
gaps here](../sepnote). One issue to note is that lines from Proverbs 30
and 31 are merged so that they form a continuous sequence to match the
other texts, instead of being split as they are in the traditional text.

There are three major codices of the Septuagint, the Codex Alexandrinus
(A), the Codex Vaticanus (B) and the Codex Sinaiticus (S). Each codex
has a different set of books, and in some cases (marked by the
appropriate letters), the version of the book varies between the
codices. In addition, there are variants of Bel and the Dragon, Daniel,
and Susanna, based on a translation by Theodotion (Th).
