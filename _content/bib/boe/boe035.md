2\. And thence I went over the summits of ⌈all⌉ these mountains, far
towards the east ⌈of the earth⌉, and passed above the Erythraean sea and
went far from it, and passed over ⌈⌈the angel⌉⌉ Zotîêl.

4\. ⌈That tree is in height like the fir, and its leaves are⌉ like
(those of) the Carob tree: and its fruit is like the clusters of the
vine, very beautiful: and the fragrance of the tree penetrates afar. 5.
Then I said: '⌈How⌉ beautiful is the tree, and how attractive is its
look!' 6. Then Raphael the holy angel, who was with me, answered me
⌈⌈and said⌉⌉: 'This is the tree of wisdom, of which thy father old (in
years) and thy aged mother, who were before thee, have eaten, and they
learnt wisdom and their eyes were opened, and they knew that they were
naked and they were driven out of the garden.'
