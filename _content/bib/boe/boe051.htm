<p align="CENTER">XLVIII. <i>The Fount of Righteousness; the Son of Man--the Stay of the Righteous: Judgement of the Kings and the Mighty</i>.</p> <h3 align="CENTER" align="center">CHAPTER XLVIII.</h3><dir> <dir>  
<p>1. And in that place I saw the fountain of righteousness<br> Which was inexhaustible:<br> And around it were many fountains of wisdom;</p> 
<p>And all the thirsty drank of them,<br> And were filled with wisdom,<br> And their dwellings were with the righteous and holy and elect.<br> 2. And at that hour that Son of Man was named In the presence of the Lord of Spirits,<br> And his name before the Head of Days.</p> 
<p>3. Yea, before the sun and the signs were created,<br> Before the stars of the heaven were made,<br> His name was named before the Lord of Spirits.</p> 
<p>4. He shall be a staff to the righteous whereon to stay themselves and not fall,<br> And he shall be the light of the Gentiles,<br> And the hope of those who are troubled of heart.</p> 
<p>5. All who dwell on earth shall fall down and worship before him,<br> And will praise and bless and celebrate with song the Lord of Spirits.</p> 
<p>6. And for this reason hath he been chosen and hidden before Him,<br> Before the creation of the world and for evermore.</p> 
<p>7. And the wisdom of the Lord of Spirits hath revealed him to the holy and righteous;<br> For he hath preserved the lot of the righteous,<br> Because they have hated and despised this world of unrighteousness,<br> And have hated all its works and ways in the name of the Lord of Spirits: <a name="page_67"><font size="1" color="green">p. 67</font></A><br> For in his name they are saved,<br> And according to his good pleasure hath it been in regard to their life.</p> 
<p>8. In these days downcast in countenance shall the kings of the earth have become,<br> And the strong who possess the land because of the works of their hands;</p> 
<p>For on the day of their anguish and affliction they shall not (be able to) save themselves.<br> 9. And I will give them over into the hands of Mine elect:</p> 
<p>As straw in the fire so shall they burn before the face of the holy:<br> As lead in the water shall they sink before the face of the righteous,<br> And no trace of them shall any more be found.</p> 
<p>10. And on the day of their affliction there shall be rest on the earth,<br> And before them they shall fall and not rise again:</p> 
<p>And there shall be no one to take them with his hands and raise them:<br> For they have denied the Lord of Spirits and His Anointed.<br> The name of the Lord of Spirits be blessed.</p>
