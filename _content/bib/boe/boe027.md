XXIV\. XXV. *The Seven Mountains in the North-West and the Tree of
Life*.

### CHAPTER XXIV.

1\. ⌈⌈And from thence I went to another place of the earth⌉⌉, and he
showed me a mountain range of fire which burnt ⌈⌈day and night⌉⌉. 2. And
I went beyond it and saw seven magnificent mountains all differing each
from the other, and the stones (thereof) were magnificent and beautiful,
magnificent as a whole, of glorious appearance and fair exterior:
⌈⌈three towards⌉⌉ the east, ⌈⌈one⌉⌉ founded on the other, and three
towards the south, one upon the other, and deep rough ravines, no one of
which joined with any other. 3. And the seventh mountain was in the
midst of these, and it excelled them in height, resembling the seat of a
throne: and fragrant trees encircled the throne. 4. And amongst them was
a tree such as I had never yet smelt, neither was any amongst them nor
were others like it: it had a fragrance beyond all fragrance, and its
leaves and blooms and wood wither not for ever: and its fruit ⌈⌈is
beautiful, and its fruit⌉⌉ resembles the dates of a palm. 5. Then I
said: '⌈How⌉ beautiful is this tree, and fragrant, and its leaves are
fair, and its blooms ⌈⌈very⌉⌉ delightful in appearance.' 6. Then
answered Michael, one of the holy ⌈⌈and honoured⌉⌉ angels who was with
me, and was their leader.
