LXXXVI\. *The Fall of the Angels and the Demoralization of Mankind*.

above, and behold a star fell from heaven, and it arose and eat and
pastured amongst those oxen. 2. And after that I saw the

large and the black oxen, and behold they all changed their stalls and
pastures and their cattle, and began to live with each other. 3. And
again I saw in the vision, and looked towards the heaven, and behold I
saw many stars descend and cast themselves down from heaven to that
first star, and they became bulls amongst those cattle and pastured with
them ⌈amongst them⌉. 4. And I looked at them and saw, and behold they
all let out their privy members, like horses, and began to cover the
cows of the oxen, and they all became pregnant and bare elephants,
camels, and asses. 5. And all the oxen feared them and were affrighted
at them, and began to bite with their teeth and to devour, and to gore
with their horns. 6. And they began, moreover, to devour those oxen; and
behold all the children of the earth began to tremble and quake before
them and to flee from them.
