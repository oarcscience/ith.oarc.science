<p>1. And in those days shall have ascended the prayer of the righteous,<br> And the blood of the righteous from the earth before the Lord of Spirits.<br> 2. In those days the holy ones who dwell above in the heavens<br> Shall unite with one voice<br> And supplicate and pray <FONT COLOR="GREEN">[</FONT>and praise,<br> And give thanks and bless the name of the Lord of Spirits<FONT COLOR="GREEN">]</FONT><br> On behalf of the blood of the righteous which has been shed,<br> And that the prayer of the righteous may not be in vain before the Lord of Spirits,<br> That judgement may be done unto them,<br> And that they may not have to suffer for ever.<br> 3. In those days I saw the Head of Days when He seated himself upon the throne of His glory,<br> And the books of the living were opened before Him:<br> And all His host which is in heaven above and His counselors stood before Him,<br> 4 And the hearts of the holy were filled with joy;<br> Because the number of the righteous <b>had been offered</b>,<br> And the prayer of the righteous had been heard,<br> And the blood of the righteous been required before the Lord of Spirits.</p>
