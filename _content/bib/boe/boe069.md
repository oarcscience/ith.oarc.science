LXVI\. *The Angels of the Waters bidden to hold them in Check*.

### CHAPTER LXVI.

1\. And after that he showed me the angels of punishment who are
prepared to come and let loose all the powers of the waters which are
beneath in the earth in order to bring judgement and destruction on all
who \[abide and\] dwell on the earth. 2. And the Lord of Spirits gave
commandment to the angels who were going forth, that they should not
cause **the waters** to rise but should hold them in check; for those
angels were over the powers of the waters. 3. And I went away from the
presence of Enoch.
