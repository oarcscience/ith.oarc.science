XXXVI\. *The Journey to the South*.

### CHAPTER XXXVI.

1\. And from thence I went to the south to the ends of the earth, and
saw there three open portals of the heaven: and thence there come dew,
rain, †and wind†. 2. And from thence I went to the east to the ends of
the heaven, and saw here the three eastern portals of heaven open and
small portals above them. 3. Through each of these small portals pass
the stars of heaven and run their course to the west on the path which
is shown to them. 4. And as often as I saw I blessed always the Lord of
Glory, and I continued to bless the Lord of Glory who has wrought great
and glorious wonders, to show the greatness of His work to the angels
and to **spirits** and to men, that they might praise His work and all
His creation: that they might see the work of His might and praise the
great work of His hands and bless Him for ever.
