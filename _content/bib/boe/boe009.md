VI-XI. *The Fall of the Angels: the Demoralisation of Mankind: the
Intercession of the Angels on behalf of Mankind. The Dooms pronounced by
God on the Angels: the Messianic Kingdom* (a Noah fragment).

### CHAPTER VI.

1\. And it came to pass when the children of men had multiplied that in
those days were born unto them beautiful and comely daughters. 2. And
the angels, the children of the heaven, saw and lusted after them, and
said to one another: 'Come, let us choose us wives from among the
children of men and beget us children.' 3. And Semjâzâ, who was their
leader, said unto them: 'I fear ye will not indeed agree to do this
deed, and I alone shall have to pay the penalty of a great sin.' 4. And
they all answered

him and said: 'Let us all swear an oath, and all bind ourselves by
mutual imprecations not to abandon this plan but to do this thing.' 5.
Then sware they all together and bound themselves by mutual imprecations
upon it. 6. And they were in all two hundred; who descended ⌈in the
days⌉ of **Jared** on the summit of Mount Hermon, and they called it
Mount Hermon, because they had sworn and bound themselves by mutual
imprecations upon it. 7. And these are the names of their leaders:
Sêmîazâz, their leader, Arâkîba, Râmêêl, Kôkabîêl, Tâmîêl, Râmîêl,
Dânêl, Êzêqêêl, Barâqîjâl, Asâêl, Armârôs, Batârêl, Anânêl, Zaqîêl,
Samsâpêêl, Satarêl, Tûrêl, Jômjâêl, Sariêl. 8. These are their chiefs of
tens.
