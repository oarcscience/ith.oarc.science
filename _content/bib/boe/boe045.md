XLII\. *The Dwelling-places of Wisdom and of Unrighteousness*.

### CHAPTER XLII.

1\. Wisdom found no place where she might dwell;  
Then a dwelling-place was assigned her in the heavens.

2 Wisdom went forth to make her dwelling among the children of men,  
And found no dwelling-place:

Wisdom returned to her place,  
And took her seat among the angels.

3 And unrighteousness went forth from her chambers:  
Whom she sought not she found,  
And dwelt with them, <span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

As rain in a desert  
And dew on a thirsty land.
