<p align="CENTER">XLVI. <i>The Head of Days and the Son of Man</i>.</p> <h3 align="CENTER" align="center">CHAPTER XLVI.</h3><dir> <dir>  
<p>1. And there I saw One who had a head of days,<br> And His head was white like wool,<br> And with Him was another being whose countenance had the appearance of a man,<br> And his face was full of graciousness, like one of the holy angels.</p></dir> </dir>  
<p>2. And I asked the <b>angel</b> who went with me and showed me all the hidden things, concerning that Son of Man, who he was, and whence he was, (and)</p> 
<p><a name="page_64"><font size="1" color="green">p. 64</font></A></p> 
<p>why he went with the Head of Days? And he answered and said unto me:</p><dir> <dir>  
<p>This is the son of Man who hath righteousness,<br> With whom dwelleth righteousness,<br> And who revealeth all the treasures of that which is hidden,</p> 
<p>Because the Lord of Spirits hath chosen him,<br> And whose lot hath the pre-eminence before the Lord of Spirits in uprightness for ever.</p> 
<p>4, And this Son of Man whom thou hast seen<br> Shall &#8224;raise up&#8224; the kings and the mighty from their seats,<br> <FONT COLOR="GREEN">[</FONT>And the strong from their thrones<FONT COLOR="GREEN">]</FONT></p> 
<p>And shall loosen the reins of the strong,<br> And break the teeth of the sinners.</p> 
<p>5. <FONT COLOR="GREEN">[</FONT>And he shall put down the kings from their thrones and kingdoms<FONT COLOR="GREEN">]</FONT><br> Because they do not extol and praise Him,<br> Nor humbly acknowledge whence the kingdom was bestowed upon them.<br> 6. And he shall put down the countenance of the strong,<br> And shall fill them with shame.</p> 
<p>And darkness shall be their dwelling,<br> And worms shall be their bed,<br> And they shall have no hope of rising from their beds,<br> Because they do not extol the name of the Lord of Spirits.</p> 
<p>7. And these are they who &#8224;judge&#8224; the stars of heaven,<br> <FONT COLOR="GREEN">[</FONT>And raise their hands against the Most High<FONT COLOR="GREEN">]</FONT>,<br> &#8224;And tread upon the earth and dwell upon it&#8224;.</p> 
<p>And all their deeds manifest unrighteousness,<br> And their power rests upon their riches, <a name="page_65"><font size="1" color="green">p. 65</font></A><br> And their faith is in the &#8224;gods&#8224; which they have made with their hands,<br> And they deny the name of the Lord of Spirits,</p> 
<p>8. And they persecute the houses of His congregations,<br> And the faithful who hang upon the name of the Lord of Spirits.</p></dir> </dir>
