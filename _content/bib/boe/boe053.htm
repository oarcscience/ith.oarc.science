<p>1. And in those days a change shall take place for the holy and elect,<br> And the light of days shall abide upon them,<br> And glory and honour shall turn to the holy,<br> 2. On the day of affliction on which evil shall have been treasured up against the sinners.</p> 
<p>And the righteous shall be victorious in the name of the Lord of Spirits:<br> And He will cause the others to witness (this)<br> That they may repent<br> And forgo the works of their hands.</p> 
<p>3. They shall have no honour through the name of the Lord of Spirits,<br> Yet through His name shall they be saved,<br> And the Lord of Spirits will have compassion on them,<br> For His compassion is great.<br> 4. And He is righteous also in His judgement,<br> And in the presence of His glory unrighteousness also shall not maintain itself:<br> At His judgement the unrepentant shall perish before Him.<br> 5. And from henceforth I will have no mercy on them, saith the Lord of Spirits.</p></dir> </dir>
