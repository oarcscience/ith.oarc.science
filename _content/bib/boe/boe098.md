XCIV\. 1-5. *Admonitions to the Righteous*.

### CHAPTER XCIV.

1\. And now I say unto you, my sons, love righteousness and walk
therein;  
For the paths of righteousness are worthy of acceptation,  
But the paths of unrighteousness shall suddenly be destroyed and vanish.

2\. And to certain men of a generation shall the paths of violence and
of death be revealed,  
And they shall hold themselves afar from them,  
And shall not follow them. <span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

3\. And now I say unto you the righteous:  
Walk not in the paths of wickedness, nor in the paths of death,  
And draw not nigh to them, lest ye be destroyed.

4\. But seek and choose for yourselves righteousness and an elect
life,  
And walk in the paths of peace,  
And ye shall live and prosper.

5\. And hold fast my words in the thoughts of your hearts,  
And suffer them not to be effaced from your hearts;

For I know that sinners will tempt men to **evilly-entreat** wisdom,  
So that no place may be found for her,  
And no manner of temptation may minish.

XCIV\. 6-11. *Woes for the Sinners*.

6\. Woe to those who build unrighteousness and oppression  
And lay deceit as a foundation;  
For they shall be suddenly overthrown,  
And they shall have no peace.

7\. Woe to those who build their houses with sin;  
For from all their foundations shall they be overthrown,  
And by the sword shall they fall.

\[And those who acquire gold and silver in judgement suddenly shall
perish.\]

8\. Woe to you, ye rich, for ye have trusted in your riches,  
And from your riches shall ye depart,  
Because ye have not remembered the Most High in the days of your riches.

9\. Ye have committed blasphemy and unrighteousness,  
And have become ready for the day of slaughter, <span id="page_136">p.
136</span>  
And the day of darkness and the day of the great judgement.

10\. Thus I speak and declare unto you:  
He who hath created you will overthrow you,  
And for your fall there shall be no compassion,  
And your Creator will rejoice at your destruction.

11\. And your righteous ones in those days shall be  
A reproach to the sinners and the godless.
