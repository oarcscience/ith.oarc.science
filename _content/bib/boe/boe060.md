LVII\. *The Return from the Dispersion*.

### CHAPTER LVII.

1\. And it came to pass after this that I saw another host of wagons,
and men riding thereon, and coming on the winds from the east, and from
the west to the south. 2. And the noise of their wagons was heard, and
when this turmoil took place the holy ones from heaven remarked it, and
the pillars of the earth were moved from their place, and the sound
thereof was heard from the one end of heaven to the other, in one day.
3. And they shall all fall down and worship the Lord of Spirits. And
this is the end of the second Parable.
