breastplates, and made known to them **the metals** 〈of the earth〉 and
the art of working them, and bracelets, and ornaments, and the use of
antimony, and the beautifying of the eyelids, and all kinds of costly
stones, and all colouring tinctures. 2. And there arose much

sun〉, and Sariêl the course of the moon. And as men perished, they
cried, and their cry went up to heaven . . .
