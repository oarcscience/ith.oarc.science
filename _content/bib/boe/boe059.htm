<p>1. And I saw there the hosts of the angels of punishment going, and they held scourges and chains of iron and bronze. 2. And I asked the angel of peace who went with me, saying: 'To whom are these who hold the scourges going?' 3. And he said unto me: 'To their elect and beloved ones, that they may be cast into the chasm of the abyss of the valley.</p><dir> <dir>  
<p>4. And then that valley shall be filled with their elect and beloved,<br> And the days of their lives shall be at an end,<br> And the days of their leading astray shall not thenceforward be reckoned.</p></dir> </dir>

<p>5. And in those days the angels shall return<br> And hurl themselves to the east upon the Parthians and Medes:<br> They shall stir up the kings, so that a spirit of unrest shall come upon them,<br> And they shall rouse them from their thrones,<br> That they may break forth as lions from their lairs,<br> And as hungry wolves among their flocks.<br> 6. And they shall go up and tread under foot the land of His elect ones, <a name="page_74"><font size="1" color="green">p. 74</font></A><br> <FONT COLOR="GREEN">[</FONT>And the land of His elect ones shall be before them a threshing-floor and a highway:<FONT COLOR="GREEN">]</FONT><br> 7 But the city of my righteous shall be a hindrance to their horses.</p> 
<p>And they shall begin to fight among themselves,<br> And their right hand shall be strong against themselves,</p>

<p>Till there be no number of the corpses through their slaughter,<br> And their punishment be not in vain.</p>
