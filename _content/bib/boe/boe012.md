### CHAPTER IX.

1\. And then Michael, Uriel, Raphael, and Gabriel looked down from
heaven and saw much blood being shed upon the earth, and all lawlessness
being wrought upon the earth. 2. And they said one to another: 'The
earth made †without inhabitant cries the voice of their crying† up to
the gates of heaven. 3 ⌈⌈And now to you, the holy ones of heaven⌉⌉, the
souls of men make their suit, saying, "Bring our cause before the Most
High.".' 4. And they said to the Lord **of the ages**: 'Lord of lords,
God of gods, King of kings, 〈and God of the ages〉, the throne of Thy
glory (standeth) unto all the generations of the ages, and Thy name holy
and glorious and blessed unto all the ages! 5. Thou hast made all
things, and power over all things hast Thou: and all things are naked
and open in Thy sight, and Thou seest all things, and nothing can hide
itself from Thee. 6. Thou seest what Azâzêl hath done, who hath taught
all unrighteousness on earth and revealed the eternal secrets which were
(preserved) in heaven, which men were striving to **learn**: 7. And
Semjâzâ, to whom Thou hast given authority to bear rule over his
associates. 8. And they have gone to the daughters of men upon the
earth, and have slept with the women, and have defiled themselves, and
revealed to them all kinds of sins. 9. And the women have borne giants,
and the whole earth has thereby been filled with blood and
unrighteousness. 10. And now, behold, the souls of those who have died
are crying and making their suit to the gates of heaven, and their
lamentations have ascended: and cannot **cease** because of the lawless
deeds which are wrought on the earth. 11. And Thou knowest all things
before they come to pass, and

things and Thou dost suffer them, and Thou dost not say to us what we
are to do to them in regard to these.'
