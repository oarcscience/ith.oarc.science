### GENESIS CHAPTER 32

<span id="an_gen:32:1">1</span> And early in the morning Laban rose up,
and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them. And Laban
departed, and returned unto his place. <span
id="an_gen:32:2">2</span> And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of
God met him. <span id="an_gen:32:3">3</span> And Jacob said when he saw
them: 'This is God's camp.' And he called the name of that place  <span
id="fr_52"></span>[d](#fn_51) Mahanaim.

‏וישלח‎

<span id="an_gen:32:4">4</span> And Jacob sent messengers before him to
Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the field of Edom. <span
id="an_gen:32:5">5</span> And he commanded them, saying: 'Thus shall ye
say unto my lord Esau: Thus saith thy servant Jacob: I have sojourned
with Laban, and stayed until now. <span id="an_gen:32:6">6</span> And I
have oxen, and asses and flocks, and men-servants and maid-servants; and
I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favour in thy sight.' <span
id="an_gen:32:7">7</span> And the messengers <span id="page_40">p.
40</span> returned to Jacob, saying: 'We came to thy brother Esau, and
moreover he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.' <span
id="an_gen:32:8">8</span> Then Jacob was greatly afraid and was
distressed. And he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks,
and the herds, and the camels, into two camps. <span
id="an_gen:32:9">9</span> And he said: 'If Esau come to the one camp,
and smite it, then the camp which is left shall escape.' <span
id="an_gen:32:10">10</span> And Jacob said: 'O God of my father Abraham,
and God of my father Isaac, O LORD, who saidst unto me: Return unto thy
country, and to thy kindred, and I will do thee good; <span
id="an_gen:32:11">11</span> I am not worthy of all the mercies, and of
all the truth, which Thou hast shown unto Thy servant; for with my staff
I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two camps. <span
id="an_gen:32:12">12</span> Deliver me, I pray Thee, from the hand of my
brother, from the hand of Esau; for I fear him, lest he come and smite
me, the mother with the children. <span id="an_gen:32:13">13</span> And
Thou saidst: I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand
of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.' <span
id="an_gen:32:14">14</span> And he lodged there that night; and took of
that which he had with him a present for Esau his brother: <span
id="an_gen:32:15">15</span> two hundred she-goats and twenty he-goats,
two hundred ewes and twenty rams, <span
id="an_gen:32:16">16</span> thirty milch camels and their colts, forty
kine and ten bulls, twenty she-asses and ten foals. <span
id="an_gen:32:17">17</span> And he delivered them into the hand of his
servants, every drove by itself; and said unto his servants: 'Pass over
before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.' <span
id="an_gen:32:18">18</span> And he commanded the foremost, saying: 'When
Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying: Whose art thou?
and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee? <span
id="an_gen:32:19">19</span> then thou shalt say: They are thy servant
Jacob's; it is a present sent unto my lord, even unto Esau; and, behold,
he also is behind us.' <span id="an_gen:32:20">20</span> And he
commanded also the second, and the third, and all that followed the
droves, saying: 'In this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find
him; <span id="an_gen:32:21">21</span> and ye shall say: Moreover,
behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us.' For he said: 'I will appease
him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his
face; peradventure he will accept me.' <span
id="an_gen:32:22">22</span> So the present passed over before him; and
he himself lodged that night in the camp.

<span id="an_gen:32:23">23</span> And he rose up that night, and took
his two wives, and his two handmaids, and his eleven children, and
passed over the ford of the Jabbok. <span
id="an_gen:32:24">24</span> And he took them, and sent them over the
stream, and sent over that which he had. <span
id="an_gen:32:25">25</span> And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled
a man with him until the breaking of the day. <span
id="an_gen:32:26">26</span> And when he saw that he prevailed not
against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of
Jacob's thigh was strained, as he wrestled with him. <span
id="an_gen:32:27">27</span> And he said: 'Let me go, for the day
breaketh.' And he said: 'I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.'
<span id="an_gen:32:28">28</span> And he said unto him: 'What is thy
name?' And he said: 'Jacob.' <span id="an_gen:32:29">29</span> And he
said: Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but  <span
id="fr_53"></span>[a](#fn_52) Israel; for thou hast striven with God and
with men, and hast prevailed.' <span id="an_gen:32:30">30</span> And
Jacob asked him, and said: 'Tell me, I pray thee, thy name.' And he
said: 'Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name?' And he blessed
him there. <span id="an_gen:32:31">31</span> And Jacob called the name
of the place  <span id="fr_54"></span>[b](#fn_53) Peniel: 'for I have
seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.' <span
id="an_gen:32:32">32</span> And the <span id="page_41">p. 41</span> sun
rose upon him as he passed over  <span id="fr_55"></span>[a](#fn_54)
Peniel, and he limped upon his thigh. <span
id="an_gen:32:33">33</span> Therefore the children of Israel eat not the
sinew of the thigh-vein which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this
day; because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh, even in the sinew
of the thigh-vein.
