<p><A NAME="an_sa2:16:1">1</A>&nbsp; And when David was a little past the top, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and a hundred clusters of raisins, and a hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine. <A NAME="an_sa2:16:2">2</A>&nbsp; And the king said unto Ziba: `What meanest thou by these?' And Ziba said: `The asses are for the king's household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as are faint in the wilderness may drink.' <A NAME="an_sa2:16:3">3</A>&nbsp; And the king said: `And where is thy master's son?' And Ziba said unto the king: `Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem; for he said: To-day will the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.' <A NAME="an_sa2:16:4">4</A>&nbsp; Then said the king to Ziba: `Behold, thine is all that pertaineth unto Mephibosheth.'</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> And Ziba said: `I prostrate myself; let me find favour in thy sight, my lord, O king.'</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_sa2:16:5">5</A>&nbsp; And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, there came out thence a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera; he came out, and kept on cursing as he came. <A NAME="an_sa2:16:6">6</A>&nbsp; And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David; and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left. <A NAME="an_sa2:16:7">7</A>&nbsp; And thus said Shimei when he cursed: `Begone, begone, thou man of blood, and base fellow; <A NAME="an_sa2:16:8">8</A>&nbsp; the LORD hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son; and, behold, thou art taken in thine own mischief, because thou art a man of blood.'</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_sa2:16:9">9</A>&nbsp; Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king: `Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head.' <A NAME="an_sa2:16:10">10</A>&nbsp; And the king said: `What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? So let him curse, because the LORD hath said unto him: Curse David; who then shall say: Wherefore hast thou done so?' <A NAME="an_sa2:16:11">11</A>&nbsp; And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants: `Behold, my son, who came forth of my body, seeketh my life; how much more this Benjamite now? let him alone, and let him curse; for the LORD hath bidden him. <A NAME="an_sa2:16:12">12</A>&nbsp; It may be that the LORD will look on mine eye, and that the LORD will requite me good for his cursing of me this day.' <A NAME="an_sa2:16:13">13</A>&nbsp; So David and his men went by the way; and Shimei went along on the hill-side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust. <A NAME="an_sa2:16:14">14</A>&nbsp; And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary; and he refreshed himself there.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_sa2:16:15">15</A>&nbsp; And Absalom, and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him. <A NAME="an_sa2:16:16">16</A>&nbsp; And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom: `Long live the king, long live the king.' <A NAME="an_sa2:16:17">17</A>&nbsp; And Absalom said to Hushai: `Is this thy kindness to thy friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend?' <A NAME="an_sa2:16:18">18</A>&nbsp; And Hushai said unto Absalom: `Nay; but whom the LORD, and this people, and all the men of Israel have chosen, his will I be, and with him will I abide. <A NAME="an_sa2:16:19">19</A>&nbsp; And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy father's presence, so will I be in thy presence.'</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_sa2:16:20">20</A>&nbsp; Then said Absalom to Ahithophel: `Give your counsel what we shall do.' <A NAME="an_sa2:16:21">21</A>&nbsp; And Ahithophel said unto Absalom: `Go in unto thy father's concubines, that he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel will hear that thou art abhorred of thy father; then will the hands of all that are with thee be strong.' <A NAME="an_sa2:16:22">22</A>&nbsp; So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.&#8212;<A NAME="an_sa2:16:23">23</A>&nbsp; Now the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days, was as if a man inquired of the word of God; so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.</p>
