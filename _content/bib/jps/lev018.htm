<p><A NAME="an_lev:18:1">1</A>&nbsp;And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: <A NAME="an_lev:18:2">2</A>&nbsp;Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them:</p>  
<p>I am the LORD your God. <A NAME="an_lev:18:3">3</A>&nbsp;After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do; and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither I bring you, shall ye not do; neither shall ye walk in their statutes. <A NAME="an_lev:18:4">4</A>&nbsp;Mine ordinances shall ye do, and My statutes shall ye keep, to walk therein: I am the LORD your God. <A NAME="an_lev:18:5">5</A>&nbsp;Ye shall therefore keep My statutes, and Mine ordinances, which if a man do, he shall live by them: I am the LORD.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_lev:18:6">6</A>&nbsp;None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him, to uncover their nakedness: I am the LORD.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_lev:18:7">7</A>&nbsp;The nakedness of thy father, and the nakedness of thy mother, shalt thou not uncover: she is thy mother; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_lev:18:8">8</A>&nbsp;The nakedness of thy father's wife shalt thou not uncover: it is thy father's nakedness.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_lev:18:9">9</A>&nbsp;The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or the daughter of thy mother, whether born at home, or born abroad, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_lev:18:10">10</A>&nbsp;The nakedness of thy son's daughter, or of thy daughter's daughter, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover; for theirs is thine own nakedness.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_lev:18:11">11</A>&nbsp;The nakedness of thy father's wife's daughter, begotten of thy father, she is thy sister, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_lev:18:12">12</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's sister: she is thy father's near kinswoman.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_lev:18:13">13</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister; for she is thy mother's near kinswoman.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_lev:18:14">14</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's brother, thou shalt not approach to his wife: she is thine aunt.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_lev:18:15">15</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter-in-law: she is thy son's wife; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_lev:18:16">16</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother's wife: it is thy brother's nakedness. <A NAME="an_lev:18:17">17</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt not <a name="page_142"><font size="1" color="green">p. 142</font></A> uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter; thou shalt not take her son's daughter, or her daughter's daughter, to uncover her nakedness: they are near kinswomen; it is lewdness. <A NAME="an_lev:18:18">18</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt not take a woman to her sister, to be a rival to her, to uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her life-time. <A NAME="an_lev:18:19">19</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is impure by her uncleanness. <A NAME="an_lev:18:20">20</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighhour's wife, to defile thyself with her. <A NAME="an_lev:18:21">21</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt not give any of thy seed to set them apart to Molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I am the LORD. <A NAME="an_lev:18:22">22</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind; it is abomination. <A NAME="an_lev:18:23">23</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt not lie with any beast to defile thyself therewith; neither shall any woman stand before a beast, to lie down thereto; it is perversion.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_lev:18:24">24</A>&nbsp;Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things; for in all these the nations are defiled, which I cast out from before you. <A NAME="an_lev:18:25">25</A>&nbsp;And the land was defiled, therefore I did visit the iniquity thereof upon it, and the land vomited out her inhabitants. <A NAME="an_lev:18:26">26</A>&nbsp;Ye therefore shall keep My statutes and Mine ordinances, and shall not do any of these abominations; neither the home-born, nor the stranger that sojourneth among you&#8212;<A NAME="an_lev:18:27">27</A>&nbsp;for all these abominations have the men of the land done, that were before you, and the land is defiled&#8212;<A NAME="an_lev:18:28">28</A>&nbsp;that the land vomit not you out also, when ye defile it, as it vomited out the nation that was before you. <A NAME="an_lev:18:29">29</A>&nbsp;For whosoever shall do any of these abominations, even the souls that do them shall be cut off from among their people. <A NAME="an_lev:18:30">30</A>&nbsp;Therefore shall ye keep My charge, that ye do not any of these abominable customs, which were done before you, and that ye defile not yourselves therein: I am the LORD your God.</p>
