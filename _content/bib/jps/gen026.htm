<p><A NAME="an_gen:26:1">1</A>&nbsp;And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar. <A NAME="an_gen:26:2">2</A>&nbsp;And the LORD appeared unto him, and said: 'Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of. <A NAME="an_gen:26:3">3</A>&nbsp;Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these lands, and I will establish the oath which I swore unto Abraham thy father; <A NAME="an_gen:26:4">4</A>&nbsp;and I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these lands; and by thy seed shall all the nations of the earth bless themselves; <A NAME="an_gen:26:5">5</A>&nbsp;because that Abraham hearkened to My voice, and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws.' <A NAME="an_gen:26:6">6</A>&nbsp;And Isaac dwelt in Gerar. <A NAME="an_gen:26:7">7</A>&nbsp;And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said: 'She is my sister'; for he feared to say: 'My wife'; 'lest the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah, because she is fair to look upon.' <A NAME="an_gen:26:8">8</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife. <A NAME="an_gen:26:9">9</A>&nbsp;And Abimelech called Isaac, and said: 'Behold, of a surety she is thy wife; and how saidst thou: She is my sister?' And Isaac said unto him: 'Because I said: Lest I die because of her.' <A NAME="an_gen:26:10">10</A>&nbsp;And Abimelech said: 'What is this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might easily have lain with thy wife, and thou wouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.' <A NAME="an_gen:26:11">11</A>&nbsp;And Abimelech charged all the people, saying: 'He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.' <A NAME="an_gen:26:12">12</A>&nbsp;And Isaac sowed in that land, and found in the same year a hundredfold; and the LORD blessed him. <A NAME="an_gen:26:13">13</A>&nbsp;And the man waxed great, and grew more and more until he became very great. <A NAME="an_gen:26:14">14</A>&nbsp;And he had possessions of flocks, and possessions of herds, and a great household; and the Philistines envied him. <A NAME="an_gen:26:15">15</A>&nbsp;Now all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth. <A NAME="an_gen:26:16">16</A>&nbsp;And Abimelech said unto Isaac: 'Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we.' <A NAME="an_gen:26:17">17</A>&nbsp;And Isaac departed thence, and encamped in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there. <A NAME="an_gen:26:18">18</A>&nbsp;And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham; and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them. <A NAME="an_gen:26:19">19</A>&nbsp;And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of living water. <A NAME="an_gen:26:20">20</A>&nbsp;And the herdmen of Gerar strove with Isaac's herdmen, saying: 'The water is ours.' And he called the name of the well &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_30"></A><A HREF="#fn_29"><FONT SIZE="1">b</FONT></A>
Esek; because they contended <a name="page_31"><font size="1" color="green">p. 31</font></A> with him. <A NAME="an_gen:26:21">21</A>&nbsp;And they digged another well, and they strove for that also. And he called the name of it &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_31"></A><A HREF="#fn_30"><FONT SIZE="1">a</FONT></A>
Sitnah. <A NAME="an_gen:26:22">22</A>&nbsp;And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not. And he called the name of it &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_32"></A><A HREF="#fn_31"><FONT SIZE="1">b</FONT></A>
Rehoboth; and he said: 'For now the LORD path made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.' <A NAME="an_gen:26:23">23</A>&nbsp;And he went up from thence to Beer-sheba. <A NAME="an_gen:26:24">24</A>&nbsp;And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said: 'I am the God of Abraham thy father. Fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for My servant Abraham's sake.' <A NAME="an_gen:26:25">25</A>&nbsp;And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there; and there Isaac's servants digged a well. <A NAME="an_gen:26:26">26</A>&nbsp;Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol the captain of his host. <A NAME="an_gen:26:27">27</A>&nbsp;And Isaac said unto them: 'Wherefore are ye come unto me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?' <A NAME="an_gen:26:28">28</A>&nbsp;And they said: 'We saw plainly that the LORD was with thee; and we said: Let there now be an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee; <A NAME="an_gen:26:29">29</A>&nbsp;that thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace; thou art now the blessed of the LORD.' <A NAME="an_gen:26:30">30</A>&nbsp;And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink. <A NAME="an_gen:26:31">31</A>&nbsp;And they rose up betimes in the morning, and swore one to another; and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace. <A NAME="an_gen:26:32">32</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him: 'We have found water.' <A NAME="an_gen:26:33">33</A>&nbsp;And he called it Shibah. Therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba unto this day.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_gen:26:34">34</A>&nbsp;And when Esau was forty years old, he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite. <A NAME="an_gen:26:35">35</A>&nbsp;And they were a bitterness of spirit unto Isaac and to Rebekah.</p>
