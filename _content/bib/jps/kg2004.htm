<p><A NAME="an_kg2:4:1">1</A>&nbsp;Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha, saying: `Thy servant my husband is dead; and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the LORD; and the creditor is come to take unto him my two children to be bondmen.' <A NAME="an_kg2:4:2">2</A>&nbsp;And Elisha said unto her: `What shall I do for thee? tell me; what hast thou in the house?' And she said: `Thy handmaid hath not any thing in the house, save a pot of oil.' <A NAME="an_kg2:4:3">3</A>&nbsp;Then he said: `Go, borrow</p>  
<p><a name="page_445"><font size="1" color="green">p. 445</font></A></p>  
<p>thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbours, even empty vessels; borrow not a few. <A NAME="an_kg2:4:4">4</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt go in, and shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and pour out into all those vessels; and thou shalt set aside that which is full.' <A NAME="an_kg2:4:5">5</A>&nbsp;So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons; they brought the vessels to her, and she poured out. <A NAME="an_kg2:4:6">6</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto her son: `Bring me yet a vessel.' And he said unto her: `There is not a vessel more.' And the oil stayed. <A NAME="an_kg2:4:7">7</A>&nbsp;Then she came and told the man of God. And he said: `Go, sell the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy sons of the rest.'</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_kg2:4:8">8</A>&nbsp;and it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was, that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread. <A NAME="an_kg2:4:9">9</A>&nbsp;And she said unto her husband: `Behold now, I perceive that this is a holy man of God, that passeth by us continually. <A NAME="an_kg2:4:10">10</A>&nbsp;Let us make, I pray thee, a little chamber on the roof; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick; and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in thither.' <A NAME="an_kg2:4:11">11</A>&nbsp;And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into the upper chamber and lay there. <A NAME="an_kg2:4:12">12</A>&nbsp;And he said to Gehazi his servant: `Call this Shunammite.' And when he had called her, she stood before him. <A NAME="an_kg2:4:13">13</A>&nbsp;And he said unto him: `Say now unto her: Behold, thou hast been careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for thee? wouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host?' And she answered: `I dwell among mine own people.' <A NAME="an_kg2:4:14">14</A>&nbsp;And he said: `What then is to be done for her?' And Gehazi answered: `Verily she hath no son, and her husband is old.' <A NAME="an_kg2:4:15">15</A>&nbsp;And he said: `Call her.' And when he had called her, she stood in the door. <A NAME="an_kg2:4:16">16</A>&nbsp;And he said: `At this season, when the time cometh round, thou shalt embrace a son.' And she said: `Nay, my lord, thou man of God, do not lie unto thy handmaid.' <A NAME="an_kg2:4:17">17</A>&nbsp;And the woman conceived, and bore a son at that season, when the time came round, as Elisha had said unto her.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_kg2:4:18">18</A>&nbsp;And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers. <A NAME="an_kg2:4:19">19</A>&nbsp;And he said unto his father: `My head, my head.' And he said to his servant: `Carry him to his mother.' <A NAME="an_kg2:4:20">20</A>&nbsp;And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and then died. <A NAME="an_kg2:4:21">21</A>&nbsp;And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut the door upon him, and went out. <A NAME="an_kg2:4:22">22</A>&nbsp;And she called unto her husband, and said: `Send me, I pray thee, one of the servants, and one of the asses, that I may run to the man of God, and come back.' <A NAME="an_kg2:4:23">23</A>&nbsp;And he said: `Wherefore wilt thou go to him to-day? it is neither new moon nor sabbath.' And she said: `It shall be well.' <A NAME="an_kg2:4:24">24</A>&nbsp;Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant: `Drive, and go forward; slacken me not the riding, except I bid thee.' <A NAME="an_kg2:4:25">25</A>&nbsp;So she went, and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel.</p>  
<p>And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant: `Behold, yonder is that Shunammite. <A NAME="an_kg2:4:26">26</A>&nbsp;Run, I pray thee, now to meet her, and say unto her: Is it well with thee? is it well with thy husband? is it well with the child?' And she answered: `It is well.' <A NAME="an_kg2:4:27">27</A>&nbsp;And when she</p>  
<p><a name="page_446"><font size="1" color="green">p. 446</font></A></p>  
<p>came to the man of God to the hill, she caught hold of his feet. And Gehazi came near to thrust her away; but the man of God said: `Let her alone; for her soul is bitter within her; and the LORD hath hid it from me, and hath not told me.' <A NAME="an_kg2:4:28">28</A>&nbsp;Then she said: `Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say: Do not deceive me?' <A NAME="an_kg2:4:29">29</A>&nbsp;Then he said to Gehazi: `Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thy hand, and go thy way; if thou meet any man, salute him not; and if any salute thee, answer him not; and lay my staff upon the face of the child.' <A NAME="an_kg2:4:30">30</A>&nbsp;And the mother of the child said: `As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee.' And he arose, and followed her. <A NAME="an_kg2:4:31">31</A>&nbsp;And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing. Wherefore he returned to meet him, and told him, saying: `The child is not awaked.'</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_kg2:4:32">32</A>&nbsp;And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and laid upon his bed. <A NAME="an_kg2:4:33">33</A>&nbsp;He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed unto the LORD. <A NAME="an_kg2:4:34">34</A>&nbsp;And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands; and he stretched himself upon him; and the flesh of the child waxed warm. <A NAME="an_kg2:4:35">35</A>&nbsp;Then he returned, and walked in the house once to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself upon him; and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes. <A NAME="an_kg2:4:36">36</A>&nbsp;And he called Gehazi, and said: `Call this Shunammite.' So he called her. And when she was come in unto him, he said: Take up thy son.' <A NAME="an_kg2:4:37">37</A>&nbsp;Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed down to theground; and she took up her son, and went out.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_kg2:4:38">38</A>&nbsp;And Elisha came again to Gilgal; and there was a dearth in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him; and he said unto his servant: `Set on the great pot, and seethe pottage for the sons of the prophets. <A NAME="an_kg2:4:39">39</A>&nbsp;And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred them into the pot of pottage; for they knew them not. <A NAME="an_kg2:4:40">40</A>&nbsp;So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said: `O man of God, there is death in the pot.' And they could not eat thereof. <A NAME="an_kg2:4:41">41</A>&nbsp;But he said: `Then bring meal.' And he cast it into the pot; and he said: `Pour out for the people, that they may eat.' And there was no harm in the pot.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_kg2:4:42">42</A>&nbsp;And there came a man from Baalshalishah, and brought the man of God bread of the first-fruits, twenty loaves of barley, and fresh ears of corn in his sack. And he said: `Give unto the people, that they may eat.' <A NAME="an_kg2:4:43">43</A>&nbsp;And his servant said: `How should I set this before a hundred men?' But he said: `Give the people, that they may eat; for thus saith the LORD: They shall eat, and shall leave thereof.' <A NAME="an_kg2:4:44">44</A>&nbsp;So he set it before them, and they did eat, and left thereof, according to the word of the LORD.</p>
