### EXODUS CHAPTER 22

<span id="an_exo:22:1">1</span> <span class="contnote">\[paragraph
continues\]</span> If a thief be found breaking in, and be smitten so
that he dieth, there shall be no bloodguiltiness for him. <span
id="an_exo:22:2">2</span> If the sun be risen upon him, there shall be
bloodguiltiness for him—he shall make restitution; if he have nothing,
then he shall be sold for his theft. <span id="an_exo:22:3">3</span> If
the theft be found in his hand alive, whether it be ox, or ass, or
sheep, he shall pay double.

<span id="an_exo:22:4">4</span> If a man cause a field or vineyard to be
eaten, and shall let his beast loose, and it feed in another man's
field; of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own
vineyard, shall he make restitution.

<span id="an_exo:22:5">5</span> If fire break out, and catch in thorns,
so that the shocks of corn, or the standing corn, or the field are
consumed; he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.

<span id="an_exo:22:6">6</span> If a man deliver unto his neighbour
money or stuff to keep, and it be stolen out of the man's house; if the
thief be found, he shall pay double. <span id="an_exo:22:7">7</span> If
the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall come near
unto  <span id="fr_86"></span>[a](#fn_85) God, to see whether he have
not put his hand unto his neighbour's goods. <span
id="an_exo:22:8">8</span> For every matter of trespass, whether it be
for ox, for ass, for sheep, for raiment, or for any manner of lost
thing, whereof one saith: 'This is it,' the cause of both parties shall
come before  <span id="fr_87"></span>[a](#fn_85)God; he whom  <span
id="fr_88"></span>[a](#fn_85)God shall condemn shall pay double unto his
neighbour.

<span id="an_exo:22:9">9</span> If a man deliver unto his neighbour an
ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast, to keep, and it die, or be
hurt, or driven away, no man seeing it; <span
id="an_exo:22:10">10</span> the oath of the LORD shall be between them
both, to see whether he have not put his hand unto his neighbour's
goods; and the owner thereof shall accept it, and he shall not make
restitution. <span id="an_exo:22:11">11</span> But if it be stolen from
him, he shall make restitution unto the owner thereof. <span
id="an_exo:22:12">12</span> If it be torn in pieces, let him bring it
for witness; he shall not make good that which was torn.

<span id="an_exo:22:13">13</span> And if a man borrow aught of his
neighbour, and it be hurt, or die, the owner thereof not being with it,
he shall surely make restitution. <span id="an_exo:22:14">14</span>If
the owner thereof be with it, he shall not make it good; if it be a
hireling, he loseth his hire.

<span id="an_exo:22:15">15</span> And if a man entice a virgin that is
not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely pay a dowry for her to
be his wife. <span id="an_exo:22:16">16</span> If her father utterly
refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay money according to the dowry
of virgins.

<span id="an_exo:22:17">17</span> Thou shalt not suffer a sorceress to
live.

<span id="an_exo:22:18">18</span> Whosoever lieth with a beast shall
surely be put to death.

<span id="an_exo:22:19">19</span> He that sacrificeth unto the gods,
save unto the LORD only, shall be utterly destroyed.

<span id="an_exo:22:20">20</span> And a stranger shalt thou not wrong,
neither shalt thou oppress him; for ye were strangers in the land of
Egypt. <span id="an_exo:22:21">21</span> Ye shall not afflict any widow,
or fatherless child. <span id="an_exo:22:22">22</span> If thou afflict
them in any wise—for if they cry at all unto Me, I will surely hear
their cry—<span id="an_exo:22:23">23</span> My wrath shall wax <span
id="page_92">p. 92</span> hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and
your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless.

<span id="an_exo:22:24">24</span> If thou lend money to any of My
people, even to the poor with thee, thou shalt not be to him as a
creditor; neither shall ye lay upon him interest. <span
id="an_exo:22:25">25</span> If thou at all take thy neighbour's garment
to pledge, thou shalt restore it unto him by that the sun goeth down;
<span id="an_exo:22:26">26</span> for that is his only covering, it is
his garment for his skin; wherein shall he sleep? and it shall come to
pass, when he crieth unto Me, that I will hear; for I am gracious.

<span id="an_exo:22:27">27</span> Thou shalt not revile  <span
id="fr_89"></span>[a](#fn_86) God, nor curse a ruler of thy people.
<span id="an_exo:22:28">28</span> Thou shalt not delay to offer of the
fulness of thy harvest, and of the outflow of thy presses. The
first-born of thy sons shalt thou give unto Me. <span
id="an_exo:22:29">29</span> Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, and
with thy sheep; seven days it shall be with its dam; on the eighth day
thou shalt give it Me. <span id="an_exo:22:30">30</span> And ye shall be
holy men unto Me; therefore ye shall not eat any flesh that is torn of
beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to the dogs.
