<p><A NAME="an_jdg:5:1">1</A>&nbsp;Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day, saying:</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_jdg:5:2">2</A>&nbsp;When men let grow their hair in Israel,<br> When the people offer themselves willingly,<br> Bless ye the LORD.<br> <A NAME="an_jdg:5:3">3</A>&nbsp;Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes;<br> I, unto the LORD will I sing;<br> I will sing praise to the LORD, the God of Israel.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_jdg:5:4">4</A>&nbsp;LORD, when Thou didst go forth out of Seir,<br> When Thou didst march out of the field of Edom,<br> The earth trembled, the heavens also dropped,<br> Yea, the clouds dropped water.<br> <A NAME="an_jdg:5:5">5</A>&nbsp;The mountains quaked at the presence of the LORD,<br> Even yon Sinai at the presence of the LORD, the God of Israel.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_jdg:5:6">6</A>&nbsp;In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath,<br> In the days of Jael, the highways ceased,<br> And the travellers walked through byways.<br> <A NAME="an_jdg:5:7">7</A>&nbsp;The rulers ceased in Israel, they ceased,<br> Until that thou didst arise, Deborah,<br> That thou didst arise a mother in Israel.<br> <A NAME="an_jdg:5:8">8</A>&nbsp;They chose new gods;<br> Then was war in the gates;<br> Was there a shield or spear seen<br> Among forty thousand in Israel? <a name="page_299"><font size="1" color="green">p. 299</font></A><br> <A NAME="an_jdg:5:9">9</A>&nbsp;My heart is toward the governors of Israel,<br> That offered themselves willingly among the people.<br> Bless ye the LORD.<br> <A NAME="an_jdg:5:10">10</A>&nbsp;Ye that ride on white asses,<br> Ye that sit on rich cloths,<br> And ye that walk by the way, tell of it;<br> <A NAME="an_jdg:5:11">11</A>&nbsp;Louder than the voice of archers, by the watering-troughs!<br> There shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the LORD,<br> Even the righteous acts of His rulers in Israel.<br> Then the people of the LORD went down to the gates.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_jdg:5:12">12</A>&nbsp;Awake, awake, Deborah;<br> Awake, awake, utter a song;<br> Arise, Barak, and lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam.<br> <A NAME="an_jdg:5:13">13</A>&nbsp;Then made He a remnant to have dominion over the nobles and the people;<br> The LORD made me have dominion over the mighty.<br> <A NAME="an_jdg:5:14">14</A>&nbsp;0ut of Ephraim came they whose root is in Amalek;<br> After thee, Benjamin, among thy peoples;<br> Out of Machir came down governors,<br> And out of Zebulun they that handle the marshal's staff.<br> <A NAME="an_jdg:5:15">15</A>&nbsp;And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah;<br> As was Issachar, so was Barak;<br> Into the valley they rushed forth at his feet.<br> Among the divisions of Reuben<br> There were great resolves of heart.<br> <A NAME="an_jdg:5:16">16</A>&nbsp;Why sattest thou among the sheep-folds,<br> To hear the pipings for the flocks?<br> At the divisions of Reuben<br> There were great searchings of heart.<br> <A NAME="an_jdg:5:17">17</A>&nbsp;Gilead abode beyond the Jordan;<br> And Dan, why doth he sojourn by the ships?<br> Asher dwelt at the shore of the sea,<br> And abideth by its bays.<br> <A NAME="an_jdg:5:18">18</A>&nbsp;Zebulun is a people that jeoparded their lives unto the death,<br> And Naphtali, upon the high places of the field.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_jdg:5:19">19</A>&nbsp;The kings came, they fought;<br> Then fought the kings of Canaan,<br> In Taanach by the waters of Megiddo;<br> They took no gain of money.<br> <A NAME="an_jdg:5:20">20</A>&nbsp;They fought from heaven,<br> The stars in their courses fought against Sisera.<br> <A NAME="an_jdg:5:21">21</A>&nbsp;The brook Kishon swept them away,<br> That ancient brook, the brook Kishon.<br> O my soul, tread them down with strength.<br> <A NAME="an_jdg:5:22">22</A>&nbsp;Then did the horsehoofs stamp<br> By reason of the prancings, the prancings of their mighty ones.<br> <A NAME="an_jdg:5:23">23</A>&nbsp;`Curse ye Meroz', said the angel of the LORD,<br> `Curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof,<br> Because they came not to the help of the LORD,<br> To the help of the LORD against the mighty.'<br> <A NAME="an_jdg:5:24">24</A>&nbsp;Blessed above women shall Jael be,<br> The wife of Heber the Kenite,<br> Above women in the tent shall she be blessed.<br> <A NAME="an_jdg:5:25">25</A>&nbsp;Water he asked, milk she gave him;<br> In a lordly bowl she brought him curd.<br> <A NAME="an_jdg:5:26">26</A>&nbsp;Her hand she put to the tent-pin,<br> And her right hand to the workmen's hammer;<br> And with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote through his head,<br> Yea, she pierced and struck through his temples. <a name="page_300"><font size="1" color="green">p. 300</font></A><br> <A NAME="an_jdg:5:27">27</A>&nbsp;At her feet he sunk, he fell, he lay;<br> At her feet he sunk, he fell;<br> Where he sunk, there he fell down dead.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_jdg:5:28">28</A>&nbsp;Through the window she looked forth, and peered,<br> The mother of Sisera, through the lattice:<br> `Why is his chariot so long in coming?<br> Why tarry the wheels of his chariots?'<br> <A NAME="an_jdg:5:29">29</A>&nbsp;The wisest of her princesses answer her,<br> Yea, she returneth answer to herself:<br> <A NAME="an_jdg:5:30">30</A>&nbsp;`Are they not finding, are they not dividing the spoil?<br> A damsel, two damsels to every man;<br> To Sisera a spoil of dyed garments,<br> A spoil of dyed garments of embroidery,<br> Two dyed garments of broidery for the neck of every spoiler?'</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_jdg:5:31">31</A>&nbsp;So perish all Thine enemies, O LORD;<br> But they that love Him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might.<br> And the land had rest forty years. </p>
