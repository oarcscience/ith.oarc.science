### JUDGES CHAPTER 17

<span id="an_jdg:17:1">1</span> Now there was a man of the hill-country
of Ephraim, whose name was Micah. <span id="an_jdg:17:2">2</span> And he
said unto his mother: \`The eleven hundred pieces of silver that were
taken from thee, about which thou didst utter a curse, and didst also
speak it in mine ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it.' And
his mother said: \`Blessed be my son of the LORD.' <span
id="an_jdg:17:3">3</span> And he restored the eleven hundred pieces of
silver to his mother, and his mother said: \`I verily dedicate the
silver unto the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and
a molten image; now therefore I will restore it unto thee.' <span
id="an_jdg:17:4">4</span> And when he restored the money unto his
mother, his mother took two hundred pieces of silver, and gave them to
the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image; and it
was in the house of Micah. <span id="an_jdg:17:5">5</span> And the man
Micah had a house of God, and he made an ephod, and teraphim, and
consecrated

<span id="page_317">p. 317</span>

one of his sons, who became his priest. <span
id="an_jdg:17:6">6</span> In those days there was no king in Israel;
every man did that which was right in his own eyes.

<span id="an_jdg:17:7">7</span> And there was a young man out of
Beth-lehem in Judah—in the family of Judah-who was a Levite, and he
sojourned there. <span id="an_jdg:17:8">8</span> And the man departed
out of the city, out of Beth-lehem in Judah, to sojourn where he could
find a place; and he came to the hill-country of Ephraim to the house of
Micah, as he journeyed. <span id="an_jdg:17:9">9</span> And Micah said
unto him: \`Whence comest thou?' And he said unto him: \`I am a Levite
of Beth-lehem in Judah, and I go to sojourn where I may find a place.'
<span id="an_jdg:17:10">10</span> And Micah said unto him: \`Dwell with
me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and I will give thee ten
pieces of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals.'
So the Levite went in. <span id="an_jdg:17:11">11</span> And the Levite
was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one
of his sons. <span id="an_jdg:17:12">12</span> And Micah consecrated the
Levite, and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of
Micah. <span id="an_jdg:17:13">13</span> Then said Micah: \`Now know I
that the LORD will do me good, seeing I have a Levite as my priest.'
