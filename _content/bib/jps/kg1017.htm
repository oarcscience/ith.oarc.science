<p><A NAME="an_kg1:17:1">1</A>&nbsp;And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the settlers of Gilead, said unto Ahab: `As the LORD, the God of Israel, liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.' <A NAME="an_kg1:17:2">2</A>&nbsp;And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying: <A NAME="an_kg1:17:3">3</A>&nbsp;`Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that is before the Jordan. <A NAME="an_kg1:17:4">4</A>&nbsp;And it</p>  
<p><a name="page_430"><font size="1" color="green">p. 430</font></A></p>  
<p>shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.' <A NAME="an_kg1:17:5">5</A>&nbsp;So he went and did according unto the word of the LORD; for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that is before the Jordan. <A NAME="an_kg1:17:6">6</A>&nbsp;And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook. <A NAME="an_kg1:17:7">7</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there was no rain in the land.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_kg1:17:8">8</A>&nbsp;And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying: <A NAME="an_kg1:17:9">9</A>&nbsp;'Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Zidon, and dwell there; behold, I have commanded a widow there to sustain thee.' <A NAME="an_kg1:17:10">10</A>&nbsp;So he arose and went to Zarephath; and when he came to the gate of the city, behold, a widow was there gathering sticks; and he called to her, and said: `Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.' <A NAME="an_kg1:17:11">11</A>&nbsp;And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said: `Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thy hand.' <A NAME="an_kg1:17:12">12</A>&nbsp;And she said: `As the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake, only a handful of meal in the jar, and a little oil in the cruse; and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.' <A NAME="an_kg1:17:13">13</A>&nbsp;And Elijah said unto her: `Fear not; go and do as thou hast said; but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it forth unto me, and afterward make for thee and for thy son. <A NAME="an_kg1:17:14">14</A>&nbsp;For thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel: The jar of meal shall not be spent, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the LORD sendeth rain upon the land.' <A NAME="an_kg1:17:15">15</A>&nbsp;And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah; and she, and he, and her house, did eat many days. <A NAME="an_kg1:17:16">16</A>&nbsp;The jar of meal was not spent, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the LORD, which He spoke by Elijah.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_kg1:17:17">17</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass after these things, that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him. <A NAME="an_kg1:17:18">18</A>&nbsp;And she said unto Elijah: `What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? art thou come unto me to bring my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son?' <A NAME="an_kg1:17:19">19</A>&nbsp;And he said unto her: `Give me thy son.' And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into the upper chamber, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed. <A NAME="an_kg1:17:20">20</A>&nbsp;And he cried unto the LORD, and said: `O LORD my God, hast Thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?' <A NAME="an_kg1:17:21">21</A>&nbsp;And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto the LORD, and said: `O LORD my God, I pray Thee, let this child's soul come back into him.' <A NAME="an_kg1:17:22">22</A>&nbsp;And the LORD hearkened unto the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came back into him, and he revived. <A NAME="an_kg1:17:23">23</A>&nbsp;And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the upper chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother; and Elijah said: `See, thy son liveth.' <A NAME="an_kg1:17:24">24</A>&nbsp;And the woman said to Elijah: `Now I know that thou art a man of God, and that the word of the LORD in thy mouth is truth.'</p>
