### GENESIS CHAPTER 28

<span id="an_gen:28:1">1</span> And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him,
and charged him, and said unto him: 'Thou shalt not take a wife of the
daughters of Canaan. <span id="an_gen:28:2">2</span> Arise, go to
Paddan-aram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's father; and take thee
a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother's brother. <span
id="an_gen:28:3">3</span> And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee
fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a congregation of
peoples; <span id="an_gen:28:4">4</span> and give thee the blessing of
Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit
the land of thy sojournings, which God gave unto Abraham.' <span
id="an_gen:28:5">5</span> And Isaac sent away Jacob; and he went to
Paddan-aram unto Laban, son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of
Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother. <span id="an_gen:28:6">6</span> Now
Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan-aram,
to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him he gave him a
charge, saying: 'Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan';
<span id="an_gen:28:7">7</span> and that Jacob hearkened to his father
and his mother, and was gone to Paddan-aram; <span
id="an_gen:28:8">8</span> and Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan
pleased not Isaac his father; <span id="an_gen:28:9">9</span> so Esau
went unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives that he had Mahalath the
daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebaioth, to be his
wife. <span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

<span id="an_gen:28:10">10</span> And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and
went toward Haran. <span id="an_gen:28:11">11</span> And he lighted upon
the place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he
took one of the stones of the place, and put it under his head, and lay
down in that place to sleep. <span id="an_gen:28:12">12</span> And he
dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it
reached to heaven; and behold the angels of God ascending and descending
on it. <span id="an_gen:28:13">13</span> And, behold, the LORD stood
beside him, and said: 'I am the LORD, the God of Abraham thy father, and
the God of Isaac. The land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it,
and to thy seed. <span id="an_gen:28:14">14</span> And thy seed shall be
as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and
to the east, and to the north, and to the south. And in thee and in thy
seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed. <span
id="an_gen:28:15">15</span> And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep
thee whithersoever thou goest, and will bring thee back into this land;
for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to
thee of.' <span id="an_gen:28:16">16</span> And Jacob awaked out of his
sleep, and he said: 'Surely the LORD is in this place; and I knew it
not.' <span id="an_gen:28:17">17</span> And he was afraid, and said:
'How full of awe is this place! this is none other than the house of
God, and this is the gate of heaven.' <span
id="an_gen:28:18">18</span> And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and
took the stone that he had put under his head, and set it up for a
pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it. <span
id="an_gen:28:19">19</span> And he called the name of that place  <span
id="fr_33"></span>[a](#fn_32) Beth-el, but the name of the city was Luz
at the first. <span id="an_gen:28:20">20</span> And Jacob vowed a vow,
saying: 'If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go,
and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, <span
id="an_gen:28:21">21</span> so that I come back to my father's house in
peace, then shall the LORD be my God, <span
id="an_gen:28:22">22</span> and this stone, which I have set up for a
pillar, shall be God's house; and of all that Thou shalt give me I will
surely give the tenth unto Thee.'
