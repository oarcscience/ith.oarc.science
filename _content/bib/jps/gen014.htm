<p><A NAME="an_gen:14:1">1</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim, <A NAME="an_gen:14:2">2</A>&nbsp;that they made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela&#8212;the same is Zoar. <A NAME="an_gen:14:3">3</A>&nbsp;All these came as allies unto the vale of Siddim&#8212;the same is the Salt Sea. <A NAME="an_gen:14:4">4</A>&nbsp;Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled. <A NAME="an_gen:14:5">5</A>&nbsp;And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim, and the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim, <A NAME="an_gen:14:6">6</A>&nbsp;and the Horites in their mount Seir, unto El-paran, which is by the wilderness. <A NAME="an_gen:14:7">7</A>&nbsp;And they turned back, and came to En-mishpat&#8212;the same is Kadesh&#8212;and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazazon-tamar. <A NAME="an_gen:14:8">8</A>&nbsp;And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela&#8212;the same is Zoar; and they set the battle in array against <a name="page_16"><font size="1" color="green">p. 16</font></A> them in the vale of Siddim; <A NAME="an_gen:14:9">9</A>&nbsp;against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings against the five. <A NAME="an_gen:14:10">10</A>&nbsp;Now the vale of Siddim was full of slime pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and they fell there, and they that remained fled to the mountain. <A NAME="an_gen:14:11">11</A>&nbsp;And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way. <A NAME="an_gen:14:12">12</A>&nbsp;And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed. <A NAME="an_gen:14:13">13</A>&nbsp;And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew&#8212;now he dwelt by the terebinths of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner; and these were confederate with Abram. <A NAME="an_gen:14:14">14</A>&nbsp;And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he led forth his trained men, born in his house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued as far as Dan. <A NAME="an_gen:14:15">15</A>&nbsp;And he divided himself against them by night, he and his servants, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus. <A NAME="an_gen:14:16">16</A>&nbsp;And he brought back all the goods, and also brought back his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people. <A NAME="an_gen:14:17">17</A>&nbsp;And the king of Sodom went out to meet him, after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him, at the vale of Shaveh&#8212;the same is the King's Vale. <A NAME="an_gen:14:18">18</A>&nbsp;And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine; and he was priest of God the Most High. <A NAME="an_gen:14:19">19</A>&nbsp;And he blessed him, and said: 'Blessed be Abram of God Most High, Maker of heaven and earth; <A NAME="an_gen:14:20">20</A>&nbsp;and blessed be God the Most High, who hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand.' And he gave him a tenth of all. <A NAME="an_gen:14:21">21</A>&nbsp;And the king of Sodom said unto Abram: 'Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself.' <A NAME="an_gen:14:22">22</A>&nbsp;And Abram said to the king of Sodom: 'I have lifted up my hand unto the LORD, God Most High, Maker of heaven and earth, <A NAME="an_gen:14:23">23</A>&nbsp;that I will not take a thread nor a shoe-latchet nor aught that is thine, lest thou shouldest say: I have made Abram rich; <A NAME="an_gen:14:24">24</A>&nbsp;save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre, let them take their portion.'</p>
