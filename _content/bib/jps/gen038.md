### GENESIS CHAPTER 38

<span id="an_gen:38:1">1</span> And it came to pass at that time, that
Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain
Adullamite, whose name was Hirah. <span id="an_gen:38:2">2</span> And
Judah saw there a daughter of a' certain Canaanite whose name was Shua;
and he took her, and went in unto her. <span
id="an_gen:38:3">3</span> And she conceived, and bore a son; and he
called his name Er. <span id="an_gen:38:4">4</span> And she conceived
again, and bore a son; and she called his name Onan. <span
id="an_gen:38:5">5</span> And she yet again bore a son, and called his
name Shelah; and he was at Chezib, when she bore him. <span
id="an_gen:38:6">6</span> And Judah took a wife for Er his first-born,
and her name was Tamar. <span id="an_gen:38:7">7</span> And Er, Judah's
first-born, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD slew him.
<span id="an_gen:38:8">8</span> And Judah said unto Onan: 'Go in unto
thy brother's wife, and perform the duty of a husband's brother unto
her, and raise up seed to thy brother.' <span
id="an_gen:38:9">9</span> And Onan knew that the seed would not be his;
and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he
spilled it on the ground, lest he should give seed to his brother. <span
id="an_gen:38:10">10</span> And the thing which he did was evil in the
sight of the LORD; and He slew him also. <span
id="an_gen:38:11">11</span> Then said Judah to Tamar his
daughter-in-law: 'Remain a widow in thy father's house, till Shelah my
son be grown up'; for he said: 'Lest he also die, like his brethren.'
And Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house. <span
id="an_gen:38:12">12</span> And in process of time Shua's daughter, the
wife of Judah, died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his
sheep-shearers to Timnah, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite. <span
id="an_gen:38:13">13</span> And it was told Tamar, saying: 'Behold, thy
father-in-law goeth up to Timnah to shear his sheep.' <span
id="an_gen:38:14">14</span> And she put off from her the garments of her
widowhood, and covered herself with her veil, and wrapped herself, and
sat in the entrance of Enaim, which is by the way to Timnah; for she saw
that Shelah was grown up, and she was not given unto him to wife. <span
id="an_gen:38:15">15</span> When Judah saw her, he thought her to be a
harlot; for she had covered her face. <span
id="an_gen:38:16">16</span> And he turned unto her by the way, and said:
'Come, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee'; for he knew not that she
was his daughter-in-law. And she said: 'What wilt thou give me, that
thou mayest come in unto me?' <span id="an_gen:38:17">17</span> And he
said: 'I will send thee a kid of the goats from the flock.' And she
said: 'Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?' <span
id="an_gen:38:18">18</span> And he said: 'What pledge shall I give
thee?' And she said: 'Thy signet and thy cord, and thy staff that is in
thy hand.' And he gave them to her, and came in unto her, and she
conceived by him. <span id="an_gen:38:19">19</span> And she arose, and
went away, and put off her veil from her, and put on the garments of her
widowhood. <span id="an_gen:38:20">20</span> And Judah sent the kid of
the goats by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive the
pledge from the woman's hand; but he found her not. <span
id="an_gen:38:21">21</span> Then he asked the men of her place, saying:
'Where is the harlot, that was at Enaim by the wayside?' And they said:
'There hath been no harlot here.' <span id="an_gen:38:22">22</span> And
he returned to Judah, <span id="page_48">p. 48</span> and said: 'I have
not found her: and also the men of the place said: There hath been no
harlot here.' <span id="an_gen:38:23">23</span> And Judah said: 'Let her
take it, lest we be put to shame; behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast
not found her.' <span id="an_gen:38:24">24</span> And it came to pass
about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying: 'Tamar thy
daughter-in-law hath played the harlot; and moreover, behold, she is
with child by harlotry.' And Judah said: 'Bring her forth, and let her
be burnt.' <span id="an_gen:38:25">25</span> When she was brought forth,
she sent to her father-in-law, saying: 'By the man, whose these are, am
I with child'; and she said: 'Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the
signet, and the cords, and the staff.' <span
id="an_gen:38:26">26</span> And Judah acknowledged them, and said: 'She
is more righteous than I; forasmuch as I gave her not to Shelah my son.'
And he knew her again no more. <span id="an_gen:38:27">27</span> And it
came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her
womb. <span id="an_gen:38:28">28</span> And it came to pass, when she
travailed, that one put out a hand; and the midwife took and bound upon
his hand a scarlet thread, saying: 'This came out first.' <span
id="an_gen:38:29">29</span> And it came to pass, as he drew back his
hand, that, behold, his brother came out; and she said: 'Wherefore hast
thou made a breach for thyself?' Therefore his name was called  <span
id="fr_65"></span>[a](#fn_64) Perez. <span
id="an_gen:38:30">30</span> And afterward came out his brother, that had
the scarlet thread upon his hand; and his name was called Zerah.
