<p><A NAME="an_sa2:7:1">1</A>&nbsp; And it came to pass, when the king dwelt in his house, and the LORD had given him rest from all his enemies round about, <A NAME="an_sa2:7:2">2</A>&nbsp; that the king said unto Nathan the prophet: `See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains.' <A NAME="an_sa2:7:3">3</A>&nbsp; And Nathan said to the king: `Go, do all that is in thy heart; for the LORD is with thee.' <A NAME="an_sa2:7:4">4</A>&nbsp; And it came to pass the same night, that the word of the LORD came unto Nathan, saying: <A NAME="an_sa2:7:5">5</A>&nbsp; `Go and tell My servant David: Thus saith the LORD: Shalt thou build Me a house for Me to dwell in? <A NAME="an_sa2:7:6">6</A>&nbsp; for I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle. <A NAME="an_sa2:7:7">7</A>&nbsp; In all places wherein I have walked among all the children of Israel, spoke I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feed My people Israel, saying: Why have ye not built Me a house of cedar? <A NAME="an_sa2:7:8">8</A>&nbsp; Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto My servant David: Thus saith the LORD of hosts: I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be prince over My people, over Israel. <A NAME="an_sa2:7:9">9</A>&nbsp; And I have</p>  
<p><a name="page_374"><font size="1" color="green">p. 374</font></A></p>  
<p>been with thee whithersoever thou didst go, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee; and I will make thee a great name, like unto the name of the great ones that are in the earth. <A NAME="an_sa2:7:10">10</A>&nbsp; And I will appoint a place for My people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be disquieted no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as at the first, <A NAME="an_sa2:7:11">11</A>&nbsp; even from the day that I commanded judges to be over My people Israel; and I will cause thee to rest from all thine enemies. Moreover the LORD telleth thee that the LORD will make thee a house. <A NAME="an_sa2:7:12">12</A>&nbsp; When thy days are fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, that shall proceed out of thy body, and I will establish his kingdom. <A NAME="an_sa2:7:13">13</A>&nbsp; He shall build a house for My name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever. <A NAME="an_sa2:7:14">14</A>&nbsp; I will be to him for a father, and he shall be to Me for a son; if he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men; <A NAME="an_sa2:7:15">15</A>&nbsp; but My mercy shall not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before thee. <A NAME="an_sa2:7:16">16</A>&nbsp; And thy house and thy kingdom shall be made sure for ever before thee; thy throne shall be established for ever.' <A NAME="an_sa2:7:17">17</A>&nbsp; According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_sa2:7:18">18</A>&nbsp; Then David the king went in, and sat before the LORD; and he said: `Who am I, O Lord GOD, and what is my house, that Thou hast brought me thus far? <A NAME="an_sa2:7:19">19</A>&nbsp; And this was yet a small thing in Thine eyes, O Lord GOD; but Thou hast spoken also of Thy servant's house for a great while to come; and this too after the manner of great men, O Lord GOD. <A NAME="an_sa2:7:20">20</A>&nbsp; And what can David say more unto Thee? for Thou knowest Thy servant, O Lord GOD. <A NAME="an_sa2:7:21">21</A>&nbsp; For Thy word's sake, and according to Thine own heart, hast Thou wrought all this greatness, to make Thy servant know it. <A NAME="an_sa2:7:22">22</A>&nbsp; Therefore Thou art great, O LORD GOD; for there is none like Thee, neither is there any God beside Thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears. <A NAME="an_sa2:7:23">23</A>&nbsp; And who is like Thy people, like Israel, a nation one in the earth, whom God went to redeem unto Himself for a people, and to make Him a name, and to do for Thy land great things and tremendous, even for you, [in driving out] from before Thy people, whom Thou didst redeem to Thee out of Egypt, the nations and their gods? <A NAME="an_sa2:7:24">24</A>&nbsp; And Thou didst establish to Thyself Thy people Israel to be a people unto Thee for ever; and Thou, LORD, becamest their God. <A NAME="an_sa2:7:25">25</A>&nbsp; And now, O LORD God, the word that Thou hast spoken concerning Thy servant, and concerning his house, confirm Thou it for ever, and do as Thou hast spoken. <A NAME="an_sa2:7:26">26</A>&nbsp; And let Thy name be magnified for ever, that it may be said: The LORD of hosts is God over Israel; and the house of Thy servant David shall be established before Thee. <A NAME="an_sa2:7:27">27</A>&nbsp; For Thou, O LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, hast revealed to Thy servant, saying: I will build thee a house; therefore hath Thy servant taken heart to pray this prayer unto Thee. <A NAME="an_sa2:7:28">28</A>&nbsp; And now, O Lord God, Thou alone art God, and Thy words are truth, and Thou hast promised this good thing unto Thy servant; <A NAME="an_sa2:7:29">29</A>&nbsp; now therefore let it please Thee to bless the house of Thy servant, that it may continue for ever before Thee; for Thou, O Lord GOD, hast spoken it; and through Thy blessing let the house of Thy servant be blessed for ever.'</p>
