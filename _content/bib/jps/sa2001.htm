<p><A NAME="an_sa2:1:1">1</A>&nbsp; AND it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag; <A NAME="an_sa2:1:2">2</A>&nbsp; it came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head; and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and prostrated himself. <A NAME="an_sa2:1:3">3</A>&nbsp; And David said unto him: `From whence comest thou?' And he said unto him: `Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.' <A NAME="an_sa2:1:4">4</A>&nbsp; And David said unto him: `How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me.' And he answered: `The people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.' <A NAME="an_sa2:1:5">5</A>&nbsp; And David said unto the young man that told him: `How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?' <A NAME="an_sa2:1:6">6</A>&nbsp; And the young man that told him said: `As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and the horsemen pressed hard upon him. <A NAME="an_sa2:1:7">7</A>&nbsp; And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered: Here am I. <A NAME="an_sa2:1:8">8</A>&nbsp; And he said unto me: Who art thou? And I answered him: I am an Amalekite. <A NAME="an_sa2:1:9">9</A>&nbsp; And he said unto me: Stand, I pray thee, beside me, and slay me, for the agony hath taken hold of me; because my life is just yet in me. <A NAME="an_sa2:1:10">10</A>&nbsp; So I stood beside him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen; and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.'</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_sa2:1:11">11</A>&nbsp; Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him. <A NAME="an_sa2:1:12">12</A>&nbsp; And they wailed, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword. <A NAME="an_sa2:1:13">13</A>&nbsp; And David said unto the young man that told him: `Whence art thou?' And he answered: `I am the son of an Amalekite stranger.' <A NAME="an_sa2:1:14">14</A>&nbsp; And David said unto him: `How wast thou not afraid to put forth thy hand to destroy the LORD's anointed?' <A NAME="an_sa2:1:15">15</A>&nbsp; And David called one of the young men, and said: `Go near, and fall upon him.' And he smote him that he died. <A NAME="an_sa2:1:16">16</A>&nbsp; And David said unto him: `Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying: I have slain the LORD's anointed.'</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_sa2:1:17">17</A>&nbsp; And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son, <A NAME="an_sa2:1:18">18</A>&nbsp; and said&#8212;To teach the sons of Judah the bow. Behold, it is written in the book of Jashar:</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_sa2:1:19">19</A>&nbsp; Thy beauty, O Israel, upon thy high places is slain!<br> How are the mighty fallen!</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_sa2:1:20">20</A>&nbsp; Tell it not in Gath,<br> Publish it not in the streets of Ashkelon; <a name="page_367"><font size="1" color="green">p. 367</font></A><br> Lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice,<br> Lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.<br> <A NAME="an_sa2:1:21">21</A>&nbsp; Ye mountains of Gilboa,<br> Let there be no dew nor rain upon you,<br> Neither fields of choice fruits;<br> For there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away,<br> The shield of Saul, not anointed with oil.<br> <A NAME="an_sa2:1:22">22</A>&nbsp; From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty,<br> The bow of Jonathan turned not back,<br> And the sword of Saul returned not empty.<br> <A NAME="an_sa2:1:23">23</A>&nbsp; Saul and Jonathan, the lovely and the pleasant<br> In their lives, even in their death they were not divided;<br> They were swifter than eagles,<br> They were stronger than lions.<br> <A NAME="an_sa2:1:24">24</A>&nbsp; Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul,<br> Who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights,<br> Who put ornaments of gold upon your apparel.<br> <A NAME="an_sa2:1:25">25</A>&nbsp; How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle!</p>  
<p>Jonathan upon thy high places is slain!<br> <A NAME="an_sa2:1:26">26</A>&nbsp; I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan;<br> Very pleasant hast thou been unto me;<br> Wonderful was thy love to me,<br> Passing the love of women.<br> <A NAME="an_sa2:1:27">27</A>&nbsp; How are the mighty fallen,<br> And the weapons of war perished!</p>
