<p><A NAME="an_exo:19:1">1</A> In the third month after the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai. <A NAME="an_exo:19:2">2</A>&nbsp;And when they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the wilderness of Sinai, they encamped in the wilderness; and there Israel encamped before the mount. <A NAME="an_exo:19:3">3</A>&nbsp;And Moses went up unto God, and the LORD called unto him out of the mountain, saying: 'Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel: <A NAME="an_exo:19:4">4</A>&nbsp;Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles&#8217; wings, and brought you unto Myself. <A NAME="an_exo:19:5">5</A>&nbsp;Now therefore, if ye will hearken unto My voice indeed, and keep My covenant, then ye shall be Mine own treasure from among all peoples; for all the earth is Mine; <A NAME="an_exo:19:6">6</A>&nbsp;and ye shall be unto Me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel.' <A NAME="an_exo:19:7">7</A>&nbsp;And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and set before them all these words which the LORD commanded him. <A NAME="an_exo:19:8">8</A>&nbsp;And all the <a name="page_88"><font size="1" color="green">p. 88</font></A> people answered together, and said: 'All that the LORD hath spoken we will do.' And Moses reported the words of the people unto the LORD. <A NAME="an_exo:19:9">9</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said unto Moses: 'Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and may also believe thee for ever.' And Moses told the words of the people unto the LORD. <A NAME="an_exo:19:10">10</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said unto Moses: 'Go unto the people, and sanctify them to-day and to-morrow, and let them wash their garments, rand be ready against the third day; for the third day the LORD will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai. <A NAME="an_exo:19:12">12</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying: Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it; whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death; <A NAME="an_exo:19:13">13</A>&nbsp;no hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live; when the ram's horn soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.' <A NAME="an_exo:19:14">14</A>&nbsp;And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their garments. <A NAME="an_exo:19:15">15</A>&nbsp;And he said unto the people: 'Be ready against the third day; come not near a woman.' <A NAME="an_exo:19:16">16</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass on the third day, when it was morning, that there were thunders and lightnings and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of a horn exceeding loud; and all the people that were in the camp trembled. <A NAME="an_exo:19:17">17</A>&nbsp;And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount. <A NAME="an_exo:19:18">18</A>&nbsp;Now mount Sinai was altogether on smoke, because the LORD descended upon it in fire; and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly. <A NAME="an_exo:19:19">19</A>&nbsp;And when the voice of the horn waxed louder and louder Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice. <A NAME="an_exo:19:20">20</A>&nbsp;And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, to the top of the mount; and the LORD called Moses to the top of the mount; and Moses went up. <A NAME="an_exo:19:21">21</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said unto Moses: 'Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish. <A NAME="an_exo:19:22">22</A>&nbsp;And let the priests also, that come near to the LORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them'. <A NAME="an_exo:19:23">23</A>&nbsp;And Moses said unto the LORD: 'The people cannot come up to mount Sinai; for thou didst charge us, saying: Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it.' <A NAME="an_exo:19:24">24</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said unto him: 'Go, get thee down, and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee; but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the LORD, lest He break forth upon them.' <A NAME="an_exo:19:25">25</A>&nbsp;So Moses went down unto the people, and told them.</p>
