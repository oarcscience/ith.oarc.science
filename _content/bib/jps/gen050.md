### GENESIS CHAPTER 50

<span id="an_gen:50:1">1</span> And Joseph fell upon his father's face,
and wept upon him, and kissed him. <span id="an_gen:50:2">2</span> And
Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father. And
the physicians embalmed Israel. <span id="an_gen:50:3">3</span> And
forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of
embalming. And the Egyptians wept for him threescore and ten days.

<span id="an_gen:50:4">4</span> And when the days of weeping for him
were past, Joseph spoke unto the house of Pharaoh, saying: 'If now I
have found favour in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of
Pharaoh, saying: <span id="an_gen:50:5">5</span> My father made me
swear, saying: Lo, I die; in my grave which I have digged for me in the
land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I
pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come back.' <span
id="an_gen:50:6">6</span> And Pharaoh said: 'Go up, and bury thy father,
according as he made thee swear.' <span id="an_gen:50:7">7</span> And
Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the servants
of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of
Egypt, <span id="an_gen:50:8">8</span> and all the house of Joseph, and
his brethren, and his father's house; only their little ones, and their
flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen. <span
id="an_gen:50:9">9</span> And there went up with him both chariots and
horsemen; and it was a very great company. <span
id="an_gen:50:10">10</span> And they came to the threshing-floor of
Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, and there they wailed with a very
great and sore wailing; and he made a mourning for his father seven
days. <span id="an_gen:50:11">11</span> And when the inhabitants of the
land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said:
'This is a grievous  <span id="fr_72"></span>[a](#fn_71) mourning to the
Egyptians.' Wherefore the name of it was called Abel-mizraim, which is
beyond the Jordan. <span id="an_gen:50:12">12</span> And his sons did
unto him according as he commanded them. <span
id="an_gen:50:13">13</span> For his sons carried him into the land of
Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which
Abraham bought with the field, for a possession of a burying-place, of
Ephron the Hittite, in front of Mamre.

<span id="an_gen:50:14">14</span> And Joseph returned into Egypt, he,
and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father,
after he had buried his father. <span id="an_gen:50:15">15</span> And
when <span id="page_64">p. 64</span> Joseph's brethren saw that their
father was dead, they said: 'It may be that Joseph will hate us, and
will fully requite us all the evil which we did unto him.' <span
id="an_gen:50:16">16</span> And they sent a message unto Joseph, saying:
'Thy father did command before he died, saying: <span
id="an_gen:50:17">17</span> So shall ye say unto Joseph: Forgive, I pray
thee now, the transgression of thy brethren, and their sin, for that
they did unto thee evil. And now, we pray thee, forgive the
transgression of the servants of the God of thy father.' And Joseph wept
when they spoke unto him. <span id="an_gen:50:18">18</span> And his
brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said:
'Behold, we are thy bondmen.' <span id="an_gen:50:19">19</span> And
Joseph said unto them: 'Fear not; for am I in the place of God? <span
id="an_gen:50:20">20</span> And as for you, ye meant evil against me;
but God meant it for good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save
much people alive. <span id="an_gen:50:21">21</span> Now therefore fear
ye not; I will sustain you, and your little ones.' And he comforted
them, and spoke kindly unto them.

<span id="an_gen:50:22">22</span> And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his
father's house; and Joseph lived a hundred and ten years. <span
id="an_gen:50:23">23</span> And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the
third generation; the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were
born upon Joseph's knees. <span id="an_gen:50:24">24</span> And Joseph
said unto his brethren: 'I die; but God will surely remember you, and
bring you up out of this land unto the land which He swore to Abraham,
to Isaac, and to Jacob.' <span id="an_gen:50:25">25</span> And Joseph
took an oath of the children of Israel, saying: 'God will surely
remember you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.' <span
id="an_gen:50:26">26</span> So Joseph died, being a hundred and ten
years old. And they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.
