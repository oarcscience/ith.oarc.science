<p><A NAME="an_kg2:5:1">1</A>&nbsp;Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Aram, was a great man with his master, and held in esteem, because by him the LORD had given victory unto Aram; he was also a mighty man of valour, but he was a leper. <A NAME="an_kg2:5:2">2</A>&nbsp;And the Arameans had gone out in bands, and had</p>  
<p><a name="page_447"><font size="1" color="green">p. 447</font></A></p>  
<p>brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and she waited on Naaman's wife. <A NAME="an_kg2:5:3">3</A>&nbsp;And she said unto her mistress: `Would that my lord were with the prophet that is in Samaria! then would he recover him of his leprosy.' <A NAME="an_kg2:5:4">4</A>&nbsp;And he went in, and told his lord, saying: `Thus and thus said the maid that is of the land of Israel.' <A NAME="an_kg2:5:5">5</A>&nbsp;And the king of Aram said: `Go now, and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel.' And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of raiment. <A NAME="an_kg2:5:6">6</A>&nbsp;And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying: `And now when this letter is come unto thee, behold, I have sent Naaman my servant to thee, that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy.' <A NAME="an_kg2:5:7">7</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said: `Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy? but consider, I pray you, and see how he seeketh an occasion against me.'</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_kg2:5:8">8</A>&nbsp;And it was so, when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying: `Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.' <A NAME="an_kg2:5:9">9</A>&nbsp;So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariots, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha. <A NAME="an_kg2:5:10">10</A>&nbsp;And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying: `Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come back to thee, and thou shalt be clean.' <A NAME="an_kg2:5:11">11</A>&nbsp;But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said: `Behold, I thought: He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the LORD his God, and wave his hand over the place, and recover the leper. <A NAME="an_kg2:5:12">12</A>&nbsp;Are not Amanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean?' So he turned, and went away in a rage. <A NAME="an_kg2:5:13">13</A>&nbsp;And his servants came near, and spoke unto him, and said: `My father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest thou not have done it? how much rather then, when he saith to thee: Wash, and be clean?' <A NAME="an_kg2:5:14">14</A>&nbsp;Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God; and his flesh came back like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_kg2:5:15">15</A>&nbsp;And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him; and he said: `Behold now, I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel; now therefore, I pray thee, take a present of thy servant.' <A NAME="an_kg2:5:16">16</A>&nbsp;But he said: `As the LORD liveth, before whom I stand, I will receive none.' And he urged him to take it; but he refused. <A NAME="an_kg2:5:17">17</A>&nbsp;And Naaman said: `If not, yet I pray thee let there be given to thy servant two mules' burden of earth; for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt-offering nor sacrifice unto other gods, but unto the LORD. <A NAME="an_kg2:5:18">18</A>&nbsp;In this thing the LORD pardon thy servant: when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I prostrate myself in the house of Rimmon, when I prostrate myself in the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon thy servant in this thing.' <A NAME="an_kg2:5:19">19</A>&nbsp;And he said unto him: `Go in peace.' So he departed from him some way.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_kg2:5:20">20</A>&nbsp;But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha</p>  
<p><a name="page_448"><font size="1" color="green">p. 448</font></A></p>  
<p>the man of God, said: `Behold, my master hath spared this Naaman the Aramean, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought; as the LORD liveth, I will surely run after him, and take somewhat of him.' <A NAME="an_kg2:5:21">21</A>&nbsp;So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw one running after him, he alighted from the chariot to meet him, and said: `Is all well?' <A NAME="an_kg2:5:22">22</A>&nbsp;And he said: `All is well. My master hath sent me, saying: Behold, even now there are come to me from the hill-country of Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets; give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and two changes of raiment.' <A NAME="an_kg2:5:23">23</A>&nbsp;And Naaman said: `Be content, take two talents.' And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of raiment, and laid them upon two of his servants; and they bore them before him. <A NAME="an_kg2:5:24">24</A>&nbsp;And when he came to the hill, he took them from their hand, and deposited them in the house; and he let the men go, and they departed. <A NAME="an_kg2:5:25">25</A>&nbsp;But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said unto him: `Whence comest thou, Gehazi?' And he said: `Thy servant went no whither.' <A NAME="an_kg2:5:26">26</A>&nbsp;And he said unto him: `Went not my heart [with thee], when the man turned back from his chariot to meet thee? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and olive-yards and vineyards, and sheep and oxen, and men-servants and maidservants? <A NAME="an_kg2:5:27">27</A>&nbsp;The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy seed for ever.' And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow.</p>
