<p><A NAME="an_sa1:16:1">1</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said unto Samuel: `How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from being king over Israel? fill thy horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Beth-lehemite; for I have provided Me a king among his sons.' <A NAME="an_sa1:16:2">2</A>&nbsp;And Samuel said: `How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me.' And the LORD said: `Take a heifer with thee, and say: I am come to sacrifice to the LORD. <A NAME="an_sa1:16:3">3</A>&nbsp;And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will tell thee what thou shalt do; and thou shalt anoint unto Me him whom I name unto thee.' <A NAME="an_sa1:16:4">4</A>&nbsp;And Samuel did that which the LORD spoke, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the city came to meet him trembling, and said: `Comest thou peaceably?' <A NAME="an_sa1:16:5">5</A>&nbsp;And he said : `Peaceably; I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD; sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice.' And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice. <A NAME="an_sa1:16:6">6</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when they were come, that he beheld Eliab, and said: `Surely the LORD'S anointed is before Him.' <A NAME="an_sa1:16:7">7</A>&nbsp;But the LORD said unto Samuel: `Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have rejected him; for it is not as man seeth: for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart.' <A NAME="an_sa1:16:8">8</A>&nbsp;Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said: `Neither hath the LORD chosen this.' <A NAME="an_sa1:16:9">9</A>&nbsp;Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said: `Neither hath the LORD chosen this.' <A NAME="an_sa1:16:10">10</A>&nbsp;And Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse: `The LORD hath not chosen these.' <A NAME="an_sa1:16:11">11</A>&nbsp;And Samuel said unto Jesse: `Are here all thy children?' And he said: `There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep.' And Samuel said unto Jesse: `Send and fetch him; for we will not sit down till he come hither.' <A NAME="an_sa1:16:12">12</A>&nbsp;And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of beautiful eyes, and goodly to look upon. And the LORD said: `Arise, anoint him; for this is he.' <A NAME="an_sa1:16:13">13</A>&nbsp;Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren; and the spirit of the LORD came mightily upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_sa1:16:14">14</A>&nbsp;Now the spirit of the LORD had departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD terrified him. <A NAME="an_sa1:16:15">15</A>&nbsp;And Saul's servants said unto him: `Behold now, an evil spirit from God</p>  
<p><a name="page_345"><font size="1" color="green">p. 345</font></A></p>  
<p>terrifieth thee. <A NAME="an_sa1:16:16">16</A>&nbsp;Let our lord now command thy servants, that are before thee, to seek out a man who is a skilful player on the harp; and it shall be, when the evil spirit from God cometh upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.' <A NAME="an_sa1:16:17">17</A>&nbsp;And Saul said unto his servants: `Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me.' <A NAME="an_sa1:16:18">18</A>&nbsp;Then answered one of the young men, and said: `Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Beth-lehemite, that is skilful in playing, and a mighty man of valour, and a man of war, and prudent in affairs, and a comely person, and the LORD is with him.' <A NAME="an_sa1:16:19">19</A>&nbsp;Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said: `Send me David thy son, who is with the sheep.' <A NAME="an_sa1:16:20">20</A>&nbsp;And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by David his son unto Saul. <A NAME="an_sa1:16:21">21</A>&nbsp;And David came to Saul, and stood before him; and he loved him greatly; and he became his armour-bearer. <A NAME="an_sa1:16:22">22</A>&nbsp;And Saul sent to Jesse, saying: `Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favour in my sight.' <A NAME="an_sa1:16:23">23</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when the [evil] spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took the harp, and played with his hand; so Saul found relief, and it was well with him, and the evil spirit departed from him.</p>
