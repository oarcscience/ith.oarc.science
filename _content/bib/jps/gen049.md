### GENESIS CHAPTER 49

<span id="an_gen:49:1">1</span> And Jacob called unto his sons, and
said: 'Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall
befall you in the end of days.

<span id="an_gen:49:2">2</span> Assemble yourselves, and hear, ye sons
of Jacob;  
And hearken unto Israel your father.  
<span id="an_gen:49:3">3</span> Reuben, thou art my first-born,  
My might, and the first-fruits of my strength;  
The excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power.  
<span id="an_gen:49:4">4</span> Unstable as water, have not thou the
excellency;  
Because thou wentest up to thy father's bed;  
Then defiledst thou it—he went up to my couch.

<span id="an_gen:49:5">5</span> Simeon and Levi are brethren;  
Weapons of violence their kinship.  
<span id="an_gen:49:6">6</span> Let my soul not come into their
council;  
Unto their assembly let my glory not be united; <span id="page_62">p.
62</span>

For in their anger they slew men,  
And in their self-will they houghed oxen  
<span id="an_gen:49:7">7</span> Cursed be their anger, for it was
fierce,  
And their wrath, for it was cruel;  
I will divide them in Jacob,  
And scatter them in Israel.

<span id="an_gen:49:8">8</span> Judah, thee shall thy brethren praise;  
Thy hand shall be on the neck of thine enemies;  
Thy father's sons shall bow down before thee.  
<span id="an_gen:49:9">9</span> Judah is a lion's whelp;  
From the prey, my son, thou art gone up.  
He stooped down, he couched as a lion,  
And as a lioness; who shall rouse him up?  
<span id="an_gen:49:10">10</span> The sceptre shall not depart from
Judah,  
Nor the ruler's staff from between his feet,  
As long as men come to Shiloh;  
And unto him shall the obedience of the peoples be.  
<span id="an_gen:49:11">11</span> Binding his foal unto the vine,  
And his ass's colt unto the choice vine;  
He washeth his garments in wine,  
And his vesture in the blood of grapes;  
<span id="an_gen:49:12">12</span> His eyes shall be red with wine,  
And his teeth white with milk.

<span id="an_gen:49:13">13</span> Zebulun shall dwell at the shore of
the sea,  
And he shall be a shore for ships,  
And his flank shall be upon Zidon.

<span id="an_gen:49:14">14</span> Issachar is a large-boned ass,  
Couching down between the sheep- folds.  
<span id="an_gen:49:15">15</span> For he saw a resting-place that it was
good,  
And the land that it was pleasant;  
And he bowed his shoulder to bear,  
And became a servant under task-work.

<span id="an_gen:49:16">16</span> Dan shall judge his people,  
As one of the tribes of Israel.  
<span id="an_gen:49:17">17</span> Dan shall be a serpent in the way,  
A horned snake in the path,  
That biteth the horse's heels,  
So that his rider falleth backward.  
<span id="an_gen:49:18">18</span> I wait for Thy salvation, O Lord.

<span id="an_gen:49:19">19</span> Gad,  <span
id="fr_70"></span>[a](#fn_69) a troop  <span
id="fr_71"></span>[b](#fn_70) shall troop upon him;  
But he shall troop upon their heel.

<span id="an_gen:49:20">20</span> As for Asher, his bread shall be
fat,  
And he shall yield royal dainties.

<span id="an_gen:49:21">21</span> Naphtali is a hind let loose:  
He giveth goodly words.

<span id="an_gen:49:22">22</span> Joseph is a fruitful vine,  
A fruitful vine by a fountain;  
Its branches run over the wall.  
<span id="an_gen:49:23">23</span> The archers have dealt bitterly with
him,  
And shot at him, and hated him;  
<span id="an_gen:49:24">24</span> But his bow abode firm,  
And the arms of his hands were made supple,  
By the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob,  
From thence, from the Shepherd, the Stone of Israel,  
<span id="an_gen:49:25">25</span> Even by the God of thy father, who
shall help thee,  
And by the Almighty, who shall bless thee,  
With blessings of heaven above,  
Blessings of the deep that coucheth beneath,  
Blessings of the breasts, and of the womb.  
<span id="an_gen:49:26">26</span> The blessings of thy father  
Are mighty beyond the blessings of my progenitors <span id="page_63">p.
63</span>  
Unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills;  
They shall be on the head of Joseph,  
And on the crown of the head of  
the prince among his brethren.

<span id="an_gen:49:27">27</span> Benjamin is a wolf that raveneth;  
In the morning he devoureth the prey,  
And at even he divideth the spoil.'

<span id="an_gen:49:28">28</span> All these are the twelve tribes of
Israel, and this is it that their father spoke unto them and blessed
them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them. <span
id="an_gen:49:29">29</span> And he charged them, and said unto them: 'I
am to be gathered unto my people; bury me with my fathers in the cave
that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite, <span
id="an_gen:49:30">30</span> in the cave that is in the field of
Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham
bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a
burying-place. <span id="an_gen:49:31">31</span> There they buried
Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his
wife; and there I buried Leah. <span id="an_gen:49:32">32</span> The
field and the cave that is therein, which was purchased from the
children of Heth.' <span id="an_gen:49:33">33</span> And when Jacob made
an end of charging his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and
expired, and was gathered unto his people.
