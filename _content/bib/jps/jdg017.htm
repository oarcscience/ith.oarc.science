<p><A NAME="an_jdg:17:1">1</A>&nbsp;Now there was a man of the hill-country of Ephraim, whose name was Micah. <A NAME="an_jdg:17:2">2</A>&nbsp;And he said unto his mother: `The eleven hundred pieces of silver that were taken from thee, about which thou didst utter a curse, and didst also speak it in mine ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it.' And his mother said: `Blessed be my son of the LORD.' <A NAME="an_jdg:17:3">3</A>&nbsp;And he restored the eleven hundred pieces of silver to his mother, and his mother said: `I verily dedicate the silver unto the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image; now therefore I will restore it unto thee.' <A NAME="an_jdg:17:4">4</A>&nbsp;And when he restored the money unto his mother, his mother took two hundred pieces of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image; and it was in the house of Micah. <A NAME="an_jdg:17:5">5</A>&nbsp;And the man Micah had a house of God, and he made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated</p>

<p>one of his sons, who became his priest. <A NAME="an_jdg:17:6">6</A>&nbsp;In those days there was no king in Israel; every man did that which was right in his own eyes.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_jdg:17:7">7</A>&nbsp;And there was a young man out of Beth-lehem in Judah&#8212;in the family of Judah-who was a Levite, and he sojourned there. <A NAME="an_jdg:17:8">8</A>&nbsp;And the man departed out of the city, out of Beth-lehem in Judah, to sojourn where he could find a place; and he came to the hill-country of Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed. <A NAME="an_jdg:17:9">9</A>&nbsp;And Micah said unto him: `Whence comest thou?' And he said unto him: `I am a Levite of Beth-lehem in Judah, and I go to sojourn where I may find a place.' <A NAME="an_jdg:17:10">10</A>&nbsp;And Micah said unto him: `Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and I will give thee ten pieces of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals.' So the Levite went in. <A NAME="an_jdg:17:11">11</A>&nbsp;And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons. <A NAME="an_jdg:17:12">12</A>&nbsp;And Micah consecrated the Levite, and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah. <A NAME="an_jdg:17:13">13</A>&nbsp;Then said Micah: `Now know I that the LORD will do me good, seeing I have a Levite as my priest.'</p>
