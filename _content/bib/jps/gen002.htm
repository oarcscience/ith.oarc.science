<p><A NAME="an_gen:2:1">1</A>&nbsp;And the heaven and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. <A NAME="an_gen:2:2">2</A>&nbsp;And on the seventh day God finished His work which He had made; and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had made. <A NAME="an_gen:2:3">3</A>&nbsp;And God blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it; because that in it He rested from all His work which God in creating had made.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_gen:2:4">4</A>&nbsp;These are the generations of the heaven and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made earth and heaven.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_gen:2:5">5</A>&nbsp;No shrub of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up; for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground; <A NAME="an_gen:2:6">6</A>&nbsp;but there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground. <A NAME="an_gen:2:7">7</A>&nbsp;Then the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul. <A NAME="an_gen:2:8">8</A>&nbsp;And the LORD God planted a garden eastward, in Eden; and there He put the man whom He had formed. <A NAME="an_gen:2:9">9</A>&nbsp;And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. <A NAME="an_gen:2:10">10</A>&nbsp;And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became four heads. <A NAME="an_gen:2:11">11</A>&nbsp;The name of the first is Pishon; that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold; <A NAME="an_gen:2:12">12</A>&nbsp;and the gold of that land is good; there is bdellium and the onyx stone. <A NAME="an_gen:2:13">13</A>&nbsp;And the name of the second river is Gihon; the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Cush. <A NAME="an_gen:2:14">14</A>&nbsp;And the name of the third river is &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5"></A><A HREF="#fn_4"><FONT SIZE="1">a</FONT></A>
Tigris; that is it which goeth toward the east of Asshur. And the fourth river is the Euphrates. <A NAME="an_gen:2:15">15</A>&nbsp;And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. <A NAME="an_gen:2:16">16</A>&nbsp;And the LORD God commanded the man, saying: 'Of every tree of the garden thou <a name="page_5"><font size="1" color="green">p. 5</font></A> mayest freely eat; <A NAME="an_gen:2:17">17</A>&nbsp;but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.'</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_gen:2:18">18</A>&nbsp;And the LORD God said: 'It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a help meet for him.' <A NAME="an_gen:2:19">19</A>&nbsp;And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto the man to see what he would call them; and whatsoever the man would call every living creature, that was to be the name thereof. <A NAME="an_gen:2:20">20</A>&nbsp;And the man gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found a help meet for him. <A NAME="an_gen:2:21">21</A>&nbsp;And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; and He took one of his ribs, and closed up the place with flesh instead thereof. <A NAME="an_gen:2:22">22</A>&nbsp;And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from the man, made He a woman, and brought her unto the man. <A NAME="an_gen:2:23">23</A>&nbsp;And the man said: 'This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6"></A><A HREF="#fn_5"><FONT SIZE="1">a</FONT></A>
Woman, because she was taken out of &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_7"></A><A HREF="#fn_6"><FONT SIZE="1">b</FONT></A>
Man.' <A NAME="an_gen:2:24">24</A>&nbsp;Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife, and they shall be one flesh. <A NAME="an_gen:2:25">25</A>&nbsp;And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.</p>
