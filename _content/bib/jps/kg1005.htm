<p><A NAME="an_kg1:5:1">1</A>&nbsp;And Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the River unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt; they brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_kg1:5:2">2</A>&nbsp;And Solomon's provision for one</p>  
<p><a name="page_408"><font size="1" color="green">p. 408</font></A></p>  
<p>day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal; <A NAME="an_kg1:5:3">3</A>&nbsp;ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and a hundred sheep, beside harts, and gazelles, and roebucks, and fatted fowl. <A NAME="an_kg1:5:4">4</A>&nbsp;For he had dominion over all the region on this side the River, from Tiphsah even to Gaza, over all the kings on this side the River; and he had peace on all sides round about him. <A NAME="an_kg1:5:5">5</A>&nbsp;And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig-tree, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, all the days of Solomon.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_kg1:5:6">6</A>&nbsp;And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen. <A NAME="an_kg1:5:7">7</A>&nbsp;And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for all that came unto king Solomon's table, every man in his month; they let nothing be lacking. <A NAME="an_kg1:5:8">8</A>&nbsp;Barley also and straw for the horses and swift steeds brought they unto the place where it should be, every man according to his charge.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_kg1:5:9">9</A>&nbsp;And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea-shore. <A NAME="an_kg1:5:10">10</A>&nbsp;And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east, and all the wisdom of Egypt. <A NAME="an_kg1:5:11">11</A>&nbsp;For he was wiser than all men: than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol; and his fame was in all the nations round about. <A NAME="an_kg1:5:12">12</A>&nbsp;And he spoke three thousand proverbs; and his songs were a thousand and five. <A NAME="an_kg1:5:13">13</A>&nbsp;And he spoke of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall; he spoke also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes. <A NAME="an_kg1:5:14">14</A>&nbsp;And there came of all peoples to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, who had heard of his wisdom.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_kg1:5:15">15</A>&nbsp;And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father; for Hiram was ever a lover of David. <A NAME="an_kg1:5:16">16</A>&nbsp;And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying: <A NAME="an_kg1:5:17">17</A>&nbsp;'Thou knowest how that David my father could not build a house for the name of the LORD his God for the wars which were about him on every side, until the LORD put them under the soles of my feet. <A NAME="an_kg1:5:18">18</A>&nbsp;But now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side; there is neither adversary, nor evil occurrence. <A NAME="an_kg1:5:19">19</A>&nbsp;And, behold, I purpose to build a house for the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD spoke unto David my father, saying: Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall build the house for My name. <A NAME="an_kg1:5:20">20</A>&nbsp;Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar-trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants; and I will give thee hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt say; for thou knowest that there is not among us any that hath skill to hew timber like unto the Zidonians.'</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_kg1:5:21">21</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said: `Blessed be the LORD this day, who hath given unto David a wise son over this great people.' <A NAME="an_kg1:5:22">22</A>&nbsp;And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying: `I have heard that which thou hast sent unto me; I will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of cypress. <A NAME="an_kg1:5:23">23</A>&nbsp;My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea; and I will make them into rafts to go by sea unto the place that thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be broken up there,</p>  
<p><a name="page_409"><font size="1" color="green">p. 409</font></A></p>  
<p>and thou shalt receive them; and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household.' <A NAME="an_kg1:5:24">24</A>&nbsp;So &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_137"></A><A HREF="#fn_133"><FONT SIZE="1">a</FONT></A>
Hiram gave Solomon timber of cedar and timber of cypress according to all his desire. <A NAME="an_kg1:5:25">25</A>&nbsp;And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household, and twenty measures of beaten oil; thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year. <A NAME="an_kg1:5:26">26</A>&nbsp;And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as He promised him; and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league together.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_kg1:5:27">27</A>&nbsp;And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men. <A NAME="an_kg1:5:28">28</A>&nbsp;And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses: a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home; and Adoniram was over the levy. <A NAME="an_kg1:5:29">29</A>&nbsp;And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bore burdens, and fourscore thousand that were hewers in the mountains; <A NAME="an_kg1:5:30">30</A>&nbsp;besides Solomon's chief officers that were over the work, three thousand and three hundred, who bore rule over the people that wrought in the work. <A NAME="an_kg1:5:31">31</A>&nbsp;And the king commanded, and they quarried great stones, costly stories, to lay the foundation of the house with hewn stone. <A NAME="an_kg1:5:32">32</A>&nbsp;And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders and the Gebalites did fashion them, and prepared the timber and the stones to build the house.</p>
