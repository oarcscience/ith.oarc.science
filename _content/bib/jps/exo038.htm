<p><A NAME="an_exo:38:1">1</A>&nbsp;And he made the altar of burnt-offering of acacia-wood: five cubits was the length thereof, and five cubits the breadth thereof, four-square and three cubits the height thereof. <A NAME="an_exo:38:2">2</A>&nbsp;And he made the horns thereof upon the four corners of it; the horns thereof <a name="page_113"><font size="1" color="green">p. 113</font></A> were of one piece with it; and he overlaid it with brass. <A NAME="an_exo:38:3">3</A>&nbsp;And he made all the vessels of the altar, the pots, and the shovels, and the basins, the flesh-hooks, and the fire-pans; all the vessels thereof made he of brass. <A NAME="an_exo:38:4">4</A>&nbsp;And he made for the altar a grating of network of brass, under the ledge round it beneath, reaching halfway up. <A NAME="an_exo:38:5">5</A>&nbsp;And he cast four rings for the four ends of the grating of brass, to be holders for the staves. <A NAME="an_exo:38:6">6</A>&nbsp;And he made the staves of acacia-wood, and overlaid them with brass. <A NAME="an_exo:38:7">7</A>&nbsp;And he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the altar, wherewith to bear it; he made it hollow with planks.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_exo:38:8">8</A>&nbsp;And he made the laver of brass, and the base thereof of brass, of the mirrors of the serving women that did service at the door of the tent of meeting.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_exo:38:9">9</A>&nbsp;And he made the court; for the south side southward the hangings of the court were of fine twined linen, a hundred cubits. <A NAME="an_exo:38:10">10</A>&nbsp;Their pillars were twenty, and their sockets twenty, of brass; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets were of silver. <A NAME="an_exo:38:11">11</A>&nbsp;And for the north side a hundred cubits, their pillars twenty, and their sockets twenty, of brass; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver. <A NAME="an_exo:38:12">12</A>&nbsp;And for the west side were hangings of fifty cubits, their pillars ten, and their sockets ten; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver. <A NAME="an_exo:38:13">13</A>&nbsp;And for the east side eastward fifty cubits. <A NAME="an_exo:38:14">14</A>&nbsp;The hangings for the one side [of the gate] were fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their sockets three. <A NAME="an_exo:38:15">15</A>&nbsp;And so for the other side; on this hand and that hand by the gate of the court were hangings of fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their sockets three. <A NAME="an_exo:38:16">16</A>&nbsp;All the hangings of the court round about were of fine twined linen. <A NAME="an_exo:38:17">17</A>&nbsp;And the sockets for the pillars were of brass; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver; and the overlaying of their capitals of silver; and all the pillars of the court were filleted with silver. <A NAME="an_exo:38:18">18</A>&nbsp;And the screen for the gate of the court was the work of the weaver in colours, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen; and twenty cubits was the length, and the height in the breadth was five cubits, answerable to the hangings of the court. <A NAME="an_exo:38:19">19</A>&nbsp;And their pillars were four, and their sockets four, of brass; their hooks of silver, and the overlaying of their capitals and their fillets of silver. <A NAME="an_exo:38:20">20</A>&nbsp;And all the pins of the tabernacle, and of the court round about, were of brass.</p>
