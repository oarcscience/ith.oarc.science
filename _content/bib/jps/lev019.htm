<p><A NAME="an_lev:19:1">1</A>&nbsp;And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: <A NAME="an_lev:19:2">2</A>&nbsp;Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, and say unto them:</p>  
<p>Ye shall be holy; for I the LORD your God am holy. <A NAME="an_lev:19:3">3</A>&nbsp;Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and ye shall keep My sabbaths: I am the LORD your God. <A NAME="an_lev:19:4">4</A>&nbsp;Turn ye not unto the idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I am the LORD your God.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_lev:19:5">5</A>&nbsp;And when ye offer a sacrifice of peace-offerings unto the LORD, ye shall - offer it that ye may be accepted. <A NAME="an_lev:19:6">6</A>&nbsp;It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow; and if aught remain until the third day, it shall be burnt with fire. <A NAME="an_lev:19:7">7</A>&nbsp;And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it is a vile thing; it shall not be accepted. <A NAME="an_lev:19:8">8</A>&nbsp;But every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity, because he hath profaned the holy thing of the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from his people.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_lev:19:9">9</A>&nbsp;And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corner of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleaning of thy harvest. <A NAME="an_lev:19:10">10</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather the fallen fruit of thy vineyard; thou shalt leave them for the poor and for the stranger: I am the LORD your God. <A NAME="an_lev:19:11">11</A>&nbsp;Ye shall not steal; neither shall ye deal falsely, nor lie one to another. <A NAME="an_lev:19:12">12</A>&nbsp;And ye shall not swear by My name. falsely, so that thou profane the name of thy God: I am the LORD. <A NAME="an_lev:19:13">13</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt not oppress thy neighbour, nor rob him; the wages of a hired servant <a name="page_143"><font size="1" color="green">p. 143</font></A> shall not abide with thee all night until the morning. <A NAME="an_lev:19:14">14</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumbling-block before the blind, but thou shalt fear thy God: I am the LORD. <A NAME="an_lev:19:15">15</A>&nbsp;Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment; thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor favour the person of the mighty; but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour. <A NAME="an_lev:19:16">16</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people; neither shalt thou stand idly by the blood of thy neighbour: I am the LORD. <A NAME="an_lev:19:17">17</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt not hate thy brother. in thy heart; thou shalt surely rebuke thy neighbour, and not bear sin because of him. <A NAME="an_lev:19:18">18</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I am the LORD. <A NAME="an_lev:19:19">19</A>&nbsp;Ye shall keep My statutes. Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind; thou shalt not sow thy field with two kinds of seed; neither shall there come upon thee a garment of two kinds of stuff mingled together. <A NAME="an_lev:19:20">20</A>&nbsp;And whosoever Beth carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid, designated for a man, and not at all redeemed, nor was freedom given her; there shall be inquisition; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free. <A NAME="an_lev:19:21">21</A>&nbsp;And he shall bring his forfeit unto the LORD, unto the door of the tent of meeting, even a ram for a guilt-offering. <A NAME="an_lev:19:22">22</A>&nbsp;And the priest shall make atonement for him with the rain of the guilt-offering before the LORD for his sin which he hath sinned; and he shall be forgiven for his sin which he hath sinned.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_lev:19:23">23</A>&nbsp;And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit thereof as forbidden; three years shall it be as forbidden unto you; it shall not be eaten. <A NAME="an_lev:19:24">24</A>&nbsp;And in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy, for giving praise unto the LORD. <A NAME="an_lev:19:25">25</A>&nbsp;But in the fifth year may ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it may yield unto you more richly the increase thereof: I am the LORD your God. <A NAME="an_lev:19:26">26</A>&nbsp;Ye shall not eat with the blood; neither shall ye practise divination nor soothsaying. <A NAME="an_lev:19:27">27</A>&nbsp;Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard. <A NAME="an_lev:19:28">28</A>&nbsp;Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor imprint any marks upon you: I am the LORD. <A NAME="an_lev:19:29">29</A>&nbsp;Profane not thy daughter, to make her a harlot, lest the land fall into harlotry, and the land become full of lewdness. <A NAME="an_lev:19:30">30</A>&nbsp;Ye shall keep My sabbaths, and reverence My sanctuary: I am the LORD. <A NAME="an_lev:19:31">31</A>&nbsp;Turn ye not unto the ghosts, nor unto familiar spirits; seek them not out, to be defiled by them: I am the LORD your God. <A NAME="an_lev:19:32">32</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of the old man, and thou shalt fear thy God: I am the LORD. <A NAME="an_lev:19:33">33</A>&nbsp;And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not do him wrong. <A NAME="an_lev:19:34">34</A>&nbsp;The stranger that sojourneth with you shall be unto you as the home-born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God. <A NAME="an_lev:19:35">35</A>&nbsp;Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in weight, or in measure. <A NAME="an_lev:19:36">36</A>&nbsp;Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall ye have: I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt. <A NAME="an_lev:19:37">37</A>&nbsp;And ye shall observe all My statutes, and all Mine ordinances, and do them: I am the LORD.</p>
