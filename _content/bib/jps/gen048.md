### GENESIS CHAPTER 48

<span id="an_gen:48:1">1</span> And it came to pass after these things,
that one said to Joseph: 'Behold, thy father is sick.' And he took with
him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. <span
id="an_gen:48:2">2</span> And one told Jacob, and said: 'Behold, thy son
Joseph cometh unto thee.' And Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon
the bed. <span id="an_gen:48:3">3</span> And Jacob said unto Joseph:
'God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed
me, <span id="an_gen:48:4">4</span> and said unto me: Behold, I will
make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a company
of peoples; and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an
everlasting possession. <span id="an_gen:48:5">5</span> And now thy two
sons, who were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto
thee into Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh, even as Reuben and
Simeon, shall be mine. <span id="an_gen:48:6">6</span> And thy issue,
that thou begettest after them, shall be thine; they shall be called
after the name of their brethren in their inheritance. <span
id="an_gen:48:7">7</span> And as for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel
died unto me in the land of Canaan in the way, <span id="page_61">p.
61</span> when there was still some way to come unto Ephrath; and I
buried her there in the way to Ephrath—the same is Beth-lehem.' <span
id="an_gen:48:8">8</span> And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said:
'Who are these?' <span id="an_gen:48:9">9</span> And Joseph said unto
his father: 'They are my sons, whom God hath given me here.' And he
said: 'Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them.' <span
id="an_gen:48:10">10</span> Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so
that he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed
them, and embraced them. <span id="an_gen:48:11">11</span> And Israel
said unto Joseph: 'I had not thought to see thy face; and, lo, God hath
let me see thy seed also.' <span id="an_gen:48:12">12</span> And Joseph
brought them out from between his knees; and he fell down on his face to
the earth. <span id="an_gen:48:13">13</span> And Joseph took them both,
Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his
left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him.
<span id="an_gen:48:14">14</span> And Israel stretched out his right
hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left
hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was
the first-born. <span id="an_gen:48:15">15</span> And he blessed Joseph,
and said: 'The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk,
the God who hath been my shepherd all my life long unto this day, <span
id="an_gen:48:16">16</span> the angel who hath redeemed me from all
evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named in them, and the name of
my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the
midst of the earth.' <span id="an_gen:48:17">17</span> And when Joseph
saw that his father was laying his right hand upon the head of Ephraim,
it displeased him, and he held up his father's hand, to remove it from
Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head. <span
id="an_gen:48:18">18</span> And Joseph said unto his father: 'Not so, my
father, for this is the first-born; put thy right hand upon his head.'
<span id="an_gen:48:19">19</span> And his father refused, and said: 'I
know it, my son, I know it; he also shall become a people, and he also
shall be great; howbeit his younger brother shall be greater than he,
and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.' <span
id="an_gen:48:20">20</span> And he blessed them that day, saying: 'By
thee shall Israel bless, saying: God make thee as Ephraim and as
Manasseh.' And he set Ephraim before Manasseh. <span
id="an_gen:48:21">21</span> And Israel said unto Joseph: 'Behold, I die;
but God will be with you, and bring you back unto the land of your
fathers. <span id="an_gen:48:22">22</span> Moreover I have given to thee
one  <span id="fr_69"></span>[a](#fn_68) portion above thy brethren,
which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my
bow.'
