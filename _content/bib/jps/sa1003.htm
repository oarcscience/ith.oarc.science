<p><A NAME="an_sa1:3:1">1</A>&nbsp;And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no frequent vision. <A NAME="an_sa1:3:2">2</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place&#8212;now his eyes had begun to wax dim, that he could not see&#8212;<A NAME="an_sa1:3:3">3</A>&nbsp;and the lamp of God was not yet gone out, and Samuel was laid down to sleep in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was, <A NAME="an_sa1:3:4">4</A>&nbsp;that the LORD called Samuel; and he said: `Here am I.' <A NAME="an_sa1:3:5">5</A>&nbsp;And he ran unto Eli, and said: `Here am I; for thou didst call me.' And he said: `I called not; lie down again.' And he went and lay down. <A NAME="an_sa1:3:6">6</A>&nbsp;And the LORD called yet again Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said: `Here am I; for thou didst call me.' And he answered:`I called not, my son; lie down again.' <A NAME="an_sa1:3:7">7</A>&nbsp;Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him. <A NAME="an_sa1:3:8">8</A>&nbsp;And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said: `Here am I; for thou didst call me.' And Eli perceived that the LORD was calling the child. <A NAME="an_sa1:3:9">9</A>&nbsp;Therefore Eli said unto Samuel: `Go, lie down; and it shall be, if thou be called, that thou shalt say: Speak, LORD; for Thy servant heareth.' So Samuel went and lay down in his place. <A NAME="an_sa1:3:10">10</A>&nbsp;And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times: `Samuel, Samuel.' Then Samuel said: `Speak; for Thy servant heareth.' <A NAME="an_sa1:3:11">11</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said to Samuel: `Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle. <A NAME="an_sa1:3:12">12</A>&nbsp;In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from the beginning even unto the end. <A NAME="an_sa1:3:13">13</A>&nbsp;For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever, for the iniquity, in that he knew that his sons did bring a curse upon themselves, and he rebuked them not. <A NAME="an_sa1:3:14">14</A>&nbsp;And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be expiated with sacrifice nor offering for ever.' <A NAME="an_sa1:3:15">15</A>&nbsp;And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to tell Eli the vision. <A NAME="an_sa1:3:16">16</A>&nbsp;Then Eli called Samuel, and said: `Samuel, my son.' And he said: `Here am I.' <A NAME="an_sa1:3:17">17</A>&nbsp;And he said: `What is the thing that He hath spoken unto thee? I pray thee,</p>  
<p><a name="page_329"><font size="1" color="green">p. 329</font></A></p>  
<p>hide it not from me; God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide any thing from me of all the things that He spoke unto thee.' <A NAME="an_sa1:3:18">18</A>&nbsp;And Samuel told him all the words, and hid nothing from him. And he said: `It is the LORD; let Him do what seemeth Him good.'</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_sa1:3:19">19</A>&nbsp;And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground. <A NAME="an_sa1:3:20">20</A>&nbsp;And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the LORD. <A NAME="an_sa1:3:21">21</A>&nbsp;And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh; for the LORD revealed Himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD. </p>
