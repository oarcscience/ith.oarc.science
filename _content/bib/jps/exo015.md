### EXODUS CHAPTER 15

<span id="an_exo:15:1">1</span> Then sang Moses and the children of
Israel this song unto the LORD, and spoke, saying:

I will sing unto the LORD, for He is highly exalted;  
The horse and his rider hath He thrown into the sea.  
<span id="an_exo:15:2">2</span> The LORD is my strength and song, And  
He is become my salvation; This is my God, and I will glorify Him;  
My father's God, and I will exalt Him.  
<span id="an_exo:15:3">3</span> The LORD is a man of war,  
The LORD is His name.  
<span id="an_exo:15:4">4</span> Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath He
cast into the sea,  
And his chosen captains are sunk in the Red Sea.  
<span id="an_exo:15:5">5</span> The deeps cover them  
They went down into the depths like a stone.  
<span id="an_exo:15:6">6</span> Thy right hand, O LORD, glorious in
power,  
Thy right hand, O LORD, dasheth in pieces the enemy. <span
id="page_83">p. 83</span>  
<span id="an_exo:15:7">7</span> And in the greatness of Thine excellency
Thou overthrowest them that rise up against Thee;  
Thou sendest forth Thy wrath, it consumeth them as stubble.  
<span id="an_exo:15:8">8</span> And with the blast of Thy nostrils the
waters were piled up—  
The floods stood upright as a heap; The deeps were congealed in the
heart of the sea.  
<span id="an_exo:15:9">9</span> The enemy said:  
'I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil;  
My lust shall be satisfied upon them;  
I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.'  
<span id="an_exo:15:10">10</span> Thou didst blow with Thy wind, the sea
covered them;  
They sank as lead in the mighty waters.  
<span id="an_exo:15:11">11</span> Who is like unto Thee, O LORD, among
the mighty?  
Who is like unto Thee, glorious in holiness,  
Fearful in praises, doing wonders?  
<span id="an_exo:15:12">12</span> Thou stretchedst out Thy right hand—  
The earth swallowed them.  
<span id="an_exo:15:13">13</span> Thou in Thy love hast led the people
that Thou hast redeemed;  
Thou hast guided them in Thy strength to Thy holy habitation.  
<span id="an_exo:15:14">14</span> The peoples have heard, they
tremble;  
Pangs have taken hold on the inhabitants of Philistia.  
<span id="an_exo:15:15">15</span> Then were the chiefs of Edom
affrighted;  
The mighty men of Moab, trembling taketh hold upon them;  
All the inhabitants of Canaan are melted away.  
<span id="an_exo:15:16">16</span> Terror and dread falleth upon them;  
By the greatness of Thine arm they are as still as a stone;  
Till Thy people pass over, O LORD,  
Till the people pass over that Thou hast gotten.  
<span id="an_exo:15:17">17</span> Thou bringest them in, and plantest
them in the mountain of Thine inheritance,  
The place, O LORD, which Thou hast made for Thee to dwell in,  
The sanctuary, O Lord, which Thy hands have established.  
<span id="an_exo:15:18">18</span> The LORD shall reign for ever and
ever.

<span id="an_exo:15:19">19</span> For the horses of Pharaoh went in with
his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought
back the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel walked
on dry land in the midst of the sea.

<span id="an_exo:15:20">20</span> And Miriam the prophetess, the sister
of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after
her with timbrels and with dances. <span id="an_exo:15:21">21</span> And
Miriam sang unto them:

Sing ye to the LORD, for He is highly exalted:  
The horse and his rider hath He thrown into the sea.

<span id="an_exo:15:22">22</span> And Moses led Israel onward from the
Red Sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went
three days in the wilderness, and found no water. <span
id="an_exo:15:23">23</span> And when they came to Marah, they could not
drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter. Therefore the name
of it was called  <span id="fr_78"></span>[a](#fn_77) Marah. <span
id="an_exo:15:24">24</span> And the people murmured against Moses,
saying: 'What shall we drink?' <span id="an_exo:15:25">25</span> And he
cried unto the LORD; and the LORD showed him a tree, and he cast it into
the waters, and the waters were made sweet. There He made for them a
statute and an ordinance, and there He proved them; <span
id="an_exo:15:26">26</span> and He said: 'If thou wilt diligently
hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, and wilt <span id="page_84">p.
84</span> do that which is right in His eyes, and wilt give ear to his
commandments, and keep all His statutes, I will put none of the diseases
upon thee, which I have put upon the Egyptians; for I am the LORD that
healeth thee.'

<span id="an_exo:15:27">27</span> And they came to Elim, where were
twelve springs of water, and three score and ten palm-trees; and they
encamped there by the waters.
