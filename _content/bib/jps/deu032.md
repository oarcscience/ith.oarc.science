### DEUTERONOMY CHAPTER 32

‏האזינו‎

<span id="an_deu:32:1">1</span> Give ear, ye heavens, and I will
speak;  
And let the earth hear the words of my mouth.  
<span id="an_deu:32:2">2</span> My doctrine shall drop as the rain,  
My speech shall distil as the dew;  
As the small rain upon the tender grass,  
And as the showers upon the herb.  
<span id="an_deu:32:3">3</span> For I will proclaim the name of the
LORD;  
Ascribe ye greatness unto our God.

<span id="an_deu:32:4">4</span> The Rock, His work is perfect;  
For all His ways are justice;  
A God of faithfulness and without iniquity,  
Just and right is He.  
<span id="an_deu:32:5">5</span> Is corruption His? No; His children's is
the blemish;  
A generation crooked and perverse.  
<span id="an_deu:32:6">6</span> Do ye thus requite the LORD,  
O foolish people and unwise?  
Is not, He thy father that hath gotten thee?  
Hath He not made thee, and established thee?

<span id="an_deu:32:7">7</span> Remember the days of old,  
Consider the years of many generations;  
Ask thy father, and he will declare unto thee,  
Thine elders, and they will tell thee.  
<span id="an_deu:32:8">8</span> When the Most High gave to the nations
their inheritance,  
When He separated the children of men,  
He set the borders of the peoples  
According to the number of the children of Israel.  
<span id="an_deu:32:9">9</span> For the portion of the LORD is His
people,  
Jacob the lot of His inheritance.

<span id="an_deu:32:10">10</span> He found him in a desert land,  
And in the waste, a howling wilderness;  
He compassed him about, He cared for him,  
He kept him as the apple of His eye.  
<span id="an_deu:32:11">11</span> As an eagle that stirreth up her
nest,  
Hovereth over her young,  
Spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them,  
Beareth them on her pinions—  
<span id="an_deu:32:12">12</span> The LORD alone did lead him,  
And there was no strange god with Him.

<span id="an_deu:32:13">13</span> He made him ride on the high places of
the earth,  
And he did eat the fruitage of the field;  
And He made him to suck honey out of the crag,  
And oil out of the flinty rock;  
<span id="an_deu:32:14">14</span> Curd of kine, and milk of sheep,  
With fat of lambs, <span id="page_254">p. 254</span>  
And rams of the breed of Bashan, and he-goats,  
With the kidney-fat of wheat;  
And of the blood of the grape thou drankest foaming wine.

<span id="an_deu:32:15">15</span> But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked—  
Thou didst wax fat, thou didst grow thick, thou didst become gross—  
And he forsook God who made him,  
And contemned the Rock of his salvation.  
<span id="an_deu:32:16">16</span> They roused Him to jealousy with
strange gods,  
With abominations did they provoke Him.  
<span id="an_deu:32:17">17</span> They sacrificed unto demons,
no-gods,  
Gods that they knew not,  
New gods that came up of late,  
Which your fathers dreaded not.  
<span id="an_deu:32:18">18</span> Of the Rock that begot thee thou wast
unmindful,  
And didst forget God that bore thee.

<span id="an_deu:32:19">19</span> And the LORD saw, and spurned,  
Because of the provoking of His sons and His daughters.  
<span id="an_deu:32:20">20</span> And He said: \`I will hide My face
from them,  
I will see what their end shall be;  
For they are a very froward generation,  
Children in whom is no faithfulness.  
<span id="an_deu:32:21">21</span> They have roused Me to jealousy with a
no-god;  
They have provoked Me with their vanities;  
And I will rouse them to jealousy with a no-people;  
I will provoke them with a vile nation.  
<span id="an_deu:32:22">22</span> For a fire is kindled in My nostril,  
And burneth unto the depths of the nether-world,  
And devoureth the earth with her produce,  
And setteth ablaze the foundations of the mountains.

<span id="an_deu:32:23">23</span> I will heap evils upon them;  
I will spend Mine arrows upon them;  
<span id="an_deu:32:24">24</span> The wasting of hunger, and the
devouring of the fiery bolt,  
And bitter destruction;  
And the teeth of beasts will I send upon them,  
With the venom of crawling things of the dust.  
<span id="an_deu:32:25">25</span> Without shall the sword bereave,  
And in the chambers terror;  
Slaying both young man and virgin,  
The suckling with the man of gray hairs.

<span id="an_deu:32:26">26</span> I thought I would make an end of
them,  
I would make their memory cease from among men;  
<span id="an_deu:32:27">27</span> Were it not that I dreaded the enemy's
provocation,  
Lest their adversaries should misdeem,  
Lest they should say: Our hand is exalted,  
And not the LORD hath wrought all this.'

<span id="an_deu:32:28">28</span> For they are a nation void of
counsel,  
And there is no understanding in them.  
<span id="an_deu:32:29">29</span> If they were wise, they would
understand this,  
They would discern their latter end.  
<span id="an_deu:32:30">30</span> How should one chase a thousand,  
And two put ten thousand to flight,  
Except their Rock had given them over,  
And the LORD had delivered them up?  
<span id="an_deu:32:31">31</span> For their rock is not as our Rock,
<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

Even our enemies themselves being judges.  
<span id="an_deu:32:32">32</span> For their vine is of the vine of
Sodom,  
And of the fields of Gomorrah;  
Their grapes are grapes of gall,  
Their clusters are bitter;  
<span id="an_deu:32:33">33</span> Their wine is the venom of serpents,  
And the cruel poison of asps.

<span id="an_deu:32:34">34</span> \`Is not this laid up in store with
Me,  
Sealed up in My treasuries?  
<span id="an_deu:32:35">35</span> Vengeance is Mine, and recompense,  
Against the time when their foot shall slip;  
For the day of their calamity is at hand,  
And the things that are to come upon them shall make haste.

<span id="an_deu:32:36">36</span> For the LORD will judge His people,  
And repent Himself for His servants;  
When He seeth that their stay is gone,  
And there is none remaining, shut up or left at large.  
<span id="an_deu:32:37">37</span> And it is said: Where are their
gods,  
The rock in whom they trusted;  
<span id="an_deu:32:38">38</span> Who did eat the fat of their
sacrifices,  
And drank the wine of their drink-offering?  
Let him rise up and help you,  
Let him be your protection.

<span id="an_deu:32:39">39</span> See now that I, even I, am He,  
And there is no god with Me;  
I kill, and I make alive;  
I have wounded, and I heal;  
And there is none that can deliver out of My hand.  
<span id="an_deu:32:40">40</span> For I lift up My hand to heaven,  
And say: As I live for ever,  
<span id="an_deu:32:41">41</span> If I whet My glittering sword,  
And My hand take hold on judgment;  
I will render vengeance to Mine adversaries,  
And will recompense them that hate Me.  
<span id="an_deu:32:42">42</span> I will make Mine arrows drunk with
blood,  
And My sword shall devour flesh;  
With the blood of the slain and the captives,  
From the long-haired heads of the enemy.'

<span id="an_deu:32:43">43</span> Sing aloud, O ye nations, of His
people;  
For He doth avenge the blood of His servants,  
And doth render vengeance to His adversaries,  
And doth make expiation for the land of His people.

<span id="an_deu:32:44">44</span> And Moses came and spoke all the words
of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun.
<span id="an_deu:32:45">45</span> And when Moses made an end of speaking
all these words to all Israel, <span id="an_deu:32:46">46</span> he said
unto them: \`Set your heart unto all the words wherewith I testify
against you this day; that ye may charge your children therewith to
observe to do all the words of this law. <span
id="an_deu:32:47">47</span> For it is no vain thing for you; because it
is your life, and through this thing ye shall prolong your days upon the
land, whither ye go over the Jordan to possess it.'

<span id="an_deu:32:48">48</span> And the LORD spoke unto Moses that
selfsame day, saying: <span id="an_deu:32:49">49</span> \`Get thee up
into this mountain of Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which is in the land of
Moab, that is over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which
I give unto the children of Israel for a possession; <span
id="an_deu:32:50">50</span> and die in the mount whither thou goest up,
and be gathered unto thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor,
and was gathered unto his people. <span
id="an_deu:32:51">51</span> Because ye

<span id="page_256">p. 256</span>

trespassed against Me in the midst of the children of Israel at the
waters of Meribath-kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye
sanctified Me not in the midst of the children of Israel. <span
id="an_deu:32:52">52</span> For thou shalt see the land afar off; but
thou shalt not go thither into the land which I give the children of
Israel.'
