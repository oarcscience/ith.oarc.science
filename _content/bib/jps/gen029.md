### GENESIS CHAPTER 29

<span id="an_gen:29:1">1</span> Then Jacob went on his journey, and came
to the land of the children of the east. <span
id="an_gen:29:2">2</span> And he looked, and behold a well in the field,
and to three flocks of sheep lying there by it.—For out of that well
they watered the flocks. And the stone upon the well's mouth was great.
<span id="an_gen:29:3">3</span> And thither were all the flocks
gathered; and they rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered
the sheep, and put the stone back upon the well's mouth in its
place.—<span id="an_gen:29:4">4</span> And Jacob said unto them: 'My
brethren, whence are ye?' And they said: 'Of Haran are we.' <span
id="an_gen:29:5">5</span> And he said unto them: 'Know ye Laban the son
of Nahor?' And they said: 'We know him.' <span
id="an_gen:29:6">6</span> And he said unto them: 'Is it well with him?'
And they said: 'It is well; and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with
the sheep.' <span id="an_gen:29:7">7</span> And he said: 'Lo, it is yet
high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered
together; water ye the sheep, and go and feed them.' <span
id="an_gen:29:8">8</span> And they said: 'We cannot, until all the
flocks be gathered together, and they roll the stone from the well's
mouth; then we water the sheep.' <span id="an_gen:29:9">9</span> While
he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep; for
she tended them. <span id="an_gen:29:10">10</span> And it came to pass,
when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and
the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and
rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban
his mother's brother. <span id="an_gen:29:11">11</span> And Jacob kissed
Rachel, and lifted <span id="page_35">p. 35</span> up his voice, and
wept. <span id="an_gen:29:12">12</span> And Jacob told Rachel that he
was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son; and she ran and
told her father. <span id="an_gen:29:13">13</span> And it came to pass,
when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son, that he ran to
meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his
house. And he told Laban all these things. <span
id="an_gen:29:14">14</span> And Laban said to him: 'Surely thou art my
bone and my flesh.' And he abode with him the space of a month. <span
id="an_gen:29:15">15</span> And Laban said unto Jacob: 'Because thou art
my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what
shall thy wages be?' <span id="an_gen:29:16">16</span> Now Laban had two
daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger
was Rachel. <span id="an_gen:29:17">17</span> And Leah's eyes were weak;
but Rachel was of beautiful form and fair to look upon. <span
id="an_gen:29:18">18</span> And Jacob loved Rachel; and he said: 'I will
serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.' <span
id="an_gen:29:19">19</span> And Laban said: 'It is better that I give
her to thee, than that I should give her to another man; abide with me.'
<span id="an_gen:29:20">20</span> And Jacob served seven years for
Rachel; and they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to
her. <span id="an_gen:29:21">21</span> And Jacob said unto Laban: 'Give
me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.' <span
id="an_gen:29:22">22</span> And Laban gathered together all the men of
the place, and made a feast. <span id="an_gen:29:23">23</span> And it
came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought
her to him; and he went in unto her. <span
id="an_gen:29:24">24</span> And Laban gave Zilpah his handmaid unto his
daughter Leah for a handmaid. <span id="an_gen:29:25">25</span> And it
came to pass in the morning that, behold, it was Leah; and he said to
Laban: 'What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I serve with thee
for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?' <span
id="an_gen:29:26">26</span> And Laban said: 'It is not so done in our
place, to give the younger before the first-born. <span
id="an_gen:29:27">27</span> Fulfil the week of this one, and we will
give thee the other also for the service which thou shalt serve with me
yet seven other years.' <span id="an_gen:29:28">28</span> And Jacob did
so, and fulfilled her week; and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife.
<span id="an_gen:29:29">29</span> And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter
Bilhah his handmaid to be her handmaid. <span
id="an_gen:29:30">30</span> And he went in also unto Rachel, and he
loved Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.

<span id="an_gen:29:31">31</span> And the LORD saw that Leah was hated,
and he opened her womb; but Rachel was barren. <span
id="an_gen:29:32">32</span> And Leah conceived, and bore a son, and she
called his name Reuben; for she said: 'Because the LORD  <span
id="fr_34"></span>[a](#fn_33) hath looked upon my affliction; for now my
husband will love me.' <span id="an_gen:29:33">33</span> And she
conceived again, and bore a son; and said: 'Because the LORD  <span
id="fr_35"></span>[b](#fn_34) hath heard that I am hated, He hath
therefore given me this son also.' And she called his name  <span
id="fr_36"></span>[c](#fn_35) Simeon. <span
id="an_gen:29:34">34</span> And she conceived again, and bore a son; and
said: 'Now this time will my husband be  <span
id="fr_37"></span>[d](#fn_36) joined unto me, because I have borne him
three sons.' Therefore was his name called Levi. <span
id="an_gen:29:35">35</span> And she conceived again, and bore a son; and
she said: 'This time will I  <span id="fr_38"></span>[e](#fn_37) praise
the LORD.' Therefore she called his name  <span
id="fr_39"></span>[f](#fn_38) Judah; and she left off bearing.
