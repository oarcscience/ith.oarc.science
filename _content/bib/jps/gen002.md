### Genesis Chapter 2

<span id="an_gen:2:1">1</span> And the heaven and the earth were
finished, and all the host of them. <span id="an_gen:2:2">2</span> And
on the seventh day God finished His work which He had made; and He
rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had made. <span
id="an_gen:2:3">3</span> And God blessed the seventh day, and hallowed
it; because that in it He rested from all His work which God in creating
had made.

<span id="an_gen:2:4">4</span> These are the generations of the heaven
and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God
made earth and heaven.

<span id="an_gen:2:5">5</span> No shrub of the field was yet in the
earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up; for the LORD God had
not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till
the ground; <span id="an_gen:2:6">6</span> but there went up a mist from
the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground. <span
id="an_gen:2:7">7</span> Then the LORD God formed man of the dust of the
ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man
became a living soul. <span id="an_gen:2:8">8</span> And the LORD God
planted a garden eastward, in Eden; and there He put the man whom He had
formed. <span id="an_gen:2:9">9</span> And out of the ground made the
LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for
food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of
the knowledge of good and evil. <span id="an_gen:2:10">10</span> And a
river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was
parted, and became four heads. <span id="an_gen:2:11">11</span> The name
of the first is Pishon; that is it which compasseth the whole land of
Havilah, where there is gold; <span id="an_gen:2:12">12</span> and the
gold of that land is good; there is bdellium and the onyx stone. <span
id="an_gen:2:13">13</span> And the name of the second river is Gihon;
the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Cush. <span
id="an_gen:2:14">14</span> And the name of the third river is  <span
id="fr_5"></span>[a](#fn_4) Tigris; that is it which goeth toward the
east of Asshur. And the fourth river is the Euphrates. <span
id="an_gen:2:15">15</span> And the LORD God took the man, and put him
into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. <span
id="an_gen:2:16">16</span> And the LORD God commanded the man, saying:
'Of every tree of the garden thou <span id="page_5">p. 5</span> mayest
freely eat; <span id="an_gen:2:17">17</span> but of the tree of the
knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for in the day
that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.'

<span id="an_gen:2:18">18</span> And the LORD God said: 'It is not good
that the man should be alone; I will make him a help meet for him.'
<span id="an_gen:2:19">19</span> And out of the ground the LORD God
formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought
them unto the man to see what he would call them; and whatsoever the man
would call every living creature, that was to be the name thereof. <span
id="an_gen:2:20">20</span> And the man gave names to all cattle, and to
the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there
was not found a help meet for him. <span id="an_gen:2:21">21</span> And
the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; and
He took one of his ribs, and closed up the place with flesh instead
thereof. <span id="an_gen:2:22">22</span> And the rib, which the LORD
God had taken from the man, made He a woman, and brought her unto the
man. <span id="an_gen:2:23">23</span> And the man said: 'This is now
bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called  <span
id="fr_6"></span>[a](#fn_5) Woman, because she was taken out of  <span
id="fr_7"></span>[b](#fn_6) Man.' <span
id="an_gen:2:24">24</span> Therefore shall a man leave his father and
his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife, and they shall be one flesh.
<span id="an_gen:2:25">25</span> And they were both naked, the man and
his wife, and were not ashamed.
