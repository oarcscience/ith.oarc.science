<p><A NAME="an_exo:34:1">1</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said unto Moses: 'Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first; and I will write upon the tables the words that were on the first tables, which thou didst break. <A NAME="an_exo:34:2">2</A>&nbsp;And be ready by the morning, and come up in the morning unto mount Sinai, and present thyself there to Me on the top of the mount. <A NAME="an_exo:34:3">3</A>&nbsp;And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount.' <A NAME="an_exo:34:4">4</A>&nbsp;And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand two tables of stone. <A NAME="an_exo:34:5">5</A>&nbsp;And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD. <A NAME="an_exo:34:6">6</A>&nbsp;And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed: 'The LORD, the LORD, God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth; <A NAME="an_exo:34:7">7</A>&nbsp;keeping mercy unto the thousandth generation, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin; and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, unto the third and unto the fourth generation.' <A NAME="an_exo:34:8">8</A>&nbsp;And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshipped. <A NAME="an_exo:34:9">9</A>&nbsp;And he said: 'If now I have found grace in Thy sight, O Lord, let the Lord, I pray Thee, go in the midst of us; for it is a stiffnecked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for Thine inheritance.' <A NAME="an_exo:34:10">10</A>&nbsp;And He said: 'Behold, I make a covenant; before all thy people I will do marvels, such as have not been wrought in all the earth, nor in any nation; and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of the LORD that I am about to do with thee, that it is tremendous. <A NAME="an_exo:34:11">11</A>&nbsp;Observe thou that which I am commanding thee this day; behold, I am driving out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite. <A NAME="an_exo:34:12">12</A>&nbsp;Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest they be for a snare in the midst of thee. <A NAME="an_exo:34:13">13</A>&nbsp;But ye shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and ye shall cut down their Asherim. <A NAME="an_exo:34:14">14</A>&nbsp;For thou shalt bow down to no other god; for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous <a name="page_108"><font size="1" color="green">p. 108</font></A> God; <A NAME="an_exo:34:15">15</A>&nbsp;lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they go astray after their gods, and do sacrifice unto their gods, and they call thee, and thou eat of their sacrifice; <A NAME="an_exo:34:16">16</A>&nbsp;and thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters go astray after their gods, and make thy sons go astray after their gods. <A NAME="an_exo:34:17">17</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt make thee no molten gods. <A NAME="an_exo:34:18">18</A>&nbsp;The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, at the time appointed in the month Abib, for in the month Abib thou earnest out from Egypt. <A NAME="an_exo:34:19">19</A>&nbsp;All that openeth the womb is Mine; and of all thy cattle thou shalt sanctify the males, the firstlings of ox and sheep. <A NAME="an_exo:34:20">20</A>&nbsp;And the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break its neck. All the first-born of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before Me empty. <A NAME="an_exo:34:21">21</A>&nbsp;Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest; in plowing time and in harvest thou shalt rest. <A NAME="an_exo:34:22">22</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, even of the first-fruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the turn of the year. <A NAME="an_exo:34:23">23</A>&nbsp;Three times in the year shall all thy males appear before the Lord GOD, the God of Israel. <A NAME="an_exo:34:24">24</A>&nbsp;For I will cast out nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders; neither shall any man covet thy land, when thou goest up to appear before the LORD thy God three times in the year. <A NAME="an_exo:34:25">25</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt not offer the blood of My sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning. <A NAME="an_exo:34:26">26</A>&nbsp;The choicest first-fruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in its mother's milk.'</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_exo:34:27">27</A>&nbsp;And the Lord said unto Moses: 'Write thou these words, for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel.' <A NAME="an_exo:34:28">28</A>&nbsp;And he was there with the Lord forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten words. <A NAME="an_exo:34:29">29</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of the testimony in Moses&#8217; hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses knew not that the skin of his face sent forth, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_91"></A><A HREF="#fn_88"><FONT SIZE="1">a</FONT></A>
beams while He talked with him. <A NAME="an_exo:34:30">30</A>&nbsp;And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face sent forth beams; and they were afraid to come nigh him. <A NAME="an_exo:34:31">31</A>&nbsp;And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him; and Moses spoke to them. <A NAME="an_exo:34:32">32</A>&nbsp;And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh, and he gave them in commandment all that the Lord had spoken with him in mount Sinai. <A NAME="an_exo:34:33">33</A>&nbsp;And when Moses had done speaking with them, he put a veil on his face. <A NAME="an_exo:34:34">34</A>&nbsp;But when Moses went in before the Lord that He: might speak with him, he took the veil off, until he came out; and he came out, and spoke unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded. <A NAME="an_exo:34:35">35</A>&nbsp;And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses&#8217; face sent forth beams; and Moses put the veil back upon his face, until he went in to speak with Him.</p>
