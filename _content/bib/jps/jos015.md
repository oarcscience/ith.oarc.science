### JOSHUA CHAPTER 15

<span id="an_jos:15:1">1</span> And the lot for the tribe of the
children of Judah according to their families was unto the border of
Edom, even to the wilderness of Zin southward, at the uttermost part of
the south. <span id="an_jos:15:2">2</span> And their south border was
from the uttermost part of the Salt Sea, from the bay that looked
southward. <span id="an_jos:15:3">3</span> And it went out southward of
the ascent of Akrabbim, and passed along to Zin, and went up by the
south of Kadesh-barnea, and passed along by Hezron, and went up to
Addar, and turned about to Karka. <span id="an_jos:15:4">4</span> And it
passed along to Azmon, and went out at the Brook of Egypt; and the
goings out of the border were at the sea; this shall be your south
border. <span id="an_jos:15:5">5</span> And the east border was the Salt
Sea, even unto the end of the Jordan. And the border of the north side
was from the bay of the sea at the end of the Jordan. <span
id="an_jos:15:6">6</span> And the border went up to Beth-hoglah,

<span id="page_279">p. 279</span>

and passed along by the north of Beth-arabah; and the border went up to
the Stone of Bohan the son of Reuben. <span
id="an_jos:15:7">7</span> And the border went up to Debir from the
valley of Achor, and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that is over
against the ascent of Adummim, which is on the south side of the brook;
and the border passed along to the waters of Enshemesh, and the goings
out thereof were at En-rogel. <span id="an_jos:15:8">8</span> And the
border went up by the Valley of the son of Hinnom unto the side of the
Jebusite southward—the same is Jerusalem—and the border went up to the
top of the mountain that lieth before the Valley of Hinnom westward,
which is at the uttermost part of the vale of Rephaim northward. <span
id="an_jos:15:9">9</span> And the border was drawn from the top of the
mountain unto the fountain of the waters of Nephtoah, and went out to
the cities of mount Ephron; and the border was drawn to Baalah—the same
is Kiriath-jearim. <span id="an_jos:15:10">10</span> And the border
turned about from Baalah westward unto mount Seir, and passed along unto
the side of mount Jearim on the north—the same is Chesalonand went down
to Beth-shemesh, and passed along by Timnah. <span
id="an_jos:15:11">11</span> And the border went out unto the side of
Ekron northward; and the border was drawn to Shikkeron, and passed along
to mount Baalah, and went out at Jabneel; and the goings out of the
border were at the sea. <span id="an_jos:15:12">12</span> And as for the
west border, the Great Sea was the border thereof. This is the border of
the children of Judah round about according to their families.

<span id="an_jos:15:13">13</span> And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh he
gave a portion among the children of Judah, according to the commandment
of the LORD to Joshua, even Kiriath-arba, which Arba was the father of
Anak—the same is Hebron. <span id="an_jos:15:14">14</span> And Caleb
drove out thence the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and Ahiman, and
Talmai, the children of Anak. <span id="an_jos:15:15">15</span> And he
went up thence against the inhabitants of Debir—now the name of Debir
beforetime was Kiriath-sepher. <span id="an_jos:15:16">16</span> And
Caleb said: 'He that smiteth Kiriath-sepher, and taketh it, to him will
I give Achsah my daughter to wife.' <span
id="an_jos:15:17">17</span> And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of
Caleb, took it; and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife. <span
id="an_jos:15:18">18</span> And it came to pass, when she came unto him,
that she persuaded him to ask of her father a field; and she alighted
from off her ass; and Caleb said unto her: 'What wouldest thou?' <span
id="an_jos:15:19">19</span> And she said: 'Give me a blessing; for that
thou hast set me in the  <span id="fr_107"></span>[a](#fn_104)
Southland, give me therefore springs of water.' And he gave her the
Upper Springs and the Nether Springs.

<span id="an_jos:15:20">20</span> This is the inheritance of the tribe
of the children of Judah according to their families.

<span id="an_jos:15:21">21</span> And the cities at the uttermost part
of the tribe of the children of Judah toward the border of Edom in the
South were Kabzeel, and Eder, and Jagur; <span
id="an_jos:15:22">22</span> and Kinah, and Dimonah, and Adadah; <span
