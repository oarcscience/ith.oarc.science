<p><A NAME="an_gen:25:1">1</A>&nbsp;And Abraham took another wife, and her name was Keturah. <A NAME="an_gen:25:2">2</A>&nbsp;And she bore him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and <a name="page_29"><font size="1" color="green">p. 29</font></A> Ishbak, and Shuah. <A NAME="an_gen:25:3">3</A>&nbsp;And Jokshan begot Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim. <A NAME="an_gen:25:4">4</A>&nbsp;And the sons of Midian: Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah. <A NAME="an_gen:25:5">5</A>&nbsp;And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac. <A NAME="an_gen:25:6">6</A>&nbsp;But unto the sons of the concubines, that Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts; and he sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country. <A NAME="an_gen:25:7">7</A>&nbsp;And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, a hundred threescore and fifteen years. <A NAME="an_gen:25:8">8</A>&nbsp;And Abraham expired, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people. <A NAME="an_gen:25:9">9</A>&nbsp;And Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre; <A NAME="an_gen:25:10">10</A>&nbsp;the field which Abraham purchased of the children of Heth; there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife. <A NAME="an_gen:25:11">11</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed Isaac his son; and Isaac dwelt by Beer-lahai-roi.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_gen:25:12">12</A>&nbsp;Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bore unto Abraham. <A NAME="an_gen:25:13">13</A>&nbsp;And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the first-born of Ishmael, Nebaioth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam, <A NAME="an_gen:25:14">14</A>&nbsp;and Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa; <A NAME="an_gen:25:15">15</A>&nbsp;Hadad, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedem; <A NAME="an_gen:25:16">16</A>&nbsp;these are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their villages, and by their encampments; twelve princes according to their nations. <A NAME="an_gen:25:17">17</A>&nbsp;And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, a hundred and thirty and seven years; and he expired and died; and was gathered unto his people. <A NAME="an_gen:25:18">18</A>&nbsp;And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Asshur: over against all his brethren he did settle.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_gen:25:19">19</A>&nbsp;And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham begot Isaac. <A NAME="an_gen:25:20">20</A>&nbsp;And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean, of Paddan-aram, the sister of Laban the Aramean, to be his wife. <A NAME="an_gen:25:21">21</A>&nbsp;And Isaac entreated the LORD for his wife, because she was barren; and the LORD let Himself be entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived. <A NAME="an_gen:25:22">22</A>&nbsp;And the children struggled together within her; and she said: 'If it be so, wherefore do I live?' And she went to inquire of the LORD. <A NAME="an_gen:25:23">23</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said unto her:</p>  
<p>Two nations are in thy womb,<br> And two peoples shall be separated from thy bowels;<br> And the one people shall be stronger than the other people;<br> And the elder shall serve the younger.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_gen:25:24">24</A>&nbsp;And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb. <A NAME="an_gen:25:25">25</A>&nbsp;And the first came forth ruddy, all over like a hairy mantle; and they called his name Esau. <A NAME="an_gen:25:26">26</A>&nbsp;And after that came forth his brother, and his hand had hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_28"></A><A HREF="#fn_27"><FONT SIZE="1">a</FONT></A>
Jacob. And Isaac was threescore years old when she bore them. <A NAME="an_gen:25:27">27</A>&nbsp;And the boys grew; and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a quiet man, dwelling in tents. <A NAME="an_gen:25:28">28</A>&nbsp;Now Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison; and Rebekah loved Jacob. <A NAME="an_gen:25:29">29</A>&nbsp;And Jacob <a name="page_30"><font size="1" color="green">p. 30</font></A> sod pottage; and Esau came in from the field, and he was faint. <A NAME="an_gen:25:30">30</A>&nbsp;And Esau said to Jacob: 'Let me swallow, I pray thee, some of this red, red pottage; for I am faint.' Therefore was his name called &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_29"></A><A HREF="#fn_28"><FONT SIZE="1">a</FONT></A>
Edom. <A NAME="an_gen:25:31">31</A>&nbsp;And Jacob said: 'Sell me first thy birthright.' <A NAME="an_gen:25:32">32</A>&nbsp;And Esau said: 'Behold, I am at the point to die; and what profit shall the birthright do to me?' <A NAME="an_gen:25:33">33</A>&nbsp;And Jacob said: 'Swear to me first'; and he swore unto him; and he sold his birthright unto Jacob. <A NAME="an_gen:25:34">34</A>&nbsp;And Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way. So Esau despised his birthright.</p>
