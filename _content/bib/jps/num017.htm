<p><A NAME="an_num:17:1">1</A>&nbsp;And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: <A NAME="an_num:17:2">2</A>&nbsp;`Speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the fire-pans out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are become holy; <A NAME="an_num:17:3">3</A>&nbsp;even the fire-pans of these men who have sinned at the cost of their lives, and let them be made beaten plates for a covering of the altar&#8212;for they are become holy, because they were offered before the LORD&#8212;that they may be a sign unto the children of Israel.' <A NAME="an_num:17:4">4</A>&nbsp;And Eleazar the priest took the brazen fire-pans, which they that were burnt had offered; and they beat them out for a covering of the altar, <A NAME="an_num:17:5">5</A>&nbsp;to be a memorial unto the children of Israel, to the end that no common man, that is not of the seed of Aaron, draw near to burn incense before the LORD; that he fare not as Korah, and as his company; as the LORD spoke unto him by the hand of Moses.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_num:17:6">6</A>&nbsp;But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying: `Ye have killed the people of the LORD.' <A NAME="an_num:17:7">7</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when the congregation was assembled against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tent of meeting; and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the LORD appeared. <A NAME="an_num:17:8">8</A>&nbsp;And Moses and Aaron came to the front of the tent of meeting. <A NAME="an_num:17:9">9</A>&nbsp;And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: <A NAME="an_num:17:10">10</A>&nbsp;`Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.' And they fell upon their faces. <A NAME="an_num:17:11">11</A>&nbsp;And Moses said unto Aaron: `Take thy fire-pan, and put fire therein from off the altar, and lay incense thereon, and carry it quickly unto the congregation, and make atonement for them; for there is wrath gone out from the LORD: the plague is begun.' <A NAME="an_num:17:12">12</A>&nbsp;And Aaron took as Moses spoke, and ran into the midst of the assembly; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people; and he put on the incense, and made atonement for the people. <A NAME="an_num:17:13">13</A>&nbsp;And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_num:17:14">14</A>&nbsp;Now they that died by the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, besides them that died about the matter of Korah. <A NAME="an_num:17:15">15</A>&nbsp;And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tent of meeting, and the plague was stayed.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_num:17:16">16</A>&nbsp;And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: <A NAME="an_num:17:17">17</A>&nbsp;`Speak unto the children of Israel, and take of them rods, one for each fathers' house, of all their princes according to their fathers' houses, twelve rods; thou shalt write every man's name upon his rod. <A NAME="an_num:17:18">18</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi, for there shall be one rod for the head of their fathers' houses. <A NAME="an_num:17:19">19</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt lay them up in the tent of meeting before the testimony, where I meet with you. <A NAME="an_num:17:20">20</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass, that the man whom I shall choose, his rod shall bud; and I will make to cease from Me the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against you.' <A NAME="an_num:17:21">21</A>&nbsp;And Moses spoke unto the children of Israel; and all their princes gave him rods, for each prince one, according to their fathers' houses, even twelve rods; and the rod of Aaron was among their rods. <A NAME="an_num:17:22">22</A>&nbsp;And Moses laid up the rods before the LORD in the tent of the testimony. <A NAME="an_num:17:23">23</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses went into the tent of the testimony; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and put forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and bore ripe almonds. <A NAME="an_num:17:24">24</A>&nbsp;And Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD unto all the children of Israel; and they looked, and took every man his rod.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_num:17:25">25</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said unto Moses: `Put back the rod of Aaron before the testimony, to be kept there, for a token against the rebellious children; that there may be made an end of their murmurings against Me, that they die not.' <A NAME="an_num:17:26">26</A>&nbsp;Thus did Moses; as the LORD commanded him, so did he.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_num:17:27">27</A>&nbsp;And the children of Israel spoke unto Moses, saying: `Behold, we perish, we are undone, we are all undone. <A NAME="an_num:17:28">28</A>&nbsp;Every one that cometh near, that cometh near unto the tabernacle of the LORD, is to die; shall we wholly perish?'</p>
