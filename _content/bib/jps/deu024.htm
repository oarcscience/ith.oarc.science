<p><A NAME="an_deu:24:1">1</A>&nbsp;When a man taketh a wife, and marrieth her, then it cometh to pass, if she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath found some unseemly thing in her, that he writeth her a bill of divorcement, and giveth it in her hand, and sendeth her out of his house, <A NAME="an_deu:24:2">2</A>&nbsp;and she departeth out of his</p>  
<p><a name="page_242"><font size="1" color="green">p. 242</font></A></p>  
<p>house, and goeth and becometh another man's wife, <A NAME="an_deu:24:3">3</A>&nbsp;and the latter husband hateth her, and writeth her a bill of divorcement, and giveth it in her hand, and sendeth her out of his house; or if the latter husband die, who took her to be his wife; <A NAME="an_deu:24:4">4</A>&nbsp;her former husband, who sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is abomination before the LORD; and thou shalt not cause the land to sin, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_deu:24:5">5</A>&nbsp;When a man taketh a new wife, he shall not go out in the host, neither shall he be charged with any business; he shall be free for his house one year, and shall cheer his wife whom he hath taken.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_deu:24:6">6</A>&nbsp;No man shall take the mill or the upper millstone to pledge; for he taketh a man's life to pledge.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_deu:24:7">7</A>&nbsp;If a man be found stealing any of his brethren of the children of Israel, and he deal with him as a slave, and sell him; then that thief shall die; so shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_deu:24:8">8</A>&nbsp;Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that thou observe diligently, and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you, as I commanded them, so ye shall observe to do. <A NAME="an_deu:24:9">9</A>&nbsp;Remember what the LORD thy God did unto Miriam, by the way as ye came forth out of Egypt.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_deu:24:10">10</A>&nbsp;When thou dost lend thy neighbour any manner of loan, thou shalt not go into his house to fetch his pledge. <A NAME="an_deu:24:11">11</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt stand without, and the man to whom thou dost lend shall bring forth the pledge without unto thee. <A NAME="an_deu:24:12">12</A>&nbsp;And if he be a poor man, thou shalt not sleep with his pledge; <A NAME="an_deu:24:13">13</A>&nbsp;thou shalt surely restore to him the pledge when the sun goeth down, that he may sleep in his garment, and bless thee; and it shall be righteousness unto thee before the LORD thy God.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_deu:24:14">14</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt not oppress a hired servant that is poor and needy; whether he be of thy brethren, or of thy strangers that are in thy land within thy gates. <A NAME="an_deu:24:15">15</A>&nbsp;In the same day thou shalt give him his hire, neither shall the sun go down upon it; for he is poor, and setteth his heart upon it; lest he cry against thee unto the LORD, and it be sin in thee.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_deu:24:16">16</A>&nbsp;The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers; every man shall be put to death for his own sin.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_deu:24:17">17</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt not pervert the justice due to the stranger, or to the fatherless; nor take the widow's raiment to pledge. <A NAME="an_deu:24:18">18</A>&nbsp;But thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt, and the LORD thy God redeemed thee thence; therefore I command thee to do this thing.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_deu:24:19">19</A>&nbsp;When thou reapest thy harvest in thy field, and hast forgot a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go back to fetch it; it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow; that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all the work of thy hands.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_deu:24:20">20</A>&nbsp;When thou beatest thine olive-tree, thou shalt not go over the boughs again; it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow. <A NAME="an_deu:24:21">21</A>&nbsp;When thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard, thou shalt not glean it after thee; it shall he for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow. <A NAME="an_deu:24:22">22</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt; therefore I command thee to do this thing.</p>
