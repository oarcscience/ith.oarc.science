### LEVITICUS CHAPTER 12

<span id="an_lev:12:1">1</span> And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:
<span id="an_lev:12:2">2</span> Speak unto the children of Israel,
saying:

If a woman be delivered, and bear a man-child, then she shall be unclean
seven days; as in the days of the impurity of her sickness shall she be
unclean. <span id="an_lev:12:3">3</span> And in the eighth day the flesh
of his foreskin shall be circumcised. <span
id="an_lev:12:4">4</span> And she shall continue in the blood of
purification three and thirty days; she shall touch no hallowed thing,
nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purification be
fulfilled. <span id="an_lev:12:5">5</span> But if she bear a maid-child,
then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her impurity; and she shall
continue in the blood of purification threescore and six days. <span
id="an_lev:12:6">6</span> And when the days of her purification are
fulfilled, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the
first year for a burnt-offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtle-dove,
for a sin-offering, unto the door of the <span id="page_132">p.
132</span> tent of meeting, unto the priest. <span
id="an_lev:12:7">7</span> And he shall offer it before the LORD, and
make atonement for her; and she shall be cleansed from the fountain of
her blood. This is the law for her that beareth, whether a male or a
female. <span id="an_lev:12:8">8</span> And if her means suffice not for
a lamb, then she shall take two turtledoves, or two young pigeons: the
one for a burnt-offering, and the other for a sin-offering; and the
priest shall make atonement for her, and she shall be clean.
