<p><A NAME="an_exo:2:1">1</A>&nbsp;And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi. <A NAME="an_exo:2:2">2</A>&nbsp;And the woman conceived, and bore a son; and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, <a name="page_66"><font size="1" color="green">p. 66</font></A> she hid him three months. <A NAME="an_exo:2:3">3</A>&nbsp;And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch; and she put the child therein, and laid it in the flags by the river's brink. <A NAME="an_exo:2:4">4</A>&nbsp;And his sister stood afar off, to know what would be done to him. <A NAME="an_exo:2:6">6</A>&nbsp;And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe in the river; and her maidens walked along by the river-side; and she saw the ark among the flags, and sent her handmaid to fetch it. <A NAME="an_exo:2:6">6</A>&nbsp;And she opened it, and saw it, even the child; and behold a boy that wept. And she had compassion on him, and said: 'This is one of the Hebrews' children.' <A NAME="an_exo:2:7">7</A>&nbsp;Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter: 'Shall I go and call thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?' <A NAME="an_exo:2:8">8</A>&nbsp;And Pharaoh's daughter said to her: 'Go.' And the maiden went and called the child's mother. <A NAME="an_exo:2:9">9</A>&nbsp;And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her: 'Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages.' And the woman took the child, and nursed it. <A NAME="an_exo:2:10">10</A>&nbsp;And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_73"></A><A HREF="#fn_72"><FONT SIZE="1">a</FONT></A>
Moses, and said: 'Because I &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_74"></A><A HREF="#fn_73"><FONT SIZE="1">b</FONT></A>
drew him out of the water.'</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_exo:2:11">11</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown up, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens; and he saw an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew, one of his brethren. <A NAME="an_exo:2:12">12</A>&nbsp;And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he smote the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand. <A NAME="an_exo:2:13">13</A>&nbsp;And he went out the second day, and, behold, two men of the Hebrews were striving together; and he said to him that did the wrong: 'Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?' <A NAME="an_exo:2:14">14</A>&nbsp;And he said: 'Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us? thinkest thou to kill me, as thou didst kill the Egyptian?' And Moses feared, and said: 'Surely the thing is known.' <A NAME="an_exo:2:15">15</A>&nbsp;Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian; and he sat down by a well. <A NAME="an_exo:2:16">16</A>&nbsp;Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters; and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock. <A NAME="an_exo:2:17">17</A>&nbsp;And the shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock. <A NAME="an_exo:2:18">18</A>&nbsp;And when they came to Reuel their father, he said: 'How is it that ye are come so soon to-day?' <A NAME="an_exo:2:19">19</A>&nbsp;And they said: 'An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and moreover he drew water for us, and watered the flock.' <A NAME="an_exo:2:20">20</A>&nbsp;And he said unto his daughters: 'And where is he? why is it that ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.' <A NAME="an_exo:2:21">21</A>&nbsp;And Moses was content to dwell with the man; and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter. <A NAME="an_exo:2:22">22</A>&nbsp;And she bore a son, and he called' his name Gershom; for he said: 'I have been &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_75"></A><A HREF="#fn_74"><FONT SIZE="1">c</FONT></A>

<p><A NAME="an_exo:2:23">23</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass in the course of those many days that the king of Egypt died; and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage. <A NAME="an_exo:2:24">24</A>&nbsp;And God heard their groaning, and God remembered His covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob. <A NAME="an_exo:2:25">25</A>&nbsp;And God saw the children of Israel, and God took cognizance of them.</p>
