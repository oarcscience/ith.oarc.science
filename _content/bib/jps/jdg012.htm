<p><A NAME="an_jdg:12:1">1</A>&nbsp;And the men of Ephraim were gathered together, and passed to Zaphon; and they said unto Jephthah: `Wherefore didst thou pass over to fight against the children of Ammon, and didst not call us to go</p>  
<p><a name="page_311"><font size="1" color="green">p. 311</font></A></p>  
<p>with thee? we will burn thy house upon thee with fire.' <A NAME="an_jdg:12:2">2</A>&nbsp;And Jephthah said unto them: `I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, ye saved me not out of their hand. <A NAME="an_jdg:12:3">3</A>&nbsp;And when I saw that ye saved me not, I put my life in my hand, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and the LORD delivered them into my hand; wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day, to fight against me?' <A NAME="an_jdg:12:4">4</A>&nbsp;Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim; and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said: `Ye are fugitives of Ephraim, ye Gileadites, in the midst of Ephraim, and in the midst of Manasseh.' <A NAME="an_jdg:12:5">5</A>&nbsp;And the Gileadites took the fords of the Jordan against the Ephraimites; and it was so, that when any of the fugitives of Ephraim said: `Let me go over', the men of Gilead said unto him: `Art thou an Ephraimite?' If he said: `Nay'; <A NAME="an_jdg:12:6">6</A>&nbsp;then said they unto him: `Say now Shibboleth'; and he said `Sibboleth'; for he could not frame to pronounce it right; then they laid hold on him, and slew him at the fords of the Jordan; and there fell at that time of Ephraim forty and two thousand.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_jdg:12:7">7</A>&nbsp;And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then died Jephthah the Gileadite, and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_jdg:12:8">8</A>&nbsp;And after him Ibzan of Beth-lehem judged Israel. <A NAME="an_jdg:12:9">9</A>&nbsp;And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters he sent abroad, and thirty daughters he brought in from abroad for his sons. And he judged Israel seven years. <A NAME="an_jdg:12:10">10</A>&nbsp;And Ibzan died, and was buried at Beth-lehem.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_jdg:12:11">11</A>&nbsp;And after him Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel; and he judged Israel ten years. <A NAME="an_jdg:12:12">12</A>&nbsp;And Elon the Zebulunite died, and was buried in Aijalon in the land of Zebulun.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_jdg:12:13">13</A>&nbsp;And after him Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel. <A NAME="an_jdg:12:14">14</A>&nbsp;And he had forty sons and thirty sons' sons, that rode on threescore and ten ass colts; and he judged Israel eight years. <A NAME="an_jdg:12:15">15</A>&nbsp;And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the hill-country of the Amalekites.</p>
