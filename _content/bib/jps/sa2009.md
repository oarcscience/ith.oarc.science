### II SAMUEL CHAPTER 9

<span id="an_sa2:9:1">1</span>  And David said: \`Is there yet any that
is left of the house of Saul, that I may show him kindness for
Jonathan's sake?' <span id="an_sa2:9:2">2</span>  Now there was of the
house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba, and they called him unto
David; and the king said unto him: \`Art thou Ziba?' And he said: \`Thy
servant is he.' <span id="an_sa2:9:3">3</span>  And the king said: \`Is
there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may show the kindness of
God unto him?' And Ziba said unto the king: \`Jonathan hath yet a son,
who is lame on his feet.' <span id="an_sa2:9:4">4</span>  And the king
said unto him: \`Where is he?' And Ziba said unto the king: \`Behold, he
is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, in Lodebar.'

<span id="page_376">p. 376</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> <span
id="an_sa2:9:5">5</span>  Then king David sent, and fetched him out of
the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, from Lo-debar. <span
id="an_sa2:9:6">6</span>  And Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son
of Saul, came unto David, and fell on his face, and prostrated himself.
And David said: \`Mephibosheth!' And he answered: \`Behold thy servant!'
<span id="an_sa2:9:7">7</span>  And David said unto him: \`Fear not; for
I will surely show thee kindness for Jonathan thy father's sake, and
will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat
bread at my table continually.' <span id="an_sa2:9:8">8</span>  And he
bowed down, and said: \`What is thy servant, that thou shouldest look
upon such a dead dog as I am?'

<span id="an_sa2:9:9">9</span>  Then the king called to Ziba, Saul's
servant, and said unto him: \`All that pertained to Saul and to all his
house have I given unto thy master's son. <span
id="an_sa2:9:10">10</span>  And thou shalt till the land for him, thou,
and thy sons, and thy servants; and thou shalt bring in the fruits, that
thy master's son may have bread to eat; but Mephibosheth thy master's
son shall eat bread continually at my table.' Now Ziba had fifteen sons
and twenty servants. <span id="an_sa2:9:11">11</span>  Then said Ziba
unto the king: \`According to all that my lord the king commandeth his
servant, so shall thy servant do; but Mephibosheth eateth at my table as
one of the king's sons.' <span id="an_sa2:9:12">12</span>  Now
Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Mica. And all that dwelt in
the house of Ziba were servants unto Mephibosheth. <span
id="an_sa2:9:13">13</span>  But Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem; for he
did eat continually at the king's table; and he was lame on both his
feet.
