<p><A NAME="an_gen:3:1">1</A>&nbsp;Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman: 'Yea, hath God said: Ye shall not eat of any tree of the garden?' <A NAME="an_gen:3:2">2</A>&nbsp;And the woman said unto the serpent: 'Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat; <A NAME="an_gen:3:3">3</A>&nbsp;but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said: Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.' <A NAME="an_gen:3:4">4</A>&nbsp;And the serpent said unto the woman: 'Ye shall not surely die; <A NAME="an_gen:3:5">5</A>&nbsp;for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as God, knowing good and evil.' <A NAME="an_gen:3:6">6</A>&nbsp;And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat; and she gave also unto her husband with her, and he did eat. <A NAME="an_gen:3:7">7</A>&nbsp;And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig-leaves together, and made themselves girdles. <A NAME="an_gen:3:8">8</A>&nbsp;And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden toward the cool of the day; and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden. <A NAME="an_gen:3:9">9</A>&nbsp;And the LORD God called unto the man, and said unto him: 'Where art thou?' <A NAME="an_gen:3:10">10</A>&nbsp;And he said: 'I heard Thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.' <A NAME="an_gen:3:11">11</A>&nbsp;And He said: 'Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?' <A NAME="an_gen:3:12">12</A>&nbsp;And the man said: 'The woman whom Thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.' <A NAME="an_gen:3:13">13</A>&nbsp;And the LORD God said unto the woman: 'What is this thou hast done?' And the woman said: 'The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.' <A NAME="an_gen:3:14">14</A>&nbsp;And the LORD God said unto the serpent: 'Because thou hast done this, cursed art thou from among all cattle, and from among all beasts of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life. <A NAME="an_gen:3:15">15</A>&nbsp;And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy <a name="page_6"><font size="1" color="green">p. 6</font></A> seed and her seed; they shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise their heel.'</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_gen:3:16">16</A>&nbsp;Unto the woman He said: 'I will greatly multiply thy pain and thy travail; in pain thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.'</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_gen:3:17">17</A>&nbsp;And unto Adam He said: 'Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying: Thou shalt not eat of it; cursed is the ground for thy sake; in toil shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life. <A NAME="an_gen:3:18">18</A>&nbsp;Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field. <A NAME="an_gen:3:19">19</A>&nbsp;In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken; for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.' <A NAME="an_gen:3:20">20</A>&nbsp;And the man called his wife's name &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8"></A><A HREF="#fn_7"><FONT SIZE="1">a</FONT></A>
Eve; because she was the mother of all living. <A NAME="an_gen:3:21">21</A>&nbsp;And the LORD God made for Adam and for his wife garments of skins, and clothed them.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_gen:3:22">22</A>&nbsp;And the LORD God said: 'Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever.' <A NAME="an_gen:3:23">23</A>&nbsp;Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken. <A NAME="an_gen:3:24">24</A>&nbsp;So He drove out the man; and He placed at the east of the garden of Eden the cherubim, and the flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way to the tree of life.</p>
