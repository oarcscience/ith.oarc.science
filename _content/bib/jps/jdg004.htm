<p><A NAME="an_jdg:4:1">1</A>&nbsp;And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, when Ehud was dead. <A NAME="an_jdg:4:2">2</A>&nbsp;And the LORD gave them over into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera, who dwelt in Harosheth-goiim. <A NAME="an_jdg:4:3">3</A>&nbsp;And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD; for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_jdg:4:4">4</A>&nbsp;Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, she judged Israel at that time. <A NAME="an_jdg:4:5">5</A>&nbsp;And she sat under the palm-tree of Deborah between Ramah and Beth-el in the hill-country of Ephraim; and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment. <A NAME="an_jdg:4:6">6</A>&nbsp;And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh-naphtali, and said unto him: `Hath not the LORD, the God of Israel, commanded, saying: Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun? <A NAME="an_jdg:4:7">7</A>&nbsp;And I will draw unto thee to the brook Kishon Sisera, the captain of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into thy hand.' <A NAME="an_jdg:4:8">8</A>&nbsp;And Barak said unto her: `If thou wilt go with me, then I will go; but if thou wilt not go with me, I will not go.' <A NAME="an_jdg:4:9">9</A>&nbsp;And she said: `I will surely go with thee; notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thy honour; for the LORD will give Sisera over into the hand of a woman.' And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh. <A NAME="an_jdg:4:10">10</A>&nbsp;And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali together to Kedesh; and there went up ten thousand men at his feet; and Deborah went up with him.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_jdg:4:11">11</A>&nbsp;Now Heber the Kenite had severed himself from the Kenites, even from the children of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, and had pitched his tent as far as Elon-bezaanannim, which is by Kedesh.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_jdg:4:12">12</A>&nbsp;And they told Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to mount Tabor. <A NAME="an_jdg:4:13">13</A>&nbsp;And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from Harosheth-goiim, unto the brook Kishon. <A NAME="an_jdg:4:14">14</A>&nbsp;And Deborah said unto Barak: `Up; for this is the day in which the LORD hath delivered Sisera into thy</p>  
<p><a name="page_298"><font size="1" color="green">p. 298</font></A></p>  
<p>hand; is not the LORD gone out before thee?' So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him. <A NAME="an_jdg:4:15">15</A>&nbsp;And the LORD discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; and Sisera alighted from his chariot, and fled away on his feet. <A NAME="an_jdg:4:16">16</A>&nbsp;But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto Harosheth-goiim; and all the host of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; there was not a man left.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_jdg:4:17">17</A>&nbsp;Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite; for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite. <A NAME="an_jdg:4:18">18</A>&nbsp;And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him: `Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not.' And he turned in unto her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug. <A NAME="an_jdg:4:19">19</A>&nbsp;And he said unto her: `Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty.' And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him. <A NAME="an_jdg:4:20">20</A>&nbsp;And he said unto her: `Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man doth come and inquire of thee, and say: Is there any man here? that thou shalt say: No.' <A NAME="an_jdg:4:21">21</A>&nbsp;Then Jael Heber's wife took a tent-pin, and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the pin into his temples, and it pierced through into the ground; for he was in a deep sleep; so he swooned and died. <A NAME="an_jdg:4:22">22</A>&nbsp;And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said unto him: `Come, and I will show thee the man whom thou seekest.' And he came unto her; and, behold, Sisera lay dead, and the tent-pin was in his temples. <A NAME="an_jdg:4:23">23</A>&nbsp;So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel. <A NAME="an_jdg:4:24">24</A>&nbsp;And the hand of the children of Israel prevailed more and more against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.</p>
