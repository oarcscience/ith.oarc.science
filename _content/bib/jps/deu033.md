### DEUTERONOMY CHAPTER 33

‏וזאת הברכה‎

<span id="an_deu:33:1">1</span> And this is the blessing, wherewith
Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death.
<span id="an_deu:33:2">2</span> And he said:

The LORD came from Sinai,  
And rose from Seir unto them;  
He shined forth from mount Paran,  
And He came from the myriads holy,  
At His right hand was a fiery law unto them.  
<span id="an_deu:33:3">3</span> Yea, He loveth the peoples,  
All His holy onesthey are in Thy hand;  
And they sit down at Thy feet,  
Receiving of Thy words.  
<span id="an_deu:33:4">4</span> Moses commanded us a law,  
An inheritance of the congregation of Jacob.  
<span id="an_deu:33:5">5</span> And there was a king in Jeshurun,  
When the heads of the people were gathered,  
All the tribes of Israel together.

<span id="an_deu:33:6">6</span> Let Reuben live, and not die  
In that his men become few.

<span id="an_deu:33:7">7</span> And this for Judah, and he said:  
Hear, LORD, the voice of Judah,  
And bring him in unto his people;  
His hands shall contend for him,  
And Thou shalt be a help against his adversaries.

<span id="an_deu:33:8">8</span> And of Levi he said:  
Thy Thummim and Thy Urim be with Thy holy one,  
Whom Thou didst prove at Massah,  
With whom Thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah;  
<span id="an_deu:33:9">9</span> Who said of his father, and of his
mother: \`I have not seen him';  
Neither did he acknowledge his brethren,  
Nor knew he his own children;  
For they have observed Thy word,  
And keep Thy covenant.  
<span id="an_deu:33:10">10</span> They shall teach Jacob Thine
ordinances,  
And Israel Thy law;  
They shall put incense before Thee,  
And whole burnt-offering upon Thine altar.  
<span id="an_deu:33:11">11</span> Bless, LORD, his substance,  
And accept the work of his hands;  
Smite through the loins of them that rise up against him,  
And of them that hate him, that they rise not again.

<span id="an_deu:33:12">12</span> Of Benjamin he said:  
The beloved of the LORD shall dwell in safety by Him;  
He covereth him all the day,  
And He dwelleth between his shoulders.

<span id="an_deu:33:13">13</span> And of Joseph he said:  
Blessed of the LORD be his land;  
For the precious things of heaven, for the dew,  
And for the deep that coucheth beneath,  
<span id="an_deu:33:14">14</span> And for the precious things of the
fruits of the sun,  
And for the precious things of the yield of the moons,  
<span id="an_deu:33:15">15</span> And for the tops of the ancient
mountains,  
And for the precious things of the everlasting hills,  
<span id="an_deu:33:16">16</span> And for the precious things of the
earth and the fulness thereof,  
And the good will of Him that dwelt in the bush;  
<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>  
Let the blessing come upon the head of Joseph,  
And upon the crown of the head of him that is prince among his
brethren.  
<span id="an_deu:33:17">17</span> His firstling bullock, majesty is
his;  
And his horns are the horns of the wild-ox;  
With them he shall gore the peoples all of them, even the ends of the
earth;  
And they are the ten thousands of Ephraim,  
And they are the thousands of Manasseh.

<span id="an_deu:33:18">18</span> And of Zebulun he said:  
Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out,  
And, Issachar, in thy tents.  
<span id="an_deu:33:19">19</span> They shall call peoples unto the
mountain;  
There shall they offer sacrifices of righteousness;  
For they shall suck the abundance of the seas,  
And the hidden treasures of the sand.

<span id="an_deu:33:20">20</span> And of Gad he said:  
Blessed be He that enlargeth Gad;  
He dwelleth as a lioness,  
And teareth the arm, yea, the crown of the head.  
<span id="an_deu:33:21">21</span> And he chose a first part for
himself,  
For there a portion of a ruler was reserved;  
And there came the heads of the people,  
He executed the righteousness of the LORD,  
And His ordinances with Israel.

<span id="an_deu:33:22">22</span> And of Dan he said:  
Dan is a lion's whelp,  
That leapeth forth from Bashan.

<span id="an_deu:33:23">23</span> And of Naphtali he said:  
O Naphtali, satisfied with favour,  
And full with the blessing of the LORD:  
Possess thou the sea and the south.

<span id="an_deu:33:24">24</span> And of Asher he said:  
Blessed be Asher above sons;  
Let him be the favoured of his brethren,  
And let him dip his foot in oil.  
<span id="an_deu:33:25">25</span> Iron and brass shall be thy bars;  
And as thy days, so shall thy strength be.

<span id="an_deu:33:26">26</span> There is none like unto God, O
Jeshurun,  
Who rideth upon the heaven as thy help,  
And in His excellency on the skies.  
<span id="an_deu:33:27">27</span> The eternal God is a dwellingplaee,  
And underneath are the everlasting arms;  
And He thrust out the enemy from before thee,  
And said: \`Destroy.'  
<span id="an_deu:33:28">28</span> And Israel dwelleth in safety,  
The fountain of Jacob alone,  
In a land of corn and wine;  
Yea, his heavens drop down dew.  
<span id="an_deu:33:29">29</span> Happy art thou, O Israel, who is like
unto thee?  
A people saved by the LORD,  
The shield of thy help,  
And that is the sword of thy excellency!  
And thine enemies shall dwindle away before thee;  
And thou shalt tread upon their high places.
