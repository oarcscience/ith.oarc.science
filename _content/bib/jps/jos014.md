### JOSHUA CHAPTER 14

<span id="an_jos:14:1">1</span> And these are the inheritances which the
children of Israel took in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest,
and Joshua the son of Nun,

<span id="page_278">p. 278</span>

and the heads of the fathers' houses of the tribes of the children of
Israel, distributed unto them, <span id="an_jos:14:2">2</span> by the
lot of their inheritance, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses,
for the nine tribes, and for the half-tribe.— <span
id="an_jos:14:3">3</span> For Moses had given the inheritance of the two
tribes and the half-tribe beyond the Jordan; but unto the Levites he
gave no inheritance among them. <span id="an_jos:14:4">4</span> For the
children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim; and they gave
no portion unto the Levites in the land, save cities to dwell in, with
the open land about them for their cattle and for their substance.<span
id="an_jos:14:5">5</span> As the LORD commanded Moses, so the children
of Israel did, and they divided the land.

<span id="an_jos:14:6">6</span> Then the children of Judah drew nigh
unto Joshua in Gilgal; and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said
unto him: 'Thou knowest the thing that the LORD spoke unto Moses the man
of God concerning me and concerning thee in Kadesh-barnea. <span
id="an_jos:14:7">7</span> Forty years old was I when Moses the servant
of the LORD sent me from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land; and I
brought him back word as it was in my heart. <span
id="an_jos:14:8">8</span> Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me
made the heart of the people melt; but I wholly followed the LORD my
God. <span id="an_jos:14:9">9</span> And Moses swore on that day,
saying: Surely the land whereon thy foot hath trodden shall be an
inheritance to thee and to thy children for ever, because thou hast
wholly followed the LORD my God. <span id="an_jos:14:10">10</span> And
now, behold, the LORD hath kept me alive, as He spoke, these forty and
five years, from the time that the LORD spoke this word unto Moses,
while Israel walked in the wilderness; and now, lo, I am this day
fourscore and five years old. <span id="an_jos:14:11">11</span> As yet I
am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me; as my
strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war, and to go out
and to come in. <span id="an_jos:14:12">12</span> Now therefore give me
this mountain, whereof the LORD spoke in that day; for thou heardest in
that day how the Anakim were there, and cities great and fortified; it
may be that the LORD will be with me, and I shall drive them out, as the
LORD spoke.' <span id="an_jos:14:13">13</span> And Joshua blessed him;
and he gave Hebron unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance.
<span id="an_jos:14:14">14</span> Therefore Hebron became the
inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, unto this day;
because that he wholly followed the LORD, the God of Israel. <span
id="an_jos:14:15">15</span> Now the name of Hebron beforetime was  <span
id="fr_106"></span>[a](#fn_103) Kiriath-arba, which Arba was the
greatest man among the Anakim. And the land had rest from war.
