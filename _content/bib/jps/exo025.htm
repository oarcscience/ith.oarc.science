<p><A NAME="an_exo:25:1">1</A>&nbsp;And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: <A NAME="an_exo:25:2">2</A>&nbsp;'Speak unto the children of Israel, that they take for Me an offering; of every man whose heart maketh him willing ye shall take My offering. <A NAME="an_exo:25:3">3</A>&nbsp;And this is the offering which ye shall take of them: gold, and silver, and brass; <A NAME="an_exo:25:4">4</A>&nbsp;and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats&#8217; hair; <A NAME="an_exo:25:5">5</A>&nbsp;and rams&#8217; skins dyed red, and sealskins, and acacia-wood; <A NAME="an_exo:25:6">6</A>&nbsp;oil for the light, spices for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense; <A NAME="an_exo:25:7">7</A>&nbsp;onyx stones, and stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate. <A NAME="an_exo:25:8">8</A>&nbsp;And let them make Me a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them. <A NAME="an_exo:25:9">9</A>&nbsp;According to all that I show thee, the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the furniture thereof, even so shall ye make it.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_exo:25:10">10</A>&nbsp;And they shall make an ark of acacia-wood: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof. <A NAME="an_exo:25:11">11</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, within and without shalt thou overlay it, and shalt make upon it a crown of gold round about. <A NAME="an_exo:25:12">12</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it, and put them in the four feet thereof; and two rings shall be on the one side of it, and two rings on the other side of it. <A NAME="an_exo:25:13">13</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt make staves of acacia-wood, and overlay them with gold. <A NAME="an_exo:25:14">14</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt put the staves into the rings on the sides of the ark, wherewith to bear the ark. <A NAME="an_exo:25:15">15</A>&nbsp;The staves shall be in the rings of the ark; they shall not be taken from it. <A NAME="an_exo:25:16">16</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall give thee. <A NAME="an_exo:25:17">17</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt make an ark-cover of pure gold: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof. <A NAME="an_exo:25:18">18</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt make two cherubim of gold; of beaten work shalt thou make them, at the two ends of the ark-cover. <A NAME="an_exo:25:19">19</A>&nbsp;And make one cherub at the one end, and one cherub at the other end; of one piece with the ark-cover shall <a name="page_95"><font size="1" color="green">p. 95</font></A> ye make the cherubim of the two ends thereof. <A NAME="an_exo:25:20">20</A>&nbsp;And the cherubim shall spread out their wings on high, screening the ark-cover with their wings, with their faces one to another; toward the ark-cover shall the faces of the cherubim be. <A NAME="an_exo:25:21">21</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt put the ark-cover above upon the ark; and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee. <A NAME="an_exo:25:22">22</A>&nbsp;And there I will meet with thee, and I will speak with thee from above the ark-cover, from between the two cherubim which are upon the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_exo:25:23">23</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt make a table of acacia-wood: two cubits shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof. <A NAME="an_exo:25:24">24</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, and make thereto a crown of gold round about. <A NAME="an_exo:25:25">25</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt make unto it a border of a handbreadth round about, and thou shalt make a golden crown to the border thereof round about. <A NAME="an_exo:25:26">26</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt make for it four rings of gold, and put the rings in the four corners that are on the four feet thereof. <A NAME="an_exo:25:27">27</A>&nbsp;Close by the border shall the rings be, for places for the staves to bear the table. <A NAME="an_exo:25:28">28</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt make the staves of acacia-wood, and overlay them with gold, that the table may be borne with them. <A NAME="an_exo:25:29">29</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt make the dishes thereof, and the pans thereof, and the jars thereof, and the bowls thereof, wherewith to pour out; of pure gold shalt thou make them. <A NAME="an_exo:25:30">30</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt set upon the table showbread before Me alway.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_exo:25:31">31</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work shall the candlestick be made, even its base, and its shaft; its cups, its knops, and its flowers, shall be of one piece with it. <A NAME="an_exo:25:32">32</A>&nbsp;And there shall be six branches going out of the sides thereof: three branches of the candlestick out of the one side thereof, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side thereof; <A NAME="an_exo:25:33">33</A>&nbsp;three cups made like almond-blossoms in one branch, a knop and a flower; and three cups made like almond-blossoms in the other branch, a knop and a flower; so for the six branches going out of the candlestick. <A NAME="an_exo:25:34">34</A>&nbsp;And in the candlestick four cups made like almond-blossoms, the knops thereof, and the flowers thereof. <A NAME="an_exo:25:35">35</A>&nbsp;And a knop under two branches of one piece with it, and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, for the six branches going out of the candlestick. <A NAME="an_exo:25:36">36</A>&nbsp;Their knops and their branches shall be of one piece with it; the whole of it one beaten work of pure gold. <A NAME="an_exo:25:37">37</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt make the lamps thereof, seven; and they shall light the lamps thereof, to give light over against it. <A NAME="an_exo:25:38">38</A>&nbsp;And the tongs thereof, and the snuffdishes thereof, shall be of pure gold. <A NAME="an_exo:25:39">39</A>&nbsp;Of a talent of pure gold shall it be made, with all these vessels. <A NAME="an_exo:25:40">40</A>&nbsp;And see that thou make them after their pattern, which is being shown thee in the mount.</p>
