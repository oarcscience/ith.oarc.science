<p><A NAME="an_lev:2:1">1</A>&nbsp;And when any one bringeth a meal-offering unto the LORD, his offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense <a name="page_119"><font size="1" color="green">p. 119</font></A> thereon. <A NAME="an_lev:2:2">2</A>&nbsp;And he shall bring it to Aaron's sons the priests; and he shall take thereout his handful of the fine flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, together with all the frankincense thereof; and the priest shall make the memorial-part thereof smoke upon the altar, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD. <A NAME="an_lev:2:3">3</A>&nbsp;But that which is left of the meal-offering shall be Aaron's and his sons&#8217;; it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_lev:2:4">4</A>&nbsp;And when thou bringest a meal-offering baked in the oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers spread with oil.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_lev:2:5">5</A>&nbsp;And if thy offering be a meal-offering baked on a griddle, it shall be of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil. <A NAME="an_lev:2:6">6</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt break it in pieces, and pour oil thereon; it is a meal-offering.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_lev:2:7">7</A>&nbsp;And if thy offering be a meal-offering of the stewing-pan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil. <A NAME="an_lev:2:8">8</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt bring the meal-offering that is made of these things unto the LORD; and it shall be presented unto the priest, and he shall bring it unto the altar. <A NAME="an_lev:2:9">9</A>&nbsp;And the priest shall take off from the meal-offering the memorial-part thereof, and shall make it smoke upon the altar&#8212;an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD. <A NAME="an_lev:2:10">10</A>&nbsp;But that which is left of the meal-offering shall be Aaron's and his sons&#8217;; it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire. <A NAME="an_lev:2:11">11</A>&nbsp;No meal-offering, which ye shall bring unto the LORD, shall be made with leaven; for ye shall make no leaven, nor any honey, smoke as an offering made by fire unto the LORD. <A NAME="an_lev:2:12">12</A>&nbsp;As an offering of first-fruits ye may bring them unto the LORD; but they shall not come up for a sweet savour on the altar. <A NAME="an_lev:2:13">13</A>&nbsp;And every meal-offering of thine shalt thou season with salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meal-offering; with all thine offerings thou shalt offer salt.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_lev:2:14">14</A>&nbsp;And if thou bring a meal-offering of first-fruits unto the LORD, thou shalt bring for the meal-offering of thy first-fruits corn in the ear parched with fire, even groats of the fresh ear. <A NAME="an_lev:2:15">15</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon; it is a meal-offering. <A NAME="an_lev:2:16">16</A>&nbsp;And the priest shall make the memorial-part of it smoke, even of the groats thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof; it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.</p>
