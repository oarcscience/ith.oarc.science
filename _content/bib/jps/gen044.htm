<p><A NAME="an_gen:44:1">1</A>&nbsp;And he commanded the steward of his house, saying: 'Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth. <A NAME="an_gen:44:2">2</A>&nbsp;And put my goblet, the silver goblet, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his corn money.' And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken. <A NAME="an_gen:44:3">3</A>&nbsp;As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses. <A NAME="an_gen:44:4">4</A>&nbsp;And when they were gone out of the city, and were not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward: 'Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them: Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good? <A NAME="an_gen:44:5">5</A>&nbsp;Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby he indeed divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.' <A NAME="an_gen:44:6">6</A>&nbsp;And he overtook them, and he spoke unto them these words. <A NAME="an_gen:44:7">7</A>&nbsp;And they said unto him: 'Wherefore speaketh my lord such words as these? Far be it from thy servants that they should do such a thing. <A NAME="an_gen:44:8">8</A>&nbsp;Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought back unto thee out of the land of Canaan; how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold? <A NAME="an_gen:44:9">9</A>&nbsp;With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen.' <A NAME="an_gen:44:10">10</A>&nbsp;And he said: 'Now also let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my bondman; and ye shall be blameless.' <A NAME="an_gen:44:11">11</A>&nbsp;Then they hastened, and took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack. <A NAME="an_gen:44:12">12</A>&nbsp;And he searched, beginning at the eldest, and leaving off at the youngest; and the goblet was found in Benjamin's sack. <A NAME="an_gen:44:13">13</A>&nbsp;Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city. <A NAME="an_gen:44:14">14</A>&nbsp;And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house, and he was yet there; and they fell before him on the ground. <A NAME="an_gen:44:15">15</A>&nbsp;And Joseph said unto them: 'What deed is this that ye have done? know ye <a name="page_56"><font size="1" color="green">p. 56</font></A> not that such a man as I will indeed divine?' <A NAME="an_gen:44:16">16</A>&nbsp;And Judah said: 'What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants; behold, we are my lord's bondmen, both we, and he also in whose hand the cup is found.' <A NAME="an_gen:44:17">17</A>&nbsp;And he said: Far be it from me that I should do so; the man in whose hand the goblet is found, he shall be my bondman; but as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.'</p>

<p><A NAME="an_gen:44:18">18</A>&nbsp;Then Judah came near unto him, and said: 'Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant; for thou art even as Pharaoh. <A NAME="an_gen:44:19">19</A>&nbsp;My lord asked his servants, saying: Have ye a father, or a brother? <A NAME="an_gen:44:20">20</A>&nbsp;And we said unto my lord: We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him. <A NAME="an_gen:44:21">21</A>&nbsp;And thou saidst unto thy servants: Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him. <A NAME="an_gen:44:22">22</A>&nbsp;And we said unto my lord: The lad cannot leave his father; for if he should leave his father, his father would die. <A NAME="an_gen:44:23">23</A>&nbsp;And thou saidst unto thy servants: Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more. <A NAME="an_gen:44:24">24</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord. <A NAME="an_gen:44:25">25</A>&nbsp;And our father said: Go again, buy us a little food. <A NAME="an_gen:44:26">26</A>&nbsp;And we said: We cannot go down; if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down; for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother be with us. <A NAME="an_gen:44:27">27</A>&nbsp;And thy servant my father said unto us: Ye know that my wife bore me two sons; <A NAME="an_gen:44:28">28</A>&nbsp;and the one went out from me, and I said: Surely he is torn in pieces; and I have not seen him since; <A NAME="an_gen:44:29">29</A>&nbsp;and if ye take this one also from me, and harm befall him, ye will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave. <A NAME="an_gen:44:30">30</A>&nbsp;Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad is not with us; seeing that his soul is bound up with the lad's soul; <A NAME="an_gen:44:31">31</A>&nbsp;it will come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us, that he will die; and thy servants will bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave. <A NAME="an_gen:44:32">32</A>&nbsp;For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying: If I bring him not unto thee, then shall I bear the blame to my father for ever. <A NAME="an_gen:44:33">33</A>&nbsp;Now therefore, let thy servant, I pray thee, abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren. <A NAME="an_gen:44:34">34</A>&nbsp;For how shall I go up to my father, if the lad be not with me? lest I look upon the evil that shall come on my father.'</p>
