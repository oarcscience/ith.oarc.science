### JUDGES CHAPTER 15

<span id="an_jdg:15:1">1</span> But it came to pass after a while, in
the time of wheat harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and
he said: \`I will go in to my

<span id="page_314">p. 314</span>

wife into the chamber.' But her father would not suffer him to go in.
<span id="an_jdg:15:2">2</span> And her father said: \`I verily thought
that thou hadst utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to thy
companion; is not her younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray
thee, instead of her.' <span id="an_jdg:15:3">3</span> And Samson said
unto them: \`This time shall I be quits with the Philistines, when I do
them a mischief.' <span id="an_jdg:15:4">4</span> And Samson went and
caught three hundred foxes, and took torches, and turned tail to tail,
and put a torch in the midst between every two tails. <span
id="an_jdg:15:5">5</span> And when he had set the torches on fire, he
let them go into the standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both
the shocks and the standing corn, and also the oliveyards. <span
id="an_jdg:15:6">6</span> Then the Philistines said: \`Who hath done
this?' And they said: \`Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because
he hath taken his wife, and given her to his companion.' And the
Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire. <span
id="an_jdg:15:7">7</span> And Samson said unto them: \`If ye do after
this manner, surely I will be avenged of you, and after that I will
cease.' <span id="an_jdg:15:8">8</span> And he smote them hip and thigh
with a great slaughter; and he went down and dwelt in the cleft of the
rock of Etam.

<span id="an_jdg:15:9">9</span> Then the Philistines went up, and
pitched in Judah, and spread themselves against Lehi. <span
id="an_jdg:15:10">10</span> And the men of Judah said: \`Why are ye come
up against us?' And they said: \`To bind Samson are we come up, to do to
him as he hath done to us.' <span id="an_jdg:15:11">11</span> Then three
thousand men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam, and
said to Samson: \`Knowest thou not that the Philistines are rulers over
us? what then is this that thou hast done unto us?' And he said unto
them: \`As they did unto me, so have I done unto them.' <span
id="an_jdg:15:12">12</span> And they said unto him: \`We are come down
to bind thee, that we may deliver thee into the hand of the
Philistines.' And Samson said unto them: \`Swear unto me, that ye will
not fall upon me yourselves.' <span id="an_jdg:15:13">13</span> And they
spoke unto him, saying: \`No; but we will bind thee fast, and deliver
thee into their hand; but surely we will not kill thee.' And they bound
him with two new ropes, and brought him up from the rock. <span
id="an_jdg:15:14">14</span> When he came unto Lehi, the Philistines
shouted as they met him; and the spirit of the LORD came mightily upon
him, and the ropes that were upon his arms became as flax that was burnt
with fire, and his bands dropped from off his hands. <span
id="an_jdg:15:15">15</span> And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and
put forth his hand, and took it, and smote a thousand men therewith.
<span id="an_jdg:15:16">16</span> And Samson said:

With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps,  
With the jawbone of an ass have I smitten a thousand men.

<span id="an_jdg:15:17">17</span> And it came to pass, when he had made
an end of speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand; and
that place was called  <span id="fr_114"></span>[a](#fn_111)
Ramath-lehi. <span id="an_jdg:15:18">18</span> And he was sore athirst,
and called on the LORD, and said: \`Thou hast given this great
deliverance by the hand of Thy servant; and now shall I die for thirst,
and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?' <span
id="an_jdg:15:19">19</span> But God cleaved the hollow place that is in
Lehi, and there came water thereout; and when he had drunk, his spirit
came back, and he revived; wherefore the name thereof was called  <span
id="fr_115"></span>[b](#fn_112) En-hakkore, which is in Lehi unto this
day. <span id="an_jdg:15:20">20</span> And he judged Israel in the days
of the Philistines twenty years.
