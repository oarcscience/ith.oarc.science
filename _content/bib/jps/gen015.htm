<p><A NAME="an_gen:15:1">1</A>&nbsp;After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision, saying: 'Fear not, Abram, I am thy shield, thy reward shall be exceeding great.' <A NAME="an_gen:15:2">2</A>&nbsp;And Abram said: 'O Lord GOD, what wilt Thou give me, seeing I go hence childless, and he that shall be possessor of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?' <A NAME="an_gen:15:3">3</A>&nbsp;And Abram said: 'Behold, to me Thou hast given no seed, and, lo, one born in my house is to be mine heir.' <A NAME="an_gen:15:4">4</A>&nbsp;And, behold, the word of the LORD came unto him saying: 'This man shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.' <A NAME="an_gen:15:5">5</A>&nbsp;And He brought him forth abroad, and said: 'Look now toward heaven, and count the stars, if thou be able to count them'; and He said unto him: 'So shall thy seed be.' <A NAME="an_gen:15:6">6</A>&nbsp;And he believed in the LORD; and He counted it to him for righteousness. <A NAME="an_gen:15:7">7</A>&nbsp;And He said unto him: 'I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.' <A NAME="an_gen:15:8">8</A>&nbsp;And he said: 'O Lord GOD, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?' <A NAME="an_gen:15:9">9</A>&nbsp;And He said unto him: 'Take Me a heifer of three years old, and a she-goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and <a name="page_17"><font size="1" color="green">p. 17</font></A> a turtle-dove, and a young pigeon.' <A NAME="an_gen:15:10">10</A>&nbsp;And he took him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each half over against the other; but the birds divided he not. <A NAME="an_gen:15:11">11</A>&nbsp;And the birds of prey came down upon the carcasses, and Abram drove them away. <A NAME="an_gen:15:12">12</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, that, when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram, and, lo, a dread, even a great darkness, fell upon him. <A NAME="an_gen:15:13">13</A>&nbsp;And He said unto Abram: 'Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years; <A NAME="an_gen:15:14">14</A>&nbsp;and also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge; and afterward shall they come out with great substance. <A NAME="an_gen:15:15">15</A>&nbsp;But thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age. <A NAME="an_gen:15:16">16</A>&nbsp;And in the fourth generation they shall come back hither; for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full.' <A NAME="an_gen:15:17">17</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and there was thick darkness, behold a smoking furnace, and a flaming torch that passed between these pieces. <A NAME="an_gen:15:18">18</A>&nbsp;In that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying: 'Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates; <A NAME="an_gen:15:19">19</A>&nbsp;the Kenite, and the Kenizzite, and the Kadmonite, <A NAME="an_gen:15:20">20</A>&nbsp;and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Rephaim, <A NAME="an_gen:15:21">21</A>&nbsp;and the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Girgashite, and the Jebusite.'</p>
