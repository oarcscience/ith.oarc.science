<p><A NAME="an_gen:37:1">1</A>&nbsp;And Jacob dwelt in the land of his father's sojournings, in the land of Canaan. <A NAME="an_gen:37:2">2</A>&nbsp;These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren, being still a lad, even with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives; and Joseph brought evil report of them unto their father. <A NAME="an_gen:37:3">3</A>&nbsp;Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age; and he made him a coat of many colours. <A NAME="an_gen:37:4">4</A>&nbsp;And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him. <A NAME="an_gen:37:5">5</A>&nbsp;And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brethren; and they hated him yet the more. <A NAME="an_gen:37:6">6</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them: 'Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed: <A NAME="an_gen:37:7">7</A>&nbsp;for, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves came round about, and bowed down to my sheaf.' <A NAME="an_gen:37:8">8</A>&nbsp;And his brethren said to him: 'Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us?' And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, <a name="page_46"><font size="1" color="green">p. 46</font></A> and for his words. <A NAME="an_gen:37:9">9</A>&nbsp;And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it to his brethren, and said: 'Behold, I have dreamed yet a dream: and, behold, the sun and the moon and eleven stars bowed down to me.' <A NAME="an_gen:37:10">10</A>&nbsp;And he told it to his father, and to his brethren; and his father rebuked him, and said unto him: 'What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down to thee to the earth?' <A NAME="an_gen:37:11">11</A>&nbsp;And his brethren envied him; but his father kept the saying in mind.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_gen:37:12">12</A>&nbsp;And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem. <A NAME="an_gen:37:13">13</A>&nbsp;And Israel said unto Joseph: 'Do not thy brethren feed the flock in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them.' And he said to him: 'Here am I.' <A NAME="an_gen:37:14">14</A>&nbsp;And he said to him: Go now, see whether it is well with thy brethren, and well with the flock; and bring' me back word.' So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem. <A NAME="an_gen:37:15">15</A>&nbsp;And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field. And the man asked him, saying: 'What seekest thou?' <A NAME="an_gen:37:16">16</A>&nbsp;And he said: 'I seek my brethren. Tell me, I pray thee, where they are feeding the flock.' <A NAME="an_gen:37:17">17</A>&nbsp;And the man said: 'They are departed hence; for I heard them say: Let us go to Dothan.' And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan. <A NAME="an_gen:37:18">18</A>&nbsp;And they saw him afar off, and before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him. <A NAME="an_gen:37:19">19</A>&nbsp;And they said one to another: 'Behold, this dreamer cometh. <A NAME="an_gen:37:20">20</A>&nbsp;Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into one of the pits, and we will say: An evil beast hath devoured him; and we shall see what will become of his dreams.' <A NAME="an_gen:37:21">21</A>&nbsp;And Reuben heard it, and delivered him out of their hand; and said: 'Let us not take his life.' <A NAME="an_gen:37:22">22</A>&nbsp;And Reuben said unto them: 'Shed no blood; cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, but lay no hand upon him'&#8212;that he might deliver him out of their hand, to restore him to his father. <A NAME="an_gen:37:23">23</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stripped Joseph of his coat, the coat of many colours that was on him; <A NAME="an_gen:37:24">24</A>&nbsp;and they took him, and cast him into the pit&#8212;and the pit was empty, there was no water in it. <A NAME="an_gen:37:25">25</A>&nbsp;And they sat down to eat bread; and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a caravan of Ishmaelites came from Gilead, with their camels bearing spicery and balm and ladanum, going to carry it down to Egypt. <A NAME="an_gen:37:26">26</A>&nbsp;And Judah said unto his brethren: 'What profit is it if we slay our brother and conceal his blood? <A NAME="an_gen:37:27">27</A>&nbsp;Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother, our flesh.' And his brethren hearkened unto him. <A NAME="an_gen:37:28">28</A>&nbsp;And there passed by Midianites, merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty shekels of silver. And they brought Joseph into Egypt. <A NAME="an_gen:37:29">29</A>&nbsp;And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes. <A NAME="an_gen:37:30">30</A>&nbsp;And he returned unto his brethren, and said: 'The child is not; and as for me, whither shall I go?' <A NAME="an_gen:37:31">31</A>&nbsp;And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a he-goat, and dipped the coat in the blood; <A NAME="an_gen:37:32">32</A>&nbsp;and they sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to their father; and said: 'This have we found. Know now whether it is thy son's coat or not.' <A NAME="an_gen:37:33">33</A>&nbsp;And he knew it, and said: 'It is my son's coat; an evil beast hath <a name="page_47"><font size="1" color="green">p. 47</font></A> devoured him; Joseph is without doubt torn in pieces.' <A NAME="an_gen:37:34">34</A>&nbsp;And Jacob rent his garments, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days. <A NAME="an_gen:37:35">35</A>&nbsp;And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said: 'Nay, but I will go down to the grave to my son mourning.' And his father wept for him. <A NAME="an_gen:37:36">36</A>&nbsp;And the &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_64"></A><A HREF="#fn_63"><FONT SIZE="1">a</FONT></A>
Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, the captain of the guard.</p>
