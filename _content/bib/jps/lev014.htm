<p><A NAME="an_lev:14:1">1</A>&nbsp;And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_lev:14:2">2</A>&nbsp;This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing: he shall be; brought unto the priest. <A NAME="an_lev:14:3">3</A>&nbsp;And the priest shall go forth out of the camp; and the priest shall look, and, behold, if the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper; <A NAME="an_lev:14:4">4</A>&nbsp;then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed two living clean birds, and cedar-wood, and scarlet, and hyssop. <a name="page_135"><font size="1" color="green">p. 135</font></A> <A NAME="an_lev:14:5">5</A>&nbsp;And the priest shall command to kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water. <A NAME="an_lev:14:6">6</A>&nbsp;As for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar-wood, and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water. <A NAME="an_lev:14:7">7</A>&nbsp;And he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let go the living bird into the open field. <A NAME="an_lev:14:8">8</A>&nbsp;And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off all his hair, and bathe himself in water, and he shall be clean; and after that he may come into the camp, but shall dwell outside his tent seven days. <A NAME="an_lev:14:9">9</A>&nbsp;And it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair he shall shave off; and he shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and he shall be clean. <A NAME="an_lev:14:10">10</A>&nbsp;And on the eighth day he shall take two he-lambs without blemish, and one ewe-lamb of the first year without blemish, and three tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with oil, and one log of oil. <A NAME="an_lev:14:11">11</A>&nbsp;And the priest that cleanseth him shall set the man that is to be cleansed, and those things, before the LORD, at the door of the tent of meeting. <A NAME="an_lev:14:12">12</A>&nbsp;And the priest shall take one of the he-lambs, and offer him for a guilt-offering, and the log of oil, and wave them for a wave-offering before the LORD. <A NAME="an_lev:14:13">13</A>&nbsp;And he shall kill the he-lamb in the place where they kill the sin-offering and the burnt-offering, in the place of the sanctuary; for as the sin-offering is the priest's, so is the guilt-offering; it is most holy. <A NAME="an_lev:14:14">14</A>&nbsp;And the priest shall take of the blood of the guilt-offering, and the priest shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot. <A NAME="an_lev:14:15">15</A>&nbsp;And the priest shall take of the log of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand. <A NAME="an_lev:14:16">16</A>&nbsp;And the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand, and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times before the LORD. <A NAME="an_lev:14:17">17</A>&nbsp;And of the rest of the oil that is in his hand shall the priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the guilt-offering. <A NAME="an_lev:14:18">18</A>&nbsp;And the rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed; and the priest shall make atonement for him before the LORD. <A NAME="an_lev:14:19">19</A>&nbsp;And the priest shall offer the sin-offering, and make atonement for him that is to be cleansed because of his uncleanness; and afterward he shall kill the burnt-offering. <A NAME="an_lev:14:20">20</A>&nbsp;And the priest shall offer the burnt-offering and the meal-offering upon the altar; and the priest shall make atonement for him, and he shall be clean.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_lev:14:21">21</A>&nbsp;And if he be poor, and his means suffice not, then he shall take one he-lamb for a guilt-offering to be waved, to make atonement for him, and one tenth part of an ephah of fine flour mingled with oil for a meal-offering, and a log of oil; <A NAME="an_lev:14:22">22</A>&nbsp;and two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, such as his means suffice for; and the one shall be a sin-offering, and the other a burnt-offering. <A NAME="an_lev:14:23">23</A>&nbsp;And on the eighth day he shall bring them for his cleansing unto the priest, unto the door of the tent of meeting, before the LORD. <A NAME="an_lev:14:24">24</A>&nbsp;And the priest shall take the lamb of the guilt-offering, and the <a name="page_136"><font size="1" color="green">p. 136</font></A> log of oil, and the priest shall wave them for a wave-offering before the LORD. <A NAME="an_lev:14:25">25</A>&nbsp;And he shall kill the lamb of the guilt-offering, and the priest shall take of the blood of the guilt-offering, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot. <A NAME="an_lev:14:26">26</A>&nbsp;And the priest shall pour of the oil into the palm of his own left hand. <A NAME="an_lev:14:27">27</A>&nbsp;And the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger some of the oil that is in his left hand seven times before the LORD. <A NAME="an_lev:14:28">28</A>&nbsp;And the priest shall put of the oil that is in his hand upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the place of the blood of the guilt-offering. <A NAME="an_lev:14:29">29</A>&nbsp;And the rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed, to make atonement for him before the LORD. <A NAME="an_lev:14:30">30</A>&nbsp;And he shall offer one of the turtle-doves, or of the young pigeons, such as his means suffice for; <A NAME="an_lev:14:31">31</A>&nbsp;even such as his means suffice for, the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering, with the meal-offering; and the priest shall make atonement for him that is to be cleansed before the LORD. <A NAME="an_lev:14:32">32</A>&nbsp;This is the law of him in whom is the plague of leprosy, whose means suffice not for that which pertaineth to his cleansing.</p>
