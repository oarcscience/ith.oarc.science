<p><A NAME="an_gen:4:1">1</A>&nbsp;And the man knew Eve his wife; and she conceived and bore Cain, and said: 'I have &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_9"></A><A HREF="#fn_8"><FONT SIZE="1">b</FONT></A>
gotten a man with the help of the LORD.' <A NAME="an_gen:4:2">2</A>&nbsp;And again she bore his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground. <A NAME="an_gen:4:3">3</A>&nbsp;And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD. <A NAME="an_gen:4:4">4</A>&nbsp;And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering; <A NAME="an_gen:4:5">5</A>&nbsp;but unto Cain and to his offering He had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell. <A NAME="an_gen:4:6">6</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said unto Cain: 'Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen? <A NAME="an_gen:4:7">7</A>&nbsp;If thou doest well, shall it not be lifted up? and if thou doest not well, sin coucheth at the door; and unto thee is its desire, but thou mayest rule over it.' <A NAME="an_gen:4:8">8</A>&nbsp;And Cain spoke unto Abel his brother. And it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_gen:4:9">9</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said unto Cain: 'Where is Abel thy brother?' And he said: 'I know not; am I my brother's keeper?' <A NAME="an_gen:4:10">10</A>&nbsp;And He said: 'What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto Me from the ground. <A NAME="an_gen:4:11">11</A>&nbsp;And now cursed art thou from the ground, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand. <A NAME="an_gen:4:12">12</A>&nbsp;When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a wanderer shalt thou be in the earth.' <A NAME="an_gen:4:13">13</A>&nbsp;And Cain said unto the LORD: 'My punishment is greater than I can bear. <A NAME="an_gen:4:14">14</A>&nbsp;Behold, Thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the land; and from Thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth; and it will come to pass, that whosoever findeth me will slay me.' <A NAME="an_gen:4:15">15</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said unto him: <a name="page_7"><font size="1" color="green">p. 7</font></A> 'Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold.' And the LORD set a sign for Cain, lest any finding him should smite him.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_gen:4:16">16</A>&nbsp;And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_10"></A><A HREF="#fn_9"><FONT SIZE="1">a</FONT></A>
Nod, on the east of Eden. <A NAME="an_gen:4:17">17</A>&nbsp;And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bore Enoch; and he builded a city, and called the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch. <A NAME="an_gen:4:18">18</A>&nbsp;And unto Enoch was born Irad; and Irad begot Mehujael; and &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_11"></A><A HREF="#fn_10"><FONT SIZE="1">b</FONT></A>
Mehujael begot Methushael; and Methushael begot Lamech. <A NAME="an_gen:4:19">19</A>&nbsp;And Lamech took unto him two wives; the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah. <A NAME="an_gen:4:20">20</A>&nbsp;And Adah bore Jabal; he was the father of such as dwell in tents and have cattle. <A NAME="an_gen:4:21">21</A>&nbsp;And his brother's name was Jubal; he was the father of all such as handle the harp and pipe. <A NAME="an_gen:4:22">22</A>&nbsp;And Zillah, she also bore Tubal-cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron; and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah. <A NAME="an_gen:4:23">23</A>&nbsp;And Lamech said unto his wives:</p>  
<p>Adah and Zillah, hear my voice;<br> Ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech;<br> For I have slain a man for wounding me,<br> And a young man for bruising me;<br> <A NAME="an_gen:4:24">24</A>&nbsp;If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold,<br> Truly Lamech seventy and seven-fold.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_gen:4:25">25</A>&nbsp;And Adam knew his wife again; and she bore a son, and called his name &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_12"></A><A HREF="#fn_11"><FONT SIZE="1">c</FONT></A>
Seth: 'for God &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_13"></A><A HREF="#fn_12"><FONT SIZE="1">d</FONT></A>
hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel; for Cain slew him.' <A NAME="an_gen:4:26">26</A>&nbsp;And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enosh; then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.</p>
