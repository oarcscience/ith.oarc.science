<p><A NAME="an_num:9:1">1</A>&nbsp;And the LORD spoke unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying: <A NAME="an_num:9:2">2</A>&nbsp;`Let the children of Israel keep the passover in its appointed season. <A NAME="an_num:9:3">3</A>&nbsp;In the fourteenth day of this month, at dusk, ye shall keep it in its appointed season; according to all the statutes of it, and according to all the ordinances thereof, shall ye keep it.' <A NAME="an_num:9:4">4</A>&nbsp;And Moses spoke unto the children of Israel, that they should keep the passover. <A NAME="an_num:9:5">5</A>&nbsp;And they kept the passover in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, at dusk, in the wilderness of Sinai; according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel. <A NAME="an_num:9:6">6</A>&nbsp;But there were certain men, who were unclean by the dead body of a man, so that they could not keep the passover on that day; and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day. <A NAME="an_num:9:7">7</A>&nbsp;And those men said unto him: `We are unclean by the dead body of a man; wherefore are we to be kept back, so as not to bring the offering of the LORD in its appointed season among the children of Israel?' <A NAME="an_num:9:8">8</A>&nbsp;And Moses said unto them: `Stay ye, that I may hear what the LORD will command concerning you.'</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_num:9:9">9</A>&nbsp;And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: <A NAME="an_num:9:10">10</A>&nbsp;`Speak unto the children of Israel, saying: If any man of you or of your generations shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be in a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover unto the LORD; <A NAME="an_num:9:11">11</A>&nbsp;in the second month on the fourteenth day at dusk they shall keep it; they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs; <A NAME="an_num:9:12">12</A>&nbsp;they shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break a bone thereof; according to all the statute of the passover they shall keep it. <A NAME="an_num:9:13">13</A>&nbsp;But the man that is clean, and is not on a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, that soul shall be cut off from his people; because he brought not the offering of the LORD in its appointed season, that man shall bear his sin. <A NAME="an_num:9:14">14</A>&nbsp;And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover unto the LORD: according to the statute of the passover, and according to the ordinance thereof, so shall he do; ye shall have one statute, both for the stranger, and for him that is born in the land.'</p>
