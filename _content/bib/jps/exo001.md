# EXODUS

### CHAPTER 1

<span id="an_exo:1:1">1</span> Now these are the names of the sons of
Israel, who came into Egypt with Jacob; every man came with his
household: <span id="an_exo:1:2">2</span> Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and
Judah; <span id="an_exo:1:3">3</span> Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin;
<span id="an_exo:1:4">4</span> Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher. <span
id="an_exo:1:5">5</span> And all the souls that came out of the loins of
Jacob were seventy souls; and Joseph was in Egypt already. <span
id="an_exo:1:6">6</span> And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all
that generation. <span id="an_exo:1:7">7</span> And the children of
Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and
waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.

<span id="an_exo:1:8">8</span> Now there arose a new king over Egypt,
who knew not Joseph. <span id="an_exo:1:9">9</span> And he said unto his
people: 'Behold, the people of the children of Israel are too many and
too mighty for us; <span id="an_exo:1:10">10</span> come, let us deal
wisely with them, lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when
there befalleth us any war, they also join themselves unto our enemies,
and fight against us, and get them up out of the land.' <span
id="an_exo:1:11">11</span> Therefore they did set over them taskmasters
to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh
store-cities, Pithom and Raamses. <span id="an_exo:1:12">12</span> But
the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and the more they
spread abroad. And they were adread because of the children of Israel.
<span id="an_exo:1:13">13</span> And the Egyptians made the children of
Israel to serve with rigour. <span id="an_exo:1:14">14</span> And they
made their lives bitter with hard service, in mortar and in brick, and
in all manner of service in the field; in all their service, wherein
they made them serve with rigour.

<span id="an_exo:1:15">15</span> And the king of Egypt spoke to the
Hebrew midwives, of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name
of the other Puah; <span id="an_exo:1:16">16</span> and he said: 'When
ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, ye shall look upon
the birthstool: if it be a son, then ye shall kill him; but if it be a
daughter, then she shall live.' <span id="an_exo:1:17">17</span> But the
midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them,
but saved the men-children alive. <span id="an_exo:1:18">18</span> And
the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them: 'Why have
ye done this thing, and have saved the men-children alive?' <span
id="an_exo:1:19">19</span> And the midwives said unto Pharaoh: 'Because
the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and
are delivered ere the midwife come unto them.' <span
id="an_exo:1:20">20</span> And God dealt well with the midwives; and the
people multiplied, and waxed very mighty. <span
id="an_exo:1:21">21</span> And it came to pass, because the midwives
feared God, that He made them houses. <span
id="an_exo:1:22">22</span> And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying:
'Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter
ye shall save alive.'
