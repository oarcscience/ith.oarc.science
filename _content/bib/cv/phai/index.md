Wellhausen's theories about the development of the Old Testament are for
Biblical criticism what Einstein is to physics. Wellhausen devised a new
paradigm which explained many of the apparent inconsistencies in the
Biblical texts. In the process, he upset many traditionalists who didn't
like the concept that the early portions of the Bible were the product
of four separate authors. Or that the Levitical code was redacted into
the text by the priestly class at a very late date in the evolution of
the Bible. Or that the Bible even evolved...

He has continued relevance. Wellhausen's theories have been built on by
contemporary scholars. The current Christian fundamentalist movement
emerged as a response to the Biblical criticism of Wellhausen and other
19th century scholars. Wellhausen remains difficult to fully grasp by
all but those schooled in the ways of the Documentary hypothesis.
However, brave readers willing to attempt an expedition through the
Prolegomena will be richly rewarded, whichever side of the cultural
divide you fall on.

*Production Notes:* This was originally published in German in 1883 as
Geschichte Israels, and then as Prolegomena zur Geschichte Israels in
1883, The existing etext of this book in Project Gutenberg was
re-proofed using a printed facsimile of the 1885 English translation
(New York: Meridian Books \[1957\]). This included two separate
word-by-word proof passes, one of which was a comprehensive spell-check.
[Unicode](../../../unicode) Hebrew and Greek text was added, numerous
errors in the etext were corrected, and pagination was inserted. Lastly,
[the index](phai31), lacking in the PG etext, was scanned, proofed and
appended.
