<p>We have thus far briefly examined what may for the most part be termed the skeleton or dry bones of the Mithraic religion, so far as we can trace them, at the period when it seemed to be successfully competing with Christianity. What of the inner life, the spiritual message and attraction which there must have been to give the cult its hold over the Roman Empire? Here it is that our ignorance becomes most sharply felt. So far as Christian zeal could suppress all good report of Mithraism, this was done, when Christianity&#151;I will not say overthrew, but&#151;absorbed the Mithraic movement. There were in antiquity, we know from Porphyry,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1579"></A><A HREF="#fn_1579"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> several elaborate treatises setting forth the religion of Mithra; and every one of these has been destroyed by the care of the Church.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1580"></A><A HREF="#fn_1580"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> They doubtless included much narrative as well as much didactic matter, the knowledge of which would colour the whole religious consciousness of Mithra's worshippers. We shall see later that clues still exist, one of which has been overlooked in studies of Mithraism, to some of the myths of the cult; and we may safely decide in general that just as the Brahmanas prove the currency of myths concerning the Vedic Gods which are not mentioned in the Vedic hymns, so there must have existed a Mithraic mythology which is not contained in the Zendavesta, that being, though not a simple collection of hymns, a compilation for purposes of worship. The reconstruction of that mythology, however, is now hopeless. Too little attention, perhaps, has been paid to Creuzer's theory that the name Perseus = Perses, "the Persian," and that the Perseus myth is really an early adaptation of the Mithra myth.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1581"></A><A HREF="#fn_1581"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> The story of Perseus certainly has an amount of action and colour unusual in Greek myth, and no less suggestive of Oriental origin than is the</p>

<p>legend of Herakles. But unless new evidence be forthcoming, such a hypothesis can at most stand for a possibility.</p>  
<p>And so with the didactic side of Mithraism: we must limit our inferences to our positive data. These include the evidence of the Vendid&acirc;d ritual that there was associated with the cult a teaching of happy immortality for the righteous, very much on the lines of that of Christianity. An extract&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1582"></A><A HREF="#fn_1582"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> will make the point clear&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1583"></A><A HREF="#fn_1583"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>:&#151;</p>  <table border="0">  <tr>   <td valign="top" align="top">

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> It is noteworthy, further, that in some codices of the Avesta is found this formula: "He has gained nothing who has not gained the soul: He shall gain nothing who shall not gain the soul." The meaning is "gain a place in Paradise,"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1584"></A><A HREF="#fn_1584"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and the passage looks very like an original form of a well-known Christian text.</p>  
<p>For the rest, the Zendavesta, like most other Sacred Books, insists on the normal morals strenuously enough. It has strange special teachings as to the sacro-sanctity of the dog; and its veto alike on the burning and the burying of bodies&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1585"></A><A HREF="#fn_1585"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> is peculiar to Mazdeism; but these beliefs do not seem to have affected later Mithraism; whereas probably its special stress on truthfulness&#151;not paralleled in the Ten Commandments&#151;was maintained. We cannot, indeed, tell how the Mithraic priests dealt with the special problems of the life of the Roman Empire; but we are entitled none the less to protest against the loose revival of unfounded and exploded charges against the cult. To this day we find Christian scholars either saying or hinting that Mithraism was signalised in the Roman period by human sacrifices. For this there is no justification.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1586"></A><A HREF="#fn_1586"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> The ecclesiastical historian Sokrates&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1587"></A><A HREF="#fn_1587"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> does indeed allege that about the year 360 a temple of Mithra at Alexandria, long empty and neglected, was granted by Constantius to the Christians; that they found in it an <i>adytum</i> of vast depth, containing the skulls of many persons, old and young, who had been sacrificed to Mithra; and that the Christians paraded them through the city, whereupon there was a riot, in which Bishop George and many others were slain. But this narrative is unsupported even in ecclesiastical history, and is full of incredibilities. The "Pagans" in general are represented as taking arms to avenge an attack on the Mithraic sect, though the Mithraic temple is expressly declared to have been long deserted; and the emperor Julian, a Mithraist, is represented as writing a letter denouncing the Alexandrians for their conduct. Yet he merely speaks of the killing of George, where Sokrates alleges a wholesale massacre. The whole story savours of mere <i>odium theologicum</i>, and will not consist with any other accounts of Mithraic worship. We do know that during</p>

<p>the whole of the first three or four centuries it was charged against the Christians, by Jews or Pagans, that they were wont to sacrifice a child at their mysteries.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1588"></A><A HREF="#fn_1588"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> That charge was doubtless false, but it was constantly made.</p>  
<p>On the other hand, the only kind of record founded-on for the charge against Mithraism is one which rebuts it. Sainte-Croix, accepting the plainly worthless testimony of the ecclesiastical historian, referred&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1589"></A><A HREF="#fn_1589"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> to a passage in the life of Commodus by Lampridius, in the Augustan history, in support of his insinuation that Mithraism involved human sacrifice. But this passage&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1590"></A><A HREF="#fn_1590"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> explicitly says that Commodus "<i>polluted</i> the rites of Mithras <i>by a real homicide</i>, where it is usual for something to be said or done for the purpose of causing terror" (<i>quum illic aliquid ad speciem timoris vel dici vel fingi soleat</i>). The same scholar makes another reference which equally serves to confute him;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1591"></A><A HREF="#fn_1591"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> yet an English writer later speaks of "the dark and fearful mysteries" of Mithra, repeating the old insinuation.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1592"></A><A HREF="#fn_1592"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> Selden&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1593"></A><A HREF="#fn_1593"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> quotes from Photius&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1594"></A><A HREF="#fn_1594"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> a statement that men, women, and boys were sacrificed to Mithra; but that assertion also is plainly valueless, coming as it does from a Christian writer of the tenth century, and being absolutely without ancient corroboration. What seems to have happened was a symbolical sacrifice, perhaps followed up by a symbolical eating of the God's image&#151;proceedings which, there is good reason to suppose, occurred in the mysteries of the early Christians.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1595"></A><A HREF="#fn_1595"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A></p>  
<p>But there is far more testimony, such as it is, for the charge of infamous procedure against the Christians than against the Mithraists. The Mithraic mysteries, save for the fact that they involved real austerities and a scenic representation of death,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1596"></A><A HREF="#fn_1596"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> were no more dark and fearful than the Christian mysteries are known to have been, not to speak of what these are said to have been. There lies against them no such imputation of licence as was constantly brought against</p>

<p>the midnight meetings of the Christians, or as is specifically brought by Paul against his own converts at Corinth. Their purpose was unquestionably moral as well as consolatory.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1597"></A><A HREF="#fn_1597"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> In the words of Suidas, the worshipper went through his trials in order that he should become holy and passionless. In the course of the initiation, as we know from the unwilling admiration of Tertullian,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1598"></A><A HREF="#fn_1598"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> the devotee, called the soldier of Mithra, was offered a crown, which it was his part to refuse, saying that Mithra was his crown. And everything points to the enunciation of a theory of expiation of and purification from sin, in which Mithra figured as Mediator and Saviour, actually undergoing a symbolic sacrifice, and certainly securing to his worshippers eternal life.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1599"></A><A HREF="#fn_1599"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> As to the doctrine of immortality being pre-Christian, it is now quite unnecessary to speak; and the whole Mithraic symbolism implies such a teaching. On most of the bull monuments, it will be remembered, there stand beside Mithra two figures, one holding a raised and one a lowered torch. These signified primarily sunrise and sunset, or rising spring sun and sinking autumn sun; but, as Lessing&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1600"></A><A HREF="#fn_1600"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> long ago showed, they were also the ancient symbols for life and death, and would further signify the fall and return of the soul.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1601"></A><A HREF="#fn_1601"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Nor was this the only point at which Mithraism is known to have competed with Christianity in what pass for its highest attractions. The doctrine of the <i>Logos</i>, the Incarnate Word or Reason, which Christianity absorbed through the Platonising Jews of Alexandria, was present in Mithraism, and of prior derivation. That Mithra was connected with "the Word" appears from the Avesta.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1602"></A><A HREF="#fn_1602"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> In the Vend&icirc;d&acirc;d, further,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1603"></A><A HREF="#fn_1603"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> Zarathustra is made to praise successively Mithra "of the most glorious weapons," Sraosha, "the Holy One," and "the Holy Word, the most glorious," thus joining and in part identifying Mithra with the Word as well as joining him with the Holy Spirit. And Emanuel Deutsch&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1604"></A><A HREF="#fn_1604"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> was of opinion that the Metatron&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1605"></A><A HREF="#fn_1605"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> of the Talmud (whom he equates with the Ideas of Plato,</p>

<p>the <i>Logos</i> of Philo, the "World of Aziluth" of the Kabbalists, the <i>Sophia</i> or Power of the Gnostics and the <i>Nous</i> of Plotinus)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1606"></A><A HREF="#fn_1606"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> was "most probably nothing but Mithra."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1607"></A><A HREF="#fn_1607"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> As the Metatron is on the Jewish side identified with the "Angel" promised as leader and commander to the Hebrews in Palestine,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1608"></A><A HREF="#fn_1608"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and that angel is quasi-historically represented by Joshua =Jesus, the chain of allusion from Mithra to the Christ is thus curiously complete. In respect of the concept of a Trinity, as we have already seen, the parallel continues. By the admission of a Catholic theologian, the Gods Ahura-Mazda, Sraosha, and Mithra constitute an ostensible trinity closely analogous to that of the later Christists;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1609"></A><A HREF="#fn_1609"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> and yet again Mithra, himself approaching to supreme status, rides to battle with Sraosha at his right and Rashnu at his left hand;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1610"></A><A HREF="#fn_1610"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> or else with Rashnu on his right, and Kista, the holy one (female) white-clothed, on his left.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1611"></A><A HREF="#fn_1611"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A></p>  
<p>There seems no good reason for supposing that the doctrines of the <i>Logos</i> and the Trinity reached the Persians through the Greeks:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1612"></A><A HREF="#fn_1612"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> on the contrary, they probably acquired them from Babylonian sources, on which the Greeks also drew; and it was not improbably their version of the <i>Logos</i> idea that gave the lead to the Philonic and Christian form, in which the Word is explicitly "the light of the world."</p>
