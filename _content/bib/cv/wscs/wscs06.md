## THE WORLD'S

# SIXTEEN CRUCIFIED SAVIORS.

### CHAPTER I.

#### RIVAL CLAIMS OF THE SAVIORS.

IT is claimed by the disciples of Jesus Christ, that he was of
supernatural and divine origin; that he had a human being for a mother,
and a God for his father; that, although he was woman-conceived, he was
Deity-begotten, and molded in the human form, but comprehending in
essence a full measure of the infinite Godhead; thus making him half
human and half divine in his sublunary origin. It is claimed that he was
full and perfect God, and perfect man; and while he was God, he was also
the son of God, and as such was sent down by his father to save a fallen
and guilty world; and that thus his mission pertained to the whole human
race; and his inspired seers are made to declare that ultimately every
nation, tongue, kindred, and people under heaven will acknowledge
allegiance to his government, and concede his right to reign and rule
the world; that "every knee must bow, and every tongue confess that
Jesus is Lord, to the glory of God the Father."

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

But we do not find that this prophecy has ever been or is likely to be
fulfilled. We do not observe that this claim to the infinite deityship
of Jesus Christ has been or is likely to be universally conceded. On the
contrary, it is found. that by a portion, and a *large* portion of the
people of even those nations now called Christian, this claim has been
steadily and unswervingly controverted, through the whole line of
history, stretching through the nearly two thousand years which have
elapsed since his advent to earth.

Even some of those who are represented to have been personally
acquainted with him—aye! some of his own brethren in the flesh, children
in the same household, children of the same mother—had the temerity to
question the tenableness of his claim to a divine emanation. And when we
extend our researches to other countries, we find this claim, so far
from being conceded, is denied and contested by whole nations upon other
grounds. It is met and confronted by rival claims.

Upon this ground hundreds of millions of the established believers in
divine revelation—hundreds of millions of believers in the divine
character and origin of religion—reject the pretentious set up for Jesus
Christ. They admit both a God and a Savior, but do hot accept Jesus of
Nazareth as being either. They admit *a* Messiah, but not *the* Messiah;
these nations contend that the title is misplaced which makes "the man
Christ Jesus" the Savior of the world. They claim to have been honored
with the birth of the true Savior among them and defend this claim upon
the ground of priority of date. They aver that the advent of their
Messiahs were long prior to that of the Christians’, and that this
circumstance adjudicates for them a superiority of claim as to having
had the true Messiah born upon their soil.

It is argued that, as the story of the incarnation of the Christians’
Savior is of more recent date than that of these

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

oriental and ancient religions (as is conceded by Christians
themselves), the origin of the former is thus indicated and foreshadowed
as being an outgrowth from, if not a plagiarism upon the latter—a
borrowed copy, of which the pagan stories furnish the original. Here,
then, we observe a rivalship of claims, as to which of the remarkable
personages who have figured in the world as Saviors, Messiahs, and Sons
of God, in different ages and different countries, can be considered the
true Savior and "sent of God;" or whether all should be, or the claims
of all rejected.

 

For researches into oriental history reveal the remarkable fact that
stories of incarnate Gods answering to and resembling the miraculous
character of Jesus Christ have been prevalent in most if not all the
principal religions heathen nations of antiquity; and the accounts and
narrations of some of these deific incarnations bear such a striking
resemblance to that of the Christian Savior—not only in their general
features, but in some cases in the most minute details, from the legend
of the immaculate conception to that of the crucifixion, and subsequent
ascension into heaven—that one might almost be mistaken for the other.

 

More than twenty claims of this kind—claims of beings invested with
divine honor (deified)—have come forward and presented themselves at the
bar of the world with their credentials, to contest the verdict of
Christendom, in having proclaimed Jesus Christ, "the only son, and sent
of God:" twenty Messiahs, Saviors, and Sons of God, according to history
or tradition, have, in past times, descended from heaven, and taken upon
themselves the form of men, clothing themselves with human flesh, and
furnishing incontestable evidence of a divine origin, by various
miracles, marvelous works, and superlative virtues; and finally these
twenty Jesus Christs (accepting their character

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

for the name) laid the foundation for the salvation of the world, and
ascended back to heaven.

These have all received divine honors, have nearly all been worshiped as
Gods, or sons of God; were mostly incarnated as Christs, Saviors,
Messiahs, or Mediators; not a few of them were reputedly born of
virgins; some of them filling a character almost identical with that
ascribed by the Christian's bible to Jesus Christ; many of them, like

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

him, are reported to have been crucified; and all of them, taken
together, furnish a prototype and parallel for nearly every important
incident and wonder-inciting miracle, doctrine and precept recorded in
the New Testament, of the Christian's Savior. Surely, with so many
Saviors the world cannot, or should not, be lost.

We have now presented before us a two-fold ground for doubting and
disputing the claims put forth by the Christian world in behalf of "Our
Lord and Savior Jesus Christ." In the first place, allowing the question
to be answered in the affirmative as to whether he was really a Savior,
or supernatural being, or more than a mere man, a negative answer to
which seems to have been sprung (as previously intimated) at the very
hour of his birth, and that by his kindred, his own nearest relatives;
as it is declared, "his own brethren did not believe on him"—a
skepticism which has been growing deeper and broader from that day to
this.

And now, upon the heel of this question, we find another formidable
query to be met and answered, viz.: Was he (Christ) the only Savior,
seeing that a multitude of similar claims are now upon our council-board
to be disposed of?

We shall, however, leave the theologians of the various religious
schools to adjust and settle this difficulty among themselves. We shall
leave them to settle the question as best they can as to whether Jesus
Christ was the only son and sent of God—"the only begotten of the
Father," as John declares him to be (John i. 14)—in view of the fact
that long prior to his time various personages, in different nations,
were invested with the title "Son of God," and have left behind them
similar proofs and credentials of the justness of their claims to such a
title, if being essentially alike—as we shall prove and demonstrate them
to be—can make their claims similar.

We shall present an array of facts and historical proofs,

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

drawn from numerous histories and the Holy Scriptures and bibles
appertaining to these various Saviors, and which include a history of
their lives and doctrines, that will go to show that in nearly all their
leading features, and mostly even in their details, they are strikingly
similar.

 

A comparison, or parallel view, extended through their sacred histories,
so as to include an exhibition presented in parallels of the teachings
of their respective bibles, would make it clearly manifest that, with
respect to nearly every important thought, deed, word, action, doctrine,
principle, receipt, tenet, ritual, ordinance or ceremony, and even the
various important characters or personages, who figure in their
religious dramas as Saviors, prophets, apostles, angels, devils, demons,
exalted or fallen genii—in a word, nearly every miraculous or marvelous
story, moral precept, or tenet of religious faith, noticed in either the
Old or New Testament Scriptures of Christendom—from the Jewish
cosmogony, or story of creation in Genesis, to the last legendary tale
in St. John's "Arabian Nights" (*alias* the Apocalypse)—there is to be
found an antitype for, or outline of, somewhere in the sacred records or
bibles of the oriental heathen nations, making equal if not higher
pretention to a divine emanation and divine inspiration, and admitted by
all historians, even the most orthodox, to be of much more ancient date;
for while Christians only claim, for the earthly advent of their Savior
and the birth of their religion, a period less than nineteen hundred
years in the past, on the contrary, most of the deific or divine
incarnations of the heathen and their respective religions are, by the
concurrent and united verdict of all history, assigned a date several
hundred or several thousand years earlier, thus leaving the inference
patent that so far as there has been any borrowing or transfer of
materials from one system to another, Christianity has been the
borrower.

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And as nearly the
whole outline and constituent parts of the Christian system are found
scattered through these older systems, the query is at once sprung as to
whether Christianity did not derive its materials from these
sources—that is from heathenism, instead of from high heaven—as it
claims.
