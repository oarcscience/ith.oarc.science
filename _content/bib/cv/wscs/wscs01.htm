<p>INVERSELY to the remoteness of time has been man's ascent toward the temple of knowledge. Truth has made its ingress into the human mind in the ratio by which man has attained the capacity to receive and appreciate it. Hence, as we tread back the meandering pathway of human history, every step in the receding process brings us to a lower plane of intelligence and a state of mind more thoroughly encrusted with ignorance and superstition. It is, therefore, no source of surprise to learn, when we take a survey of the world two or three thousand years in the past, that every religious writer of that era committed errors on every subject which employed his pen, involving a scientific principle. Hence, the bible, or sacred book, to which he was a contributor, is now found to bear the marks of human imperfection. For the temple of knowledge was but partially reared, and its chambers but dimly lighted up. The intellectual brain was in a dark, feeble and dormant condition. Hence, the moral and religious feelings were drifted about without a pilot on the turbulent waves of superstition, and finally stranded on the shoals of bigotry. The Christian bible, like other bibles, having been written in an age when science was but budding into life, and philosophy had attained but a feeble growth, should be expected to teach many things incompatible with the principles of modern science. And accordingly it is found to contain, like other bibles, numerous statements so obviously at war with present established scientific truths that almost any school-boy,</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_4"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 4</FONT></A></p>  
<p>at the present day, can demonstrate their falsity. Let the unbiased reader examine and compare the oriental and Christian bibles together, and he will note the following facts, viz:&#8212;</p>  
<p>1. That the cardinal religious conceptions of all bibles are essentially the same&#8212;all running in parable grooves.</p>  
<p>2. That every chapter of every bible is but a transcript of the mental chart of the writer.</p>  
<p>3. That no bible, pagan or Christian, contains anything surpassing the natural, mental and moral capacity of the writer to originate. And hence no divine aid or inspiration was necessary for its production.</p>  
<p>4. That the moral and religious teachings of <i>no bible</i> reach a higher altitude than the intelligence and mental development of the age and country which produced it.</p>  
<p>That the Christian bible, in <i>some respects</i>, is superior to some of the other bibles, but <i>only to the extent</i> to which the age in which it was written was superior in intelligence and natural mental capacity to the era in which the older bibles were penned; and that this superiority consists not its more exalted religious conceptions, but only in the fact that, being of more modern origin, the progress of mind had worn away some of the legendary rubbish of the past. Being written in a later and more enlightened age, it is consequently a little less encrusted with mythological tradition and oriental imagery. Though not free from these elements, it possesses them in less degree. And by comparing Christ's history with those of the oriental Gods, it will be found:&#8212;</p>  
<p>1. That he taught no new doctrine or moral precept.</p>  
<p>2. That he inculcated the same religion and morality, which he elaborated, as other moral teachers, to great extremes.</p>  
<p>3. That Christ differs so little in his character, preaching, and practical life from some of the oriental Gods, that no</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_5"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 5</FONT></A></p>  
<p>person whose mind is not deplorably warped and biased by early training can call one divine while he considers the other human.</p>  
<p>That if Christ was a God, then all were Gods.</p>

<p align="center">PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.</p>  
<p>The author desires to say that this work has been carefully reviewed and corrected, and some additions made, embracing two chapters from "the Bible of Bibles," and some explanatory notes, and is now able to place before the reader a greatly improved edition.</p>  
<p>The author also desires to say here, that the many flattering letters he has received from various parts of the country, from those who have supplied themselves with the work, excites in his mind the hope it will ultimately effect something towards achieving the important end sought to be attained by its publication&#8212;the banishment of that wide-spread delusion comprehended in the belief in an incarnate, virgin-born God, called Jesus Christ, and the infallibility of his teachings, with the numerous evils growing legitimately out of this belief&#8212;among the most important of which is, its cramping effect upon the mind of the possessor, which interdicts its growth, and thus constitutes a serious obstacle to the progress both of the individual and of society. And such has been the blinding effect of this delusion upon all who have fallen victims to its influence, that the numerous errors and evils of our popular system of religious faith, which constitutes its legitimate fruits, have passed from age to age, unnoticed by all except scientific and progressive maids, who are constantly bringing these errors and evils to light. This state of</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_6"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 6</FONT></A></p>  
<p>things has been a source of sorrow and regret to every philanthropist desiring the welfare of the race. And if this work shall achieve anything towards arresting this great evil, the author will feel that he is amply compensated for the years of toil and mental labor spent in its preparation.</p>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">NOTE.&#8212;As the different works consulted have assigned different dates for the same event, the author has, in one or two cases, followed their example, accepting them as authority; as in the date of the birth and death of the Gods of Mexico. The reader will also notice that the name of the same God is found in different countries. Example&#8212;Adonis and Bacchus are found amongst the Gods of both Greece and Egypt.</FONT></p>
