<p align="center">THE SABBATH REPUDIATED.</p>  
<p>The new moons and <i>sabbaths</i>, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is <i>iniquity</i>. (Is. 1:13.)</p>  
<p>One man esteemeth one day above another; another esteemeth <i>every day alike</i>. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind. (Rom. 14:5.)</p>

<p align="center">THE SABBATH INSTITUTED <b>BECAUSE GOD BROUGHT THE ISRAELITES OUT OF EGYPT</b>.</p>

<p align="center">JESUS CHRIST <b>BROKE</b> THE SABBATH AND <b>JUSTIFIED HIS DISCIPLES</b> IN THE SAME.</p>  
<p>Therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had <i>done these things</i> on the <i>Sabbath day</i>. (John 5:16.)</p>  
<p>At that time Jesus went on the <i>Sabbath day</i> through the corn; and his disciples were a hungered, and began to pluck the ears of corn, and to eat. But when the Pharisees saw it they said unto him, Behold, thy disciples do that which is <i>not lawful</i> to do upon the Sabbath day. But he said unto them, . . . . Have ye not read in the law, how that on the Sabbath days the priests in the temple <i>profane</i> the Sabbath, and are <i>blameless?</i> (Matt. 12:1, 2, 3, 5.)</p>

<p align="center">BAPTISM <b>NOT</b> COMMANDED.</p>  
<p>For Christ sent me <i>not to baptize</i>, but to preach the gospel. . . . I thank God that I <i>baptized none</i> of you but Crispus and Gaius. (1 Cor. 1:17, 14.)</p>

<p>There is <i>nothing unclean</i> of itself. (Rom. 14:14.)</p>  
<p align="center">CERTAIN KINDS OF ANIMALS <b>PROHIBITED</b> FOR FOOD.</p>  
<p>Nevertheless, these shall ye <i>not eat</i>, of them that chew the cud or of them that divide the cloven hoof; as the <i>camel</i> and the <i>hare</i>, and the <i>coney</i><i>;</i> for they chew the cud, but divide not the hoof; therefore, they are <i>unclean</i> unto you. And the <i>swine</i>, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not the cud, it is unclean unto you; ye shall <i>not eat</i> of their flesh, nor touch their dead carcass. (Deut. 14:7, 8.)</p>

<p>Now, therefore, <i>swear</i> unto me here by God. . . . And Abraham said, I will <i>swear</i>. . . . Therefore, he called the place Beersheba [the well of the oath]; because there they sware both of them. (Gen. 21:23, 24, 31.)</p>  
<p>And Jacob <i>sware</i> by the fear of his father Isaac. (Gen. 31:53.)</p>  
<p>Because he [God] could swear by no greater, he <i>sware</i> by himself. (Heb. 6:13.)</p>  
<p align="center">THE TAKING OF OATHS <b>FORBIDDEN</b>.</p>  
<p>But I say unto you, <i>swear not at all;</i> neither by heaven for it is God's throne; nor by the earth for it is his footstool. (Matt. 5:34.)</p>

<p>Marriage is <i>honorable in all</i>. (Heb. 13:4.)</p>  
<p align="center">MARRIAGE <b>DISAPPROVED</b>.</p>  
<p>It is good for a man <i>not to touch</i> a woman. (1 Cor. 7:1.)</p>

<p>When thou goest out to war against thine enemies, and the Lord thy God hath delivered them into thy hands, and thou hast taken them captive, and seest among the captives a beautiful woman and hast a desire unto her, then thou shalt take her home to thy house; . . . and after that thou shalt <i>go in</i> unto her and be <i>her husband</i>, and she shall be <i>thy wife</i>. . . .

<p>And the Lord said unto Hosea, Go, take thee a wife of whoredoms. . . . Then said the Lord to me [Hosea], Go, yet, <i>love a woman</i>, beloved of her friend, yet <i>an adulteress</i>. . . . So I <i>bought</i> her; . . . and said unto her, Thou shalt <i>abide for me</i> many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be for another man; so will I also be for thee.
