### Sirach 44

[Apo](../apo/sir044)

1 Let us now praise famous men, and our fathers that begat us.

2 The Lord hath wrought great glory by them through his great power from
the beginning.

3 Such as did bear rule in their kingdoms, men renowned for their power,
giving counsel by their understanding, and declaring prophecies:

4 Leaders of the people by their counsels, and by their knowledge of
learning meet for the people, wise and eloquent are their instructions:

5 Such as found out musical tunes, and recited verses in writing:

6 Rich men furnished with ability, living peaceably in their
habitations:

7 All these were honoured in their generations, and were the glory of
their times.

8 There be of them, that have left a name behind them, that their
praises might be reported.

9 And some there be, which have no memorial; who are perished, as though
they had never been; and are become as though they had never been born;
and their children after them.

10 But these were merciful men, whose righteousness hath not been
forgotten.

11 With their seed shall continually remain a good inheritance, and
their children are within the covenant.

12 Their seed standeth fast, and their children for their sakes.

13 Their seed shall remain for ever, and their glory shall not be
blotted out.

14 Their bodies are buried in peace; but their name liveth for evermore.

15 The people will tell of their wisdom, and the congregation will shew
forth their praise.

16 Enoch pleased the Lord, and was translated, being an example of
repentance to all generations.

17 Noah was found perfect and righteous; in the time of wrath he was
taken in exchange \[for the world;\] therefore was he left as a remnant
unto the earth, when the flood came.

18 An everlasting covenant was made with him, that all flesh should
perish no more by the flood.

19 Abraham was a great father of many people: in glory was there none
like unto him;

20 Who kept the law of the most High, and was in covenant with him: he
established the covenant in his flesh; and when he was proved, he was
found faithful.

21 Therefore he assured him by an oath, that he would bless the nations
in his seed, and that he would multiply him as the dust of the earth,
and exalt his seed as the stars, and cause them to inherit from sea to
sea, and from the river unto the utmost part of the land.

22 With Isaac did he establish likewise \[for Abraham his father's
sake\] the blessing of all men, and the covenant, And made it rest upon
the head of Jacob. He acknowledged him in his blessing, and gave him an
heritage, and divided his portions; among the twelve tribes did he part
them.

1 αἰνέσωμεν δὴ ἄνδρας ἐνδόξους καὶ τοὺς πατέρας ἡμῶν τῇ γενέσει

2 πολλὴν δόξαν ἔκτισεν ὁ κύριος τὴν μεγαλωσύνην αὐτοῦ ἀπ᾽ αἰῶνος

3 κυριεύοντες ἐν ταῖς βασιλείαις αὐτῶν καὶ ἄνδρες ὀνομαστοὶ ἐν δυνάμει
βουλεύοντες ἐν συνέσει αὐτῶν ἀπηγγελκότες ἐν προφητείαις

4 ἡγούμενοι λαοῦ ἐν διαβουλίοις καὶ συνέσει γραμματείας λαοῦ σοφοὶ λόγοι
ἐν παιδείᾳ αὐτῶν

5 ἐκζητοῦντες μέλη μουσικῶν καὶ διηγούμενοι ἔπη ἐν γραφῇ

6 ἄνδρες πλούσιοι κεχορηγημένοι ἰσχύι εἰρηνεύοντες ἐν κατοικίαις αὐτῶν

7 πάντες οὗτοι ἐν γενεαῖς ἐδοξάσθησαν καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις αὐτῶν καύχημα

8 εἰσὶν αὐτῶν οἳ κατέλιπον ὄνομα τοῦ ἐκδιηγήσασθαι ἐπαίνους

9 καὶ εἰσὶν ὧν οὐκ ἔστιν μνημόσυνον καὶ ἀπώλοντο ὡς οὐχ ὑπάρξαντες καὶ
ἐγένοντο ὡς οὐ γεγονότες καὶ τὰ τέκνα αὐτῶν μετ᾽ αὐτούς

10 ἀλλ᾽ ἢ οὗτοι ἄνδρες ἐλέους ὧν αἱ δικαιοσύναι οὐκ ἐπελήσθησαν

11 μετὰ τοῦ σπέρματος αὐτῶν διαμενεῖ ἀγαθὴ κληρονομία ἔκγονα αὐτῶν

12 ἐν ταῖς διαθήκαις ἔστη τὸ σπέρμα αὐτῶν καὶ τὰ τέκνα αὐτῶν δι᾽ αὐτούς

13 ἕως αἰῶνος μενεῖ σπέρμα αὐτῶν καὶ ἡ δόξα αὐτῶν οὐκ ἐξαλειφθήσεται

14 τὰ σώματα αὐτῶν ἐν εἰρήνῃ ἐτάφη καὶ τὸ ὄνομα αὐτῶν ζῇ εἰς γενεάς

15 σοφίαν αὐτῶν διηγήσονται λαοί καὶ τὸν ἔπαινον ἐξαγγέλλει ἐκκλησία

16 Ενωχ εὐηρέστησεν κυρίῳ καὶ μετετέθη ὑπόδειγμα μετανοίας ταῖς γενεαῖς

17 Νωε εὑρέθη τέλειος δίκαιος ἐν καιρῷ ὀργῆς ἐγένετο ἀντάλλαγμα διὰ
τοῦτον ἐγενήθη κατάλειμμα τῇ γῇ ὅτε ἐγένετο κατακλυσμός

18 διαθῆκαι αἰῶνος ἐτέθησαν πρὸς αὐτόν ἵνα μὴ ἐξαλειφθῇ κατακλυσμῷ πᾶσα
σάρξ

19 Αβρααμ μέγας πατὴρ πλήθους ἐθνῶν καὶ οὐχ εὑρέθη ὅμοιος ἐν τῇ δόξῃ

20 ὃς συνετήρησεν νόμον ὑψίστου καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν διαθήκῃ μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ ἐν
σαρκὶ αὐτοῦ ἔστησεν διαθήκην καὶ ἐν πειρασμῷ εὑρέθη πιστός

21 διὰ τοῦτο ἐν ὅρκῳ ἔστησεν αὐτῷ ἐνευλογηθῆναι ἔθνη ἐν σπέρματι αὐτοῦ
πληθῦναι αὐτὸν ὡς χοῦν τῆς γῆς καὶ ὡς ἄστρα ἀνυψῶσαι τὸ σπέρμα αὐτοῦ καὶ
κατακληρονομῆσαι αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ θαλάσσης ἕως θαλάσσης καὶ ἀπὸ ποταμοῦ ἕως
ἄκρου τῆς γῆς

22 καὶ ἐν τῷ Ισαακ ἔστησεν οὕτως δι᾽ Αβρααμ τὸν πατέρα αὐτοῦ

23 εὐλογίαν πάντων ἀνθρώπων καὶ διαθήκην κατέπαυσεν ἐπὶ κεφαλὴν Ιακωβ
ἐπέγνω αὐτὸν ἐν εὐλογίαις αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ ἐν κληρονομίᾳ καὶ
διέστειλεν μερίδας αὐτοῦ ἐν φυλαῖς ἐμέρισεν δέκα δύο

[Vul](../vul/sir044)

1 \[Laudemus viros gloriosos,  
et parentes nostros in generatione sua.  

2 Multam gloriam fecit Dominus:  
magnificentia sua a sæculo.  

3 Dominantes in potestatibus suis,  
homines magni virtute et prudentia sua præditi,  
nuntiantes in prophetis dignitatem prophetarum:  

4 et imperantes in præsenti populo,  
et virtute prudentiæ populis sanctissima verba:  

5 in peritia sua requirentes modos musicos,  
et narrantes carmina Scripturarum:  

6 homines divites in virtute,  
pulchritudinis studium habentes,  
pacificantes in domibus suis.  

7 Omnes isti in generationibus gentis suæ gloriam adepti sunt,  
et in diebus suis habentur in laudibus.  

8 Qui de illis nati sunt reliquerunt nomen  
narrandi laudes eorum.  

9 Et sunt quorum non est memoria:  
perierunt quasi qui non fuerint:  
et nati sunt quasi non nati,  
et filii ipsorum cum ipsis.  

10 Sed illi viri misericordiæ sunt,  
quorum pietates non defuerunt.  

11 Cum semine eorum permanent bona:  

12 hæreditas sancta nepotes eorum,  
et in testamentis stetit semen eorum:  

13 et filii eorum propter illos usque in æternum manent:  
semen eorum et gloria eorum non derelinquetur.  

14 Corpora ipsorum in pace sepulta sunt,  
et nomen eorum vivit in generationem et generationem.  

15 Sapientiam ipsorum narrent populi,  
et laudem eorum nuntiet ecclesia.\]  

16 \[Enoch placuit Deo, et translatus est in paradisum,  
ut det gentibus pœnitentiam.  

17 Noë inventus est perfectus, justus,  
et in tempore iracundiæ factus est reconciliatio.  

18 Ideo dimissum est reliquum terræ,  
cum factum est diluvium.  

19 Testamenta sæculi posita sunt apud illum,  
ne deleri possit diluvio omnis caro.\]  

20 \[Abraham magnus pater multitudinis gentium,  
et non est inventus similis illi in gloria:  
qui conservavit legem Excelsi,  
et fuit in testamento cum illo.  

21 In carne ejus stare fecit testamentum,  
et in tentatione inventus est fidelis.  

22 Ideo jurejurando dedit illi gloriam in gente sua,  
crescere illum quasi terræ cumulum,  

23 et ut stellas exaltare semen ejus,  
et hæreditare illos a mari usque ad mare,  
et a flumine usque ad terminos terræ.  

24 Et in Isaac eodem modo fecit,  
propter Abraham patrem ejus.  

25 Benedictionem omnium gentium dedit illi Dominus,  
et testamentum confirmavit super caput Jacob.  

26 Agnovit eum in benedictionibus suis,  
et dedit illi hæreditatem,  
et divisit illi partem in tribubus duodecim.  

27 Et conservavit illi homines misericordiæ,  
invenientes gratiam in oculis omnis carnis.\]
