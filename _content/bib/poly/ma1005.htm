<p align="center"><a href="../apo/ma1005.htm">Apo</a></p><P>1&nbsp;Now when the nations round about heard that the altar was built and the sanctuary renewed as before, it displeased them very much. </P>
<P>2&nbsp;Wherefore they thought to destroy the generation of Jacob that was among them, and thereupon they began to slay and destroy the people. </P>
<P>3&nbsp;Then Judas fought against the children of Esau in Idumea at Arabattine, because they besieged Gael: and he gave them a great overthrow, and abated their courage, and took their spoils. </P>
<P>4&nbsp;Also he remembered the injury of the children of Bean, who had been a snare and an offence unto the people, in that they lay in wait for them in the ways. </P>
<P>5&nbsp;He shut them up therefore in the towers, and encamped against them, and destroyed them utterly, and burned the towers of that place with fire, and all that were therein. </P>
<P>6&nbsp;Afterward he passed over to the children of Ammon, where he found a mighty power, and much people, with Timotheus their captain. </P>
<P>7&nbsp;So he fought many battles with them, till at length they were discomfited before him; and he smote them. </P>
<P>8&nbsp;And when he had taken Jazar, with the towns belonging thereto, he returned into Judea. </P>
<P>9&nbsp;Then the heathen that were at Galaad assembled themselves together against the Israelites that were in their quarters, to destroy them; but they fled to the fortress of Dathema. </P>
<P>10&nbsp;And sent letters unto Judas and his brethren, The heathen that are round about us are assembled together against us to destroy us: </P>
<P>11&nbsp;And they are preparing to come and take the fortress whereunto we are fled, Timotheus being captain of their host. </P>
<P>12&nbsp;Come now therefore, and deliver us from their hands, for many of us are slain: </P>
<P>13&nbsp;Yea, all our brethren that were in the places of Tobie are put to death: their wives and their children also they have carried away captives, and borne away their stuff; and they have destroyed there about a thousand men. </P>
<P>14&nbsp;While these letters were yet reading, behold, there came other messengers from Galilee with their clothes rent, who reported on this wise, </P>
<P>15&nbsp;And said, They of Ptolemais, and of Tyrus, and Sidon, and all Galilee of the Gentiles, are assembled together against us to consume us. </P>
<P>16&nbsp;Now when Judas and the people heard these words, there assembled a great congregation together, to consult what they should do for their brethren, that were in trouble, and assaulted of them. </P>
<P>17&nbsp;Then said Judas unto Simon his brother, Choose thee out men, and go and deliver thy brethren that are in Galilee, for I and Jonathan my brother will go into the country of Galaad. </P>
<P>18&nbsp;So he left Joseph the son of Zacharias, and Azarias, captains of the people, with the remnant of the host in Judea to keep it. </P>
<P>19&nbsp;Unto whom he gave commandment, saying, Take ye the charge of this people, and see that ye make not war against the heathen until the time that we come again. </P>
<P>20&nbsp;Now unto Simon were given three thousand men to go into Galilee, and unto Judas eight thousand men for the country of Galaad. </P>
<P>21&nbsp;Then went Simon into Galilee, where he fought many battles with the heathen, so that the heathen were discomfited by him. </P>
<P>22&nbsp;And he pursued them unto the gate of Ptolemais; and there were slain of the heathen about three thousand men, whose spoils he took. </P>
<P>23&nbsp;And those that were in Galilee, and in Arbattis, with their wives and their children, and all that they had, took he away with him, and brought them into Judea with great joy. </P>
<P>24&nbsp;Judas Maccabeus also and his brother Jonathan went over Jordan, and travelled three days' journey in the wilderness, </P>
<P>25&nbsp;Where they met with the Nabathites, who came unto them in a peaceable manner, and told them every thing that had happened to their brethren in the land of Galaad: </P>
<P>26&nbsp;And how that many of them were shut up in Bosora, and Bosor, and Alema, Casphor, Maked, and Carnaim; all these cities are strong and great: </P>
<P>27&nbsp;And that they were shut up in the rest of the cities of the country of Galaad, and that against to morrow they had appointed to bring their host against the forts, and to take them, and to destroy them all in one day. </P>
<P>28&nbsp;Hereupon Judas and his host turned suddenly by the way of the wilderness unto Bosora; and when he had won the city, he slew all the males with the edge of the sword, and took all their spoils, and burned the city with fire, </P>
<P>29&nbsp;From whence he removed by night, and went till he came to the fortress. </P>
<P>30&nbsp;And betimes in the morning they looked up, and, behold, there was an innumerable people bearing ladders and other engines of war, to take the fortress: for they assaulted them. </P>
<P>31&nbsp;When Judas therefore saw that the battle was begun, and that the cry of the city went up to heaven, with trumpets, and a great sound, </P>
<P>32&nbsp;He said unto his host, Fight this day for your brethren. </P>
<P>33&nbsp;So he went forth behind them in three companies, who sounded their trumpets, and cried with prayer. </P>
<P>34&nbsp;Then the host of Timotheus, knowing that it was Maccabeus, fled from him: wherefore he smote them with a great slaughter; so that there were killed of them that day about eight thousand men. </P>
<P>35&nbsp;This done, Judas turned aside to Maspha; and after he had assaulted it he took and slew all the males therein, and received the spoils thereof and and burnt it with fire. </P>
<P>36&nbsp;From thence went he, and took Casphon, Maged, Bosor, and the other cities of the country of Galaad. </P>
<P>37&nbsp;After these things gathered Timotheus another host and encamped against Raphon beyond the brook. </P>
<P>38&nbsp;So Judas sent men to espy the host, who brought him word, saying, All the heathen that be round about us are assembled unto them, even a very great host. </P>
<P>39&nbsp;He hath also hired the Arabians to help them and they have pitched their tents beyond the brook, ready to come and fight against thee. Upon this Judas went to meet them. </P>
<P>40&nbsp;Then Timotheus said unto the captains of his host, When Judas and his host come near the brook, if he pass over first unto us, we shall not be able to withstand him; for he will mightily prevail against us: </P>
<P>41&nbsp;But if he be afraid, and camp beyond the river, we shall go over unto him, and prevail against him. </P>
<P>42&nbsp;Now when Judas came near the brook, he caused the scribes of the people to remain by the brook: unto whom he gave commandment, saying, Suffer no man to remain in the camp, but let all come to the battle. </P>
<P>43&nbsp;So he went first over unto them, and all the people after him: then all the heathen, being discomfited before him, cast away their weapons, and fled unto the temple that was at Carnaim. </P>
<P>44&nbsp;But they took the city, and burned the temple with all that were therein. Thus was Carnaim subdued, neither could they stand any longer before Judas. </P>
<P>45&nbsp;Then Judas gathered together all the Israelites that were in the country of Galaad, from the least unto the greatest, even their wives, and their children, and their stuff, a very great host, to the end they might come into the land of Judea. </P>
<P>46&nbsp;Now when they came unto Ephron, (this was a great city in the way as they should go, very well fortified) they could not turn from it, either on the right hand or the left, but must needs pass through the midst of it. </P>
<P>47&nbsp;Then they of the city shut them out, and stopped up the gates with stones. </P>
<P>48&nbsp;Whereupon Judas sent unto them in peaceable manner, saying, Let us pass through your land to go into our own country, and none shall do you any hurt; we will only pass through on foot: howbeit they would not open unto him. </P>
<P>49&nbsp;Wherefore Judas commanded a proclamation to be made throughout the host, that every man should pitch his tent in the place where he was. </P>
<P>50&nbsp;So the soldiers pitched, and assaulted the city all that day and all that night, till at the length the city was delivered into his hands: </P>
<P>51&nbsp;Who then slew all the males with the edge of the sword, and rased the city, and took the spoils thereof, and passed through the city over them that were slain. </P>
<P>52&nbsp;After this went they over Jordan into the great plain before Bethsan. </P>
<P>53&nbsp;And Judas gathered together those that came behind, and exhorted the people all the way through, till they came into the land of Judea. </P>
<P>54&nbsp;So they went up to mount Sion with joy and gladness, where they offered burnt offerings, because not one of them were slain until they had returned in peace. </P>
<P>55&nbsp;Now what time as Judas and Jonathan were in the land of Galaad, and Simon his brother in Galilee before Ptolemais, </P>
<P>56&nbsp;Joseph the son of Zacharias, and Azarias, captains of the garrisons, heard of the valiant acts and warlike deeds which they had done. </P>
<P>57&nbsp;Wherefore they said, Let us also get us a name, and go fight against the heathen that are round about us. </P>
<P>58&nbsp;So when they had given charge unto the garrison that was with them, they went toward Jamnia. </P>
<P>59&nbsp;Then came Gorgias and his men out of the city to fight against them. </P>
<P>60&nbsp;And so it was, that Joseph and Azaras were put to flight, and pursued unto the borders of Judea: and there were slain that day of the people of Israel about two thousand men. </P>
<P>61&nbsp;Thus was there a great overthrow among the children of Israel, because they were not obedient unto Judas and his brethren, but thought to do some valiant act. </P>
<P>62&nbsp;Moreover these men came not of the seed of those, by whose hand deliverance was given unto Israel. </P>
<P>63&nbsp;Howbeit the man Judas and his brethren were greatly renowned in the sight of all Israel, and of all the heathen, wheresoever their name was heard of; </P>
<P>64&nbsp;Insomuch as the the people assembled unto them with joyful acclamations. </P>
<P>65&nbsp;Afterward went Judas forth with his brethren, and fought against the children of Esau in the land toward the south, where he smote Hebron, and the towns thereof, and pulled down the fortress of it, and burned the towers thereof round about. </P>
<P>66&nbsp;From thence he removed to go into the land of the Philistines, and passed through Samaria. </P>
<P>67&nbsp;At that time certain priests, desirous to shew their valour, were slain in battle, for that they went out to fight unadvisedly. </P>
<P>68&nbsp;So Judas turned to Azotus in the land of the Philistines, and when he had pulled down their altars, and burned their carved images with fire, and spoiled their cities, he returned into the land of Judea. </P>

<p align="center"><a href="../vul/ma1005.htm">Vul</a></p><P>1&nbsp;Et factum est, ut audierunt gentes in circuitu quia &#230;dificatum est altare et sanctuarium sicut prius, irat&#230; sunt valde:</P>
<P>2&nbsp;et cogitabant tollere genus Jacob, qui erant inter eos, et c&#156;perunt occidere de populo, et persequi.</P>
<P>3&nbsp;Et debellabat Judas filios Esau in Idum&#230;a, et eos qui erant in Acrabathane, quia circumsedebant Isra&#235;litas: et percussit eos plaga magna.</P>
<P>4&nbsp;Et recordatus est malitiam filiorum Bean, qui erant populo in laqueum et in scandalum, insidiantes ei in via.</P>
<P>5&nbsp;Et conclusi sunt ab eo in turribus, et applicuit ad eos, et anathematizavit eos, et incendit turres eorum igni cum omnibus qui in eis erant.</P>
<P>6&nbsp;Et transivit ad filios Ammon, et invenit manum fortem, et populum copiosum, et Timotheum ducem ipsorum:</P>
<P>7&nbsp;et commisit cum eis pr&#230;lia multa, et contriti sunt in conspectu eorum, et percussit eos:</P>
<P>8&nbsp;et cepit Gazer civitatem et filias ejus, et reversus est in Jud&#230;am.</P>
<P>9&nbsp;Et congregat&#230; sunt gentes qu&#230; sunt in Galaad adversus Isra&#235;litas, qui erant in finibus eorum, ut tollerent eos: et fugerunt in Datheman munitionem.</P>
<P>10&nbsp;Et miserunt litteras ad Judam et fratres ejus, dicentes: Congregat&#230; sunt adversum nos gentes per circuitum, ut nos auferant,</P>
<P>11&nbsp;et parant venire, et occupare munitionem, in quam confugimus: et Timotheus est dux exercitus eorum.</P>
<P>12&nbsp;Nunc ergo veni, et eripe nos de manibus eorum, quia cecidit multitudo de nobis.</P>
<P>13&nbsp;Et omnes fratres nostri, qui erant in locis Tubin, interfecti sunt: et captivas duxerunt uxores eorum, et natos, et spolia, et peremerunt illic fere mille viros.</P>
<P>14&nbsp;Et adhuc epistol&#230; legebantur, et ecce alii nuntii venerunt de Galil&#230;a conscissis tunicis, nuntiantes secundum verba h&#230;c:</P>
<P>15&nbsp;dicentes convenisse adversum se a Ptolemaida, et Tyro, et Sidone: et repleta est omnis Galil&#230;a alienigenis, ut nos consumant.</P>
<P>16&nbsp;Ut audivit autem Judas et populus sermones istos, convenit ecclesia magna cogitare quid facerent fratribus suis, qui in tribulatione erant, et expugnabantur ab eis.<BR>
</P>
<P>17&nbsp;Dixitque Judas Simoni fratri suo: Elige tibi viros, et vade, et libera fratres tuos in Galil&#230;a: ego autem et frater meus Jonathas ibimus in Galaaditim.</P>
<P>18&nbsp;Et reliquit Josephum filium Zachari&#230;, et Azariam, duces populi, cum residuo exercitu in Jud&#230;a ad custodiam:</P>
<P>19&nbsp;et pr&#230;cepit illis, dicens: Pr&#230;estote populo huic: et nolite bellum committere adversum gentes, donec revertamur.</P>
<P>20&nbsp;Et partiti sunt Simoni viri tria millia, ut iret in Galil&#230;am: Jud&#230; autem octo millia in Galaaditim.</P>
<P>21&nbsp;Et abiit Simon in Galil&#230;am, et commisit pr&#230;lia multa cum gentibus: et contrit&#230; sunt gentes a facie ejus, et persecutus est eos usque ad portam</P>
<P>22&nbsp;Ptolemaidis: et ceciderunt de gentibus fere tria millia virorum. Et accepit spolia eorum,</P>
<P>23&nbsp;et assumpsit eos qui erant in Galil&#230;a et in Arbatis, cum uxoribus, et natis, et omnibus qu&#230; erant illis, et adduxit in Jud&#230;am cum l&#230;titia magna.<BR>
</P>
<P>24&nbsp;Et Judas Machab&#230;us, et Jonathas frater ejus, transierunt Jordanem, et abierunt viam trium dierum per desertum.</P>
<P>25&nbsp;Et occurrerunt eis Nabuth&#230;i, et susceperunt eos pacifice, et narraverunt eis omnia qu&#230; acciderant fratribus eorum in Galaaditide,</P>
<P>26&nbsp;et quia multi ex eis comprehensi sunt in Barasa, et Bosor, et in Alimis, et in Casphor, et Mageth, et Carnaim: h&#230; omnes civitates munit&#230; et magn&#230;.</P>
<P>27&nbsp;Sed et in ceteris civitatibus Galaaditidis tenentur comprehensi, et in crastinum constituerunt admovere exercitum civitatibus his, et comprehendere, et tollere eos in una die.</P>
<P>28&nbsp;Et convertit Judas et exercitus ejus viam in desertum Bosor repente, et occupavit civitatem: et occidit omnem masculum in ore gladii, et accepit omnia spolia eorum, et succendit eam igni.</P>
<P>29&nbsp;Et surrexerunt inde nocte, et ibant usque ad munitionem.</P>
<P>30&nbsp;Et factum est diluculo, cum elevassent oculos suos, ecce populus multus, cujus non erat numerus, portantes scalas et machinas ut comprehenderent munitionem, et expugnarent eos.</P>
<P>31&nbsp;Et vidit Judas quia c&#156;pit bellum, et clamor belli ascendit ad c&#230;lum sicut tuba, et clamor magnus de civitate:</P>
<P>32&nbsp;et dixit exercitui suo: Pugnate hodie pro fratribus vestris.</P>
<P>33&nbsp;Et venit tribus ordinibus post eos, et exclamaverunt tubis, et clamaverunt in oratione.</P>
<P>34&nbsp;Et cognoverunt castra Timothei quia Machab&#230;us est, et refugerunt a facie ejus: et percusserunt eos plaga magna. Et ceciderunt ex eis in die illa fere octo millia virorum.</P>
<P>35&nbsp;Et divertit Judas in Maspha, et expugnavit, et cepit eam: et occidit omnem masculum ejus, et sumpsit spolia ejus, et succendit eam igni.</P>
<P>36&nbsp;Inde perrexit, et cepit Casbon, et Mageth, et Bosor, et reliquas civitates Galaaditidis.</P>
<P>37&nbsp;Post h&#230;c autem verba congregavit Timotheus exercitum alium, et castra posuit contra Raphon trans torrentem.</P>
<P>38&nbsp;Et misit Judas speculari exercitum: et renuntiaverunt ei, dicentes: Quia convenerunt ad eum omnes gentes qu&#230; in circuitu nostro sunt, exercitus multus nimis:</P>
<P>39&nbsp;et Arabas conduxerunt in auxilium sibi, et castra posuerunt trans torrentem, parati ad te venire in pr&#230;lium. Et abiit Judas obviam illis.</P>
<P>40&nbsp;Et ait Timotheus principibus exercitus sui: Cum appropinquaverit Judas, et exercitus ejus, ad torrentem aqu&#230;: si transierit ad nos prior, non poterimus sustinere eum, quia potens poterit adversum nos;</P>
<P>41&nbsp;si vero timuerit transire, et posuerit castra extra flumen, transfretamus ad eos, et poterimus adversus illum.</P>
<P>42&nbsp;Ut autem appropinquavit Judas ad torrentem aqu&#230;, statuit scribas populi secus torrentem, et mandavit eis, dicens: Neminem hominem reliqueritis, sed veniant omnes in pr&#230;lium.</P>
<P>43&nbsp;Et transfretavit ad illos prior, et omnis populus post eum, et contrit&#230; sunt omnes gentes a facie eorum, et projecerunt arma sua, et fugerunt ad fanum, quod erat in Carnaim.</P>
<P>44&nbsp;Et occupavit ipsam civitatem, et fanum succendit igni cum omnibus qui erant in ipso: et oppressa est Carnaim, et non potuit sustinere contra faciem Jud&#230;.<BR>
</P>
<P>45&nbsp;Et congregavit Judas universos Isra&#235;litas, qui erant in Galaaditide, a minimo usque ad maximum, et uxores eorum, et natos, et exercitum magnum valde, ut venirent in terram Juda.</P>
<P>46&nbsp;Et venerunt usque Ephron: et h&#230;c civitas magna in ingressu posita, munita valde, et non erat declinare ab ea dextera vel sinistra, sed per mediam iter erat.</P>
<P>47&nbsp;Et incluserunt se qui erant in civitate, et obstruxerunt portas lapidibus: et misit ad eos Judas verbis pacificis,</P>
<P>48&nbsp;dicens: Transeamus per terram vestram, ut eamus in terram nostram: et nemo vobis nocebit, tantum pedibus transibimus. Et nolebant eis aperire.</P>
<P>49&nbsp;Et pr&#230;cepit Judas pr&#230;dicare in castris, ut applicarent unusquisque in quo erat loco:</P>
<P>50&nbsp;et applicuerunt se viri virtutis, et oppugnavit civitatem illam tota die et tota nocte, et tradita est civitas in manu ejus:</P>
<P>51&nbsp;et peremerunt omnem masculum in ore gladii, et eradicavit eam, et accepit spolia ejus: et transivit per totam civitatem super interfectos.</P>
<P>52&nbsp;Et transgressi sunt Jordanem in campo magno, contra faciem Bethsan.</P>
<P>53&nbsp;Et erat Judas congregans extremos, et exhortabatur populum per totam viam, donec venirent in terram Juda:</P>
<P>54&nbsp;et ascenderunt in montem Sion cum l&#230;titia, et gaudio, et obtulerunt holocausta, quod nemo ex eis cecidisset donec reverterentur in pace.<BR>
</P>
<P>55&nbsp;Et in diebus quibus erat Judas et Jonathas in terra Galaad, et Simon frater ejus in Galil&#230;a contra faciem Ptolemaidis,</P>
<P>56&nbsp;audivit Josephus Zachari&#230; filius, et Azarias princeps virtutis, res bene gestas, et pr&#230;lia qu&#230; facta sunt,</P>
<P>57&nbsp;et dixit: Faciamus et ipsi nobis nomen, et eamus pugnare adversus gentes qu&#230; in circuitu nostro sunt.</P>
<P>58&nbsp;Et pr&#230;cepit his qui erant in exercitu suo, et abierunt Jamniam.</P>
<P>59&nbsp;Et exivit Gorgias de civitate, et viri ejus obviam illis in pugnam.</P>
<P>60&nbsp;Et fugati sunt Josephus et Azarias usque in fines Jud&#230;&#230;: et ceciderunt illo die de populo Isra&#235;l ad duo millia viri, et facta est fuga magna in populo:</P>
<P>61&nbsp;quia non audierunt Judam, et fratres ejus, existimantes fortiter se facturos.</P>
<P>62&nbsp;Ipsi autem non erant de semine virorum illorum, per quos salus facta est in Isra&#235;l.</P>
<P>63&nbsp;Et viri Juda magnificati sunt valde in conspectu omnis Isra&#235;l, et gentium omnium ubi audiebatur nomen eorum.</P>
<P>64&nbsp;Et convenerunt ad eos fausta acclamantes.<BR>
</P>
<P>65&nbsp;Et exivit Judas et fratres ejus, et expugnabant filios Esau in terra qu&#230; ad austrum est, et percussit Chebron et filias ejus: et muros ejus, et turres succendit igni in circuitu.</P>
<P>66&nbsp;Et movit castra ut iret in terram alienigenarum, et perambulabat Samariam.</P>
<P>67&nbsp;In die illa ceciderunt sacerdotes in bello, dum volunt fortiter facere, dum sine consilio exeunt in pr&#230;lium.</P>
<P>68&nbsp;Et declinavit Judas in Azotum in terram alienigenarum, et diruit aras eorum, et sculptilia deorum ipsorum succendit igni: et cepit spolia civitatum, et reversus est in terram Juda.</P>
