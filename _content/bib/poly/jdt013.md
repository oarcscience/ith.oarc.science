### Judith 13

[Apo](../apo/jdt013)

1 Now when the evening was come, his servants made haste to depart, and
Bagoas shut his tent without, and dismissed the waiters from the
presence of his lord; and they went to their beds: for they were all
weary, because the feast had been long.

2 And Judith was left along in the tent, and Holofernes lying along upon
his bed: for he was filled with wine.

3 Now Judith had commanded her maid to stand without her bedchamber, and
to wait for her. coming forth, as she did daily: for she said she would
go forth to her prayers, and she spake to Bagoas according to the same
purpose.

4 So all went forth and none was left in the bedchamber, neither little
nor great. Then Judith, standing by his bed, said in her heart, O Lord
God of all power, look at this present upon the works of mine hands for
the exaltation of Jerusalem.

5 For now is the time to help thine inheritance, and to execute thine
enterprizes to the destruction of the enemies which are risen against
us.

6 Then she came to the pillar of the bed, which was at Holofernes' head,
and took down his fauchion from thence,

7 And approached to his bed, and took hold of the hair of his head, and
said, Strengthen me, O Lord God of Israel, this day.

8 And she smote twice upon his neck with all her might, and she took
away his head from him.

9 And tumbled his body down from the bed, and pulled down the canopy
from the pillars; and anon after she went forth, and gave Holofernes his
head to her maid;

10 And she put it in her bag of meat: so they twain went together
according to their custom unto prayer: and when they passed the camp,
they compassed the valley, and went up the mountain of Bethulia, and
came to the gates thereof.

11 Then said Judith afar off, to the watchmen at the gate, Open, open
now the gate: God, even our God, is with us, to shew his power yet in
Jerusalem, and his forces against the enemy, as he hath even done this
day.

12 Now when the men of her city heard her voice, they made haste to go
down to the gate of their city, and they called the elders of the city.

13 And then they ran all together, both small and great, for it was
strange unto them that she was come: so they opened the gate, and
received them, and made a fire for a light, and stood round about them.

14 Then she said to them with a loud voice, Praise, praise God, praise
God, I say, for he hath not taken away his mercy from the house of
Israel, but hath destroyed our enemies by mine hands this night.

15 So she took the head out of the bag, and shewed it, and said unto
them, behold the head of Holofernes, the chief captain of the army of
Assur, and behold the canopy, wherein he did lie in his drunkenness; and
the Lord hath smitten him by the hand of a woman.

16 As the Lord liveth, who hath kept me in my way that I went, my
countenance hath deceived him to his destruction, and yet hath he not
committed sin with me, to defile and shame me.

17 Then all the people were wonderfully astonished, and bowed themselves
and worshipped God, and said with one accord, Blessed be thou, O our
God, which hast this day brought to nought the enemies of thy people.

18 Then said Ozias unto her, O daughter, blessed art thou of the most
high God above all the women upon the earth; and blessed be the Lord
God, which hath created the heavens and the earth, which hath directed
thee to the cutting off of the head of the chief of our enemies.

19 For this thy confidence shall not depart from the heart of men, which
remember the power of God for ever.

20 And God turn these things to thee for a perpetual praise, to visit
thee in good things because thou hast not spared thy life for the
affliction of our nation, but hast revenged our ruin, walking a straight
way before our God. And all the people said; So be it, so be it.

1 ὡς δὲ ὀψία ἐγένετο ἐσπούδασαν οἱ δοῦλοι αὐτοῦ ἀναλύειν καὶ Βαγώας
συνέκλεισεν τὴν σκηνὴν ἔξωθεν καὶ ἀπέκλεισεν τοὺς παρεστῶτας ἐκ προσώπου
τοῦ κυρίου αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀπῴχοντο εἰς τὰς κοίτας αὐτῶν ἦσαν γὰρ πάντες
κεκοπωμένοι διὰ τὸ ἐπὶ πλεῖον γεγονέναι τὸν πότον

2 ὑπελείφθη δὲ Ιουδιθ μόνη ἐν τῇ σκηνῇ καὶ Ολοφέρνης προπεπτωκὼς ἐπὶ τὴν
κλίνην αὐτοῦ ἦν γὰρ περικεχυμένος αὐτῷ ὁ οἶνος

3 καὶ εἶπεν Ιουδιθ τῇ δούλῃ αὐτῆς στῆναι ἔξω τοῦ κοιτῶνος αὐτῆς καὶ
ἐπιτηρεῖν τὴν ἔξοδον αὐτῆς καθάπερ καθ᾽ ἡμέραν ἐξελεύσεσθαι γὰρ ἔφη ἐπὶ
τὴν προσευχὴν αὐτῆς καὶ τῷ Βαγώᾳ ἐλάλησεν κατὰ τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα

4 καὶ ἀπήλθοσαν πάντες ἐκ προσώπου καὶ οὐδεὶς κατελείφθη ἐν τῷ κοιτῶνι
ἀπὸ μικροῦ ἕως μεγάλου καὶ στᾶσα Ιουδιθ παρὰ τὴν κλίνην αὐτοῦ εἶπεν ἐν
τῇ καρδίᾳ αὐτῆς κύριε ὁ θεὸς πάσης δυνάμεως ἐπίβλεψον ἐν τῇ ὥρᾳ ταύτῃ
ἐπὶ τὰ ἔργα τῶν χειρῶν μου εἰς ὕψωμα Ιερουσαλημ

5 ὅτι νῦν καιρὸς ἀντιλαβέσθαι τῆς κληρονομίας σου καὶ ποιῆσαι τὸ
ἐπιτήδευμά μου εἰς θραῦσμα ἐχθρῶν οἳ ἐπανέστησαν ἡμῖν

6 καὶ προσελθοῦσα τῷ κανόνι τῆς κλίνης ὃς ἦν πρὸς κεφαλῆς Ολοφέρνου
καθεῖλεν τὸν ἀκινάκην αὐτοῦ ἀπ᾽ αὐτοῦ

7 καὶ ἐγγίσασα τῆς κλίνης ἐδράξατο τῆς κόμης τῆς κεφαλῆς αὐτοῦ καὶ εἶπεν
κραταίωσόν με κύριε ὁ θεὸς Ισραηλ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ταύτῃ

8 καὶ ἐπάταξεν εἰς τὸν τράχηλον αὐτοῦ δὶς ἐν τῇ ἰσχύι αὐτῆς καὶ ἀφεῖλεν
τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ ἀπ᾽ αὐτοῦ

9 καὶ ἀπεκύλισε τὸ σῶμα αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ τῆς στρωμνῆς καὶ ἀφεῖλε τὸ κωνώπιον
ἀπὸ τῶν στύλων καὶ μετ᾽ ὀλίγον ἐξῆλθεν καὶ παρέδωκεν τῇ ἅβρᾳ αὐτῆς τὴν
κεφαλὴν Ολοφέρνου

10 καὶ ἐνέβαλεν αὐτὴν εἰς τὴν πήραν τῶν βρωμάτων αὐτῆς καὶ ἐξῆλθον αἱ
δύο ἅμα κατὰ τὸν ἐθισμὸν αὐτῶν ἐπὶ τὴν προσευχήν καὶ διελθοῦσαι τὴν
παρεμβολὴν ἐκύκλωσαν τὴν φάραγγα ἐκείνην καὶ προσανέβησαν τὸ ὄρος
Βαιτυλουα καὶ ἤλθοσαν πρὸς τὰς πύλας αὐτῆς

11 καὶ εἶπεν Ιουδιθ μακρόθεν τοῖς φυλάσσουσιν ἐπὶ τῶν πυλῶν ἀνοίξατε
ἀνοίξατε δὴ τὴν πύλην μεθ᾽ ἡμῶν ὁ θεὸς ὁ θεὸς ἡμῶν ποιῆσαι ἔτι ἰσχὺν ἐν
Ισραηλ καὶ κράτος κατὰ τῶν ἐχθρῶν καθὰ καὶ σήμερον ἐποίησεν

12 καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἤκουσαν οἱ ἄνδρες τῆς πόλεως αὐτῆς τὴν φωνὴν αὐτῆς
ἐσπούδασαν τοῦ καταβῆναι ἐπὶ τὴν πύλην τῆς πόλεως αὐτῶν καὶ συνεκάλεσαν
τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους τῆς πόλεως

13 καὶ συνέδραμον πάντες ἀπὸ μικροῦ ἕως μεγάλου αὐτῶν ὅτι παράδοξον ἦν
αὐτοῖς τὸ ἐλθεῖν αὐτήν καὶ ἤνοιξαν τὴν πύλην καὶ ὑπεδέξαντο αὐτὰς καὶ
ἅψαντες πῦρ εἰς φαῦσιν περιεκύκλωσαν αὐτάς

14 ἡ δὲ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτοὺς φωνῇ μεγάλῃ αἰνεῖτε τὸν θεόν αἰνεῖτε αἰνεῖτε
τὸν θεόν ὃς οὐκ ἀπέστησεν τὸ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ τοῦ οἴκου Ισραηλ ἀλλ᾽
ἔθραυσε τοὺς ἐχθροὺς ἡμῶν διὰ χειρός μου ἐν τῇ νυκτὶ ταύτῃ

15 καὶ προελοῦσα τὴν κεφαλὴν ἐκ τῆς πήρας ἔδειξεν καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς ἰδοὺ
ἡ κεφαλὴ Ολοφέρνου ἀρχιστρατήγου δυνάμεως Ασσουρ καὶ ἰδοὺ τὸ κωνώπιον ἐν
ᾧ κατέκειτο ἐν ταῖς μέθαις αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτὸν ὁ κύριος ἐν χειρὶ
θηλείας

16 καὶ ζῇ κύριος ὃς διεφύλαξέν με ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ μου ᾗ ἐπορεύθην ὅτι ἠπάτησεν
αὐτὸν τὸ πρόσωπόν μου εἰς ἀπώλειαν αὐτοῦ καὶ οὐκ ἐποίησεν ἁμάρτημα μετ᾽
ἐμοῦ εἰς μίασμα καὶ αἰσχύνην

17 καὶ ἐξέστη πᾶς ὁ λαὸς σφόδρα καὶ κύψαντες προσεκύνησαν τῷ θεῷ καὶ
εἶπαν ὁμοθυμαδόν εὐλογητὸς εἶ ὁ θεὸς ἡμῶν ὁ ἐξουδενώσας ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ
σήμερον τοὺς ἐχθροὺς τοῦ λαοῦ σου

18 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ Οζιας εὐλογητὴ σύ θύγατερ τῷ θεῷ τῷ ὑψίστῳ παρὰ πάσας
τὰς γυναῖκας τὰς ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς καὶ εὐλογημένος κύριος ὁ θεός ὃς ἔκτισεν
τοὺς οὐρανοὺς καὶ τὴν γῆν ὃς κατεύθυνέν σε εἰς τραῦμα κεφαλῆς ἄρχοντος
ἐχθρῶν ἡμῶν

19 ὅτι οὐκ ἀποστήσεται ἡ ἐλπίς σου ἀπὸ καρδίας ἀνθρώπων μνημονευόντων
ἰσχὺν θεοῦ ἕως αἰῶνος

20 καὶ ποιήσαι σοι αὐτὰ ὁ θεὸς εἰς ὕψος αἰώνιον τοῦ ἐπισκέψασθαί σε ἐν
ἀγαθοῖς ἀνθ᾽ ὧν οὐκ ἐφείσω τῆς ψυχῆς σου διὰ τὴν ταπείνωσιν τοῦ γένους
ἡμῶν ἀλλ᾽ ἐπεξῆλθες τῷ πτώματι ἡμῶν ἐπ᾽ εὐθεῖαν πορευθεῖσα ἐνώπιον τοῦ
θεοῦ ἡμῶν καὶ εἶπαν πᾶς ὁ λαός γένοιτο γένοιτο

[Vul](../vul/jdt013)

1 Ut autem sero factum est, festinaverunt servi illius ad hospitia sua,
et conclusit Vagao ostia cubiculi, et abiit.

2 Erant autem omnes fatigati a vino,

3 eratque Judith sola in cubiculo.

4 Porro Holofernes jacebat in lecto, nimia ebrietate sopitus.

5 Dixitque Judith puellæ suæ ut staret foris ante cubiculum, et
observaret.

6 Stetitque Judith ante lectum, orans cum lacrimis, et labiorum motu in
silentio,

7 dicens: Confirma me, Domine Deus Israël, et respice in hac hora ad
opera manuum mearum, ut, sicut promisisti, Jerusalem civitatem tuam
erigas: et hoc quod credens per te posse fieri cogitavi, perficiam.

8 Et cum hæc dixisset, accessit ad columnam quæ erat ad caput lectuli
ejus, et pugionem ejus, qui in ea ligatus pendebat, exsolvit.

9 Cumque evaginasset illum, apprehendit comam capitis ejus, et ait:
Confirma me, Domine Deus, in hac hora.

10 Et percussit bis in cervicem ejus, et abscidit caput ejus, et
abstulit conopeum ejus a columnis, et evolvit corpus ejus truncum.

11 Et post pusillum exivit, et tradidit caput Holofernis ancillæ suæ, et
jussit ut mitteret illud in peram suam.

12 Et exierunt duæ, secundum consuetudinem suam, quasi ad orationem, et
transierunt castra, et gyrantes vallem, venerunt ad portam civitatis.

13 Et dixit Judith a longe custodibus murorum: Aperite portas, quoniam
nobiscum est Deus, qui fecit virtutem in Israël.  

14 Et factum est cum audissent viri vocem ejus, vocaverunt presbyteros
civitatis.

15 Et concurrerunt ad eam omnes, a minimo usque ad maximum: quoniam
sperabant eam jam non esse venturam.

16 Et accendentes luminaria, congyraverunt circa eam universi: illa
autem ascendens in eminentiorem locum, jussit fieri silentium. Cumque
omnes tacuissent,

17 dixit Judith: Laudate Dominum Deum nostrum, qui non deseruit
sperantes in se,

18 et in me ancilla sua adimplevit misericordiam suam, quam promisit
domui Israël: et interfecit in manu mea hostem populi sui hac nocte.

19 Et proferens de pera caput Holofernis, ostendit illis, dicens: Ecce
caput Holofernis principis militiæ Assyriorum, et ecce conopeum illius,
in quo recumbebat in ebrietate sua, ubi per manum feminæ percussit illum
Dominus Deus noster.

20 Vivit autem ipse Dominus, quoniam custodivit me angelus ejus et hinc
euntem, et ibi commorantem, et inde huc revertentem, et non permisit me
Dominus ancillam suam coinquinari, sed sine pollutione peccati revocavit
me vobis gaudentem in victoria sua, in evasione mea, et in liberatione
vestra.

21 Confitemini illi omnes, quoniam bonus, quoniam in sæculum
misericordia ejus.

22 Universi autem adorantes Dominum, dixerunt ad eam: Benedixit te
Dominus in virtute sua, quia per te ad nihilum redegit inimicos nostros.

23 Porro Ozias princeps populi Israël dixit ad eam: Benedicta es tu,
filia, a Domino Deo excelso præ omnibus mulieribus super terram.

24 Benedictus Dominus, qui creavit cælum et terram, qui te direxit in
vulnera capitis principis inimicorum nostrorum:

25 quia hodie nomen tuum ita magnificavit, ut non recedat laus tua de
ore hominum qui memores fuerint virtutis Domini in æternum, pro quibus
non pepercisti animæ tuæ propter angustias et tribulationem generis tui,
sed subvenisti ruinæ ante conspectum Dei nostri.

26 Et dixit omnis populus: Fiat, fiat.  

27 Porro Achior vocatus venit, et dixit ei Judith: Deus Israël, cui tu
testimonium dedisti quod ulciscatur se de inimicis suis, ipse caput
omnium incredulorum incidit hac nocte in manu mea.

28 Et ut probes quia ita est, ecce caput Holofernis, qui in contemptu
superbiæ suæ Deum Israël contempsit, et tibi interitum minabatur,
dicens: Cum captus fuerit populus Israël, gladio perforari præcipiam
latera tua.

29 Videns autem Achior caput Holofernis, angustiatus præ pavore cecidit
in faciem suam super terram, et æstuavit anima ejus.

30 Postea vero quam resumpto spiritu recreatus est, procidit ad pedes
ejus, et adoravit eam, et dixit:

31 Benedicta tu a Deo tuo in omni tabernaculo Jacob, quoniam in omni
gente quæ audierit nomen tuum, magnificabitur super te Deus Israël.
