<p align="center"><a href="../apo/jdt007">Apo</a></p><P>1&nbsp;The next day Holofernes commanded all his army, and all his people which were come to take his part, that they should remove their camp against Bethulia, to take aforehand the ascents of the hill country, and to make war against the children of Israel. </P>
<P>2&nbsp;Then their strong men removed their camps in that day, and the army of the men of war was an hundred and seventy thousand footmen, and twelve thousand horsemen, beside the baggage, and other men that were afoot among them, a very great multitude. </P>
<P>3&nbsp;And they camped in the valley near unto Bethulia, by the fountain, and they spread themselves in breadth over Dothaim even to Belmaim, and in length from Bethulia unto Cynamon, which is over against Esdraelon. </P>
<P>4&nbsp;Now the children of Israel, when they saw the multitude of them, were greatly troubled, and said every one to his neighbour, Now will these men lick up the face of the earth; for neither the high mountains, nor the valleys, nor the hills, are able to bear their weight. </P>
<P>5&nbsp;Then every man took up his weapons of war, and when they had kindled fires upon their towers, they remained and watched all that night. </P>
<P>6&nbsp;But in the second day Holofernes brought forth all his horsemen in the sight of the children of Israel which were in Bethulia, </P>
<P>7&nbsp;And viewed the passages up to the city, and came to the fountains of their waters, and took them, and set garrisons of men of war over them, and he himself removed toward his people. </P>
<P>8&nbsp;Then came unto him all the chief of the children of Esau, and all the governors of the people of Moab, and the captains of the sea coast, and said, </P>
<P>9&nbsp;Let our lord now hear a word, that there be not an overthrow in thine army. </P>
<P>10&nbsp;For this people of the children of Israel do not trust in their spears, but in the height of the mountains wherein they dwell, because it is not easy to come up to the tops of their mountains. </P>
<P>11&nbsp;Now therefore, my lord, fight not against them in battle array, and there shall not so much as one man of thy people perish. </P>
<P>12&nbsp;Remain in thy camp, and keep all the men of thine army, and let thy servants get into their hands the fountain of water, which issueth forth of the foot of the mountain: </P>
<P>13&nbsp;For all the inhabitants of Bethulia have their water thence; so shall thirst kill them, and they shall give up their city, and we and our people shall go up to the tops of the mountains that are near, and will camp upon them, to watch that none go out of the city. </P>
<P>14&nbsp;So they and their wives and their children shall be consumed with fire, and before the sword come against them, they shall be overthrown in the streets where they dwell. </P>
<P>15&nbsp;Thus shalt thou render them an evil reward; because they rebelled, and met not thy person peaceably. </P>
<P>16&nbsp;And these words pleased Holofernes and all his servants, and he appointed to do as they had spoken. </P>
<P>17&nbsp;So the camp of the children of Ammon departed, and with them five thousand of the Assyrians, and they pitched in the valley, and took the waters, and the fountains of the waters of the children of Israel. </P>
<P>18&nbsp;Then the children of Esau went up with the children of Ammon, and camped in the hill country over against Dothaim: and they sent some of them toward the south, and toward the east over against Ekrebel, which is near unto Chusi, that is upon the brook Mochmur; and the rest of the army of the Assyrians camped in the plain, and covered the face of the whole land; and their tents and carriages were pitched to a very great multitude. </P>
<P>19&nbsp;Then the children of Israel cried unto the Lord their God, because their heart failed, for all their enemies had compassed them round about, and there was no way to escape out from among them. </P>
<P>20&nbsp;Thus all the company of Assur remained about them, both their footmen, chariots, and horsemen, four and thirty days, so that all their vessels of water failed all the inhibitants of Bethulia. </P>
<P>21&nbsp;And the cisterns were emptied, and they had not water to drink their fill for one day; for they gave them drink by measure. </P>
<P>22&nbsp;Therefore their young children were out of heart, and their women and young men fainted for thirst, and fell down in the streets of the city, and by the passages of the gates, and there was no longer any strength in them. </P>
<P>23&nbsp;Then all the people assembled to Ozias, and to the chief of the city, both young men, and women, and children, and cried with a loud voice, and said before all the elders, </P>
<P>24&nbsp;God be judge between us and you: for ye have done us great injury, in that ye have not required peace of the children of Assur. </P>
<P>25&nbsp;For now we have no helper: but God hath sold us into their hands, that we should be thrown down before them with thirst and great destruction. </P>
<P>26&nbsp;Now therefore call them unto you, and deliver the whole city for a spoil to the people of Holofernes, and to all his army. </P>
<P>27&nbsp;For it is better for us to be made a spoil unto them, than to die for thirst: for we will be his servants, that our souls may live, and not see the death of our infants before our eyes, nor our wives nor our children to die. </P>
<P>28&nbsp;We take to witness against you the heaven and the earth, and our God and Lord of our fathers, which punisheth us according to our sins and the sins of our fathers, that he do not according as we have said this day. </P>
<P>29&nbsp;Then there was great weeping with one consent in the midst of the assembly; and they cried unto the Lord God with a loud voice. </P>
<P>30&nbsp;Then said Ozias to them, Brethren, be of good courage, let us yet endure five days, in the which space the Lord our God may turn his mercy toward us; for he will not forsake us utterly. </P>
<P>31&nbsp;And if these days pass, and there come no help unto us, I will do according to your word. </P>
<P>32&nbsp;And he dispersed the people, every one to their own charge; and they went unto the walls and towers of their city, and sent the women and children into their houses: and they were very low brought in the city. </P>

<P>29&nbsp;καὶ ἐγένετο κλαυθμὸς μέγας ἐν μέσῳ τῆς ἐκκλησίας πάντων ὁμοθυμαδόν καὶ ἐβόησαν πρὸς κύριον τὸν θεὸν φωνῇ μεγάλῃ </P>
<P>30&nbsp;καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτοὺς Οζιας θαρσεῖτε ἀδελφοί διακαρτερήσωμεν ἔτι πέντε ἡμέρας ἐν αἷς ἐπιστρέψει κύριος ὁ θεὸς ἡμῶν τὸ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ ἐφ᾽ ἡμᾶς οὐ γὰρ ἐγκαταλείψει ἡμᾶς εἰς τέλος </P>
<P>31&nbsp;ἐὰν δὲ διέλθωσιν αὗται καὶ μὴ ἔλθῃ ἐφ᾽ ἡμᾶς βοήθεια ποιήσω κατὰ τὰ ῥήματα ὑμῶν </P>
<P>32&nbsp;καὶ ἐσκόρπισεν τὸν λαὸν εἰς τὴν ἑαυτοῦ παρεμβολήν καὶ ἐπὶ τὰ τείχη καὶ τοὺς πύργους τῆς πόλεως αὐτῶν ἀπῆλθον καὶ τὰς γυναῖκας καὶ τὰ τέκνα εἰς τοὺς οἴκους αὐτῶν ἀπέστειλαν καὶ ἦσαν ἐν ταπεινώσει πολλῇ ἐν τῇ πόλει </P>

<p align="center"><a href="../vul/jdt007">Vul</a></p><P>1&nbsp;Holofernes autem altera die pr&#230;cepit exercitibus suis ut ascenderent contra Bethuliam.</P>
<P>2&nbsp;Erant autem pedites bellatorum centum viginti millia, et equites viginti duo millia, pr&#230;ter pr&#230;parationes virorum illorum quos occupaverat captivitas, et abducti fuerant de provinciis et urbibus univers&#230; juventutis.</P>
<P>3&nbsp;Omnes paraverunt se pariter ad pugnam contra filios Isra&#235;l, et venerunt per crepidinem montis usque ad apicem, qui respicit super Dothain, a loco qui dicitur Belma usque ad Chelmon, qui est contra Esdrelon.</P>
<P>4&nbsp;Filii autem Isra&#235;l, ut viderunt multitudinem illorum, prostraverunt se super terram, mittentes cinerem super capita sua, unanimes orantes ut Deus Isra&#235;l misericordiam suam ostenderet super populum suum.</P>
<P>5&nbsp;Et assumentes arma sua bellica, sederunt per loca qu&#230; ad angusti itineris tramitem dirigunt inter montosa, et erant custodientes ea tota die et nocte.<BR>
</P>
<P>6&nbsp;Porro Holofernes, dum circuit per gyrum, reperit quod fons qui influebat, aqu&#230;ductum illorum a parte australi extra civitatem dirigeret: et incidi pr&#230;cepit aqu&#230;ductum illorum.</P>
<P>7&nbsp;Erant tamen non longe a muris fontes, ex quibus furtim videbantur haurire aquam ad refocillandum potius quam ad potandum.</P>
<P>8&nbsp;Sed filii Ammon et Moab accesserunt ad Holofernem, dicentes: Filii Isra&#235;l non in lancea nec in sagitta confidunt, sed montes defendunt illos, et muniunt illos colles in pr&#230;cipitio constituti.</P>
<P>9&nbsp;Ut ergo sine congressione pugn&#230; possis superare eos, pone custodes fontium, ut non hauriant aquam ex eis, et sine gladio interficies eos, vel certe fatigati tradent civitatem suam, quam putant in montibus positam superari non posse.</P>
<P>10&nbsp;Et placuerunt verba h&#230;c coram Holoferne et coram satellitibus ejus, et constituit per gyrum centenarios per singulos fontes.</P>
<P>11&nbsp;Cumque ista custodia per dies viginti fuisset expleta, defecerunt cistern&#230; et collectiones aquarum omnibus habitantibus Bethuliam, ita ut non esset intra civitatem unde satiarentur vel una die, quoniam ad mensuram dabatur populis aqua quotidie.<BR>
</P>
<P>12&nbsp;Tunc ad Oziam congregati omnes viri femin&#230;que, juvenes et parvuli, omnes simul una voce</P>
<P>13&nbsp;dixerunt: Judicet Deus inter nos et te, quoniam fecisti in nos mala, nolens loqui pacifice cum Assyriis, et propter hoc vendidit nos Deus in manibus eorum.</P>
<P>14&nbsp;Et ideo non est qui adjuvet, cum prosternamur ante oculos eorum in siti, et perditione magna.</P>
<P>15&nbsp;Et nunc congregate universos qui in civitate sunt, ut sponte tradamus nos omnes populo Holofernis.</P>
<P>16&nbsp;Melius est enim ut captivi benedicamus Dominum viventes, quam moriamur, et simus opprobrium omni carni, cum viderimus uxores nostras et infantes nostros mori ante oculos nostros.</P>
<P>17&nbsp;Contestamur hodie c&#230;lum et terram, et Deum patrum nostrorum, qui ulciscitur nos secundum peccata nostra, ut jam tradatis civitatem in manu militi&#230; Holofernis, et sit finis noster brevis in ore gladii, qui longior efficitur in ariditate sitis.</P>
<P>18&nbsp;Et cum h&#230;c dixissent, factus est fletus et ululatus magnus in ecclesia ab omnibus, et per multas horas una voce clamaverunt ad Deum, dicentes:</P>
<P>19&nbsp;Peccavimus cum patribus nostris: injuste egimus, iniquitatem fecimus.</P>
<P>20&nbsp;Tu, quia pius es, miserere nostri, aut in tuo flagello vindica iniquitates nostras, et noli tradere confitentes te populo qui ignorat te,</P>
<P>21&nbsp;ut non dicant inter gentes: Ubi est Deus eorum?</P>
<P>22&nbsp;Et cum fatigati ex his clamoribus et his fletibus lassati siluissent,</P>
<P>23&nbsp;exsurgens Ozias infusus lacrimis, dixit: &#198;quo animo estote, fratres, et hos quinque dies expectemus a Domino misericordiam.</P>
<P>24&nbsp;Forsitan enim indignationem suam abscindet, et dabit gloriam nomini suo.</P>
<P>25&nbsp;Si autem transactis quinque diebus non venerit adjutorium, faciemus h&#230;c verba qu&#230; locuti estis.</P>
