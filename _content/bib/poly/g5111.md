τολμάω  
tolmaō  
*tol-mah‘-o*  
From τόλμα tolma (*boldness*; probably itself from the base of
[5056](g5056) through the idea of *extreme* conduct); to *venture*
(objectively or in *act*; while [2292](g2292) is rather subjective or in
*feeling*); by implication to be *courageous:* - be bold, boldly, dare,
durst.
