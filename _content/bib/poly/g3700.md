G3700  
ὀπτάνομαι, ὄπτομαι  
optanomai optomai  
*op-tan‘-om-ahee,* *op‘-tom-ahee*  
The first a (middle voice) prolonged form of the second (primary) which
is used for it in certain tenses; and both as alternates of
[3708](g3708) to *gaze* (that is, with wide open eyes, as at something
remarkable; and thus differing from [991](g0991) which denotes simply
*voluntary* observation; and from [1492](g1492) which expresses merely
mechanical, passive or casual vision; while [2300](g2300) and still more
emphatically its intensive [2334](g2334) signifies an earnest but more
continued *inspection*; and [4648](g4648) a watching *from* *a*
*distance*): - appear, look, see, shew self.
