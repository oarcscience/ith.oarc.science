H2167  
זמר  
זָמַר ‎ zâmar  
*zaw-mar‘*  
A primitive root (perhaps identical with [2168](h2168) through the idea
of *striking* with the fingers); properly to *touch* the strings or
parts of a musical instrument, that is, *play* upon it; to make *music*,
accompanied by the voice; hence to *celebrate* in song and music: - give
praise, sing forth praises, psalms.
