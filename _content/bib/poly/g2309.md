G2309  
θέλω, ἐθέλω  
thelō ethelō  
*thel‘-o,* *eth-el‘-o*  
Either the first or the second form may be used. In certain tenses θελέω
theleō *thel-eh‘-o* (and ἐθέλέω etheleō *eth-el-eh‘-o* ) are used, which
are otherwise obsolete; apparently strengthened from the alternate form
of [138](g0138) to *determine* (as an active voice *option* from
subjective impulse; whereas [1014](g1014) properly denotes rather a
passive voice *acquiescence* in objective considerations), that is,
*choose* or *prefer* (literally or figuratively); by implication to
*wish*, that is, *be* *inclined* to (sometimes adverbially *gladly*);
impersonally for the future tense, to *be* *about* *to*; by Hebraism to
*delight* *in:* - desire, be disposed (forward), intend, list, love,
mean, please, have rather, (be) will (have, -ling, -ling \[ly\]).
