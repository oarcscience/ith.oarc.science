σιωπάω  
siōpaō  
*see-o-pah‘-o*  
From σιωπη siōpē (*silence*, that is, a *hush*; properly *muteness*,
that is, *involuntary* stillness, or *inability* ot speak; and thus
differing from [4602](g4602) which is rather a voluntary *refusal* or
*indisposition* to speak, although the terms are often used
synonymously); to *be* *dumb* (but not *deaf* also, like [2974](g2974)
properly); figuratively to *be* *calm* (as *quiet* water): - dumb,
(hold) peace.
