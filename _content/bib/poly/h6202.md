H6202  
ערף  
עָרַף ‎ ‛âraph  
*aw-raf‘*  
A primitive root (rather identical with [6201](h6201) through the idea
of *sloping*); properly to *bend* downward; but used only as a
denominative from [6203](h6203) to *break* *the* *neck*; hence
(figuratively) to *destroy: -* that is beheaded, break down, break (cut
off, strike off) neck.
