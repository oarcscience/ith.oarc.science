G4766  
στρώννυμι  
strōnnumi  
*strone‘-noo-mee*  
Or a simpler form στρωννύω strōnnuō *strone‘-noo‘-o* , prolonged from a
still simpler form στρόω stroō *stro‘-o* (used only as an alternate in
certain tenses; probably akin to [4731](g4731) through the idea of
*positing*); to “strew”, that is, *spread* (as a carpet or couch): -
make bed, furnish, spread, strew.
