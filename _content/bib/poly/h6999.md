קטר  
קָטַר ‎ qâṭar  
*kaw-tar‘*  
A primitive root (rather identical with [7000](h7000) through the idea
of fumigation in a *close* place and perhaps thus *driving* out the
occupants); to *smoke*, that is, turn into fragrance by fire (especially
as an act of worship): - burn (incense, sacrifice) (upon), (altar for)
incense, kindle, offer (incense, a sacrifice).
