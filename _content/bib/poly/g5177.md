G5177  
τυγχάνω  
tugchanō  
*toong-khan‘-o*  
Probably for an obsolete τύχω tuchō (for which the middle voice of
another alternate τεύχω teuchō \[to *make* *ready* or *bring* *to*
*pass*\] is used in certain tenses; akin to the base of [5088](g5088)
through the idea of *effecting*; properly to *affect*; or (specifically)
to *hit* or *light* *upon* (as a mark to be reached), that is,
(transitively) to *attain* or *secure* an object or end, or
(intransitively) to *happen* (as if *meeting* with); but in the latter
application only impersonally (with [1487](g1487) , that is,
*perchance*; or (present participle) as adjective *usual* (as if
commonly *met* *with*, with [3756](g3756) *extraordinary*), neuter (as
adverb) *perhaps*; or (with another verb) as adverb by *accident* (*as*
*it* *were*): - be, chance, enjoy, little, obtain, X refresh . . . self,
+ special. Compare [5180](g5180)
