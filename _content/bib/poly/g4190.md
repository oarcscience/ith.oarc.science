πονηρός  
ponēros  
*pon-ay-ros‘*  
From a derivative of [4192](g4192) *hurtful*, that is, *evil* (properly
in effect or influence, and thus differing from [2556](g2556) which
refers rather to *essential* character, as well as from [4550](g4550)
which indicates *degeneracy* from original virtue); figuratively
*calamitous*; also (passively) *ill*, that is, *diseased*; but
especially (morally) *culpable*, that is, *derelict*, *vicious*,
*facinorous*; neuter (singular) *mischief*, *malice*, or (plural)
*guilt*; masculine (singular) the *devil*, or (plural) *sinners*: - bad,
evil, grievous, harm, lewd, malicious, wicked (-ness). See also
