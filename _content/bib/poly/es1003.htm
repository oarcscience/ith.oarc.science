<p align="center"><a href="../apo/es1003">Apo</a></p><P>1&nbsp;Now when Darius reigned, he made a great feast unto all his subjects, and unto all his household, and unto all the princes of Media and Persia, </P>
<P>2&nbsp;And to all the governors and captains and lieutenants that were under him, from India unto Ethiopia, of an hundred twenty and seven provinces. </P>
<P>3&nbsp;And when they had eaten and drunken, and being satisfied were gone home, then Darius the king went into his bedchamber, and slept, and soon after awaked. </P>
<P>4&nbsp;Then three young men, that were of the guard that kept the king's body, spake one to another; </P>
<P>5&nbsp;Let every one of us speak a sentence: he that shall overcome, and whose sentence shall seem wiser than the others, unto him shall the king Darius give great gifts, and great things in token of victory: </P>
<P>6&nbsp;As, to be clothed in purple, to drink in gold, and to sleep upon gold, and a chariot with bridles of gold, and an headtire of fine linen, and a chain about his neck: </P>
<P>7&nbsp;And he shall sit next to Darius because of his wisdom, and shall be called Darius his cousin. </P>
<P>8&nbsp;And then every one wrote his sentence, sealed it, and laid it under king Darius his pillow; </P>
<P>9&nbsp;And said that, when the king is risen, some will give him the writings; and of whose side the king and the three princes of Persia shall judge that his sentence is the wisest, to him shall the victory be given, as was appointed. </P>
<P>10&nbsp;The first wrote, Wine is the strongest. </P>
<P>11&nbsp;The second wrote, The king is strongest. </P>
<P>12&nbsp;The third wrote, Women are strongest: but above all things Truth beareth away the victory. </P>
<P>13&nbsp;Now when the king was risen up, they took their writings, and delivered them unto him, and so he read them: </P>
<P>14&nbsp;And sending forth he called all the princes of Persia and Media, and the governors, and the captains, and the lieutenants, and the chief officers; </P>
<P>15&nbsp;And sat him down in the royal seat of judgment; and the writings were read before them. </P>
<P>16&nbsp;And he said, Call the young men, and they shall declare their own sentences. So they were called, and came in. </P>
<P>17&nbsp;And he said unto them, Declare unto us your mind concerning the writings. Then began the first, who had spoken of the strength of wine; </P>
<P>18&nbsp;And he said thus, O ye men, how exceeding strong is wine! it causeth all men to err that drink it: </P>
<P>19&nbsp;It maketh the mind of the king and of the fatherless child to be all one; of the bondman and of the freeman, of the poor man and of the rich: </P>
<P>20&nbsp;It turneth also every thought into jollity and mirth, so that a man remembereth neither sorrow nor debt: </P>
<P>21&nbsp;And it maketh every heart rich, so that a man remembereth neither king nor governor; and it maketh to speak all things by talents: </P>
<P>22&nbsp;And when they are in their cups, they forget their love both to friends and brethren, and a little after draw out swords: </P>
<P>23&nbsp;But when they are from the wine, they remember not what they have done. </P>
<P>24&nbsp;O ye men, is not wine the strongest, that enforceth to do thus? And when he had so spoken, he held his peace. </P>

<P>2&nbsp;καὶ πᾶσιν τοῖς σατράπαις καὶ στρατηγοῖς καὶ τοπάρχαις τοῖς ὑπ᾽ αὐτὸν ἀπὸ τῆς Ἰνδικῆς μέχρι τῆς Αἰθιοπίας ἐν ταῖς ἑκατὸν εἴκοσι ἑπτὰ σατραπείαις </P>
<P>3&nbsp;καὶ ἐφάγοσαν καὶ ἐπίοσαν καὶ ἐμπλησθέντες ἀνέλυσαν ὁ δὲ Δαρεῖος ὁ βασιλεὺς ἀνέλυσεν εἰς τὸν κοιτῶνα καὶ ἐκοιμήθη καὶ ἔξυπνος ἐγένετο </P>
<P>4&nbsp;τότε οἱ τρεῖς νεανίσκοι οἱ σωματοφύλακες οἱ φυλάσσοντες τὸ σῶμα τοῦ βασιλέως εἶπαν ἕτερος πρὸς τὸν ἕτερον </P>
<P>5&nbsp;εἴπωμεν ἕκαστος ἡμῶν ἕνα λόγον ὃς ὑπερισχύσει καὶ οὗ ἂν φανῇ τὸ ῥῆμα αὐτοῦ σοφώτερον τοῦ ἑτέρου δώσει αὐτῷ Δαρεῖος ὁ βασιλεὺς δωρεὰς μεγάλας καὶ ἐπινίκια μεγάλα </P>

<P>16&nbsp;καὶ εἶπαν αὐτοῖς ἀπαγγείλατε ἡμῖν περὶ τῶν γεγραμμένων </P>
<P>17&nbsp;καὶ ἤρξατο ὁ πρῶτος ὁ εἴπας περὶ τῆς ἰσχύος τοῦ οἴνου καὶ ἔφη οὕτως </P>
<P>18&nbsp;ἄνδρες πῶς ὑπερισχύει ὁ οἶνος πάντας τοὺς ἀνθρώπους τοὺς πίνοντας αὐτὸν πλανᾷ τὴν διάνοιαν </P>

<P>20&nbsp;καὶ πᾶσαν διάνοιαν μεταστρέφει εἰς εὐωχίαν καὶ εὐφροσύνην καὶ οὐ μέμνηται πᾶσαν λύπην καὶ πᾶν ὀφείλημα </P>
<P>21&nbsp;καὶ πάσας καρδίας ποιεῖ πλουσίας καὶ οὐ μέμνηται βασιλέα οὐδὲ σατράπην καὶ πάντα διὰ ταλάντων ποιεῖ λαλεῖν </P>

<P>23&nbsp;καὶ ὅταν ἀπὸ τοῦ οἴνου γενηθῶσιν οὐ μέμνηται ἃ ἔπραξαν </P>
<P>24&nbsp;ὦ ἄνδρες οὐχ ὑπερισχύει ὁ οἶνος ὅτι οὕτως ἀναγκάζει ποιεῖν καὶ ἐσίγησεν οὕτως εἴπας </P>
