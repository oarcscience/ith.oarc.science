### Noah's Sons led astray by Evil Spirits; Noah's Prayer; Mastêmâ; Death of Noah (x. 1-17; cf. Gen. ix. 28).

X. <span id="fr_346"></span>[1](#fn_346) And in the third week of this
jubilee the unclean demons <span id="fr_347"></span>[2](#fn_347) began
to lead astray †the children of† <span id="fr_348"></span>[3](#fn_348)
the sons of Noah; and to make to err and destroy them. 2. And the sons
of Noah came to Noah their father, and they told him concerning the
demons which were, leading astray and blinding and slaying his sons'
sons. 3. And he prayed before the Lord his God, and said:

God of the spirits of all flesh, <span id="fr_349"></span>[4](#fn_349)
who hast shown mercy unto me,  
And hast saved me and my sons from the waters of the flood,  
And hast not caused me to perish as Thou didst the sons of
perdition; <span id="fr_350"></span>[5](#fn_350)

For Thy grace hath been great towards me,  
And great hath been Thy mercy to my soul;  
Let Thy grace be lift up upon my sons,  
And let not wicked spirits rule over them  
Lest they should destroy them from the earth.

\[paragraph continues\] 4. But do Thou bless me and my sons, that we may
increase and multiply and replenish the earth. 5. And Thou knowest how
Thy Watchers, the fathers of these spirits, acted in my day: and as for
these spirits which are living, imprison them and hold them fast in the
place of condemnation, and let them not bring destruction on the sons of
thy servant, my God; for these are malignant, and created in

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

order to destroy. 6. And let them not rule over the spirits of the
living; for Thou alone canst exercise dominion over them. And let them
not have power over the sons of the righteous from henceforth and for
evermore." 7. And the Lord our God bade us to bind all. <span
id="fr_351"></span>[1](#fn_351) 8. And the chief of the spirits,
Mastêmâ, <span id="fr_352"></span>[2](#fn_352) came and said: "Lord,
Creator, let some of them remain before me, and let them hearken to my
voice, and do all that I shall say unto them; for if some of them are
not left to me, I shall not be able to execute the power of my will on
the sons of men; for these are for corruption and leading astray before
my judgment, for great is the wickedness of the sons of men." 9. And He
said: "Let the tenth part of them remain before him, and let nine parts
descend into the place of condemnation." <span
id="fr_353"></span>[3](#fn_353) 10. And one of us <span
id="fr_354"></span>[4](#fn_354) He commanded that we should teach Noah
all their medicines; for He knew that they would not walk in
uprightness, nor strive in righteousness. 11. And we did according to
all His words: all the malignant evil ones we bound in the place of
condemnation, and a tenth part of them we left that they might be
subject before Satan <span id="fr_355"></span>[5](#fn_355) on the earth.
12. And we explained to Noah all the medicines of their diseases,
together with their seductions, how he might heal them with herbs of the
earth. 13. And Noah wrote down all things in a book as we instructed him
concerning every kind of medicine. Thus the evil

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

spirits were precluded from (hurting) the sons of Noah. 14. And he gave
all that he had written to Shem, his eldest son; for he loved him
exceedingly above all his sons. 15. And Noah slept with his fathers, and
was buried on Mount Lûbâr in the land of Ararat. 16. Nine hundred and
fifty years he completed in his life, nineteen jubilees and two

weeks and five years. 17. And in his life on earth he excelled the
children of men save Enoch because of the righteousness, wherein he was
perfect. For Enoch's office was ordained for a testimony to the
generations of the world, <span id="fr_356"></span>[1](jub25.htm#fn_356)
so that he should recount all the deeds of generation unto generation,
till the day of judgment.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_346"></span>[79:1](jub24.htm#fr_346) Here we have (in x.
1-15) another fragment of the lost Apocalypse of Noah (as in vii.
20-39). The Hebrew original of 1-2 and 9-14 of this section is extant.

<span id="fn_347"></span>[79:2](jub24.htm#fr_347) *i. e.* the spirits
which issued from the children of the angels and the daughters of men.

<span id="fn_348"></span>[79:3](jub24.htm#fr_348) Omit *the children
of*.

<span id="fn_349"></span>[79:4](jub24.htm#fr_349) Cf. Num. xvi. 22,
xxvii. 16.

<span id="fn_350"></span>[79:5](jub24.htm#fr_350) Cf. 2 Thess. ii. 3.

<span id="fn_351"></span>[80:1](jub24.htm#fr_351) Cf. 1 Enoch x. 4, 12.

<span id="fn_352"></span>[80:2](jub24.htm#fr_352) The word apparently =
*maṣtîm* (Hif. part of *Ṣâṭam*), "to be adverse," "inimical"; the Heb.
noun maṣṭēmâ = "animosity," in Hos. ix. 7, 8. Thus the word = Satan
("adversary"). As a proper name it is practically confined to the
Jubilees-literature. The evil spirits under the guidance of Mastêmâ
tempt, accuse and destroy men.

<span id="fn_353"></span>[80:3](jub24.htm#fr_353) Only one-tenth are
permitted to act freely against mankind till the Day of judgment; but in
1 Enoch xv.-xvi. all the demons are allowed to do this.

<span id="fn_354"></span>[80:4](jub24.htm#fr_354) The angel Raphael is
referred to, as is shown by the Hebrew Book of Noah. For Raphael in this
connection cf. Tobit iii. 17, xii. 14, 15.

<span id="fn_355"></span>[80:5](jub24.htm#fr_355) Thus Satan and Mastêmâ
are identical.
