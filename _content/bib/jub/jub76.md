### Joseph interprets the Dreams of the Chief Butler and the Chief Baker (xxxix. 14-18; cf. Gen. xl.).,

14\. And he remained there two years. <span
id="fr_848"></span>[2](#fn_840) And in those days Pharaoh, king of
Egypt, was wroth against his two eunuchs, against the chief butler and
against the chief baker, and he put them in ward in the house of the
chief cook, <span id="fr_849"></span>[3](#fn_841) in the prison where
Joseph was kept. 15. And the chief of the prison guards appointed Joseph
to serve them; and he served before them. 16. And they both dreamed a
dream, the chief butler and the chief baker, and they told it to Joseph.
17. And as he interpreted to them so it befell them, and Pharaoh
restored the chief butler to his office, and the (chief) baker he slew,
as Joseph had interpreted to them. 18. But the chief butler forgot
Joseph in the prison, although he had informed him what would befall
him, and did not remember to inform Pharaoh how Joseph had told him for
he forgot.
