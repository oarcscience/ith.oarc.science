 VII. And in the seventh week in the first year thereof, in this jubilee, Noah planted vines on the mountain on which the ark had rested, named L&ucirc;b&acirc;r,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_243"></A><A HREF="#fn_243"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> one of the Ararat Mountains, and they <TABLE ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="10%" CELLPADDING=8>

 into a vessel, and kept it until the fifth year, until the first day, on the new moon of the first month. 3. And he celebrated with joy the day of this feast, and he made a burnt sacrifice unto the Lord, one young ox and one ram, and seven sheep, each a year old, and a kid of the goats, that he might make atonement thereby for himself and his sons.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_245"></A><A HREF="#fn_245"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> 4. And he prepared the kid first, and placed some of its blood on the flesh that was on the altar which he had made, and all the</p>

<p>fat he laid on the altar where he made the burnt sacrifice, and the ox and the ram and the sheep, and he laid all their flesh upon the altar. 5. And he placed all their offerings mingled with oil upon it, and afterwards he sprinkled wine on the fire which he had previously made on the altar, and he placed incense on the altar and caused a sweet savour to ascend acceptable before the Lord his God. 6. And he rejoiced and drank of this wine, he and his children with joy. 7. And it was evening, and he went into his tent, and being drunken he lay down and slept, and was uncovered in his tent as he slept.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_246"></A><A HREF="#fn_246"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> 8. And Ham saw Noah his father naked, and went forth and told his two brethren without. 9. And Shem took his garment and arose, he and Japheth, and they placed the garment on their shoulders and went backward and covered the shame of their father, and their faces were backward.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_247"></A><A HREF="#fn_247"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> 10. And Noah awoke from his sleep and knew all that his younger son had done unto him, and he cursed his son and said: "Cursed be Canaan; an enslaved servant shall he be unto his brethren."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_248"></A><A HREF="#fn_248"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> 11. And he blessed Shem, and said: "Blessed be the Lord God of Shem, and Canaan shall be his servant. 12. God shall enlarge Japheth, and God shall dwell in the dwelling of Shem, and Canaan shall be his servant."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_249"></A><A HREF="#fn_249"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> 13. And Ham knew that his father had cursed his younger son, and he was displeased that he had cursed his son, and he parted from his father, he and his sons with him, Cush and Mizraim and Put and Canaan.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_250"></A><A HREF="#fn_250"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> 14. And he built for himself a city and called its name after the name of his wife N&ecirc;&#146;&ecirc;l&acirc;tam&acirc;&#146;&ucirc;k. 15. And Japheth saw it, and became envious of his brother, and he too built for himself a city, and he called its name after the name of his wife &#146;Ad&acirc;tan&ecirc;s&ecirc;s. 16. And Shem dwelt with his father Noah, and he built a city close to his father on the mountain, and he too called its name</p>

For owing to these three things&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_256"></A><A HREF="#fn_256"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> came the flood upon the earth, namely, owing to the fornication wherein the Watchers against the law of their ordinances went a whoring after the daughters of men, and took themselves wives of all which they chose:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_257"></A><A HREF="#fn_257"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> and they made the beginning of uncleanness. 22.

And after this they sinned against the beasts and birds, and all that moveth and walketh on the earth:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_263"></A><A HREF="#fn_263"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and much blood was shed on the earth, and every imagination and desire of men imagined vanity and evil continually.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_264"></A><A HREF="#fn_264"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> 25. And the Lord destroyed everything from off the face of the earth;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_265"></A><A HREF="#fn_265"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> because of the wickedness of their deeds, and because of the blood which they had shed in the midst of the earth He destroyed everything. 26.

For I see, and behold the demons have begun (their) seductions against you and against your children, and now I fear on your behalf, that after my death ye will shed the blood of men upon the earth, and that ye, too, will be destroyed from the face of the earth.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_267"></A><A HREF="#fn_267"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> 28.

And ye shall not be like him who eateth with blood, but guard yourselves that none may eat blood before you:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_271"></A><A HREF="#fn_271"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> cover the blood, for thus have I been commanded to testify to you and your children, together with all flesh. 32. And suffer not the soul to be eaten with the flesh, that your blood, which is your life, may not be required at the hand of any flesh that sheddeth (it) on the earth.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_272"></A><A HREF="#fn_272"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> 33. For the earth will not be clean from the blood which hath been shed upon it;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_273"></A><A HREF="#fn_273"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> for (only) through the blood of him that shed it&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_274"></A><A HREF="#fn_274"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> will the earth be purified throughout all its generations. 34.

And behold, ye will go and build for yourselves cities, and plant in them all the plants that are upon the earth, and moreover all fruit-bearing trees. 36.
