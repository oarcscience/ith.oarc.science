<p>XXXI. And on the new moon of the month Jacob spake to all the people of his house, saying: "Purify yourselves and change your garments, and let us arise and go up to Bethel, where I vowed a vow to Him on the day when I fled from the face of Esau my brother, because He hath been with me and brought me into this land in peace, and put ye away the strange gods that are among you." 2. And they gave up the strange gods and that which was in their ears and which was &#8224;on their necks,&#8224;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_720"></A><A HREF="#fn_717"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and the idols which Rachel stole from Laban her brother she gave wholly to Jacob. And he burnt and brake them to pieces and destroyed them, and hid them under an oak which is in the land  of Shechem. 3. And he went up on the new moon of the seventh month to Bethel. And he built an altar at the place where he had slept, and he set up a pillar there, and he sent word to his father Isaac to come to him to his sacrifice, and to his mother Rebecca.</p>

And Isaac said: "Let my son Jacob come, and let me see him before I die."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_721"></A><A HREF="#fn_718"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> 5. And Jacob went to his father Isaac and to his mother Rebecca, to the house of his father Abraham,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_722"></A><A HREF="#fn_719"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and he took two of his sons with him, Levi and Judah, and he came to his father Isaac and to his mother Rebecca.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_723"></A><A HREF="#fn_720"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> 6. And Rebecca came forth from the tower to the front of it to kiss Jacob and embrace him; for her spirit had revived when she heard: "Behold Jacob thy son hath come"; and she kissed him. 7. And she saw his two sons, and she recognised them, and said unto him: "Are these thy sons, my son?" and she embraced them and kissed them, and blessed them, saying: "In you shall the seed of Abraham become illustrious, and ye will prove a blessing on the earth." 8. And Jacob went in to Isaac his father, to the chamber where he lay, and his two sons were with him, and he took the hand of his father, and stooping down he kissed him, and Isaac clung to the neck of Jacob his son, and wept upon his neck. 9. And the darkness left the eyes of Isaac, and he saw the two sons of Jacob, Levi and Judah, and he said: "Are these thy sons, my son? for they are like thee." 10. And he said unto him that they were truly his sons: "And thou hast truly seen that they are truly my sons." 11. And they came near to him, and he turned and kissed them and embraced them both together. 12. And the spirit of prophecy came down into his mouth, and he took Levi by his right hand and Judah by his left. 13. And he turned to Levi first,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_724"></A><A HREF="#fn_721"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> and began to bless him first, and said unto him:, 'May the God of all, the very Lord of all the ages, bless thee and thy children throughout all the ages. 14. And may the Lord give to thee and to thy seed &#8224;greatness and great</p>

<p>They will speak the word of the Lord in righteousness,<br> And they will judge all His judgments in righteousness.<br> And they will declare My ways to Jacob<br> And My paths to Israel.<br> The blessing of the Lord will be given in their mouths&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_727"></A><A HREF="#fn_724"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A><br> To bless all the seed of the beloved.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_728"></A><A HREF="#fn_725"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A><br> 16.

And to Judah he said:<br> May the Lord give thee strength and power<br> To tread down all that hate thee;<br> A prince shalt thou be, thou and one of thy sons,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_731"></A><A HREF="#fn_728"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> over the sons of Jacob;<br> May thy name and the name of thy sons&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_732"></A><A HREF="#fn_729"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> go forth and traverse every land and region.<br> Then will the Gentiles fear before thy face,<br> And all the nations will quake<br> [And all the peoples will quake].&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_733"></A><A HREF="#fn_730"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A><br> 19.

<p>21. And turning he kissed him again and embraced him, and rejoiced greatly; for he had seen the sons of Jacob his son in very truth. 22. And he went forth from between his feet and fell down and worshipped him. And he blessed them. And (Jacob) rested there with Isaac his father that night, and they ate and drank with joy. 23. And he made the two sons of Jacob sleep, the one on his right hand and the other on his left and it was counted to him for righteousness. 24. And Jacob told his father everything during the night, how the Lord had shown him great mercy, and how He had prospered (him in) all his ways, and protected him from all evil. 25. And Isaac blessed the God of his father Abraham, who had not withdrawn His mercy and His righteousness from the sons of His servant Isaac.</p>
