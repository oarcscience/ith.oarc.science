 exodus of the children of Israel out of Egypt, in the third month,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_34"></A><A HREF="#fn_34"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> on the sixteenth day of the month, that God spake to Moses, saying: "Come up to Me on the Mount, and I will give thee two tables of stone of the law and of the commandment, which I have written, that thou mayst teach them."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_35"></A><A HREF="#fn_35"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> 2.

<p>the seventh day out of the midst of the cloud, and the appearance of the glory of the Lord was like a flaming fire on the top of the Mount. 4. And Moses was on the Mount forty days and forty nights, and God taught him the earlier and the later history&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_36"></A><A HREF="#fn_36"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of the division of all the days of the law and of the testimony. 5. And He said: "Incline thine heart to every word which I shall speak to thee on this Mount, and write them&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_37"></A><A HREF="#fn_37"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> in a book in order that their generations may see how I have not forsaken them for all the evil which they have wrought in transgressing the covenant which I establish between Me and thee for their generations this day on Mount Sinai. 6. And thus it will come to pass when all these things come upon them,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_38"></A><A HREF="#fn_38"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> that they will recognize that I am more righteous than they in all their judgments and in all their actions, and they will recognize that I have been truly with them. 7. And do thou write for thyself&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_39"></A><A HREF="#fn_39"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> all these words which I declare unto thee this day, for I know their rebellion and their stiff neck,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_40"></A><A HREF="#fn_40"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> before I bring them into the land of which I sware to their fathers, to Abraham and to Isaac and to Jacob, saying: "Unto your seed will I give a land flowing with milk and honey. 8. And they will eat and be satisfied, and they will turn to strange gods, to (gods) which cannot deliver them from aught of their tribulation: "and this witness shall be heard for a witness against them.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_41"></A><A HREF="#fn_41"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> 9. For they will forget all My commandments, (even) all that I command them, and they will walk after the Gentiles, and after their uncleanness, and after their shame, and will serve their gods, and these will prove unto them an offence and a tribulation and an affliction and a snare.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_42"></A><A HREF="#fn_42"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> 10.

<p>many will perish and they will be taken captive,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_43"></A><A HREF="#fn_43"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and will fall into the hands of the enemy, because they have forsaken My ordinances and My commandments, and the festivals of My covenant, and My sabbaths, and My holy place&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_44"></A><A HREF="#fn_44"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> which I have hallowed for Myself in their midst, and My tabernacle,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_45"></A><A HREF="#fn_45"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and My sanctuary, which I have hallowed for Myself in the midst of the land, that I should set My name upon it, and that it should dwell (there). 11. And they&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_46"></A><A HREF="#fn_46"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> will make to themselves high places and groves and graven images,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_47"></A><A HREF="#fn_47"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> and they will worship, each his own (graven image), so as to go astray, and they will sacrifice their children to demons,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_48"></A><A HREF="#fn_48"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> and to all the works of the error of their hearts. 12. And I will send witnesses unto them, that I may witness against them, but they will not hear,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_49"></A><A HREF="#fn_49"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> and will slay&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_50"></A><A HREF="#fn_50"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> the witnesses also, and they will persecute those who seek the law, and they will abrogate and change everything so as to work evil before My eyes. 13. And I shall hide My face from them, and I shall deliver them into the hand of the Gentiles for captivity, and for a prey, and for devouring,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_51"></A><A HREF="#fn_51"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> and I shall remove them from the midst of the land, and I shall scatter&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_52"></A><A HREF="#fn_52"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A> them amongst the Gentiles. 14. And they will forget all My law and all My commandments and all My judgments, and will go astray as to new moons, and sabbaths, and festivals, and jubilees, and ordinances. 15. And after this they will turn to Me&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_53"></A><A HREF="#fn_53"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A> from amongst the Gentiles with all their heart and with all their soul and with all their strength, and I shall gather them from amongst all the Gentiles,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_54"></A><A HREF="#fn_54"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A> and they will seek Me, so that I shall be found of them, when they seek Me</p>

And I shall build My sanctuary&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_59"></A><A HREF="#fn_59"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> in their midst, and I shall dwell with them, and I shall be their God and they will be My people&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_60"></A><A HREF="#fn_60"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> in truth and righteousness. 18. And I shall not forsake them nor fail them;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_61"></A><A HREF="#fn_61"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> for I am the Lord their God." 19. And Moses fell on his face and prayed and said, "O Lord my God, do not forsake Thy people and Thy inheritance,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_62"></A><A HREF="#fn_62"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> so that they should wander in the error of their hearts, and do not deliver them into the hands of their enemies, the Gentiles, lest they should rule over them and cause them to sin against Thee. 20. Let Thy mercy, O Lord, be lifted up upon Thy people, and create in them an upright spirit,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_63"></A><A HREF="#fn_63"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> and let not the spirit of Beliar&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_64"></A><A HREF="#fn_64"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A> rule over them to accuse them before Thee, and to ensnare them from all the paths of righteousness, so that they may perish from before Thy face. 21. But they are Thy people and Thy inheritance, which Thou hast delivered with Thy great power&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_65"></A><A HREF="#fn_65"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A> from the hands of the Egyptians: create in them a clean heart and a holy Spirit,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_66"></A><A HREF="#fn_66"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A> and let them not be ensnared in their sins from henceforth until eternity." 22. And the Lord said unto Moses: "I know their contrariness and their thoughts and their stiffneckedness,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_67"></A><A HREF="#fn_67"><FONT SIZE="1">13</FONT></A> and they will not be obedient till they confess their own sin and the sin of their</p>

And after this they will turn to Me in all uprightness and with all (their) heart and with all (their) soul, and I shall circumcise the foreskin of their heart&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_69"></A><A HREF="#fn_69"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and the foreskin of the heart of their seed, and I shall create in them a holy spirit, and I shall cleanse them so that they shall not turn away from Me from that day unto eternity. 24.
