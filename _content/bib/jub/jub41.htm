 forty-second jubilee, Abraham returned and dwelt opposite Hebron, that is Kirjath Arba, two weeks of years. 2. And in the first year of the &#8224;third&#8224;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_518"></A><A HREF="#fn_517"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> week of this jubilee the days of the life of Sarah were accomplished, and she died in Hebron. 3. And Abraham went to mourn over her and bury her, and we tried him [to see] if his spirit were patient and he were not indignant in the words of his mouth; and he was found patient in this, and was not disturbed.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_519"></A><A HREF="#fn_518"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> 4.
