### Jacob's Journey to Bethel and Hebron. Isaac blesses Levi and Judah (xxxi. 1-25; cf. Gen. xxxv.).

XXXI\. And on the new moon of the month Jacob spake to all the people of
his house, saying: "Purify yourselves and change your garments, and let
us arise and go up to Bethel, where I vowed a vow to Him on the day when
I fled from the face of Esau my brother, because He hath been with me
and brought me into this land in peace, and put ye away the strange gods
that are among you." 2. And they gave up the strange gods and that which
was in their ears and which was †on their necks,† <span
id="fr_720"></span>[3](#fn_717) and the idols which Rachel stole from
Laban her brother she gave wholly to Jacob. And he burnt and brake them
to pieces and destroyed them, and hid them under an oak which is in the
land of Shechem. 3. And he went up on the new moon of the seventh month
to Bethel. And he built an altar at the place where he had slept, and he
set up a pillar there, and he sent word to his father Isaac to come to
him to his sacrifice, and to his mother Rebecca.

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

\[paragraph continues\] 4. And Isaac said: "Let my son Jacob come, and
let me see him before I die." <span id="fr_721"></span>[1](#fn_718) 5.
And Jacob went to his father Isaac and to his mother Rebecca, to the
house of his father Abraham, <span id="fr_722"></span>[2](#fn_719) and
he took two of his sons with him, Levi and Judah, and he came to his
father Isaac and to his mother Rebecca. <span
id="fr_723"></span>[3](#fn_720) 6. And Rebecca came forth from the tower
to the front of it to kiss Jacob and embrace him; for her spirit had
revived when she heard: "Behold Jacob thy son hath come"; and she kissed
him. 7. And she saw his two sons, and she recognised them, and said unto
him: "Are these thy sons, my son?" and she embraced them and kissed
them, and blessed them, saying: "In you shall the seed of Abraham become
illustrious, and ye will prove a blessing on the earth." 8. And Jacob
went in to Isaac his father, to the chamber where he lay, and his two
sons were with him, and he took the hand of his father, and stooping
down he kissed him, and Isaac clung to the neck of Jacob his son, and
wept upon his neck. 9. And the darkness left the eyes of Isaac, and he
saw the two sons of Jacob, Levi and Judah, and he said: "Are these thy
sons, my son? for they are like thee." 10. And he said unto him that
they were truly his sons: "And thou hast truly seen that they are truly
my sons." 11. And they came near to him, and he turned and kissed them
and embraced them both together. 12. And the spirit of prophecy came
down into his mouth, and he took Levi by his right hand and Judah by his
left. 13. And he turned to Levi first, <span
id="fr_724"></span>[4](#fn_721) and began to bless him first, and said
unto him:, 'May the God of all, the very Lord of all the ages, bless
thee and thy children throughout all the ages. 14. And may the Lord give
to thee and to thy seed †greatness and great

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

glory†, and cause thee and thy seed, from among all flesh, to approach
Him to serve in His sanctuary as the angels of the presence and as the
holy ones. <span id="fr_725"></span>[1](#fn_722) (Even) as they, will
the seed of thy sons be for glory and greatness and holiness, and may He
make them great unto all the ages. 15. And they will be princes and
judges, and chiefs <span id="fr_726"></span>[2](#fn_723) of all the seed
of the sons of Jacob;

They will speak the word of the Lord in righteousness,  
And they will judge all His judgments in righteousness.  
And they will declare My ways to Jacob  
And My paths to Israel.  
The blessing of the Lord will be given in their mouths <span
id="fr_727"></span>[3](#fn_724)  
To bless all the seed of the beloved. <span
id="fr_728"></span>[4](#fn_725)  
16. Thy mother hath called thy name Levi,  
And justly hath she called thy name;  
Thou wilt be joined <span id="fr_729"></span>[5](#fn_726) to the Lord  
And be the companion of all the sons of Jacob;  
Let His table be thine, <span id="fr_730"></span>[6](#fn_727)  
And do thou and thy sons eat thereof;  
And may thy table be full unto all generations,  
And thy food fail not unto all the ages.  
17. And let all who hate thee fall down before thee,  
And let all thy adversaries be rooted out and perish;  
And blessed be he that blesseth thee,  
And cursed be every nation that curseth thee. <span id="page_160">p.
160</span>  
18. And to Judah he said:  
May the Lord give thee strength and power  
To tread down all that hate thee;  
A prince shalt thou be, thou and one of thy sons, <span
id="fr_731"></span>[1](#fn_728) over the sons of Jacob;  
May thy name and the name of thy sons <span
id="fr_732"></span>[2](#fn_729) go forth and traverse every land and
region.  
Then will the Gentiles fear before thy face,  
And all the nations will quake  
\[And all the peoples will quake\]. <span
id="fr_733"></span>[3](#fn_730)  
19. In thee shall be the help of Jacob,  
And in thee be found the salvation of Israel.  
20. And when thou sittest on the throne of the honour of thy
righteousness,  
There will be great peace for all the seed of the sons of the
beloved, <span id="fr_734"></span>[4](#fn_731)  
And blessed will he be that blesseth thee;  
And all that hate thee and afflict thee and curse thee  
Shall be rooted out and destroyed from the earth and accursed."

21\. And turning he kissed him again and embraced him, and rejoiced
greatly; for he had seen the sons of Jacob his son in very truth. 22.
And he went forth from between his feet and fell down and worshipped
him. And he blessed them. And (Jacob) rested there with Isaac his father
that night, and they ate and drank with joy. 23. And he made the two
sons of Jacob sleep, the one on his right hand and the other on his left
and it was counted to him for righteousness. 24. And Jacob told his
father everything during the night, how the Lord had shown him great
mercy, and how He had prospered (him in) all his ways, and protected him
from all evil. 25. And Isaac blessed the God of his father Abraham, who
had not withdrawn His mercy and His righteousness from the sons of His
servant Isaac.
