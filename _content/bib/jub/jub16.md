### Cain and Abel (iv. 1-12; cf. Gen. iv.).

IV\. And in the third week in the second jubilee

|            |
|------------|
| 64-70 A.M. |

she gave birth to Cain, and in the fourth she gave birth

|            |
|------------|
| 71-77 A.M. |

to Abel, and in the fifth she gave birth to her daughter

|            |
|------------|
| 78-84 A.M. |

’Âwân. <span id="fr_144"></span>[3](#fn_144) 2. And in the first (year)
of the third jubilee,

|             |
|-------------|
| 99-105 A.M. |

Cain slew Abel because (God) accepted the sacrifice of Abel, and did not
accept the offering of Cain. 3. And he slew him in the field: and his
blood cried from the ground to heaven, complaining because he had slain
him. <span id="fr_145"></span>[4](#fn_145) 4. And the Lord reproved Cain
because of Abel, because he had slain him, and he made him a fugitive on
the earth because of the blood of his brother, and he cursed him upon
the earth. <span id="fr_146"></span>[5](#fn_146)

5\. And on this account it is written on the heavenly tables, "Cursed is
he who smiteth his neighbour treacherously, and let all who have seen
and heard say, So be it; and the man who hath seen and not declared
(it), let him be accursed as the other." <span
id="fr_147"></span>[6](#fn_147). And for this reason we announce when we
come before the Lord our God all the sin which is committed in heaven
and on earth, and in light and in darkness, and everywhere. 7. And Adam
and his wife mourned for Abel four weeks of years, and in the fourth
year

| (99-127) 130 A.M. |

of the fifth week they became joyful, and Adam knew

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

his wife again, and she bare him a son, and he <span
id="fr_148"></span>[1](#fn_148) called his name Seth; for he said "God
hath raised up a second seed unto us on the earth instead of Abel; for
Cain slew him." <span id="fr_149"></span>[2](#fn_149) 8. And in the
sixth week he

|              |
|--------------|
| 134-140 A.M. |

begat his daughter ’Azûrâ. 9. And Cain took ’Âwân his sister to be his
wife and she bare him Enoch <span id="fr_150"></span>[3](#fn_150) at

|              |
|--------------|
| 190-196 A.M. |

the close of the fourth jubilee. And in the first year of the first week
of the fifth jubilee, houses were built

|          |
|----------|
| 197 A.M. |

on the earth, and Cain built a city, and called its name after the name
of his son Enoch. 10. And Adam knew Eve his wife and she bare yet nine
sons. <span id="fr_151"></span>[4](#fn_151)

|              |
|--------------|
| 225-231 A.M. |

11\. And in the fifth week of the fifth jubilee Seth took ’Azûrâ his
sister to be his wife, and in the fourth

|          |
|----------|
| 235 A.M. |

(year of the sixth week) she bare him Enos. <span
id="fr_152"></span>[5](#fn_152) 12. He <span
id="fr_153"></span>[6](#fn_153) began to call on the name of the Lord on
the earth.
