forty-second jubilee, Abraham returned and dwelt opposite Hebron, that
is Kirjath Arba, two weeks of years. 2. And in the first year of the
†third† <span id="fr_518"></span>[1](#fn_517) week of this jubilee the
days of the life of Sarah were accomplished, and she died in Hebron. 3.
And Abraham went to mourn over her and bury her, and we tried him \[to
see\] if his spirit were patient and he were not indignant in the words
of his mouth; and he was found patient in this, and was not
disturbed. <span id="fr_519"></span>[2](#fn_518) 4. For in patience of
spirit he conversed with the children of Heth, to the intent that they
should give him a place in which to bury his dead. 5. And the Lord gave
him grace before all who saw him, and he besought in gentleness the sons
of Heth, and they gave him the land of the double cave <span
id="fr_520"></span>[3](#fn_519) over against Mamre, that is Hebron, for
four hundred pieces of silver. 6. And they besought him, saying, "We
shall give it to thee for nothing"; but he would not take it from their
hands for nothing, for he gave the price of the place, the money in
full, and he bowed down before them twice; and after this he buried his
dead in the double cave. 7. And all the days of the life of Sarah were
one hundred and twenty-seven years, that is, two jubilees and four weeks
and one year: these are the days of the years of the life of Sarah. 8.
This is the tenth <span id="fr_521"></span>[2](#fn_518) trial wherewith
Abraham was tried, and he was found faithful, patient in spirit. 9. And
he said not a single word regarding the rumour in the land how that God
had said that He would give it to him and to his seed after him, and he
begged a place there to bury his dead; for he was found faithful,

and was recorded on the heavenly tables as the friend of God. <span
