for his son Isaac and her name was Rebecca \[the daughter of Bethuel,
the son of Nahor, the brother of Abraham\] <span
id="fr_523"></span>[2](#fn_521) the sister of Laban and daughter of
Bethuel; and Bethuel was the son of Mêlcâ, who was the wife of Nahor,
the brother of Abraham. 11. And Abraham took to himself a third wife,
and her name was Keturah, from among the daughters of his household
servants, for Hagar had died before Sarah. <span
id="fr_524"></span>[3](#fn_522) 12. And she bare him six sons, Zimram,
and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah, in the two
weeks of years. 13. And in the sixth week,

in the second year thereof, Rebecca bare to Isaac two sons, Jacob and
Esau, and Jacob was a smooth and upright <span
id="fr_525"></span>[4](#fn_523) man, and Esau was fierce, a man of the
field, and hairy, and Jacob dwelt in tents. 14. And the youths grew, and
Jacob learned to write; <span id="fr_526"></span>[5](#fn_524) but Esau
did not learn, for he was a man of the field and a hunter, and he learnt
war, and all his deeds were fierce.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_520"></span>[113:1](jub41.htm#fr_522) A traditional title
of Abraham. It goes back to Isa. xli. 8; cf. Jas. ii. 23, *T.B. Men.*
53*b*.

<span id="fn_521"></span>[113:2](jub42.htm#fr_523) The bracketed words a
dittograph.

<span id="fn_522"></span>[113:3](jub42.htm#fr_524) This explains why
Abraham did not take Hagar back. The later tradition (cf. *e. g.* *Pirḳe
de R. Eliezer* xxx.) identifies Hagar with Keturah.

<span id="fn_523"></span>[113:4](jub42.htm#fr_525) Cf. Gen. xxv. 27
(where "plain" = lit. "upright"), and Gen. xxvii. 11 (combined here).

<span id="fn_524"></span>[113:5](jub42.htm#fr_526) According to the
Targums the "tents" were academies. Jacob is represented as a lifelong
student of the Torah (cf. *Ber. rabba* lxiii; *Pirḳe de R. Eliezer*
xxxii.).
