And they took captive Sodom and Adam&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_422"></A><A HREF="#fn_422"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> and Zeboim, and they took captive Lot also, the son of Abram's brother, and all his possessions, and they went to Dan.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_423"></A><A HREF="#fn_423"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> 24.

And to this law there is no limit of days; for He hath ordained it for the generations for ever that they should give to the Lord the tenth of everything, of the seed and of the wine and of the oil and of the cattle and of the sheep. 27. And He gave (it) unto His priests to eat and to drink with joy before Him. 28. And the king of Sodom came to him and bowed himself before him, and said: "Our Lord Abram, give unto us the souls which thou hast rescued, but let the booty be thine." 29. And Abram said unto him: "I lift up my hands to the Most High God, that from a thread to a shoe-latchet I shall not take aught that is thine, lest thou shouldst say I have made Abram rich; save only what the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men who went with me--Aner, Eschol, and Mamre. These will take their portion."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_427"></A><A HREF="#fn_427"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A></p>

Gen. xiv. 15-20). That Abraham should have given tithes to Melchizedek (who was uncircumcised) was a difficulty to later Jews (cf. Justin, Trypho xix.). One way of overcoming it was to identify Melchizedek with Shem.</P>
