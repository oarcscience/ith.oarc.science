### The decreasing Years and increasing Corruption of Mankind (xxiii. 9-17).

9\. For the days of the forefathers, of their life, were nineteen
jubilees; and after the Flood they began to grow less than nineteen
jubilees, and to decrease in jubilees, and to grow old quickly, and to
be full of their days by reason of manifold tribulation and the
wickedness of their ways, with the exception of Abraham. <span
id="fr_609"></span>[2](#fn_607) 10. For Abraham was perfect in all his
deeds with the Lord, and well-pleasing in righteousness all the days of
his life; and behold, he did not complete four jubilees in his life,
when he had grown old by reason of the wickedness <span
id="fr_610"></span>[3](#fn_608) and was full of his days. 11. And all
the generations which will arise from this time until the day of the
great judgment will grow old quickly, before they complete two jubilees,
and their knowledge will forsake them by reason of their old age \[and
all their knowledge will vanish away\]. <span
id="fr_611"></span>[4](#fn_609) 12. And in those days, if a man live a
jubilee and a half of years, they will say regarding him: "He hath lived
long, and the greater part of his days are pain and sorrow and

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

tribulation, <span id="fr_612"></span>[1](#fn_610) and there is no
peace: 13. For calamity followeth on calamity, and wound on wound, and
tribulation on tribulation, and evil tidings on evil tidings, and
illness on illness, and all evil judgments such as these, one with
another, illness and overthrow, and snow and frost and ice, and fever,
and chills, and torpor, and famine, and death, and sword, and captivity,
and all kinds of calamities and pains." <span
id="fr_613"></span>[2](#fn_611) 14. And all these will come on an evil
generation, which transgresseth on the earth: their works are
uncleanness and fornication, and pollution and abominations. <span
id="fr_614"></span>[3](#fn_612) 15. Then they will say: "The days of the
forefathers were many (even), unto a thousand years, and were good; but,
behold, the days of our life, if a man hath lived many, are three score
years and ten, and, if he is strong, four score years, and those
evil <span id="fr_615"></span>[4](#fn_613) and there is no peace in the
days of this evil generation." 16. And in that generation the sons will
convict their fathers and their elders of sin and unrighteousness, <span
id="fr_616"></span>[5](#fn_614) and of the words of their mouth and the
great wickednesses which they perpetrate, and concerning their forsaking
the covenant <span id="fr_617"></span>[6](#fn_615) which the Lord made
between them and Him, that they should observe and do all His
commandments and His ordinances and all His laws, without departing
either to the right hand or to the left. <span
id="fr_618"></span>[7](#fn_616) 17. For all have done evil, <span
id="fr_619"></span>[8](#fn_617) and every mouth speaketh iniquity <span
id="fr_620"></span>[9](#fn_618) and all their works are an uncleanness
and an abomination, and all their ways are pollution, uncleanness and
destruction.
