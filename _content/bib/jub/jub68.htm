And his sons and his daughter rose up to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted for his son. 15.

<P><A NAME="fn_767"></A><A HREF="jub68.htm#fr_771">169:2</A> The account given in 2-8 of the conquest of Shechem is given in a fuller form in the <i>Test. Judah</i> iii-vii., and in the Midrash Wajjissau (cf. Gaster, <i>Chronicles of Jerahmeel</i>, pp. 80-87). The legend evidently has an old basis, for it harmonizes with the statement given in Gen. xlviii. 22, which refers to Jacob's conquest of Shechem (cf. RX. margin). This form of the story is obviously independent of, and possibly older than, that given in Gen. xxxiv.</P>
