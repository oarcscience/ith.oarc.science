 Isaac was weaned in this jubilee, and Abraham made a great banquet in the third month, on the day his son Isaac was weaned.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_496"></A><A HREF="#fn_496"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> 2. And Ishmael, the son of Hagar, the Egyptian, was before the face of Abraham, his father, in his place, and Abraham rejoiced and blessed God because he had seen his sons 3 and had not died childless.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_497"></A><A HREF="#fn_497"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. And he remembered the words which He had spoken to him on the day on which Lot had parted from him, and he rejoiced because the Lord had given him seed upon the earth to inherit the earth, and he blessed with all his mouth the Creator of all things.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_498"></A><A HREF="#fn_498"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> 4.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_499"></A><A HREF="#fn_499"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> And Sarah saw Ishmael playing and dancing&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_500"></A><A HREF="#fn_500"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> and Abraham rejoicing with great joy, and she became jealous of Ishmael and said to Abraham, "Cast out this bondwoman and her son; for the son of this bondwoman will not be heir with my son, Isaac." 5. And the thing was grievous in Abraham's sight, because of his maidservant and because of his son, that he should drive them from him. 6. And God said to Abraham "Let it not be grievous in thy sight, because of the child and because of the bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken to her words and do (them); for in Isaac shall thy name and seed be called. 7. But as for the son of this bondwoman I will make him a great&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_501"></A><A HREF="#fn_501"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> nation, because he is of thy seed." 8. And Abraham rose up early in the morning</p>

<p>and took bread and a bottle of water, and placed them on the shoulders of Hagar and the child, and sent her away. 9. And she departed and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba, and the water in the bottle was spent, and the child thirsted, and was not able to go on, and fell down. 10. And his mother took him and cast him under an olive tree,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_502"></A><A HREF="#fn_502"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and went and sat her down over against him, at the distance of a bow-shot; for she said, "Let me not see the death of my child," and as she sat she wept. 11. And an angel of God, one of the holy ones, said unto her, "Why weepest thou, Hagar? Arise, take the child, and hold him in thine hand; for God hath heard thy voice, and hath seen the child." 12. And she&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_503"></A><A HREF="#fn_503"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water, and she went and filled her bottle with water, and she gave her child to drink, and she arose and went towards the wilderness of Paran. 13. And the child grew and became an archer, and God was with him; and his mother took him a wife from among the daughters of Egypt. 14. And she bare him a son, and he called his name Nebaioth;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_504"></A><A HREF="#fn_504"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> for she said, "The Lord was nigh to me when I called upon him."</p>
