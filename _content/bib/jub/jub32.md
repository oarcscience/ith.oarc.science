### The Campaign of Chedorlaomer (xiii. 22-29; cf. Gen. xiv.).

22\. And in this year came Chedorlaomer, king of Elam, and Amraphel,
king of Shinar, and Arioch, king of Sêllâsar <span
id="fr_420"></span>[4](#fn_420) and Têrgâl, <span
id="fr_421"></span>[5](#fn_421) king of nations, and slew the king of
Gomorrah, and the king of Sodom fled, and many fell through wounds in
the vale of Siddim, by the Salt Sea. 23. And they took captive Sodom and
Adam <span id="fr_422"></span>[6](#fn_422) and Zeboim, and they took
captive Lot also, the son of Abram's brother, and all his possessions,
and they went to Dan. <span id="fr_423"></span>[7](#fn_423) 24. And one
who had escaped came and told Abram that his brother's son had been
taken captive and (Abram) armed <span id="fr_424"></span>[8](#fn_424)
his household servants. 25 . . . . . . . . . . . . . for Abram, and for
his seed, a

tenth of the first-fruits to the Lord, <span
id="fr_425"></span>[1](#fn_425) and the Lord ordained it as an ordinance
for ever that they should give it to the priests who served before Him,
that they should possess it for ever. <span
id="fr_426"></span>[2](#fn_426) 26. And to this law there is no limit of
days; for He hath ordained it for the generations for ever that they
should give to the Lord the tenth of everything, of the seed and of the
wine and of the oil and of the cattle and of the sheep. 27. And He gave
(it) unto His priests to eat and to drink with joy before Him. 28. And
the king of Sodom came to him and bowed himself before him, and said:
"Our Lord Abram, give unto us the souls which thou hast rescued, but let
the booty be thine." 29. And Abram said unto him: "I lift up my hands to
the Most High God, that from a thread to a shoe-latchet I shall not take
aught that is thine, lest thou shouldst say I have made Abram rich; save
only what the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men who went
with me--Aner, Eschol, and Mamre. These will take their portion." <span

rendering "armed" has the support of the Targum Onkelos.

<span id="fn_425"></span>[95:1](jub32.htm#fr_425) Charles suspects a
lacuna at the beginning of 25. It no doubt contained an account of the
pursuit of the kings and told of Melchizedek (cf. Gen. xiv. 15-20). That
Abraham should have given tithes to Melchizedek (who was uncircumcised)
was a difficulty to later Jews (cf. Justin, Trypho xix.). One way of
overcoming it was to identify Melchizedek with Shem.

<span id="fn_426"></span>[95:2](jub32.htm#fr_426) The law about tithes
is made to apply for the Levitical priesthood; cf. xxxii. 15.

xiv. 21-24.
