And &#146;&Ucirc;r, the son of K&ecirc;s&ecirc;d,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_376"></A><A HREF="#fn_376"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> built the city of &#146;Ar&acirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_377"></A><A HREF="#fn_377"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> of the Chaldees, and called its name after his own name and the name of his father. 4.

And the prince Mast&ecirc;m&acirc; exerted himself to do all this, and he sent forth other spirits, those which were put under his hand, to do all manner of wrong and sin, and all manner of transgression, to corrupt and destroy, and to shed blood upon the earth.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_378"></A><A HREF="#fn_378"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> 6. For this reason he called the name of S&ecirc;r&ocirc;&#7723;, Serug, for every one turned to do all manner of sin and transgression. 7. And he grew up, and dwelt in Ur of the Chaldees, near to the father of his wife's mother, and he worshipped idols, and he took to himself a wife in the thirty-sixth jubilee, in the <TABLE ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="10%" CELLPADDING=8>

Before they could plough in the seed, the ravens picked (it) from the surface of the ground. 12. And for this reason he called his name Terah, because the ravens and the birds reduced them to destitution and devoured their seed.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_382"></A><A HREF="#fn_382"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> 13.
