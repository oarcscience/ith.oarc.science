### Renewed Study of the Law followed by a Renewal of Mankind. The Messianic Kingdom and the Blessedness of the Righteous (xxiii. 26-32; cf. Isa. lxv. 17 ff. \[Eschatological.\]

26\. And in those days the children will begin to study the laws,  
And to seek the commandments,  
And to return to the path of righteousness.  
27. And the days will begin to grow many and increase amongst those
children of men, <span id="page_132">p. 132</span>  
Till their days draw nigh to one thousand years, <span
id="fr_630"></span>[1](#fn_628)  
And to a greater number of years than (before) was the number of the
days.  
28. And there will be no old man  
Nor one who is not satisfied with his days,  
For all will be (as) children and youths. <span
id="fr_631"></span>[2](#fn_629)  
29. And all their days they will complete and live in peace and in
joy, <span id="fr_632"></span>[3](#fn_630)  
And there will be no Satan <span id="fr_633"></span>[4](#fn_631) nor any
evil destroyer;  
For all their days will be days of blessing and healing, <span
id="fr_634"></span>[5](#fn_632)  
30. And at that time the Lord will heal His servants,  
And they will rise up <span id="fr_635"></span>[6](#fn_633) and
see <span id="fr_636"></span>[7](#fn_634) great peace,  
And drive out their adversaries.  
And the righteous will see and be thankful,  
And rejoice with joy for ever and ever,  
And will see all their judgments and all their curses on their
enemies.  
31. And their bones will rest in the earth,  
And their spirits will have much joy, <span
id="fr_637"></span>[8](#fn_635)  
And they will know that it is the Lord who executeth judgment,  
And showeth mercy to hundreds and thousands and to all that love
Him. <span id="fr_638"></span>[9](#fn_636)

32\. And do thou, Moses, write down these words; for thus are they
written, and they record (them) on the heavenly tables for a testimony
for the generations for ever.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_628"></span>[132:1](jub52.htm#fr_630) The span of life
originally designed for mankind. Adam fell short of this because of his
sin.

<span id="fn_629"></span>[132:2](jub52.htm#fr_631) Cf. Isa. lxv. 20.

<span id="fn_630"></span>[132:3](jub52.htm#fr_632) Cf. Isa. lxv. 14.

<span id="fn_631"></span>[132:4](jub52.htm#fr_633) Cf. *Assumpt. Moses*
x. 1.

<span id="fn_632"></span>[132:5](jub52.htm#fr_634) Cf. i. 29.

<span id="fn_633"></span>[132:6](jub52.htm#fr_635) Probably there is no
reference here to a resurrection. Apparently the Messianic kingdom
depicted is a temporary one. The eschatology harmonizes with that of 1
Enoch xci.-civ.

<span id="fn_634"></span>[132:7](jub52.htm#fr_636) *i.e.* enjoy.

<span id="fn_635"></span>[132:8](jub52.htm#fr_637) *i.e.* they will
enjoy a blessed immortality (with no bodily resurrection); cf. 1 Enoch
ciii. 3-4.

<span id="fn_636"></span>[132:9](jub52.htm#fr_638) Cf. 4 Ezra vii. 132
ff.
