<p>on this manner amongst all men; that they should each so walk with regard to them as to do judgment and righteousness on the earth. 3. That they should circumcise their sons,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_535"></A><A HREF="#fn_533"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> according to the covenant which He had made with them, and not deviate to the right hand or the left of all the paths which the Lord had commanded us; and that we should keep ourselves from all fornication and uncleanness, [and renounce from amongst us all fornication and uncleanness].&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_536"></A><A HREF="#fn_534"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> 4.

But serve ye the Most High God, and worship Him continually:<br> And hope for His countenance always,<br> And work uprightness and righteousness before Him,<br> That He may have pleasure in you and grant you His mercy,<br> And send rain&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_543"></A><A HREF="#fn_541"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> upon you morning and evening,<br> And bless all your works which ye have wrought upon the earth,<br> And bless thy bread and thy water,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_544"></A><A HREF="#fn_542"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A><br> And bless the fruit of thy womb and the fruit of thy land,<br> And the herds of thy cattle, and the flocks of thy sheep.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_545"></A><A HREF="#fn_543"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A><br> 10.
