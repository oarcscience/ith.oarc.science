<p align="center"><FONT SIZE="-1">John 4, 43-53.</FONT></p>  
<p>AFTER two days Jesus went into Galilee: for Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honor in his own country.</p>  
<p>The Galileans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.</p>  
<p>So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he [had] made the water wine.</p>  
<p>And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum. He went unto Jesus, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death. Then said Jesus unto him,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.</div></p>  
<p>The nobleman saith, Sir, come down ere my child die. Jesus answered,</p>  
<p><a name="page_15"><font size="1" color="green">p. 15</font></A></p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Go thy way: thy son liveth.</div></p>  
<p>The man believed, and went his way. And going down, his servants met him, and told <i>him</i>, Thy son liveth.</p>  
<p>Then inquired he of them the hour when the child began to amend. They said, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.</p>  
<p>So the father knew that <i>it</i> was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth.</p>
