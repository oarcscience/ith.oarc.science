<p>THE shelves of the libraries and of the bookstores bend beneath the tomes of the sayings, the bare sayings, of all the other great men; but one will not find in library or bookstore, in any published book, the complete sayings of Jesus, the bare sayings in simple sequence, Christ's own words, <i>separate</i>.</p>  
<p>&para;This compiler's purpose has been to enable any reader, whether confirmed Christian or inquiring pagan, or a frankly detached, to get him a book of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">CHRIST'S OWN WORDS</span>, "divested," so runs the title page, "of the context, <i>excepting</i> those brief portions of the gospel narratives retained to establish the place, the time, or occasion, or a question the reply to which is the Master's own answer."</p>  
<p>Many a reader, arrived at <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">FINIS</span> in the New Testament itself, has but a hazy picture of Christ on his daily walks as a circuit preacher everywhere within walking distance; has but a sketchy outline of the times and occasions&#8212;so many biographers!&#8212;Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Paul&#8212;each essaying not a biography as such, not the record of the Teacher's sayings as such, but intent upon launching each his own conception of Christ's mission.</p>  
<p>&para;Christ's sayings complete, brought into a sequence of times and occasions, but lifted out of contexts alien to the present purpose, may prove to be a glowing story new not only to the non-reader, but new even to the whilom New-Testament readers who have not as yet discerned the "continuities."</p>  
<p>Devoted readers will not be diverted from the Great Text. Perhaps other readers&#8212;the casual New-Testament reader and the <i>non-reader</i>&#8212;after enjoying these pages may venture the greater enjoyment: the attentive perusal of all the gospels and all the epistles, perhaps of all the New Testament.</p>
