<p align="center">A.D. 29. Age 32. <i>Perea</i>.</p>  
<p align="center"><FONT SIZE="-1">Luke 12, 41-59; 13, 1-9.</FONT></p>  
<p>THEN Peter said, Lord, speakest thou this parable unto us, or even to all? and the Lord said,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_67"></A><A HREF="#fn_64"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A>Who then is that faithful and wise steward, whom <i>his</i> lord shall make ruler over his household, to give <i>them their</i> portion of meat in due season?</p>  
<p>Blessed <i>is</i> that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing. Of a truth I say unto you, that he will make him ruler over all that he hath.</p>  
<p>But if that servant say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken; the lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for <i>him</i>, and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers.</p>  
<p>And that servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not <i>himself</i>, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many <i>stripes</i>. But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few <i>stripes</i>. For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required; and to whom men have committeth much, of him they will ask more.</p>  
<p>&para;I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it be already kindled? But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished!</p>  
<p>Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division: for from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three. The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother in law against her daughter in law, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.</div></p>  
<p>&para;He said also to the people,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">When ye see a cloud rise out of the west, straightway ye say, There cometh a shower; and so it is. And when <i>ye see</i> the south wind blow, ye say, There will be heat; and it cometh to pass. <i>Ye</i> hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky and of the earth: but how is it that ye do not discern this time? Yea, and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right?</div></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_80"><font size="1" color="green">p. 80</font></A></p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">&para;When thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate, <i>as thou art</i> in the way, give diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him; lest he hale thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and the officer cast thee into prison. I tell thee, thou shalt not depart thence, till thou hast paid the very last mite.</div></p>  
<p>&para;There were present at that season some that told him of the Galileans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices. Jesus said unto them,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Suppose ye that these Galileans were sinners above all Galileans, because they suffered such things? I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.</p>  
<p>Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem? I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.</div></p>  
<p>&para;He spake also this parable:</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">A certain <i>man</i> had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none. Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground?</p>  
<p>And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and <i>dung it:</i> and if it bear fruit, <i>well:</i> and if not, <i>then</i> after that thou shalt cut it down.</div></p>
