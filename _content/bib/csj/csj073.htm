<p align="center">A.D. 30. Age 33. <i>Jerusalem, in the Temple</i>.</p>  
<p align="center"><FONT SIZE="-1">John 12, 20-36; 42-50.</FONT></p>  
<p>CERTAIN Greeks came up to worship at the feast: the same came to Philip, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.</p>  
<p>Philip and Andrew tell Jesus. Jesus answered them, saying,</p>  
<p><a name="page_109"><font size="1" color="green">p. 109</font></A></p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.</p>  
<p>Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit. He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in his world shall keep it unto life eternal.</p>  
<p>If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honor.</p>  
<p>Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour? but for this cause came I unto this hour.</p>  
<p>Father, glorify thy name.</div></p>  
<p>Then came there a voice from heaven, <i>saying</i>, I have both glorified <i>it</i>, and will glorify <i>it</i> again.</p>  
<p>The people that stood by, and heard <i>it</i>, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake.</p>  
<p>Jesus said,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.</p>  
<p>Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out. And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all <i>men</i> unto me.</div></p>  
<p>This he said, signifying what death he should die.</p>  
<p>The people answered, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever; and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man? Then Jesus said,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth. While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light.</div></p>  
<p>&para;Among the chief rulers many believed on Jesus; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess <i>him</i>, lest they should be put out of the synagogue: for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.</p>  
<p>&para;Jesus cried and said,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">He that believeth on me believeth not on me, but on him that sent me. And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me.</p>  
<p>I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness. And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.</p>  
<p>He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day. For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I</div></p>  
<p><a name="page_110"><font size="1" color="green">p. 110</font></A></p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">should speak. And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever 1 speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.</div></p>
