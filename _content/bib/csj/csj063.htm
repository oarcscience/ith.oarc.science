<p align="center">A.D. 30. Age 33. <i>Perea</i>.</p>  
<p align="center"><FONT SIZE="-1">Luke 18, 9-30: Mark 10, 13-31: Matthew 19, 13-30; and 20, 1-16.</FONT></p>  
<p>JESUS spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.</p>  
<p>The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself: God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men <i>are</i>, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican. I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.</p>  
<p>And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as <i>his</i> eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.</p>  
<p>I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every man that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.</div></p>  
<p>&para;Then were brought infants, that Jesus should touch them: but the disciples rebuked them that brought them. Jesus, much displeased, said unto the disciples,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Suffer the little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.</p>  
<p>Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall in no wise enter therein.</div></p>  
<p>He took them up in his arms, put <i>his</i> hands upon them, and blessed them; and he departed thence.</p>  
<p><a name="page_93"><font size="1" color="green">p. 93</font></A></p>  
<p>&para;When he was gone forth into the way there came one running, a ruler, and kneeled, and asked, Good Master, what good thing shall I do to inherit eternal life?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_75"></A><A HREF="#fn_72"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> Jesus answered,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Why callest thou me good? None <i>is</i> good, save one, <i>that i</i>s, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.</div></p>  
<p>He saith, Which? Jesus said,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honor thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.</div></p>  
<p>The young man saith, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet? Jesus beholding him loved him, and said,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Yet lackest thou one thing; if thou wilt be perfect, go thy way, sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross, and follow me.</div></p>  
<p>The young man went away grieved, for he was rich, and had great possessions.</p>  
<p>&para;Jesus looked round about, and saith,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God? It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_76"></A><A HREF="#fn_73"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A> than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</div></p>  
<p>The disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus saith again,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God! Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven! And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</div></p>  
<p>The disciples were saying among themselves, Who then can be saved? And Jesus answered,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">With men this is impossible; but not with God. The things which are impossible with men are possible with God: for with God all things are possible.</div></p>

<p>&para;Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee. What shall we have therefore? Jesus saith,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</p>  
<p>There is not a man that hath forsaken houses, or father, or mother, or brethren, or sisters, or wife, or children, or lands, for the kingdom of God's sake, for my sake and the gospel's, but he shall receive a hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life.</p>  
<p>Verily I say unto you, every one that hath left house, or father, or mother, or brethren, or sisters, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, and the gospel's, shall receive manifold more in this present time: houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and shall inherit life everlasting in the world to come.</p>  
<p>But many <i>that are</i> first shall be last; and the last shall be first.</p>  
<p>&para;For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man <i>that is</i> a householder, which went out early in the morning to hire laborers into his vineyard. And when he had agreed with the laborers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard.</p>  
<p>And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace, and said unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their way.</p>  
<p>Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise.</p>  
<p>And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle? They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, <i>that</i> shall ye receive.</p>  
<p>So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the laborers, and give them <i>their</i> hire, beginning from the last unto the first.</p>  
<p>And when they came that <i>were hired</i> about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny.</p>  
<p>But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny. And when they had received <i>it</i>, they murmured against the goodman of the house, saying, These last have wrought <i>but</i> one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day.</p>  
<p>But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny? Take <i>that</i> thine <i>is</i>, and go thy way: I will give unto this last, even as unto thee. Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good?</p>  
<p>So the last shall be first, and the first last; for many be called, but few chosen.</div></p>
