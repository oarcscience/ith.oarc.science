<p align="center">A.D. 30. Age 33. <i>Jerusalem: Upper Room</i>.</p>  
<p align="center"><FONT SIZE="-1">John 14, 5-31.</FONT></p>  
<p>THOMAS saith unto Jesus, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way. Jesus saith unto him,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him.</div></p>  
<p>Philip saith, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us. Jesus answered,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou <i>then</i>, Shew us the Father?</p>  
<p>Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? The words I speak unto you, I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works. Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works&#8217; sake.</p>  
<p>Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater <i>works</i> than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.</p>  
<p>And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If ye shall ask anything in my name, I will do <i>it</i>.</p>  
<p>&para;If ye love me keep my commandments. And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; <i>even</i> the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. I will not leave you comfortless; I will come to you.</p>  
<p>Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also. At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.</div></p>

<p><div class="jesussaid">He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.</div></p>  
<p>Judas, not Iscariot, saith unto him, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world? Jesus answered,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him. He that loveth me not keepth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent me.</p>  
<p>These things have I spoken unto you, being <i>yet</i> present with you.</p>  
<p>But the Comforter, <i>which is</i> the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you. Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you.</p>  
<p>Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again unto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I.</p>  
<p>And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye might believe.</p>  
<p>Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me. But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do.</div></p>
