<p align="center">A.D. 28. Age 31. <i>Capernaum: Sea of Galilee</i>.</p>  
<p align="center"><FONT SIZE="-1">Mk. 4, 30-34; 35-41: Matt. 13, 31-34; 36-52: Lk. 13, 18-21; 8, 22-25.</FONT></p>  
<p>ANOTHER parable put he forth unto them, saying,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_37"></A><A HREF="#fn_36"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A>Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it? A grain of mustard seed is the least of all seeds: is indeed less than all the seeds that be in the earth; but when it is sown in the earth, <i>it</i> groweth up: it becometh greater than all herbs; it shooteth out great branches, and becometh a tree, so that the fowls of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.</div></p>  
<p>Then said he,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Unto what is the kingdom of God like? and whereunto shall I resemble it? The kingdom of heaven is like unto a grain of mustard seed, which a man took and cast into a garden in his field; and it grew, and waxed a great tree, and the birds of the air lodged in the branches thereof, in the shadow of it.</div></p>  
<p>&para;Again Jesus said,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God?</div></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_41"><font size="1" color="green">p. 41</font></A></p>  
<p>And another parable spake he unto them,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.</div></p>  
<p>All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables.</p>  
<p>Then he sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field. He answered,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man; the field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one; the enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.</p>  
<p>As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world. The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity; and shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</p>  
<p>Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.</p>  
<p>Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>  
<p>&para;Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.</p>  
<p>&para;Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchantman, seeking goodly pearls: who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.</p>  
<p>&para;Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind: which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.</p>  
<p>So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from the just, and shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</div></p>  
<p>Jesus saith unto them,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Have ye understood all these things?</div></p>  
<p>They say, Yea, Lord. Then said he unto them,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Therefore every scribe <i>which</i> is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven, is like unto a man <i>that is</i> a householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure <i>things</i> new and old.</div></p>  
<p>And with many such parables spake Jesus the word unto them, as they were able to hear it. But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.</p>  
<p>The same day, when even was come, Jesus entered into a ship. His disciples followed, and he said unto them,</p>  
<p><a name="page_42"><font size="1" color="green">p. 42</font></A></p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Let us pass over unto the other side of the lake.</div></p>  
<p>They took him even as he was in the ship. And they launched forth.</p>  
<p>As they sailed, behold, there came down a storm of wind: the waves beat into the ship, insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves.</p>  
<p>Jesus was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and his disciples awoke him, saying, Lord, save us: we perish. He said unto them,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith?</div></p>  
<p>Then he arose and rebuked the winds, and the raging of the water: he said unto the sea,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Peace, be still.</div></p>  
<p>The wind ceased: there was a great calm, and Jesus said unto his disciples,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Why are ye fearful? where is your faith? how is it that ye have no faith?</div></p>  
<p>But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him?</p>
