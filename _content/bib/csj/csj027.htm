<P><A NAME="fn_26"></A><A HREF="csj027.htm#fr_27">33:*</A> This censure of "the cities," and the homage, "I thank thee, O Father," are from Matthew (11, 20-27). In Luke (10, 13-15 and 21;22) is a paraphrase, being a part of Christ's admonition of the "other seventy . . . sent two and two into every city." Turn to XLVIII in this book.</P>
