<p>PAUL entered into a certain man's house, named Justus one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue.</p>  
<p>Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace; for I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee; for I have much people in this city.</div></p>  
<p>And Paul continued <i>there</i> for a year and six months, teaching the word of God.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">PAUL'S FAREWELL TO THE EPHESIANS</h3>  
<p align="center">A.D. 66. <i>Miletus</i>.</p>  
<p align="center"><FONT SIZE="-1">Luke: Acts 20, 17-19, 22, 25, 32-38.</FONT></p>  
<p>FROM Miletus he (Paul) sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church.</p>  
<p>When they were come, he said unto them, Ye know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all times, serving the Lord with humility, with temptations which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews.</p>  
<p>Now I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem. not knowing the things that shall befall me there. I know that ye all, among whom I have gone, preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.</p>  
<p>Brethren, I commend you to God.</p>  
<p>I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel. Yea, ye know, that these hands&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_113"></A><A HREF="#fn_108"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> have ministered unto my necessities. I have shewed you how that so laboring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">It is more blessed to give than to receive.</div></p>  
<p>When Paul had thus spoken, he prayed with them all. They all wept, sorrowing for the words which he spake, that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him unto the ship.</p>
