<p align="center">A.D. 28. Age 31 <i>Galilee</i> (<i>Capernaum?</i>).</p>  
<p align="center"><FONT SIZE="-1">Luke 7, 36-50.</FONT></p>  
<p>ONE of the Pharisees [Simon] desired him that he would eat with him. And Jesus went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to meat.</p>  
<p>And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, brought an alabaster box of ointment, and stood weeping; and began to wash Jesus&#8217; feet, and did wipe <i>them</i> with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed <i>them</i> with the ointment.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_28"></A><A HREF="#fn_27"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Now the Pharisee [Simon, the leper] spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known what manner of woman <i>this is;</i> for she is a sinner. Jesus said unto him,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee:</p>  
<p>There was a certain creditor which had two debtors; the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty. And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both.</p>  
<p>Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?</div></p>  
<p>Simon answered, I suppose that he to whom he forgave most. Jesus said,</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_35"><font size="1" color="green">p. 35</font></A></p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Thou hast rightly judged.</div></p>  
<p>He turned to the woman, and said unto Simon,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Seest thou this woman?</p>  
<p>I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head.</p>  
<p>Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman, since the time I came in, hath not ceased to kiss my feet.</p>  
<p>My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment.</p>  
<p>Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loveth much: but to whom little is forgiven, <i>the same</i> loveth little.</div></p>  
<p>And he said unto her,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Thy sins are forgiven.</div></p>  
<p>They that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also? Jesus said to the woman,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.</div></p>
