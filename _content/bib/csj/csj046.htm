<p>JOHN&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_54"></A><A HREF="#fn_51"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8225;</FONT></A> said, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name: and we forbade him, because he followeth not with us. But Jesus said,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Forbid <i>him</i> not: for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me. For he that is not against us is for us, is on our part.</p>  
<p>For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name,</div></p>

<p><div class="jesussaid">because ye belong to Christ, verily I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward.</p>  
<p>And whosoever shall offend one of <i>these</i> little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.</p>  
<p>And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched: where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.</p>  
<p>And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched: where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.</p>  
<p>And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire: where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.</p>  
<p>For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt. Salt <i>is</i> good: but if the salt have lost his saltness, wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with another.</div></p>
