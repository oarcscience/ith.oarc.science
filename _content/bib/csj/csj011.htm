<p>A MAN of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews, came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Master, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him. Jesus answered,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</div></p>  
<p>Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? Jesus answered,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh: and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</p>  
<p>Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again. The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.</div></p>

<p>Nicodemus said, How can these things be? Jesus answered,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.</p>  
<p>If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you <i>of</i> heavenly things? And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, <i>even</i> the Son of man which is in heaven.</p>  
<p>&para;And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up: that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.</p>  
<p>&para;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.</p>  
<p>&para;He that believeth on him is not condemned; but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</p>  
<p>And this is the condemnation, that light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_7"></A><A HREF="#fn_7"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></div></p>
