### XIII

### BY THE SEA—CHRIST CHOOSES THE FOUR—THE CURE IN THE SYNAGOGUE—SOLITARY PRAYER—IN "THE NEXT TOWNS" ROUND ABOUT GALILEE

A.D. 28. Age 31. *Galilee: Capernaum*.

Mark 1, 16-26; Luke 4, 31 . . . 38 . . . 44; Matthew 4, 17 . . . 25.

NOW as Jesus walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon Peter and Andrew
his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers. He said
unto them,

<div class="jesussaid">

Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men. Follow
me.

</div>

Straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.

When he had gone a little further thence, he saw James the *son* of
Zebedee, and John his brother, who were in a ship with their father,
mending their nets. He called them: and they left their father in the
ship with the hired servants, and followed Jesus.

¶They went into Capernaum; and on the sabbath day Jesus entered into the
synagogue, and taught. They were astonished: for his word was with
power: he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.

There was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried
out, Let *us* alone, thou Jesus of Nazareth. Art thou come to destroy
us? I know who thou art: the Holy One of God.

Jesus rebuked him, saying,

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

<div class="jesussaid">

Hold thy peace, and come out of him.

</div>

When the unclean spirit had thrown the man in the midst, he came out of
him, and hurt him not.

¶Jesus arose, and, when they were come out of the synagogue, entered the
house of Peter and Andrew, with James and John.

¶In the morning, rising up a great while before day, Jesus went out into
a solitary place, and there prayed.

The people sought him, and came unto him, and stayed him, that he should
not depart. He said,

<div class="jesussaid">

I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also: for therefore am
I sent.

</div>

Simon and they that were with him followed after Jesus, and when they
had found him, they said unto him,  <span
id="fr_9"></span>[\*](#fn_9)All *men* seek for thee. He answered,

<div class="jesussaid">

Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for
therefore came I forth.

</div>

¶And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and
preaching the gospel of the kingdom. His fame went throughout Syria. And
there followed him multitudes from Galilee, and Decapolis; <span
id="fr_10"></span>[\*](#fn_9) *from* Jerusalem, and Judea; and *from*
beyond Jordan.
