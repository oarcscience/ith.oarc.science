<p align="center">A.D. 30 Age 33. Jerusalem: Upper Room.</p>  
<p align="center"><FONT SIZE="-1">Paul I. Corinthians 11, 24-25: Matthew 26, 21-29: Mark 14, 18-25: Luke 22, 19-38: John 13, 18-38; 14, 1-4.</FONT></p>  
<p>THE <i>same</i> night in which he was betrayed, the Lord Jesus took bread, and gave thanks, and blessed <i>it</i>, and brake <i>it</i>, and gave <i>it</i> to his disciples, and said,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Take, eat; this is my body, which is given&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_95"></A><A HREF="#fn_91"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> for you: this do in remembrance of me.</div></p>  
<p>As they sat and did eat, Jesus said,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.</p>  
<p>&para;But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me <i>is</i> with me on the table. And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was determined: but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed!</p>  
<p>I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the Scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me.</p>  
<p>Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am <i>he</i>.</p>  
<p>Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.</div></p>  
<p>When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit; and testified,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you which eateth with me shall betray me.</div></p>  
<p>The disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake. They were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto Jesus, one by one, Lord, is it I? and another, Is it I? He answered,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid"><i>It is</i> one of the twelve: he that dippeth <i>his</i> hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.</p>  
<p>The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him; but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had never been born.</div></p>  
<p>Now there was leaning on Jesus&#8217; bosom one whom Jesus loved.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_96"></A><A HREF="#fn_92"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A> Simon Peter beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom</p>  
<p>

<p><a name="page_120"><font size="1" color="green">p. 120</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Jesus spake. He then lying on Jesus&#8217; breast saith, Lord, who is it? Jesus answered,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it.</div></p>  
<p>He dipped the sop: he gave <i>it</i> to Judas Iscariot: then said unto him,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">That thou doest, do quickly.</div></p>  
<p>Judas said, Master, is it I? Jesus said unto him,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Thou hast said.</div></p>  
<p>Judas went immediately out: and it was night. When he was gone, Jesus said,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is <A HREF="errata.htm#6">glorified</A> in him. If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him.</p>  
<p>Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_97"></A><A HREF="#fn_93"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> so now I say to you, Whither I go, ye cannot come.</p>  
<p>A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. By this shall all <i>men</i> know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.</div></p>  
<p>&para;Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now: but thou shalt follow me afterwards.</div></p>  
<p>Peter said, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thy sake. Jesus answered,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou hast denied me thrice.</div></p>  
<p>&para;There was a strife among the disciples, which of them should be accounted the greatest. And Jesus said unto them,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">The kings of the Gentile exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors. But ye <i>shall</i> not <i>be</i> so; but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve.</p>  
<p>For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? <i>is</i> not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as he that serveth.</p>  
<p>Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations. And I</div></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_121"><font size="1" color="green">p. 121</font></A></p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">appoint unto you a kingdom, as my father hath appointed unto me; that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</div></p>  
<p>&para;And the Lord said,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired <i>to have</i> you, that he may sift you as wheat: but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.</div></p>  
<p>And Simon said, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death. And Jesus said,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.</div></p>  
<p>And he said unto them,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye anything?</div></p>  
<p>They said, Nothing. Then said Jesus,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">But now, he that hath a purse, let him take <i>it</i>, and likewise <i>his</i> scrip: and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one.</p>  
<p>For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors.</p>  
<p>For the things concerning me have an end.</div></p>  
<p>And they said, Lord, behold, here <i>are</i> two swords. And he answered,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">It is enough.</div></p>  
<p>When he had supped, Jesus after the same manner <i>took</i> the cup, and when he had given thanks, gave <i>it</i> to them, saying,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Drink ye all of it.</div></p>  
<p>And they all drank of it. And he said unto them,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you; for this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins: this do ye, as oft as ye drink <i>it</i>, in remembrance of me.</p>  
<p>Verily I say unto you, I will drink henceforth no more of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in the kingdom of God, my Father's kingdom.</p>  
<p>Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me.</div></p>  
<p><a name="page_122"><font size="1" color="green">p. 122</font></A></p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">In my Father's house are many mansions: if <i>it were</i> not <i>so</i>, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, <i>there</i> ye may be also. And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.</div></p>
