<p align="center">A.D. 29. Age 32. <i>Decapolis</i>. <i>Dalmanutha</i>. <i>Bethsaida</i>.</p>  
<p align="center"><FONT SIZE="-1">Mark 8, 1-26: Matthew 15, 32-39; John 6, 1-12.</FONT></p>  
<p>IN those days the multitude being great, and having nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples, and saith,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat: and if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way.</div></p>  
<p>For divers of them came from far.</p>  
<p>His disciples say, From whence can a man satisfy these <i>men</i> with bread here in the wilderness? Jesus saith,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way. How many loaves have ye?</div></p>  
<p>They said, Seven, and a few little fishes.</p>  
<p>He commanded the people to sit on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before the people. The few small fishes he blessed, and commanded to set them also before <i>them</i>.</p>  
<p>So they did all eat, and were filled. They took up of the broken <i>meat</i> that was left seven baskets full. And they that had eaten were about four thousand, beside women and children. He sent them away.</p>  
<p>&para;Straightway Jesus entered into a ship with his disciples, and came into the coasts of Magdala, into the parts of Dalmanutha.</p>  
<p>The Pharisees with the Sadducees came forth to question with him,</p>  
<p><a name="page_55"><font size="1" color="green">p. 55</font></A></p>  
<p>seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him. He sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Why doth this generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation.</p>  
<p>When it is evening, ye say, <i>It will be</i> fair weather: for the sky is red.</p>  
<p>And in the morning, <i>It will be</i> foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowering.</p>  
<p>O <i>ye</i> hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not <i>discern</i> the signs of the times? A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas.</div></p>  
<p>Entering into the ship again, Jesus departed to the other side.</p>  
<p>&para;Now <i>the disciples</i> had forgotten to take bread; neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf. Then Jesus charged them,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees, and of the leaven of Herod.</div></p>  
<p>They reasoned among themselves, saying, <i>It is</i> because we have taken no bread. <i>Which</i> when Jesus perceived, he said unto them,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">O ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no bread? Perceive ye not yet, neither understand? Have ye your heart yet hardened? Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember?</p>  
<p>Do ye not understand, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up? Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?</p>  
<p>When I brake the five loaves among the five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up?</div></p>  
<p>They answer, Twelve.</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up?</div></p>  
<p>They said, seven. And Jesus said,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?</div></p>  
<p>Then understood they how that he bade <i>them</i> not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_45"></A><A HREF="#fn_43"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&para;Jesus cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him.</p>

<p>Jesus again put <i>his</i> hands upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly. Jesus sent him away, saying,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Neither go into the town, nor tell <i>it</i> to any in the town.</div></p>
