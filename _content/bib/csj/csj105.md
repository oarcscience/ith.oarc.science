### CII

### TO THE CHURCH OF THE LAODICEANS—I STAND AT THE DOOR, AND KNOCK

A.D. 96.

Revelation 3, 14-22.

<div class="jesussaid">

AND unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write;

These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the
beginning of the creation of God;

I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert
cold or hot. So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor
hot, I will spew thee out of my mouth. Because thou sayest, I am rich,
and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that
thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked: I
counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire,

</div>

<div class="jesussaid">

that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be
clothed, and *that* the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint
thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see.

As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten; be zealous, therefore, and
repent.

Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and
open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with
me.

To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as
I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.

</div>

He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
churches.
