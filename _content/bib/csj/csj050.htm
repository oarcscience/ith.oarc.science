<p align="center">A.D. 29. Age 32. <i>Jerusalem</i>.</p>  
<p align="center"><FONT SIZE="-1">John 9, 1-41; 10, 1-18; 22-40.</FONT></p>  
<p>AS JESUS passed by, he saw a man which was blind from <i>his</i> birth. His disciples asked, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind? Jesus answered,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.</p>  
<p>I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work. As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.</div></p>  
<p>When he had thus spoken, he anointed the eyes of the blind man with clay, and said unto him,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Go, wash in the pool of Siloam.</div></p>  
<p>He went, and washed, and came seeing.</p>  
<p>&para;The neighbors said, Is not this he that sat and begged? He answered, I am <i>he</i>.</p>  
<p>Therefore, said they, how were thine eyes opened?</p>  
<p>He said, A man called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.</p>

<p>It was the sabbath day when Jesus opened his eyes. Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man [Jesus] is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.</p>  
<p>The Jews called the parents, and asked them, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?</p>  
<p>His parents answered, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind: but by what means he now seeth, we know not; he is of age; ask him.</p>  
<p>His parents feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that Jesus was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.</p>  
<p>Again the Jews called the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man [Jesus] is a sinner: we know not from whence he is.</p>  
<p>The man answered, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and <i>yet</i> he hath opened mine eyes. Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth. If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.</p>  
<p>They answered, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.</p>  
<p>Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Dost thou believe on the Son of God?</div></p>  
<p>He answered, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him? Jesus said,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.</div></p>  
<p>And he said, Lord, I believe.</p>  
<p>&para;Jesus said,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.</div></p>  
<p><i>Some</i> of the Pharisees heard these words, and said, Are we blind also? Jesus answered,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.</div></p>  
<p>&para;This parable spake Jesus unto them,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber. But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.</p>  
<p>And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them,</div></p>  
<p><a name="page_70"><font size="1" color="green">p. 70</font></A></p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice. And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.</div></p>  
<p>But they understood not. Then said Jesus,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep. All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.</p>  
<p>I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.</p>  
<p>The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.</p>  
<p>I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep. But he that is a hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep. The hireling fleeth, because he is a hireling, and careth not for the sheep.</p>  
<p>I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine. As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.</p>  
<p>And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.</p>  
<p>Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again. No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.</div></p>  
<p>&para;At Jerusalem it was the feast of the dedication. It was winter. Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch.</p>  
<p>Then came the Jews round about him, and said, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly. Jesus answered,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me. But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you. My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: and I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any <i>man</i> pluck them out of my hand.</p>  
<p>My Father, which gave <i>them</i> me, is greater than all; and no <i>man</i> is able to pluck <i>them</i> out of my Father's hand.</p>  
<p>I and <i>my</i> Father are one.</div></p>  
<p>The Jews took up stones again to stone him, Jesus answered,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?</div></p>  
<p><a name="page_71"><font size="1" color="green">p. 71</font></A></p>  
<p>The Jews answered, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God. Jesus answered,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?</p>  
<p>If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the Scripture cannot be broken; say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?</p>  
<p>If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not. But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works; that ye may know, and believe, that the Father <i>is</i> in me, and I in him.</div></p>  
<p>Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand, and went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he abode.</p>
