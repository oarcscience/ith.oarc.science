### XCIX

### TO THE CHURCH IN THYATIRA—"I WILL GIVE UNTO EVERY ONE OF YOU ACCORDING TO HIS WORKS"

A.D. 96.

Revelation 2, 18-29.

<div class="jesussaid">

AND unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write;

These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame
of fire, and his feet are like fine brass;

I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience,
and thy works; and the last *to be* more than the first.

Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest
that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to
seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed
unto idols. And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she
repented not. Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit
adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their
deeds. And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches
shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will
give unto every one of you according to your works.

But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not
this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they
speak; I will put upon you none other burden. But that which ye have
*already*, hold fast till I come.

And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I
give power over the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron;
as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I
received of my Father. And I will give him the morning star.

</div>

He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
churches.
