<p align="center">A.D. 29, Age 32. <i>Perea</i>.</p>  
<p align="center"><FONT SIZE="-1">Luke 10, 25-37.</FONT></p>  
<p>A CERTAIN lawyer stood up, and tempted Jesus, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? Jesus said,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">What is written in the law? how readest thou?</div></p>  
<p>He answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbor as thyself. Jesus said unto him,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live.</div></p>  
<p>But he, willing to <A HREF="errata.htm#2">justify</A> himself, said, And who is my neighbor? Jesus answering said,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">A certain <i>man</i> went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving <i>him</i> half dead.</div></p>  
<p><a name="page_74"><font size="1" color="green">p. 74</font></A></p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.</p>  
<p>And like wise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked <i>on him</i>, and passed by on the other side.</p>  
<p>But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion <i>on him</i>, and went to <i>him</i>, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave <i>them</i> to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him: and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.</p>  
<p>Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbor unto him that fell among the thieves?</div></p>  
<p>He said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Go, and do thou likewise.</div></p>
