<p>FROM thence Jesus went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon.</p>  
<p>And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, <i>thou</i> Son of David: my daughter is grievously vexed with an unclean spirit.</p>  
<p>The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation.</p>  
<p>Jesus answered her not a word. And his disciples came, saying, Send her away. Jesus said,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</div></p>  
<p>He entered into a house, and would have no man know <i>it:</i> but he could not be hid. For then came she whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, saying, Lord, help me.</p>  
<p>But Jesus said unto her,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast <i>it</i> unto the dogs.</div></p>  
<p>She said, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs which fall from their masters' table. Jesus answered,</p>  
<p><a name="page_54"><font size="1" color="green">p. 54</font></A></p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">O woman, great <i>is</i> thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter.</div></p>  
<p>Her daughter was made whole from that very hour.</p>  
<p>&para;Departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, Jesus came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.</p>  
<p>They bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech. Jesus took him aside, and put his fingers into his ears, and touched his tongue; and looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Be opened.</div></p>  
<p>Straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.</p>  
<p>Jesus charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published <i>it</i>.</p>
