<p align="center">A.D. 29. Age 32. <i>Perea</i>.</p>  
<p align="center"><FONT SIZE="-1">Luke 13, 10-21.</FONT></p>  
<p>JESUS was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath. And, behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed together, and could in no wise lift up <i>herself</i>. Jesus saw her, and said unto her,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Woman, thou are loosed from thine infirmity.</div></p>  
<p>He laid <i>his</i> hands on her: and immediately she was made straight.</p>  
<p>The ruler of the synagogue, because that Jesus had healed on the sabbath day, said with indignation unto the people, There are six days in which men ought to work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the Sabbath day.</p>  
<p>The Lord answered,</p>  
<p><a name="page_81"><font size="1" color="green">p. 81</font></A></p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid"><i>Thou</i> hypocrite, doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or <i>his</i> ass from the stall, and lead <i>him</i> away to watering? And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, who Satan hath bound, lo, these eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day?</div></p>  
<p>His adversaries were ashamed: and the people rejoiced for the glorious things that were done by him. Then said he,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_68"></A><A HREF="#fn_65"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A>Unto what is the kingdom of God like? and whereunto shall I resemble it? It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and cast into his garden; and it grew, and waxed a great tree; and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it.</div></p>  
<p>And again he said,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God? It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.</div></p>
