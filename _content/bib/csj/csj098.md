### JESUS CHRIST AS ALPHA AND OMEGA DIRECTS JOHN TO WRITE TO THE SEVEN CHURCHES IN ASIA

A.D. 96.

Revelation 1, 1-3; 9-20.

THE Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him: sent unto his
servant John: who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony
of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw. Blessed is he that
readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those
things which are written therein: for the time *is* at hand.

¶I, John, was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a
great voice as of a trumpet, saying, <span
id="fr_116"></span>[†](#fn_111)

<div class="jesussaid">

I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the
ending:

What thou seest, write in a book, and send it unto the seven churches
which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamos, and
unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto
Laodicea.

</div>

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

And I turned to see the voice that spake:

I saw seven golden candlesticks; and in the midst of the seven
candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down
to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle. His head and
his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a
flame of fire; and his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a
furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters. And he had in his
right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged
sword: and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength. And
when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead.

He laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me,

<div class="jesussaid">

Fear not; I am the first and the last: I am he that liveth, and was
dead; and, behold, I am alive forever more, Amen; and have the keys of
hell and of death.

Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the
things which shall be hereafter; the mystery of the seven stars which
thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The
seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven
candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches.

</div>

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_111"></span>[151:†](csj098.htm#fr_116) Here (following) are
set down those sayings only which John has ascribed to Christ, along
with so much of John's context as barely to establish the sequences.
*The Revelation* contains a series of prophetic visions—it is the only
prophetic book in the New Testament. Its date is supposed to be A.D. 96.

Life”](csj099)
