<p>CERTAIN of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered Jesus, saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee. But he said unto them,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas: for as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.</p>  
<p>The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas <i>is</i> here.</p>  
<p>The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts</div></p>

<p><div class="jesussaid">of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon <i>is</i> here.</p>  
<p>When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none. Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth <i>it</i> empty, swept, and garnished. Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last <i>state</i> of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_30"></A><A HREF="#fn_29"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></div></p>
