### XXV

### THE WOMAN WITH THE ALABASTER BOX OF OINTMENT, AND SIMON THE PHARISEE: PARABLE OF THE TWO DEBTORS

A.D. 28. Age 31 *Galilee* (*Capernaum?*).

Luke 7, 36-50.

ONE of the Pharisees \[Simon\] desired him that he would eat with him.
And Jesus went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to meat.

And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, brought an
alabaster box of ointment, and stood weeping; and began to wash Jesus’
feet, and did wipe *them* with the hairs of her head, and kissed his
feet, and anointed *them* with the ointment. <span

Now the Pharisee \[Simon, the leper\] spake within himself, saying, This
man, if he were a prophet, would have known what manner of woman *this
is;* for she is a sinner. Jesus said unto him,

<div class="jesussaid">

Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee:

There was a certain creditor which had two debtors; the one owed five
hundred pence, and the other fifty. And when they had nothing to pay, he
frankly forgave them both.

Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?

</div>

Simon answered, I suppose that he to whom he forgave most. Jesus said,

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

<div class="jesussaid">

Thou hast rightly judged.

</div>

He turned to the woman, and said unto Simon,

<div class="jesussaid">

Seest thou this woman?

I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she
hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her
head.

Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman, since the time I came in, hath
not ceased to kiss my feet.

My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my
feet with ointment.

Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for
she loveth much: but to whom little is forgiven, *the same* loveth
little.

</div>

And he said unto her,

<div class="jesussaid">

Thy sins are forgiven.

</div>

They that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is
this that forgiveth sins also? Jesus said to the woman,

<div class="jesussaid">

Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.

</div>
