<p>WHEN Jesus perceived that they would take him by force, to make him a king, he constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the multitude away.</p>  
<p>If He went up into a mountain apart, to pray: when the evening was come, he was there alone.</p>  
<p>His disciples went over the sea toward Capernaum. The sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew. It was now dark, and the ship in the midst of the sea, tossed with the waves, and Jesus on the land, alone.</p>  
<p>He saw them toiling in rowing; and about the fourth watch of the night, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship. They cried out for fear, saying, It is a spirit.</p>  
<p>But straightway Jesus spake,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Be of good cheer; it is I: be not afraid.</div></p>  
<p>Peter answered, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water. Jesus said,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Come.</div></p>  
<p>And Peter walked on the water, to go to Jesus. But he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, Lord, save me.</p>  
<p>Jesus stretched forth <i>his</i> hand, and caught him, and said,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?</div></p>  
<p>When they were come into the ship, the wind ceased. They came into the land of Gennesaret.</p>
