<p align="center">A.D. 30. Age 33. <i>Galilee. Mt. Olivet. Bethany</i>.</p>  
<p align="center"><FONT SIZE="-1">Matthew 28, 16-20: Mark 16, 12-18: Luke 24, 44-53; and Luke's Acts of The Apostles 1, 12.</FONT></p>  
<p>THE eleven disciples went into a mountain in Galilee, where Jesus had appointed them. And he came, saying,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.</p>  
<p>He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.</p>  
<p>And these signs shall follow them that believe: In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; they shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.</p>  
<p>All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.</p>  
<p>Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, <i>even</i> unto the end of the world.</div></p>  
<p>And Jesus said unto them (the eleven),</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was with you, That all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and <i>in</i> the prophets, and <i>in</i> the psalms, concerning me.</div></p>  
<p>Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the Scriptures; and said unto them,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Thus it is written, and thus it behooved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day: and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</p>  
<p>And ye are witnesses of these things.</p>  
<p>And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.</div></p>  
<p>&para;And he led them out as far as to Bethany; and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.</p>  
<p>And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven; and a cloud received him out of their sight.</p>  
<p>&para;Then returned they with great joy unto Jerusalem, from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day's journey.</p>  
<p>They were continually in the temple praising and blessing God.</p>
