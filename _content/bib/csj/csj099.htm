<p><div class="jesussaid">UNTO the angel of the church of Ephesus write;</p>  
<p>These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks;</p>  
<p>I know thy works, and thy labor, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars: and hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name's sake hast labored, and hast not fainted.</p>  
<p>Nevertheless I have <i>somewhat</i> against thee, because thou hast left thy first love.</p>  
<p>Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.</p>  
<p>But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.</div></p>  
<p>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches;</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.</div></p>
