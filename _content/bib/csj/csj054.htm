<p align="center">A.D. 29. Age 32. <i>Perea</i>.</p>  
<p align="center"><FONT SIZE="-1">Luke 12, 1-40.</FONT></p>  
<p>IN the mean time, when there were gathered together an innumerable multitude of people, insomuch that they trode one upon another, Jesus began to say unto his disciples first of all,</p>  
<p><a name="page_77"><font size="1" color="green">p. 77</font></A></p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy. For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid, that shall not be known. Therefore, whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops.</p>  
<p>And I say unto you my friend, Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do. But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him.</p>  
<p>Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God? But even the very hairs on your head are all numbered. Fear not therefore; ye are of more value than many sparrows.</p>  
<p>Also I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God: but he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels of God. And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven.</p>  
<p>And when they bring you unto the synagogues, and unto magistrates, and powers, take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer, or what ye shall say: for the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say.</div></p>  
<p>&para;One of the company said, Master, speak to my brother, that he divide the inheritance with me. Jesus answered,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?</div></p>  
<p>And he said unto them,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.</div></p>  
<p>And he spake a parable:</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully: and he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits.</p>  
<p>And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods. And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, <i>and</i> be merry.</p>  
<p>But God said unto him, <i>Thou</i> fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided?</p>  
<p>So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.</div></p>  
<p><a name="page_78"><font size="1" color="green">p. 78</font></A></p>  
<p>&para;Jesus said unto his disciples,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, neither for the body, what ye shall put on. The life is more than meat, and the body <i>is more</i> than raiment.</p>  
<p>Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feedeth them: how much more are ye better than the fowls?</p>  
<p>And which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit? If ye then be not able to do that thing which is least, why take ye thought for the rest?</p>  
<p>Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they spin not; and yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. If then God so clothe the grass, which is to day in the field, and to morrow is cast into the oven; how much more <i>will he clothe</i> you, O ye of little faith?</p>  
<p>And seek not ye what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, neither be ye of doubtful mind. For all these things do the nations of the world seek after; and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things.</p>  
<p>&para;But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things shall be added unto you.</p>  
<p>Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom. Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</p>  
<p>Let your loins be girded about, and <i>your</i> lights burning; and ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him immediately.</p>  
<p>Blessed <i>are</i> those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them. And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third watch, and find <i>them</i> so, blessed are those servants. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_66"></A><A HREF="#fn_63"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A>And this know, that if the goodman of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and not have suffered his house to be broken through. Be ye therefore ready also; for the Son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not.</div></p>

<P><A NAME="fn_63"></A><A HREF="csj054.htm#fr_66">78:*</A> This paragraph and the first four paragraphs of LII furnish an interesting comparison with a similar passage near the end of LXXII in this book (being Matthew 24, 43-51).</P>
