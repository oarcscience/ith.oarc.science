### LXI

### DIVORCE DENOUNCED: JESUS ANSWERS PHARISEES

A.D. 30. Age 33. *Perea*.

Mark 10, 1-12: Matthew 19, 1-12.

INTO the coasts of Judea by the farther side of Jordan, multitudes
followed Jesus: and the people resort unto him; and, as he was wont, he
taught them.

¶The Pharisees also came, and tempting him asked Jesus, Is it lawful for
a man to put away his wife for every cause? <span
id="fr_77"></span>[\*](#fn_74) He answered,

<div class="jesussaid">

What did Moses command you?

</div>

They said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and to put her
away. Jesus answered,

<div class="jesussaid">

For the hardness of your heart he wrote you his precept. But from the
beginning of creation God made them male and female. For this cause
shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife.

Have ye not read, that he which made *them* at the beginning made them
male and female, and said, For this cause shall man leave father and
mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?
So then they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath
joined together, let no man put asunder.

</div>

They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of
divorcement and to put her away? He saith,

<div class="jesussaid">

Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away
your wives: but from the beginning it was not so. And I say unto you,
Whosoever shall put away his wife, except *it be* for fornication, and
shall marry another, committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth her which
is put away doth commit adultery.

</div>

In the house his disciples asked Jesus again of the same *matter*. He
saith,

<div class="jesussaid">

Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth
adultery against her. And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be
married to another, she committeth adultery.

</div>

The disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with his wife,
it is not good to marry. But Jesus answered,

<div class="jesussaid">

All *men* cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given. For
there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and
there are some eunuchs which were made eunuchs of men:

</div>

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

<div class="jesussaid">

and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom
of heaven's sake.

He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.

</div>

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_74"></span>[95:\*](csj064.htm#fr_77) The account of this
episode in Mark 10 gains interest by comparison with that in Matthew 19.
See also Matthew 5, 31-32; and Luke 16, 18.
