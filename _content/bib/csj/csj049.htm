<p align="center">A.D. 29. Age 32. <i>Jerusalem</i>.</p>  
<p align="center"><FONT SIZE="-1">John 8, 2-59.</FONT></p>  
<p>EARLY in the morning Jesus came again into the temple. The people came; and he sat down, and taught them.</p>  
<p>&para;The scribes and Pharisees brought a woman taken in adultery.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_60"></A><A HREF="#fn_57"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A> They say unto Jesus, Master, Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?</p>  
<p>This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him.</p>  
<p>But Jesus stooped, and with his finger wrote on the ground, <i>as though he heard them not</i>. So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.</div></p>  
<p>Again Jesus stooped, and wrote on the ground. And they, being convicted by <i>their own conscience</i>, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest: Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.</p>  
<p>When he had lifited up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?</div></p>  
<p>She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.</div></p>  
<p>

<p>&para;Jesus spake again unto the people, saying,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.</div></p>  
<p>The Pharisees therefore said, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true. Jesus answered,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Though I bear record of myself, <i>yet</i> my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.</p>  
<p>Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man. And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.</p>  
<p>It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true. I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.</div></p>  
<p>Then said they, Where is thy father? Jesus answered,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also.</div></p>  
<p>These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come. Then said Jesus again,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.</div></p>  
<p>Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come. And he said,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world. I said therefore unto you that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am <i>he</i>, ye shall die in your sins.</div></p>  
<p>Then said they, Who art thou? And Jesus answered,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Even <i>the same</i> that I said unto you from the beginning.</p>  
<p>I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.</div></p>  
<p>They understood not that he spake to them of the Father. Then said Jesus,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am <i>he</i>, and <i>that</i> I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things. And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.</div></p>  
<p><a name="page_67"><font size="1" color="green">p. 67</font></A></p>  
<p>As he spake these words, many believed. Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">If ye continue in my word, <i>then</i> are ye my disciples indeed; and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.</div></p>  
<p>&para;They answered, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free? Jesus answered,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin. And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: <i>but</i> the Son abideth ever. If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.</p>  
<p>I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you. I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.</div></p>  
<p>They answered, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham. But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham. Ye do the deeds of your father.</div></p>  
<p>Then they said, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, <i>even</i> God. Jesus answered,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.</p>  
<p>Why do ye not understand my speech? <i>even</i> because ye cannot hear my word. Ye are of <i>your</i> father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do: he was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.</p>  
<p>And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not. Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me? He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God.</div></p>  
<p>Then answered the Jews, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil? Jesus answered,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">I have not a devil; but I honor my Father, and ye do dishonor me. And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.</p>  
<p>Verily, verily, I say unto you, if a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.</div></p>  
<p>Then said the Jews, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets, and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall</p>  
<p><a name="page_68"><font size="1" color="green">p. 68</font></A></p>  
<p>never taste of death. Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: who makest thou thyself? Jesus answered,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">If I honor myself, my honor is nothing: it is my Father that honoreth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God: yet ye have not known him: but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you; but I know him, and keep his saying. Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day; and he saw <i>it</i>, and was glad.</div></p>  
<p>Then said the Jews, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham? Jesus answered,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Verily, verily I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.</div></p>  
<p>They took up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.</p>
