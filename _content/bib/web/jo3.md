### World English Bible: 3 John

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> The elder to Gaius the beloved, whom I love
in truth.

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> Beloved, I pray that you may prosper in all
things and be healthy, even as your soul prospers.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> For I rejoiced greatly, when brothers came
and testified about your truth, even as you walk in truth.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> I have no greater joy than this, to hear
about my children walking in truth.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> Beloved, you do a faithful work in whatever
you accomplish for those who are brothers and strangers.

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> They have testified about your love before
the assembly. You will do well to send them forward on their journey in
a way worthy of God,

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> because for the sake of the Name they went
out, taking nothing from the Gentiles.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> We therefore ought to receive such, that we
may be fellow workers for the truth.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> I wrote to the assembly, but Diotrephes,
who loves to be first among them, doesn't accept what we say.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> Therefore, if I come, I will call
attention to his deeds which he does, unjustly accusing us with wicked
words. Not content with this, neither does he himself receive the
brothers, and those who would, he forbids and throws out of the
assembly.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> Beloved, don't imitate that which is
evil, but that which is good. He who does good is of God. He who does
evil hasn't seen God.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> Demetrius has the testimony of all, and
of the truth itself; yes, we also testify, and you know that our
testimony is true.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> I had many things to write to you, but I
am unwilling to write to you with ink and pen;

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> but I hope to see you soon, and we will
speak face to face. Peace be to you. The friends greet you. Greet the
friends by name.
