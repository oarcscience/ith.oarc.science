<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's chosen ones, and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;in hope of eternal life, which God, who can't lie, promised before time began;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;but in his own time revealed his word in the message with which I was entrusted according to the commandment of God our Savior;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;to Titus, my true child according to a common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;I left you in Crete for this reason, that you would set in order the things that were lacking, and appoint elders in every city, as I directed you;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;if anyone is blameless, the husband of one wife, having children who believe, who are not accused of loose or unruly behavior.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;For the overseer must be blameless, as God's steward; not self-pleasing, not easily angered, not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for dishonest gain;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;but given to hospitality, a lover of good, sober minded, fair, holy, self-controlled;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, that he may be able to exhort in the sound doctrine, and to convict those who contradict him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:10">1:10</A>&nbsp;For there are also many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:11">1:11</A>&nbsp;whose mouths must be stopped; men who overthrow whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for dishonest gain's sake.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:12">1:12</A>&nbsp;One of them, a prophet of their own, said, "Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, and idle gluttons."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:13">1:13</A>&nbsp;This testimony is true. For this cause, reprove them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:14">1:14</A>&nbsp;not paying attention to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn away from the truth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:15">1:15</A>&nbsp;To the pure, all things are pure; but to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; but both their mind and their conscience are defiled.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:16">1:16</A>&nbsp;They profess that they know God, but by their works they deny him, being abominable, disobedient, and unfit for any good work.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:1">2:1</A>&nbsp;But say the things which fit sound doctrine,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:2">2:2</A>&nbsp;that older men should be temperate, sensible, sober minded, sound in faith, in love, and in patience:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:3">2:3</A>&nbsp;and that older women likewise be reverent in behavior, not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine, teachers of that which is good;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:4">2:4</A>&nbsp;that they may train the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:5">2:5</A>&nbsp;to be sober minded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in subjection to their own husbands, that God's word may not be blasphemed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:6">2:6</A>&nbsp;Likewise, exhort the younger men to be sober minded;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:7">2:7</A>&nbsp;in all things showing yourself an example of good works; in your teaching showing integrity, seriousness, incorruptibility,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:8">2:8</A>&nbsp;and soundness of speech that can't be condemned; that he who opposes you may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say about us.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:9">2:9</A>&nbsp;Exhort servants to be in subjection to their own masters, and to be well-pleasing in all things; not contradicting;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:10">2:10</A>&nbsp;not stealing, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God, our Savior, in all things.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:11">2:11</A>&nbsp;For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:12">2:12</A>&nbsp;instructing us to the intent that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we would live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:13">2:13</A>&nbsp;looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:14">2:14</A>&nbsp;who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify for himself a people for his own possession, zealous for good works.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:15">2:15</A>&nbsp;Say these things and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no man despise you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:1">3:1</A>&nbsp;Remind them to be in subjection to rulers and to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:2">3:2</A>&nbsp;to speak evil of no one, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all humility toward all men.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:3">3:3</A>&nbsp;For we were also once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:4">3:4</A>&nbsp;But when the kindness of God our Savior and his love toward mankind appeared,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:5">3:5</A>&nbsp;not by works of righteousness, which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy, he saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:6">3:6</A>&nbsp;whom he poured out on us richly, through Jesus Christ our Savior;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:7">3:7</A>&nbsp;that, being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:8">3:8</A>&nbsp;This saying is faithful, and concerning these things I desire that you affirm confidently, so that those who have believed God may be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:9">3:9</A>&nbsp;but shun foolish questionings, genealogies, strife, and disputes about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:10">3:10</A>&nbsp;Avoid a factious man after a first and second warning;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:11">3:11</A>&nbsp;knowing that such a one is perverted, and sins, being self-condemned.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:12">3:12</A>&nbsp;When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis, for I have determined to winter there.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:13">3:13</A>&nbsp;Send Zenas, the lawyer, and Apollos on their journey speedily, that nothing may be lacking for them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:14">3:14</A>&nbsp;Let our people also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they may not be unfruitful.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:15">3:15</A>&nbsp;All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.</p>
