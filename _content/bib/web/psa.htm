<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;Blessed is the man who doesn't walk in the counsel of the wicked, nor stand in the way of sinners, nor sit in the seat of scoffers;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;but his delight is in Yahweh's law. On his law he meditates day and night.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;He will be like a tree planted by the streams of water, that brings forth its fruit in its season, whose leaf also does not wither. Whatever he does shall prosper.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;The wicked are not so, but are like the chaff which the wind drives away.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;For Yahweh knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked shall perish.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:1">2:1</A>&nbsp;Why do the nations rage, and the peoples plot a vain thing?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:2">2:2</A>&nbsp;The kings of the earth take a stand, and the rulers take counsel together, against Yahweh, and against his Anointed, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:3">2:3</A>&nbsp;"Let's break their bonds apart, and cast their cords from us."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:4">2:4</A>&nbsp;He who sits in the heavens will laugh. The Lord will have them in derision.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:5">2:5</A>&nbsp;Then he will speak to them in his anger, and terrify them in his wrath:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:6">2:6</A>&nbsp;"Yet I have set my King on my holy hill of Zion."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:7">2:7</A>&nbsp;I will tell of the decree. Yahweh said to me, "You are my son. Today I have become your father.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:8">2:8</A>&nbsp;Ask of me, and I will give the nations for your inheritance, the uttermost parts of the earth for your possession.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:9">2:9</A>&nbsp;You shall break them with a rod of iron. You shall dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:10">2:10</A>&nbsp;Now therefore be wise, you kings. Be instructed, you judges of the earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:11">2:11</A>&nbsp;Serve Yahweh with fear, and rejoice with trembling.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:12">2:12</A>&nbsp;Give sincere homage to the Son, lest he be angry, and you perish in the way, for his wrath will soon be kindled. Blessed are all those who take refuge in him. A Psalm by David, when he fled from Absalom his son.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:1">3:1</A>&nbsp;Yahweh, how my adversaries have increased! Many are those who rise up against me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:2">3:2</A>&nbsp;Many there are who say of my soul, "There is no help for him in God." Selah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:3">3:3</A>&nbsp;But you, Yahweh, are a shield around me, my glory, and the one who lifts up my head.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:4">3:4</A>&nbsp;I cry to Yahweh with my voice, and he answers me out of his holy hill. Selah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:5">3:5</A>&nbsp;I laid myself down and slept. I awakened; for Yahweh sustains me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:6">3:6</A>&nbsp;I will not be afraid of tens of thousands of people who have set themselves against me on every side.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:7">3:7</A>&nbsp;Arise, Yahweh! Save me, my God! For you have struck all of my enemies on the cheek bone. You have broken the teeth of the wicked.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:8">3:8</A>&nbsp;Salvation belongs to Yahweh. Your blessing be on your people. Selah. For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments. A Psalm by David.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:1">4:1</A>&nbsp;Answer me when I call, God of my righteousness. Give me relief from my distress. Have mercy on me, and hear my prayer.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:2">4:2</A>&nbsp;You sons of men, how long shall my glory be turned into dishonor? Will you love vanity, and seek after falsehood? Selah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:3">4:3</A>&nbsp;But know that Yahweh has set apart for himself him who is godly: Yahweh will hear when I call to him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:4">4:4</A>&nbsp;Stand in awe, and don't sin. Search your own heart on your bed, and be still. Selah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:5">4:5</A>&nbsp;Offer the sacrifices of righteousness. Put your trust in Yahweh.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:6">4:6</A>&nbsp;Many say, "Who will show us any good?" Yahweh, let the light of your face shine on us.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:7">4:7</A>&nbsp;You have put gladness in my heart, more than when their grain and their new wine are increased.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:8">4:8</A>&nbsp;In peace I will both lay myself down and sleep, for you, Yahweh alone, make me live in safety. For the Chief Musician, with the flutes. A Psalm by David.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:1">5:1</A>&nbsp;Give ear to my words, Yahweh. Consider my meditation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:2">5:2</A>&nbsp;Listen to the voice of my cry, my King and my God; for to you do I pray.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:3">5:3</A>&nbsp;Yahweh, in the morning you shall hear my voice. In the morning I will lay my requests before you, and will watch expectantly.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:4">5:4</A>&nbsp;For you are not a God who has pleasure in wickedness. Evil can't live with you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:5">5:5</A>&nbsp;The arrogant shall not stand in your sight. You hate all workers of iniquity.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:6">5:6</A>&nbsp;You will destroy those who speak lies. Yahweh abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful man.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:7">5:7</A>&nbsp;But as for me, in the abundance of your loving kindness I will come into your house. I will bow toward your holy temple in reverence of you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:8">5:8</A>&nbsp;Lead me, Yahweh, in your righteousness because of my enemies. Make your way straight before my face.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:9">5:9</A>&nbsp;For there is no faithfulness in their mouth. Their heart is destruction. Their throat is an open tomb. They flatter with their tongue.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:10">5:10</A>&nbsp;Hold them guilty, God. Let them fall by their own counsels; Thrust them out in the multitude of their transgressions, for they have rebelled against you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:11">5:11</A>&nbsp;But let all those who take refuge in you rejoice, Let them always shout for joy, because you defend them. Let them also who love your name be joyful in you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:12">5:12</A>&nbsp;For you will bless the righteous. Yahweh, you will surround him with favor as with a shield. For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments, upon the eight-stringed lyre. A Psalm by David.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:1">6:1</A>&nbsp;Yahweh, don't rebuke me in your anger, neither discipline me in your wrath.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:2">6:2</A>&nbsp;Have mercy on me, Yahweh, for I am faint. Yahweh, heal me, for my bones are troubled.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:3">6:3</A>&nbsp;My soul is also in great anguish. But you, Yahweh--how long?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:4">6:4</A>&nbsp;Return, Yahweh. Deliver my soul, and save me for your loving kindness' sake.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:5">6:5</A>&nbsp;For in death there is no memory of you. In Sheol, who shall give you thanks?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:6">6:6</A>&nbsp;I am weary with my groaning. Every night I flood my bed. I drench my couch with my tears.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:7">6:7</A>&nbsp;My eye wastes away because of grief. It grows old because of all my adversaries.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:8">6:8</A>&nbsp;Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity, for Yahweh has heard the voice of my weeping.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:9">6:9</A>&nbsp;Yahweh has heard my supplication. Yahweh accepts my prayer.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:10">6:10</A>&nbsp;May all my enemies be ashamed and dismayed. They shall turn back, they shall be disgraced suddenly. A meditation by David, which he sang to Yahweh, concerning the words of Cush, the Benjamite.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:1">7:1</A>&nbsp;Yahweh, my God, I take refuge in you. Save me from all those who pursue me, and deliver me,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:2">7:2</A>&nbsp;lest they tear apart my soul like a lion, ripping it in pieces, while there is none to deliver.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:3">7:3</A>&nbsp;Yahweh, my God, if I have done this, if there is iniquity in my hands,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:4">7:4</A>&nbsp;if I have rewarded evil to him who was at peace with me (yes, if I have delivered him who without cause was my adversary),</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:5">7:5</A>&nbsp;let the enemy pursue my soul, and overtake it; yes, let him tread my life down to the earth, and lay my glory in the dust. Selah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:6">7:6</A>&nbsp;Arise, Yahweh, in your anger. Lift up yourself against the rage of my adversaries. Awake for me. You have commanded judgment.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:7">7:7</A>&nbsp;Let the congregation of the peoples surround you. Rule over them on high.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:8">7:8</A>&nbsp;Yahweh administers judgment to the peoples. Judge me, Yahweh, according to my righteousness, and to my integrity that is in me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:9">7:9</A>&nbsp;Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end, but establish the righteous; their minds and hearts are searched by the righteous God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:10">7:10</A>&nbsp;My shield is with God, who saves the upright in heart.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:11">7:11</A>&nbsp;God is a righteous judge, yes, a God who has indignation every day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:12">7:12</A>&nbsp;If a man doesn't relent, he will sharpen his sword; he has bent and strung his bow.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:13">7:13</A>&nbsp;He has also prepared for himself the instruments of death. He makes ready his flaming arrows.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:14">7:14</A>&nbsp;Behold, he travails with iniquity. Yes, he has conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:15">7:15</A>&nbsp;He has dug a hole, and has fallen into the pit which he made.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:16">7:16</A>&nbsp;The trouble he causes shall return to his own head. His violence shall come down on the crown of his own head.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:17">7:17</A>&nbsp;I will give thanks to Yahweh according to his righteousness, and will sing praise to the name of Yahweh Most High. For the Chief Musician; on an instrument of Gath. A Psalm by David.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:1">8:1</A>&nbsp;Yahweh, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth, who has set your glory above the heavens!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:2">8:2</A>&nbsp;From the lips of babes and infants you have established strength, because of your adversaries, that you might silence the enemy and the avenger.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:3">8:3</A>&nbsp;When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have ordained;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:4">8:4</A>&nbsp;what is man, that you think of him? What is the son of man, that you care for him?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:5">8:5</A>&nbsp;For you have made him a little lower than God, and crowned him with glory and honor.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:6">8:6</A>&nbsp;You make him ruler over the works of your hands. You have put all things under his feet:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:7">8:7</A>&nbsp;All sheep and cattle, yes, and the animals of the field,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:8">8:8</A>&nbsp;The birds of the sky, the fish of the sea, and whatever passes through the paths of the seas.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:9">8:9</A>&nbsp;Yahweh, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth! For the Chief Musician. Set to "The Death of the Son." A Psalm by David.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:1">9:1</A>&nbsp;I will give thanks to Yahweh with my whole heart. I will tell of all your marvelous works.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:2">9:2</A>&nbsp;I will be glad and rejoice in you. I will sing praise to your name, O Most High.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:3">9:3</A>&nbsp;When my enemies turn back, they stumble and perish in your presence.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:4">9:4</A>&nbsp;For you have maintained my just cause. You sit on the throne judging righteously.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:5">9:5</A>&nbsp;You have rebuked the nations. You have destroyed the wicked. You have blotted out their name forever and ever.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:6">9:6</A>&nbsp;The enemy is overtaken by endless ruin. The very memory of the cities which you have overthrown has perished.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:7">9:7</A>&nbsp;But Yahweh reigns forever. He has prepared his throne for judgment.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:8">9:8</A>&nbsp;He will judge the world in righteousness. He will administer judgment to the peoples in uprightness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:9">9:9</A>&nbsp;Yahweh will also be a high tower for the oppressed; a high tower in times of trouble.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:10">9:10</A>&nbsp;Those who know your name will put their trust in you, for you, Yahweh, have not forsaken those who seek you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:11">9:11</A>&nbsp;Sing praises to Yahweh, who dwells in Zion, and declare among the people what he has done.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:12">9:12</A>&nbsp;For he who avenges blood remembers them. He doesn't forget the cry of the afflicted.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:13">9:13</A>&nbsp;Have mercy on me, Yahweh. See my affliction by those who hate me, and lift me up from the gates of death;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:14">9:14</A>&nbsp;that I may show forth all your praise. In the gates of the daughter of Zion, I will rejoice in your salvation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:15">9:15</A>&nbsp;The nations have sunk down in the pit that they made. In the net which they hid, their own foot is taken.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:16">9:16</A>&nbsp;Yahweh has made himself known. He has executed judgment. The wicked is snared by the work of his own hands. Meditation. Selah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:17">9:17</A>&nbsp;The wicked shall be turned back to Sheol, even all the nations that forget God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:18">9:18</A>&nbsp;For the needy shall not always be forgotten, nor the hope of the poor perish forever.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:19">9:19</A>&nbsp;Arise, Yahweh! Don't let man prevail. Let the nations be judged in your sight.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:20">9:20</A>&nbsp;Put them in fear, Yahweh. Let the nations know that they are only men. Selah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:1">10:1</A>&nbsp;Why do you stand far off, Yahweh? Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:2">10:2</A>&nbsp;In arrogance, the wicked hunt down the weak. They are caught in the schemes that they devise.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:3">10:3</A>&nbsp;For the wicked boasts of his heart's cravings. He blesses the greedy, and condemns Yahweh.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:4">10:4</A>&nbsp;The wicked, in the pride of his face, has no room in his thoughts for God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:5">10:5</A>&nbsp;His ways are prosperous at all times. He is haughty, and your laws are far from his sight. As for all his adversaries, he sneers at them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:6">10:6</A>&nbsp;He says in his heart, "I shall not be shaken. For generations I shall have no trouble."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:7">10:7</A>&nbsp;His mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and oppression. Under his tongue is mischief and iniquity.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:8">10:8</A>&nbsp;He lies in wait near the villages. From ambushes, he murders the innocent. His eyes are secretly set against the helpless.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:9">10:9</A>&nbsp;He lurks in secret as a lion in his ambush. He lies in wait to catch the helpless. He catches the helpless, when he draws him in his net.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:10">10:10</A>&nbsp;The helpless are crushed. They collapse. They fall under his strength.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:11">10:11</A>&nbsp;He says in his heart, "God has forgotten. He hides his face. He will never see it."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:12">10:12</A>&nbsp;Arise, Yahweh! God, lift up your hand! Don't forget the helpless.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:13">10:13</A>&nbsp;Why does the wicked person condemn God, and say in his heart, "God won't call me into account?"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:14">10:14</A>&nbsp;But you do see trouble and grief. You consider it to take it into your hand. You help the victim and the fatherless.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:15">10:15</A>&nbsp;Break the arm of the wicked. As for the evil man, seek out his wickedness until you find none.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:16">10:16</A>&nbsp;Yahweh is King forever and ever! The nations will perish out of his land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:17">10:17</A>&nbsp;Yahweh, you have heard the desire of the humble. You will prepare their heart. You will cause your ear to hear,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:18">10:18</A>&nbsp;to judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that man who is of the earth may terrify no more. For the Chief Musician. By David.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:1">11:1</A>&nbsp;In Yahweh, I take refuge. How can you say to my soul, "Flee as a bird to your mountain!"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:2">11:2</A>&nbsp;For, behold, the wicked bend their bows. They set their arrows on the strings, that they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:3">11:3</A>&nbsp;If the foundations are destroyed, what can the righteous do?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:4">11:4</A>&nbsp;Yahweh is in his holy temple. Yahweh is on his throne in heaven. His eyes observe. His eyes examine the children of men.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:5">11:5</A>&nbsp;Yahweh examines the righteous, but the wicked and him who loves violence his soul hates.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:6">11:6</A>&nbsp;On the wicked he will rain blazing coals; fire, sulfur, and scorching wind shall be the portion of their cup.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:7">11:7</A>&nbsp;For Yahweh is righteous. He loves righteousness. The upright shall see his face. For the Chief Musician; upon an eight-stringed lyre. A Psalm of David.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:1">12:1</A>&nbsp;Help, Yahweh; for the godly man ceases. For the faithful fail from among the children of men.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:2">12:2</A>&nbsp;Everyone lies to his neighbor. They speak with flattering lips, and with a double heart.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:3">12:3</A>&nbsp;May Yahweh cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that boasts,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:4">12:4</A>&nbsp;who have said, "With our tongue we will prevail. Our lips are our own. Who is lord over us?"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:5">12:5</A>&nbsp;"Because of the oppression of the weak and because of the groaning of the needy, I will now arise," says Yahweh; "I will set him in safety from those who malign him."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:6">12:6</A>&nbsp;The words of Yahweh are flawless words, as silver refined in a clay furnace, purified seven times.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:7">12:7</A>&nbsp;You will keep them, Yahweh. You will preserve them from this generation forever.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:8">12:8</A>&nbsp;The wicked walk on every side, when what is vile is exalted among the sons of men. For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:1">13:1</A>&nbsp;How long, Yahweh? Will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:2">13:2</A>&nbsp;How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart every day? How long shall my enemy triumph over me?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:3">13:3</A>&nbsp;Behold, and answer me, Yahweh, my God. Give light to my eyes, lest I sleep in death;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:4">13:4</A>&nbsp;Lest my enemy say, "I have prevailed against him;" Lest my adversaries rejoice when I fall.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:5">13:5</A>&nbsp;But I trust in your loving kindness. My heart rejoices in your salvation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:6">13:6</A>&nbsp;I will sing to Yahweh, because he has been good to me. For the Chief Musician. By David.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:1">14:1</A>&nbsp;The fool has said in his heart, "There is no God." They are corrupt. They have done abominable works. There is none who does good.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:2">14:2</A>&nbsp;Yahweh looked down from heaven on the children of men, to see if there were any who did understand, who did seek after God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:3">14:3</A>&nbsp;They have all gone aside. They have together become corrupt. There is none who does good, no, not one.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:4">14:4</A>&nbsp;Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge, who eat up my people as they eat bread, and don't call on Yahweh?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:5">14:5</A>&nbsp;There they were in great fear, for God is in the generation of the righteous.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:6">14:6</A>&nbsp;You frustrate the plan of the poor, because Yahweh is his refuge.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:7">14:7</A>&nbsp;Oh that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion! When Yahweh restores the fortunes of his people, then Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad. A Psalm by David.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:1">15:1</A>&nbsp;Yahweh, who shall dwell in your sanctuary? Who shall live on your holy hill?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:2">15:2</A>&nbsp;He who walks blamelessly does what is right, and speaks truth in his heart;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:3">15:3</A>&nbsp;He who doesn't slander with his tongue, nor does evil to his friend, nor casts slurs against his fellow man;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:4">15:4</A>&nbsp;In whose eyes a vile man is despised, but who honors those who fear Yahweh; he who keeps an oath even when it hurts, and doesn't change;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:5">15:5</A>&nbsp;he who doesn't lend out his money for usury, nor take a bribe against the innocent. He who does these things shall never be shaken. A Poem by David.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:1">16:1</A>&nbsp;Preserve me, God, for in you do I take refuge.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:2">16:2</A>&nbsp;My soul, you have said to Yahweh, "You are my Lord. Apart from you I have no good thing."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:3">16:3</A>&nbsp;As for the saints who are in the earth, they are the excellent ones in whom is all my delight.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:4">16:4</A>&nbsp;Their sorrows shall be multiplied who give gifts to another god. Their drink offerings of blood I will not offer, nor take their names on my lips.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:5">16:5</A>&nbsp;Yahweh assigned my portion and my cup. You made my lot secure.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:6">16:6</A>&nbsp;The lines have fallen to me in pleasant places. Yes, I have a good inheritance.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_73:2">73:2</A>&nbsp;But as for me, my feet were almost gone. My steps had nearly slipped.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_73:3">73:3</A>&nbsp;For I was envious of the arrogant, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_73:4">73:4</A>&nbsp;For there are no struggles in their death, but their strength is firm.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_73:5">73:5</A>&nbsp;They are free from burdens of men, neither are they plagued like other men.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_73:6">73:6</A>&nbsp;Therefore pride is like a chain around their neck. Violence covers them like a garment.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_73:7">73:7</A>&nbsp;Their eyes bulge with fat. Their minds pass the limits of conceit.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_73:8">73:8</A>&nbsp;They scoff and speak with malice. In arrogance, they threaten oppression.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_73:9">73:9</A>&nbsp;They have set their mouth in the heavens. Their tongue walks through the earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_73:10">73:10</A>&nbsp;Therefore their people return to them, and they drink up waters of abundance.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_73:11">73:11</A>&nbsp;They say, "How does God know? Is there knowledge in the Most High?"</p>

<p><A NAME="an_73:14">73:14</A>&nbsp;For all day long have I been plagued, and punished every morning.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_73:15">73:15</A>&nbsp;If I had said, "I will speak thus;" behold, I would have betrayed the generation of your children.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_73:18">73:18</A>&nbsp;Surely you set them in slippery places. You throw them down to destruction.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_73:19">73:19</A>&nbsp;How they are suddenly destroyed! They are completely swept away with terrors.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_73:20">73:20</A>&nbsp;As a dream when one wakes up, so, Lord, when you awake, you will despise their fantasies.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_73:23">73:23</A>&nbsp;Nevertheless, I am continually with you. You have held my right hand.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_73:24">73:24</A>&nbsp;You will guide me with your counsel, and afterward receive me to glory.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_73:25">73:25</A>&nbsp;Who do I have in heaven? There is no one on earth who I desire besides you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_73:26">73:26</A>&nbsp;My flesh and my heart fails, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_73:27">73:27</A>&nbsp;For, behold, those who are far from you shall perish. You have destroyed all those who are unfaithful to you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_73:28">73:28</A>&nbsp;But it is good for me to come close to God. I have made the Lord Yahweh my refuge, that I may tell of all your works. A contemplation by Asaph.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_74:1">74:1</A>&nbsp;God, why have you rejected us forever? Why does your anger smolder against the sheep of your pasture?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_74:2">74:2</A>&nbsp;Remember your congregation, which you purchased of old, which you have redeemed to be the tribe of your inheritance; Mount Zion, in which you have lived.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_74:3">74:3</A>&nbsp;Lift up your feet to the perpetual ruins, all the evil that the enemy has done in the sanctuary.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_74:4">74:4</A>&nbsp;Your adversaries have roared in the midst of your assembly. They have set up their standards as signs.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_74:5">74:5</A>&nbsp;They behaved like men wielding axes, cutting through a thicket of trees.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_74:6">74:6</A>&nbsp;Now they break all its carved work down with hatchet and hammers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_74:7">74:7</A>&nbsp;They have burned your sanctuary to the ground. They have profaned the dwelling place of your Name.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_74:8">74:8</A>&nbsp;They said in their heart, "We will crush them completely." They have burned up all the places in the land where God was worshiped.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_74:9">74:9</A>&nbsp;We see no miraculous signs. There is no longer any prophet, neither is there among us anyone who knows how long.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_74:11">74:11</A>&nbsp;Why do you draw back your hand, even your right hand? Take it out of your pocket and consume them!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_74:12">74:12</A>&nbsp;Yet God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_74:14">74:14</A>&nbsp;You broke the heads of Leviathan in pieces. You gave him as food to people and desert creatures.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_74:15">74:15</A>&nbsp;You opened up spring and stream. You dried up mighty rivers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_74:16">74:16</A>&nbsp;The day is yours, the night is also yours. You have prepared the light and the sun.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_74:17">74:17</A>&nbsp;You have set all the boundaries of the earth. You have made summer and winter.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_74:18">74:18</A>&nbsp;Remember this, that the enemy has mocked you, Yahweh. Foolish people have blasphemed your name.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_74:19">74:19</A>&nbsp;Don't deliver the soul of your dove to wild beasts. Don't forget the life of your poor forever.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_74:20">74:20</A>&nbsp;Honor your covenant, for haunts of violence fill the dark places of the earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_74:21">74:21</A>&nbsp;Don't let the oppressed return ashamed. Let the poor and needy praise your name.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_74:22">74:22</A>&nbsp;Arise, God! Plead your own cause. Remember how the foolish man mocks you all day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_74:23">74:23</A>&nbsp;Don't forget the voice of your adversaries. The tumult of those who rise up against you ascends continually. For the Chief Musician. To the tune of "Do Not Destroy." A Psalm by Asaph. A song.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_75:1">75:1</A>&nbsp;We give thanks to you, God. We give thanks, for your Name is near. Men tell about your wondrous works.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_75:2">75:2</A>&nbsp;When I choose the appointed time, I will judge blamelessly.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_75:3">75:3</A>&nbsp;The earth and all its inhabitants quake. I firmly hold its pillars. Selah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_75:4">75:4</A>&nbsp;I said to the arrogant, "Don't boast!" I said to the wicked, "Don't lift up the horn.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_75:5">75:5</A>&nbsp;Don't lift up your horn on high. Don't speak with a stiff neck."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_75:6">75:6</A>&nbsp;For neither from the east, nor from the west, nor yet from the south, comes exaltation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_75:7">75:7</A>&nbsp;But God is the judge. He puts down one, and lifts up another.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_75:8">75:8</A>&nbsp;For in the hand of Yahweh there is a cup, full of foaming wine mixed with spices. He pours it out. Indeed the wicked of the earth drink and drink it to its very dregs.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_75:9">75:9</A>&nbsp;But I will declare this forever: I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_75:10">75:10</A>&nbsp;I will cut off all the horns of the wicked, but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up. For the Chief Musician. On stringed instruments. A Psalm by Asaph. A song.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_76:1">76:1</A>&nbsp;In Judah, God is known. His name is great in Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_76:2">76:2</A>&nbsp;His tabernacle is also in Salem; His dwelling place in Zion.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_76:3">76:3</A>&nbsp;There he broke the flaming arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the weapons of war. Selah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_76:4">76:4</A>&nbsp;Glorious are you, and excellent, more than mountains of game.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_76:5">76:5</A>&nbsp;Valiant men lie plundered, they have slept their last sleep. None of the men of war can lift their hands.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_76:6">76:6</A>&nbsp;At your rebuke, God of Jacob, both chariot and horse are cast into a deep sleep.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_76:7">76:7</A>&nbsp;You, even you, are to be feared. Who can stand in your sight when you are angry?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_76:8">76:8</A>&nbsp;You pronounced judgment from heaven. The earth feared, and was silent,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_76:9">76:9</A>&nbsp;when God arose to judgment, to save all the afflicted ones of the earth. Selah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_76:10">76:10</A>&nbsp;Surely the wrath of man praises you. The survivors of your wrath are restrained.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_77:1">77:1</A>&nbsp;My cry goes to God! Indeed, I cry to God for help, and for him to listen to me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:2">77:2</A>&nbsp;In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord. My hand was stretched out in the night, and didn't get tired. My soul refused to be comforted.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:3">77:3</A>&nbsp;I remember God, and I groan. I complain, and my spirit is overwhelmed. Selah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:4">77:4</A>&nbsp;You hold my eyelids open. I am so troubled that I can't speak.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:5">77:5</A>&nbsp;I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:6">77:6</A>&nbsp;I remember my song in the night. I consider in my own heart; my spirit diligently inquires:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:7">77:7</A>&nbsp;"Will the Lord reject us forever? Will he be favorable no more?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:8">77:8</A>&nbsp;Has his loving kindness vanished forever? Does his promise fail for generations?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:9">77:9</A>&nbsp;Has God forgotten to be gracious? Has he, in anger, withheld his compassion?" Selah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:10">77:10</A>&nbsp;Then I thought, "I will appeal to this: the years of the right hand of the Most High."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:11">77:11</A>&nbsp;I will remember Yah's deeds; for I will remember your wonders of old.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:12">77:12</A>&nbsp;I will also meditate on all your work, and consider your doings.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:13">77:13</A>&nbsp;Your way, God, is in the sanctuary. What god is great like God?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:14">77:14</A>&nbsp;You are the God who does wonders. You have made your strength known among the peoples.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:15">77:15</A>&nbsp;You have redeemed your people with your arm, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:16">77:16</A>&nbsp;The waters saw you, God. The waters saw you, and they writhed. The depths also convulsed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:17">77:17</A>&nbsp;The clouds poured out water. The skies resounded with thunder. Your arrows also flashed around.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:18">77:18</A>&nbsp;The voice of your thunder was in the whirlwind. The lightnings lit up the world. The earth trembled and shook.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:19">77:19</A>&nbsp;Your way was through the sea; your paths through the great waters. Your footsteps were not known.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:20">77:20</A>&nbsp;You led your people like a flock, by the hand of Moses and Aaron. A contemplation by Asaph.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:1">78:1</A>&nbsp;Hear my teaching, my people. Turn your ears to the words of my mouth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:2">78:2</A>&nbsp;I will open my mouth in a parable. I will utter dark sayings of old,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:3">78:3</A>&nbsp;Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:4">78:4</A>&nbsp;We will not hide them from their children, telling to the generation to come the praises of Yahweh, his strength, and his wondrous works that he has done.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:5">78:5</A>&nbsp;For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a teaching in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:6">78:6</A>&nbsp;that the generation to come might know, even the children who should be born; who should arise and tell their children,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:7">78:7</A>&nbsp;that they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:8">78:8</A>&nbsp;and might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation that didn't make their hearts loyal, whose spirit was not steadfast with God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:9">78:9</A>&nbsp;The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:10">78:10</A>&nbsp;They didn't keep God's covenant, and refused to walk in his law.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:11">78:11</A>&nbsp;They forgot his doings, his wondrous works that he had shown them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:12">78:12</A>&nbsp;He did marvelous things in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:13">78:13</A>&nbsp;He split the sea, and caused them to pass through. He made the waters stand as a heap.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:14">78:14</A>&nbsp;In the daytime he also led them with a cloud, and all night with a light of fire.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:15">78:15</A>&nbsp;He split rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:16">78:16</A>&nbsp;He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:17">78:17</A>&nbsp;Yet they still went on to sin against him, to rebel against the Most High in the desert.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:18">78:18</A>&nbsp;They tempted God in their heart by asking food according to their desire.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:19">78:19</A>&nbsp;Yes, they spoke against God. They said, "Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:20">78:20</A>&nbsp;Behold, he struck the rock, so that waters gushed out, and streams overflowed. Can he give bread also? Will he provide flesh for his people?"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:21">78:21</A>&nbsp;Therefore Yahweh heard, and was angry. A fire was kindled against Jacob, anger also went up against Israel,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:22">78:22</A>&nbsp;because they didn't believe in God, and didn't trust in his salvation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:23">78:23</A>&nbsp;Yet he commanded the skies above, and opened the doors of heaven.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:24">78:24</A>&nbsp;He rained down manna on them to eat, and gave them food from the sky.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:25">78:25</A>&nbsp;Man ate the bread of angels. He sent them food to the full.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:26">78:26</A>&nbsp;He caused the east wind to blow in the sky. By his power he guided the south wind.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:27">78:27</A>&nbsp;He rained also flesh on them as the dust; winged birds as the sand of the seas.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:28">78:28</A>&nbsp;He let them fall in the midst of their camp, around their habitations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:29">78:29</A>&nbsp;So they ate, and were well filled. He gave them their own desire.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:30">78:30</A>&nbsp;They didn't turn from their cravings. Their food was yet in their mouths,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:31">78:31</A>&nbsp;when the anger of God went up against them, killed some of the fattest of them, and struck down the young men of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:32">78:32</A>&nbsp;For all this they still sinned, and didn't believe in his wondrous works.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:33">78:33</A>&nbsp;Therefore he consumed their days in vanity, and their years in terror.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:34">78:34</A>&nbsp;When he killed them, then they inquired after him. They returned and sought God earnestly.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:35">78:35</A>&nbsp;They remembered that God was their rock, the Most High God, their redeemer.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:36">78:36</A>&nbsp;But they flattered him with their mouth, and lied to him with their tongue.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:37">78:37</A>&nbsp;For their heart was not right with him, neither were they faithful in his covenant.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:38">78:38</A>&nbsp;But he, being merciful, forgave iniquity, and didn't destroy them. Yes, many times he turned his anger away, and didn't stir up all his wrath.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:39">78:39</A>&nbsp;He remembered that they were but flesh, a wind that passes away, and doesn't come again.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:40">78:40</A>&nbsp;How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness, and grieved him in the desert!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:41">78:41</A>&nbsp;They turned again and tempted God, and provoked the Holy One of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:42">78:42</A>&nbsp;They didn't remember his hand, nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:43">78:43</A>&nbsp;how he set his signs in Egypt, his wonders in the field of Zoan,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:44">78:44</A>&nbsp;he turned their rivers into blood, and their streams, so that they could not drink.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:45">78:45</A>&nbsp;He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:46">78:46</A>&nbsp;He gave also their increase to the caterpillar, and their labor to the locust.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:47">78:47</A>&nbsp;He destroyed their vines with hail, their sycamore fig trees with frost.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:48">78:48</A>&nbsp;He gave over their livestock also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:49">78:49</A>&nbsp;He threw on them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, indignation, and trouble, and a band of angels of evil.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:50">78:50</A>&nbsp;He made a path for his anger. He didn't spare their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:51">78:51</A>&nbsp;and struck all the firstborn in Egypt, the chief of their strength in the tents of Ham.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:52">78:52</A>&nbsp;But he led forth his own people like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:53">78:53</A>&nbsp;He led them safely, so that they weren't afraid, but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:54">78:54</A>&nbsp;He brought them to the border of his sanctuary, to this mountain, which his right hand had taken.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:55">78:55</A>&nbsp;He also drove out the nations before them, allotted them for an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:56">78:56</A>&nbsp;Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God, and didn't keep his testimonies;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:57">78:57</A>&nbsp;but turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers. They were turned aside like a deceitful bow.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:58">78:58</A>&nbsp;For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their engraved images.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:59">78:59</A>&nbsp;When God heard this, he was angry, and greatly abhorred Israel;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:60">78:60</A>&nbsp;So that he forsook the tent of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:61">78:61</A>&nbsp;and delivered his strength into captivity, his glory into the adversary's hand.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:62">78:62</A>&nbsp;He also gave his people over to the sword, and was angry with his inheritance.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:63">78:63</A>&nbsp;Fire devoured their young men. Their virgins had no wedding song.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:64">78:64</A>&nbsp;Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows couldn't weep.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:65">78:65</A>&nbsp;Then the Lord awakened as one out of sleep, like a mighty man who shouts by reason of wine.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:66">78:66</A>&nbsp;He struck his adversaries backward. He put them to a perpetual reproach.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:67">78:67</A>&nbsp;Moreover he rejected the tent of Joseph, and didn't choose the tribe of Ephraim,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:68">78:68</A>&nbsp;But chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion which he loved.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:69">78:69</A>&nbsp;He built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth which he has established forever.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:70">78:70</A>&nbsp;He also chose David his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:71">78:71</A>&nbsp;from following the ewes that have their young, he brought him to be the shepherd of Jacob, his people, and Israel, his inheritance.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:72">78:72</A>&nbsp;So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart, and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands. A Psalm by Asaph.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_79:1">79:1</A>&nbsp;God, the nations have come into your inheritance. They have defiled your holy temple. They have laid Jerusalem in heaps.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_79:2">79:2</A>&nbsp;They have given the dead bodies of your servants to be food for the birds of the sky, the flesh of your saints to the animals of the earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_79:3">79:3</A>&nbsp;Their blood they have shed like water around Jerusalem. There was no one to bury them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_79:4">79:4</A>&nbsp;We have become a reproach to our neighbors, a scoffing and derision to those who are around us.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_79:5">79:5</A>&nbsp;How long, Yahweh? Will you be angry forever? Will your jealousy burn like fire?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_79:6">79:6</A>&nbsp;Pour out your wrath on the nations that don't know you; on the kingdoms that don't call on your name;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_79:7">79:7</A>&nbsp;For they have devoured Jacob, and destroyed his homeland.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_79:8">79:8</A>&nbsp;Don't hold the iniquities of our forefathers against us. Let your tender mercies speedily meet us, for we are in desperate need.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_79:9">79:9</A>&nbsp;Help us, God of our salvation, for the glory of your name. Deliver us, and forgive our sins, for your name's sake.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_79:10">79:10</A>&nbsp;Why should the nations say, "Where is their God?" Let it be known among the nations, before our eyes, that vengeance for your servants' blood is being poured out.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_79:11">79:11</A>&nbsp;Let the sighing of the prisoner come before you. According to the greatness of your power, preserve those who are sentenced to death.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_79:12">79:12</A>&nbsp;Pay back to our neighbors seven times into their bosom their reproach with which they have reproached you, Lord.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_79:13">79:13</A>&nbsp;So we, your people and sheep of your pasture, will give you thanks forever. We will praise you forever, to all generations. For the Chief Musician. To the tune of "The Lilies of the Covenant." A Psalm by Asaph.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_80:1">80:1</A>&nbsp;Hear us, Shepherd of Israel, you who lead Joseph like a flock, you who sit above the cherubim, shine forth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_80:2">80:2</A>&nbsp;Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up your might! Come to save us!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_80:3">80:3</A>&nbsp;Turn us again, God. Cause your face to shine, and we will be saved.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_80:4">80:4</A>&nbsp;Yahweh God of Armies, How long will you be angry against the prayer of your people?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_80:5">80:5</A>&nbsp;You have fed them with the bread of tears, and given them tears to drink in large measure.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_80:6">80:6</A>&nbsp;You make us a source of contention to our neighbors. Our enemies laugh among themselves.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_80:7">80:7</A>&nbsp;Turn us again, God of Armies. Cause your face to shine, and we will be saved.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_80:8">80:8</A>&nbsp;You brought a vine out of Egypt. You drove out the nations, and planted it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_80:9">80:9</A>&nbsp;You cleared the ground for it. It took deep root, and filled the land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_80:10">80:10</A>&nbsp;The mountains were covered with its shadow. Its boughs were like God's cedars.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_80:11">80:11</A>&nbsp;It sent out its branches to the sea, Its shoots to the River.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_80:12">80:12</A>&nbsp;Why have you broken down its walls, so that all those who pass by the way pluck it?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_80:13">80:13</A>&nbsp;The boar out of the wood ravages it. The wild animals of the field feed on it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_80:14">80:14</A>&nbsp;Turn again, we beg you, God of Armies. Look down from heaven, and see, and visit this vine,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_80:15">80:15</A>&nbsp;the stock which your right hand planted, the branch that you made strong for yourself.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_80:16">80:16</A>&nbsp;It's burned with fire. It's cut down. They perish at your rebuke.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_80:17">80:17</A>&nbsp;Let your hand be on the man of your right hand, on the son of man whom you made strong for yourself.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_80:18">80:18</A>&nbsp;So we will not turn away from you. Revive us, and we will call on your name.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_80:19">80:19</A>&nbsp;Turn us again, Yahweh God of Armies. Cause your face to shine, and we will be saved. For the Chief Musician. On an instrument of Gath. By Asaph.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_81:1">81:1</A>&nbsp;Sing aloud to God, our strength! Make a joyful shout to the God of Jacob!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_81:2">81:2</A>&nbsp;Raise a song, and bring here the tambourine, the pleasant lyre with the harp.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_81:3">81:3</A>&nbsp;Blow the trumpet at the New Moon, at the full moon, on our feast day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_81:4">81:4</A>&nbsp;For it is a statute for Israel, an ordinance of the God of Jacob.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_81:5">81:5</A>&nbsp;He appointed it in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out over the land of Egypt, I heard a language that I didn't know.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_81:6">81:6</A>&nbsp;"I removed his shoulder from the burden. His hands were freed from the basket.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_81:7">81:7</A>&nbsp;You called in trouble, and I delivered you. I answered you in the secret place of thunder. I tested you at the waters of Meribah." Selah.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_105:16">105:16</A>&nbsp;He called for a famine on the land. He destroyed the food supplies.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_105:17">105:17</A>&nbsp;He sent a man before them. Joseph was sold for a slave.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_105:18">105:18</A>&nbsp;They bruised his feet with shackles. His neck was locked in irons,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_105:19">105:19</A>&nbsp;until the time that his word happened, and Yahweh's word proved him true.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_105:20">105:20</A>&nbsp;The king sent and freed him; even the ruler of peoples, and let him go free.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_105:23">105:23</A>&nbsp;Israel also came into Egypt. Jacob lived in the land of Ham.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_105:24">105:24</A>&nbsp;He increased his people greatly, and made them stronger than their adversaries.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_105:25">105:25</A>&nbsp;He turned their heart to hate his people, to conspire against his servants.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_105:26">105:26</A>&nbsp;He sent Moses, his servant, and Aaron, whom he had chosen.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_105:27">105:27</A>&nbsp;They performed miracles among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_105:28">105:28</A>&nbsp;He sent darkness, and made it dark. They didn't rebel against his words.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_105:29">105:29</A>&nbsp;He turned their waters into blood, and killed their fish.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_105:30">105:30</A>&nbsp;Their land swarmed with frogs, even in the rooms of their kings.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_105:31">105:31</A>&nbsp;He spoke, and swarms of flies came, and lice in all their borders.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_105:32">105:32</A>&nbsp;He gave them hail for rain, with lightning in their land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_105:33">105:33</A>&nbsp;He struck their vines and also their fig trees, and shattered the trees of their country.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_105:34">105:34</A>&nbsp;He spoke, and the locusts came, and the grasshoppers, without number,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_105:35">105:35</A>&nbsp;ate up every plant in their land; and ate up the fruit of their ground.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_105:36">105:36</A>&nbsp;He struck also all the firstborn in their land, the first fruits of all their manhood.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_105:37">105:37</A>&nbsp;He brought them forth with silver and gold. There was not one feeble person among his tribes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_105:38">105:38</A>&nbsp;Egypt was glad when they departed, for the fear of them had fallen on them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_105:39">105:39</A>&nbsp;He spread a cloud for a covering, fire to give light in the night.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_105:40">105:40</A>&nbsp;They asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of the sky.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_105:41">105:41</A>&nbsp;He opened the rock, and waters gushed out. They ran as a river in the dry places.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_105:42">105:42</A>&nbsp;For he remembered his holy word, and Abraham, his servant.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_105:43">105:43</A>&nbsp;He brought forth his people with joy, his chosen with singing.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_105:44">105:44</A>&nbsp;He gave them the lands of the nations. They took the labor of the peoples in possession,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_105:45">105:45</A>&nbsp;that they might keep his statutes, and observe his laws. Praise Yah!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:1">106:1</A>&nbsp;Praise Yahweh! Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good, for his loving kindness endures forever.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:2">106:2</A>&nbsp;Who can utter the mighty acts of Yahweh, or fully declare all his praise?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:3">106:3</A>&nbsp;Blessed are those who keep justice. Blessed is one who does what is right at all times.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:4">106:4</A>&nbsp;Remember me, Yahweh, with the favor that you show to your people. Visit me with your salvation,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:5">106:5</A>&nbsp;that I may see the prosperity of your chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of your nation, that I may glory with your inheritance.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:6">106:6</A>&nbsp;We have sinned with our fathers. We have committed iniquity. We have done wickedly.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:7">106:7</A>&nbsp;Our fathers didn't understand your wonders in Egypt. They didn't remember the multitude of your loving kindnesses, but were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:8">106:8</A>&nbsp;Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power known.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:9">106:9</A>&nbsp;He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up; so he led them through the depths, as through a desert.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:10">106:10</A>&nbsp;He saved them from the hand of him who hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:11">106:11</A>&nbsp;The waters covered their adversaries. There was not one of them left.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:12">106:12</A>&nbsp;Then they believed his words. They sang his praise.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:13">106:13</A>&nbsp;They soon forgot his works. They didn't wait for his counsel,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:14">106:14</A>&nbsp;but gave in to craving in the desert, and tested God in the wasteland.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:15">106:15</A>&nbsp;He gave them their request, but sent leanness into their soul.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:16">106:16</A>&nbsp;They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron, Yahweh's saint.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:17">106:17</A>&nbsp;The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:18">106:18</A>&nbsp;A fire was kindled in their company. The flame burned up the wicked.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:19">106:19</A>&nbsp;They made a calf in Horeb, and worshiped a molten image.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:20">106:20</A>&nbsp;Thus they exchanged their glory for an image of a bull that eats grass.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:21">106:21</A>&nbsp;They forgot God, their Savior, who had done great things in Egypt,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:22">106:22</A>&nbsp;Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and awesome things by the Red Sea.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:23">106:23</A>&nbsp;Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had Moses, his chosen, not stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, so that he wouldn't destroy them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:24">106:24</A>&nbsp;Yes, they despised the pleasant land. They didn't believe his word,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:25">106:25</A>&nbsp;but murmured in their tents, and didn't listen to Yahweh's voice.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:26">106:26</A>&nbsp;Therefore he swore to them that he would overthrow them in the wilderness,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:27">106:27</A>&nbsp;that he would overthrow their seed among the nations, and scatter them in the lands.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:28">106:28</A>&nbsp;They joined themselves also to Baal Peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:29">106:29</A>&nbsp;Thus they provoked him to anger with their deeds. The plague broke in on them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:30">106:30</A>&nbsp;Then Phinehas stood up, and executed judgment, so the plague was stopped.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:31">106:31</A>&nbsp;That was credited to him for righteousness, for all generations to come.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:32">106:32</A>&nbsp;They angered him also at the waters of Meribah, so that Moses was troubled for their sakes;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:33">106:33</A>&nbsp;because they were rebellious against his spirit, he spoke rashly with his lips.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:34">106:34</A>&nbsp;They didn't destroy the peoples, as Yahweh commanded them,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:35">106:35</A>&nbsp;but mixed themselves with the nations, and learned their works.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:36">106:36</A>&nbsp;They served their idols, which became a snare to them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:37">106:37</A>&nbsp;Yes, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:38">106:38</A>&nbsp;They shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan. The land was polluted with blood.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:39">106:39</A>&nbsp;Thus were they defiled with their works, and prostituted themselves in their deeds.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:40">106:40</A>&nbsp;Therefore Yahweh burned with anger against his people. He abhorred his inheritance.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:41">106:41</A>&nbsp;He gave them into the hand of the nations. Those who hated them ruled over them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:42">106:42</A>&nbsp;Their enemies also oppressed them. They were brought into subjection under their hand.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:43">106:43</A>&nbsp;Many times he delivered them, but they were rebellious in their counsel, and were brought low in their iniquity.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:44">106:44</A>&nbsp;Nevertheless he regarded their distress, when he heard their cry.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:45">106:45</A>&nbsp;He remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:46">106:46</A>&nbsp;He made them also to be pitied by all those who carried them captive.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:47">106:47</A>&nbsp;Save us, Yahweh, our God, gather us from among the nations, to give thanks to your holy name, to triumph in your praise!</p>

<p><A NAME="an_107:6">107:6</A>&nbsp;Then they cried to Yahweh in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses,</p>
