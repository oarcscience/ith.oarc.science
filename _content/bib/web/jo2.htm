<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;The elder, to the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in truth; and not I only, but also all those who know the truth;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;for the truth's sake, which remains in us, and it will be with us forever:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;I rejoice greatly that I have found some of your children walking in truth, even as we have been commanded by the Father.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;Now I beg you, dear lady, not as though I wrote to you a new commandment, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;This is love, that we should walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment, even as you heard from the beginning, that you should walk in it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who don't confess that Jesus Christ came in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the Antichrist.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;Watch yourselves, that we don't lose the things which we have accomplished, but that we receive a full reward.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;Whoever transgresses and doesn't remain in the teaching of Christ, doesn't have God. He who remains in the teaching, the same has both the Father and the Son.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:10">1:10</A>&nbsp;If anyone comes to you, and doesn't bring this teaching, don't receive him into your house, and don't welcome him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:11">1:11</A>&nbsp;for he who welcomes him participates in his evil works.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:12">1:12</A>&nbsp;Having many things to write to you, I don't want to do so with paper and ink, but I hope to come to you, and to speak face to face, that our joy may be made full.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:13">1:13</A>&nbsp;The children of your chosen sister greet you. Amen.</p>
