</p> <h3 align="center" align="center">World English Bible: Philemon</h3> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our beloved fellow worker,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;to the beloved Apphia, to Archippus, our fellow soldier, and to the assembly in your house:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;hearing of your love, and of the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all the saints;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;that the fellowship of your faith may become effective, in the knowledge of every good thing which is in us in Christ Jesus.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;For we have much joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;Therefore, though I have all boldness in Christ to command you that which is appropriate,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;yet for love's sake I rather beg, being such a one as Paul, the aged, but also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:10">1:10</A>&nbsp;I beg you for my child, whom I have become the father of in my chains, Onesimus,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:11">1:11</A>&nbsp;who once was useless to you, but now is useful to you and to me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:12">1:12</A>&nbsp;I am sending him back. Therefore receive him, that is, my own heart,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:13">1:13</A>&nbsp;whom I desired to keep with me, that on your behalf he might serve me in my chains for the Good News.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:14">1:14</A>&nbsp;But I was willing to do nothing without your consent, that your goodness would not be as of necessity, but of free will.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:15">1:15</A>&nbsp;For perhaps he was therefore separated from you for a while, that you would have him forever,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:16">1:16</A>&nbsp;no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, but how much rather to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:17">1:17</A>&nbsp;If then you count me a partner, receive him as you would receive me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:18">1:18</A>&nbsp;But if he has wronged you at all, or owes you anything, put that to my account.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:19">1:19</A>&nbsp;I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it (not to mention to you that you owe to me even your own self besides).</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:20">1:20</A>&nbsp;Yes, brother, let me have joy from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in the Lord.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:21">1:21</A>&nbsp;Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even beyond what I say.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:22">1:22</A>&nbsp;Also, prepare a guest room for me, for I hope that through your prayers I will be restored to you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:23">1:23</A>&nbsp;Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:24">1:24</A>&nbsp;as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:25">1:25</A>&nbsp;The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</p>
