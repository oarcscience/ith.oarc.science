</p> <h3 align="center" align="center">Weymouth New Testament: Philemon</h3> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;Paul, a prisoner for Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother: To Philemon our dearly-loved fellow labourer--</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;and to our sister Apphia and our comrade Archippus--as well as to the  Church in your house.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;May grace be granted to you all, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;I give continual thanks to my God while making mention of you, my brother, in my prayers,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;because I hear of your love and of the faith which you have towards the Lord Jesus and which you manifest towards all God's people;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;praying as I do, that their participation in your faith may result in others fully recognizing all the right affection that is in us toward Christ.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;For I have  found great  joy and comfort in your love, because the  hearts of God's people have been, and are, refreshed through you, my brother.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;Therefore,  though I might with Christ's authority speak very freely and order you to do what is fitting,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;it is for love's sake that--instead of that--although I am none other than Paul the aged, and am now also a prisoner for Christ Jesus,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:10">1:10</A>&nbsp;I entreat you on behalf of my own child whose father I have become while in my chains--I mean Onesimus.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:11">1:11</A>&nbsp;Formerly he was useless to you, but now--true to his name--he is of great use to you and to me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:12">1:12</A>&nbsp;I  am sending him back to you, though in so doing I send part of myself.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:13">1:13</A>&nbsp;It was my wish to keep him at my side for him to attend to my wants, as your representative, during my imprisonment for the Good News.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:14">1:14</A>&nbsp;Only I wished to do nothing without your consent, so that his kind action of yours might not be done under pressure, but might be a voluntary one.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:15">1:15</A>&nbsp;For perhaps it was  for this reason he was parted from you for a time, that you might receive him back wholly and for ever yours;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:16">1:16</A>&nbsp;no longer as a slave, but as something better than a slave--a brother peculiarly dear to me, and even dearer to you, both as a servant and as a fellow Christian.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:17">1:17</A>&nbsp;If therefore you regard me as a comrade, receive him as if he were I myself.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:18">1:18</A>&nbsp;And if he was ever dishonest or is in your debt,  debit me with the amount.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:19">1:19</A>&nbsp;I Paul write this with my own hand--I will pay you in full. (I say nothing of the fact that you owe me even your own self.)</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:20">1:20</A>&nbsp;Yes, brother, do me this favour for the Lord's sake. Refresh my heart in Christ.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:21">1:21</A>&nbsp;I write to you in the full confidence that you will meet my wishes, for I know you will do even more than I say.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:22">1:22</A>&nbsp;And at the same time provide accommodation for me; for I hope that through your prayers I shall be permitted to come to you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:23">1:23</A>&nbsp;Greetings to you, my brother, from Epaphras my fellow prisoner for the sake of Christ Jesus;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:24">1:24</A>&nbsp;and from Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:25">1:25</A>&nbsp;May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with the spirit of  every one of you. </p>
