<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;The Elder  to the elect lady and her children. Truly I love you all, and not I alone, but also all who know the truth,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;for the sake of the truth which is continually in our hearts and will be with us  for ever.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;Grace, mercy and peace will be with us from God the Father, and from Jesus Christ the Son of the Father, in truth and love.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;It is an intense joy to me to have found  some of your children living true Christian lives, in obedience to the command which we have received from the Father.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;And now, dear lady, I pray you--writing to you, as I do, not a new command, but the one which  we have had from the very beginning--let us love one another.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;The love of which I am speaking consists in our living in obedience to God's commands. God's command is that you should live in obedience to what you all heard from the very beginning.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;For many deceivers have gone out into the world--men who do not acknowledge Jesus as Christ who has come in human nature.  Such a one is `the deceiver' and `the anti-Christ.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;Keep guard over yourselves, so that you may not lose the results of your good deeds, but may receive back a full reward.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;No one has God, who instead of remaining true to the  teaching of Christ, presses on in advance: but he who remains true to that teaching has both the Father and the Son.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:10">1:10</A>&nbsp;If any one who comes to you does not bring this teaching, do not receive him under your roof nor  bid him Farewell.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:11">1:11</A>&nbsp;He who bids him Farewell is a sharer in his evil deeds.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:12">1:12</A>&nbsp;I have a great deal to say to you all, but will not write it with paper and ink. Yet I hope to come to see you and speak face to face, so that your happiness may be complete.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:13">1:13</A>&nbsp;The children of your elect sister send greetings to you.</p>
