<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;The  Genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;Abraham was the father of Isaac; Isaac of Jacob; Jacob of Judah and his brothers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;Judah was the father (by Tamar) of  Perez and Zerah; Perez of Hezron; Hezron of Ram;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;Ram of Amminadab; Amminadab of Nahshon; Nahshon of Salmon;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;Salmon (by Rahab) of Boaz; Boaz (by Ruth) of Obed; Obed of Jesse;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;Jesse of David--the King. David (by Uriah's widow) was the father of Solomon;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;Solomon of Rehoboam; Rehoboam of Abijah; Abijah of Asa;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;Asa of Jehoshaphat; Jehoshaphat of Jehoram; Jehoram of Uzziah;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;Uzziah of Jotham; Jotham of Ahaz; Ahaz of Hezekiah;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:10">1:10</A>&nbsp;Hezekiah of Manasseh; Manasseh of Amon; Amon of Josiah;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:11">1:11</A>&nbsp;Josiah of Jeconiah and his brothers at the period of the Removal to Babylon.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:12">1:12</A>&nbsp;After the Removal to Babylon Jeconiah had a son Shealtiel; Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:13">1:13</A>&nbsp;Zerubbabel of Abiud; Abiud of Eliakim; Eliakim of Azor;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:14">1:14</A>&nbsp;Azor of Zadok; Zadok of Achim; Achim of Eliud;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:15">1:15</A>&nbsp;Eliud of Eleazar; Eleazar of Matthan; Matthan of Jacob;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:16">1:16</A>&nbsp;and Jacob of Joseph the husband of Mary, who was the mother of JESUS who is called CHRIST.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:17">1:17</A>&nbsp;There are therefore, in all, fourteen generations from Abraham to David; fourteen from David to the Removal to Babylon; and fourteen from the Removal to Babylon to the Christ.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:18">1:18</A>&nbsp;The circumstances of the birth  of Jesus Christ were these. After his mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, before they were united in marriage, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:19">1:19</A>&nbsp;But Joseph her husband, being a  kind-hearted man and unwilling publicly to disgrace her, had determined to release her privately from the betrothal.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:20">1:20</A>&nbsp;But while he  was contemplating this step, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to bring home your wife Mary, for she is with child through the Holy Spirit.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:21">1:21</A>&nbsp;She will give birth to a Son, and you are to call His name  JESUS for He it is who will save His People from their sins."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:22">1:22</A>&nbsp;All this  took place in  fulfilment of what the Lord had spoken through the Prophet,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:23">1:23</A>&nbsp;&lt;"Mark! The maiden will be with child and will give birth to a son, and they will call His name Immanuel"&gt; --a word which signifies &lt;`God with us'&gt;.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:24">1:24</A>&nbsp;When Joseph awoke, he did as the angel of the Lord had commanded, and brought home his wife,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:25">1:25</A>&nbsp;but did not live with her until she had given birth to  a son. The child's name he called JESUS.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:1">2:1</A>&nbsp;Now after the birth of Jesus, which took place at Bethlehem in Judaea  in the reign of King Herod,  excitement was produced in Jerusalem by the arrival of certain  Magi from the east,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:2">2:2</A>&nbsp;inquiring, "Where is the newly born king of the Jews? For we have seen his Star in the east, and have come here to do him homage."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:3">2:3</A>&nbsp;Reports of this soon reached the king, and greatly agitated not only him but all the people of Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:4">2:4</A>&nbsp;So he assembled all the  High Priests and Scribes of the people, and  anxiously asked them where the Christ was to be born.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:5">2:5</A>&nbsp;"At Bethlehem in Judaea," they replied; "for so it stands written in the words of the Prophet,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:6">2:6</A>&nbsp;&lt;"`And thou,  Bethlehem in the land of Judah, by no means the least honorable art thou among  princely places in Judah! For from thee shall come a prince--one who shall be the Shepherd of My People Israel.'"&gt;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:7">2:7</A>&nbsp;Thereupon Herod sent privately for the Magi and ascertained from them the exact time  of the star's appearing.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:8">2:8</A>&nbsp;He then directed them to go to Bethlehem, adding, "Go and make careful inquiry about the child, and when you have found him, bring me word, that I too may come and  do him homage."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:9">2:9</A>&nbsp;After hearing what the king said, they went to Bethlehem, while,  strange to say, the star  they had seen in the east led them on until it came and stood over the place where the babe was.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:10">2:10</A>&nbsp;When they saw the star, the sight filled them with intense joy.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:11">2:11</A>&nbsp;So they entered the house; and when they  saw the babe  with His mother Mary, they prostrated themselves and did Him homage, and opening their treasure-chests offered gifts to Him--gold, frankincense, and myrrh.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:12">2:12</A>&nbsp;But being  forbidden by God in a dream to return to Herod, they went back to their own country by a different route.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:13">2:13</A>&nbsp;When they were  gone, and angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, "Rise: take the babe and His mother and escape to Egypt, and remain there till I bring you word. For Herod is about to make search for the child in order to destroy Him."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:14">2:14</A>&nbsp;So Joseph roused himself and took the babe and His mother by night and departed into Egypt.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:15">2:15</A>&nbsp;There he remained till Herod's death, that what the Lord had said through the Prophet might be  fulfilled, &lt;"Out of Egypt I called My Son."&gt;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:16">2:16</A>&nbsp;Then Herod, finding that the Magi had trifled with him, was furious, and sent and massacred all the boys under two years of age, in Bethlehem and all its neighbourhood, according to the date he had so carefully ascertained from the Magi.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:17">2:17</A>&nbsp;Then were these words, spoken by the Prophet Jeremiah,  fulfilled,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:18">2:18</A>&nbsp;&lt;"A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and bitter lamentation: It was Rachel  bewailing her children, and she refused to be comforted because there were no more."&gt;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:19">2:19</A>&nbsp;But after Herod's death an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, and said to him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:20">2:20</A>&nbsp;"Rise from sleep, and take the child and His mother, and go into the land of Israel, for those who were seeking the child's life are dead."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:21">2:21</A>&nbsp;So he roused himself and took the child and His mother and came into the land of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:22">2:22</A>&nbsp;But hearing that Archelaus had succeeded his father Herod on the throne of Judaea, he was afraid to go there; and being instructed  by God in a dream he withdrew into Galilee,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:23">2:23</A>&nbsp;and went and settled in a town called Nazareth, in order that these words spoken through the Prophets might be fulfilled, &lt;"He shall be called a  Nazarene."&gt;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:1">3:1</A>&nbsp;About this time John  the Baptist made his appearance, preaching in the Desert of Judaea.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:2">3:2</A>&nbsp;"Repent," he said, "for the Kingdom of the Heavens is now close at hand."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:3">3:3</A>&nbsp;He it is who was spoken of through the Prophet Isaiah when he said, &lt;"The voice of one crying aloud,  `In the desert prepare ye a road for the Lord: make His highway straight.'"&gt;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:4">3:4</A>&nbsp;This man John wore a garment of camel's hair, and a loincloth of leather; and he lived upon locusts and wild honey.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:5">3:5</A>&nbsp;Then large numbers of people went out to him--people from Jerusalem and from all Judaea, and from the whole of the Jordan valley--</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:6">3:6</A>&nbsp;and were baptized by him in the Jordan, making full confession of their sins.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:7">3:7</A>&nbsp;But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism, he exclaimed, "O vipers'  brood, who has  warned you to flee from the coming wrath?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:8">3:8</A>&nbsp;Therefore let your lives prove your  change of heart;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:9">3:9</A>&nbsp;and  do not imagine that you can say  to yourselves, `We have Abraham as our forefather,' for I tell you that God can  raise up descendants for Abraham from these stones.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:10">3:10</A>&nbsp;And already the axe is lying at the root of the trees, so that every tree which does not produce good fruit will quickly be hewn down and thrown into the fire.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:11">3:11</A>&nbsp;I indeed am baptizing you  in water  on a profession of repentance; but He who is coming after me is mightier than I: His sandals I am not worthy to carry for a moment; He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and in fire.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:12">3:12</A>&nbsp;His winnowing-shovel is in His hand, and He will make a thorough clearance of His threshing-floor, gathering His wheat into the storehouse, but  burning up the  chaff in unquenchable fire."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:13">3:13</A>&nbsp;Just at that time Jesus, coming from Galilee to the Jordan, presents Himself to John to be baptized by him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:14">3:14</A>&nbsp;John  protested. "It is I," he said, "who have need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:15">3:15</A>&nbsp;"Let it be so on this occasion," Jesus replied; "for so we ought to fulfil every religious duty." Then he consented;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:16">3:16</A>&nbsp;and Jesus was baptized, and immediately went up from the water.  At that moment the heavens  opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a  dove and alighting upon Him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:17">3:17</A>&nbsp;while a voice came from Heaven, saying, "This is My Son, the dearly loved, in whom is My delight."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:1">4:1</A>&nbsp;At that time Jesus was  led up by the Spirit into the Desert in order to be tempted by the Devil.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:2">4:2</A>&nbsp;There He fasted for forty days and nights; and after that He suffered from hunger.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:3">4:3</A>&nbsp;So the Tempter came and said,  "If you are the Son of God, command these stones to turn into loaves."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:4">4:4</A>&nbsp;"It is written," replied Jesus, &lt;"`It is not on bread alone that a man shall live, but on whatsoever God shall appoint.'"&gt;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:5">4:5</A>&nbsp;Then the Devil took Him to the Holy City and caused Him to stand on the roof of the  Temple,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:6">4:6</A>&nbsp;and said,  "If you are God's Son, throw yourself down; for it is written, &lt;"`To His angels He will give orders concerning thee, and on their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any moment thou shouldst strike thy foot against a stone.'"&gt;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:7">4:7</A>&nbsp;"Again it is written," replied Jesus,  &lt;"`Thou shalt not put the Lord thy God to the proof.'"&gt;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:8">4:8</A>&nbsp;Then the Devil took Him to the top of an exceedingly lofty mountain, from which he caused Him to see all the Kingdoms of the world and their splendour,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:9">4:9</A>&nbsp;and said to Him, "All this I will give you,  if you will kneel down and do me homage."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:10">4:10</A>&nbsp;"Begone, Satan!" Jesus replied; "for it is written, &lt;`To the Lord thy God thou shalt do homage, and to Him alone shalt thou render worship.'"&gt;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:11">4:11</A>&nbsp;Thereupon the Devil left Him, and angels  at once came and ministered to Him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:12">4:12</A>&nbsp;Now when Jesus heard that John was  thrown into prison, He withdrew into Galilee,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:13">4:13</A>&nbsp;and leaving Nazareth He went and settled at  Capernaum, a town by the  Lake on the frontiers of Zebulun and Naphtali,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:14">4:14</A>&nbsp;in order that these words, spoken through the Prophet Isaiah, might be fulfilled,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:15">4:15</A>&nbsp;&lt;"Zebulun's land and Naphtali's land; the road by the  Lake; the country beyond the Jordan;  Galilee of the Nations!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:16">4:16</A>&nbsp;The people who were  dwelling in darkness have seen a brilliant light; and on those who were dwelling in the  region of the shadow of death, on them light has dawned."&gt;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:17">4:17</A>&nbsp;From that time Jesus began to preach. "Repent," He said, "for the Kingdom of the Heavens is now close at hand."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:18">4:18</A>&nbsp;And walking along the shore of the Lake of Galilee He saw two brothers--Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew--throwing a drag-net into the Lake; for they were fishers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:19">4:19</A>&nbsp;And He said to them, "Come and follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:20">4:20</A>&nbsp;So they immediately left their nets and followed Him. As He went further on,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:21">4:21</A>&nbsp;He saw two other brothers, James the son of  Zabdi and his brother John, in the boat with their father Zabdi mending their nets; and He called them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:22">4:22</A>&nbsp;And they at once left the boat and their father, and followed Him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:23">4:23</A>&nbsp;Then Jesus  travelled through all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming  the Good News of the Kingdom, and curing every kind of disease and infirmity among the people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:24">4:24</A>&nbsp;Thus His fame spread through all Syria; and they brought all the sick to Him, the people who were  suffering from various diseases and pains--demoniacs, epileptics, paralytics; and He cured them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:25">4:25</A>&nbsp;And great crowds followed Him, coming from Galilee, from the Ten Towns, from Jerusalem, and from beyond the district on the other side of the Jordan.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:1">5:1</A>&nbsp;Seeing the multitude of people, Jesus went up  the Hill. There He  seated Himself, and when His disciples came to Him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:2">5:2</A>&nbsp;He proceeded to teach them, and said:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:3">5:3</A>&nbsp;"Blessed are the  poor in spirit, for to them belongs the Kingdom of the Heavens.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:4">5:4</A>&nbsp;"Blessed are the mourners, for they shall be comforted.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:5">5:5</A>&nbsp;"Blessed are  the meek, for they as heirs shall obtain possession of the earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:6">5:6</A>&nbsp;"Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be completely satisfied.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:7">5:7</A>&nbsp;"Blessed are the compassionate, for they shall receive compassion.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:8">5:8</A>&nbsp;"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:9">5:9</A>&nbsp;"Blessed are the peacemakers, for  it is they who will be recognized as sons of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:10">5:10</A>&nbsp;"Blessed are those who have borne persecution in the cause of Righteousness, for to them belongs the Kingdom of the Heavens.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:11">5:11</A>&nbsp;"Blessed are you when they have insulted and persecuted you, and have said every cruel thing about you falsely for my sake.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:12">5:12</A>&nbsp;Be joyful and triumphant, because your reward is great in the Heavens; for so were the Prophets before you persecuted.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:13">5:13</A>&nbsp;"*You* are the salt of the earth; but if salt has become  tasteless, in what way can it regain its saltness? It is no longer good for anything but to be thrown away and trodden on by the passers by.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:14">5:14</A>&nbsp;*You* are the light of the world; a town cannot be hid if built on a hill-top.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:15">5:15</A>&nbsp;Nor is a lamp lighted to be put under a bushel, but on the lampstand; and then it gives light to all in the house.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:16">5:16</A>&nbsp;Just so let your light shine before all men, in order that they may see  your holy lives and may give glory to your Father who is in Heaven.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:17">5:17</A>&nbsp;"Do not for a moment suppose that I have come to abrogate  the Law or the Prophets: I have not come to abrogate them but to give them their completion.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:18">5:18</A>&nbsp;Solemnly I tell you that until  Heaven and earth pass away, not one iota or smallest detail will pass away from the Law until all has taken place.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:19">5:19</A>&nbsp;Whoever therefore  breaks one of these least commandments and teaches  others to break them, will be called the least in the Kingdom of the Heavens; but whoever practises them and teaches them, he will be acknowledged as great in the Kingdom of the Heavens.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:20">5:20</A>&nbsp;For I assure you that unless  your righteousness  greatly surpasses that of the Scribes and the Pharisees, you will certainly not find entrance into the Kingdom of the Heavens.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:21">5:21</A>&nbsp;"You have heard that it was said to the ancients, &lt;`Thou shalt not commit murder',&gt; and whoever commits murder will be answerable to  the magistrate.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:22">5:22</A>&nbsp;But I say to you that every one who becomes  angry with his brother shall be answerable to the magistrate; that whoever says to his brother  `Raca,' shall be answerable to the  Sanhedrin; and that whoever says, `You  fool!' shall be liable to the  Gehenna of Fire.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:23">5:23</A>&nbsp;If therefore when you are offering your gift upon the altar, you remember that your brother has a grievance against you,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:24">5:24</A>&nbsp;leave your gift there before the altar, and go and make friends with your brother first, and then return and proceed to offer your gift.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:25">5:25</A>&nbsp;Come to terms without delay with your opponent while you are yet with him on the way to the court; for fear he should obtain judgement from the magistrate against you, and the magistrate should give you in custody to the officer and you be thrown into prison.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:26">5:26</A>&nbsp;I solemnly tell you that you will certainly not be released till you have paid the very last farthing.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:27">5:27</A>&nbsp;"You have heard that it was said, &lt;`Thou shalt not commit adultery.'&gt;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:28">5:28</A>&nbsp;But I tell you that whoever looks at a woman and cherishes lustful thoughts has already in his heart become guilty with regard to her.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:29">5:29</A>&nbsp;If therefore your eye, even the right eye,  is a snare to you, tear it out and away with it; it is better for you that one member should be destroyed rather than that your whole body should be thrown into Gehenna.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:30">5:30</A>&nbsp;And if your right hand  is a snare to you, cut it off and away with it; it is better for you that one member should be destroyed rather than that your whole body should go into Gehenna.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:31">5:31</A>&nbsp;"It was also said, &lt;`If any man puts away his wife, let him give her a written notice of divorce.'&gt;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:32">5:32</A>&nbsp;But I tell you that every man who puts away his wife except on the ground of  unfaithfulness causes her to commit adultery, and whoever marries  her when so divorced commits adultery.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:33">5:33</A>&nbsp;"Again, you have heard that it was said to the ancients, &lt;`Thou shalt not swear falsely, but shalt perform thy vows to the Lord.'&gt;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:34">5:34</A>&nbsp;But I tell you not to  swear at all; neither by Heaven, for it is God's throne;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:35">5:35</A>&nbsp;nor by the earth, for it is the footstool under His feet; nor  by Jerusalem, for it is the City of the Great King.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:36">5:36</A>&nbsp;And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:37">5:37</A>&nbsp;But  let your language be, `Yes, yes,' or `No, no.' Anything in excess of this comes from the Evil one.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:38">5:38</A>&nbsp;"You have heard that it was said, &lt;`Eye for eye, tooth for tooth.'&gt;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:39">5:39</A>&nbsp;But I tell you not to resist a wicked man, but if any one  strikes you on the right  cheek, turn the other to him as well.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:40">5:40</A>&nbsp;If any one wishes to go to law with you and to deprive you of your  under garment, let him take your outer one also.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:41">5:41</A>&nbsp;And whoever shall compel you to  convey his goods one mile, go with him two.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:42">5:42</A>&nbsp;To him who asks, give: from him who would borrow, turn not away.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:43">5:43</A>&nbsp;"You have heard that it was said, &lt;`Thou shalt love thy neighbour&gt; and hate thine enemy.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:44">5:44</A>&nbsp;But I command you all, love your enemies, and pray for your persecutors;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:45">5:45</A>&nbsp;that so you may become true sons of your Father in Heaven; for He causes His sun to rise on the wicked as well as the good, and sends rain upon those who do right and those who do wrong.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:46">5:46</A>&nbsp;For if you love only those who love you, what reward have you earned? Do not even the tax-gatherers do that?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:47">5:47</A>&nbsp;And if you salute only your near relatives, what praise is due to you? Do not even the Gentiles do the same?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:48">5:48</A>&nbsp;You however are to be complete in goodness, as your Heavenly Father is complete.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:1">6:1</A>&nbsp;"But beware of doing your  good actions in the sight of men, in order to attract their gaze; if you do, there is no reward for you with your Father who is in Heaven.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:2">6:2</A>&nbsp;`When you give in charity, never blow a  trumpet before you as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and streets in order that their praises may be sung by men. I solemnly tell you that  they already have their reward.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:3">6:3</A>&nbsp;But when you are giving in  charity, let not your left hand perceive what your right hand is doing,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:4">6:4</A>&nbsp;that your charities may be in secret; and then your Father--He who sees in secret--will recompense you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:5">6:5</A>&nbsp;"And when praying, you must not be like the hypocrites. They are fond of standing and praying in the synagogues or at the corners of the wider streets, in order that men may see them. I solemnly tell you that  they already have their reward.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:6">6:6</A>&nbsp;But you, whenever you pray, go into your own room and shut the door: then pray to your Father who is in secret, and your Father--He who sees in secret--will recompense you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:7">6:7</A>&nbsp;"And when praying, do not use needless repetitions as the Gentiles do, for they expect to be listened to because of their multitude of words.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:8">6:8</A>&nbsp;Do not,  however, imitate them; for  your Father knows what things you need before ever you ask Him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:9">6:9</A>&nbsp;"In this manner therefore pray: `Our Father who art in Heaven, may Thy name be kept holy;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:10">6:10</A>&nbsp;let Thy kingdom come; let Thy  will be done, as in Heaven so on earth;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:11">6:11</A>&nbsp;give us to-day our bread  for the day;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:12">6:12</A>&nbsp;and forgive us our shortcomings, as we also have forgiven those who have  failed in their duty towards us;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:13">6:13</A>&nbsp;and bring us not into temptation, but rescue us  from the Evil one.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:14">6:14</A>&nbsp;"For if you forgive others their offences, your Heavenly Father will forgive you also;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:15">6:15</A>&nbsp;but if you do not forgive others their offences, neither will your Father forgive yours.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:16">6:16</A>&nbsp;"When any of you fast, never assume gloomy looks as the hypocrites do; for they disfigure their faces in order that it may be evident to men that they are fasting. I solemnly tell you that they already have their reward.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:17">6:17</A>&nbsp;But, whenever you fast, pour  perfume on your hair and wash your face,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:18">6:18</A>&nbsp;that it may not be apparent to men that you are fasting, but to your Father who is in secret; and your Father--He who sees in secret--will recompense you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:19">6:19</A>&nbsp;"Do not lay up stores of wealth for yourselves on earth, where the moth and  wear-and-tear destroy, and where thieves  break in and steal.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:20">6:20</A>&nbsp;But amass wealth for yourselves in Heaven, where neither the moth nor  wear-and-tear destroys, and where thieves do not  break in and steal.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:21">6:21</A>&nbsp;For where your wealth is, there also will your heart be.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:22">6:22</A>&nbsp;"The eye is the lamp of the body. If then your  eyesight is good, your whole body will be well lighted;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:23">6:23</A>&nbsp;but if your  eyesight is bad, your whole body will be dark. If however the very light within you is darkness, how dense must the darkness be!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:24">6:24</A>&nbsp;"No man can be the bondservant of two masters; for either he will dislike one and like the other, or he will attach himself to one and think slightingly of the other. You cannot be the bondservants both of God and of gold.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:25">6:25</A>&nbsp;For this reason I charge you not to be over-anxious about your lives, inquiring what you are to eat or what you are to drink, nor yet about your bodies, inquiring what clothes you are to put on. Is not the life more precious than its food, and the body than its clothing?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:26">6:26</A>&nbsp;Look at the birds which fly in the air: they do not sow or reap or store up in barns, but your Heavenly Father feeds them: are not you of much greater value than they?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:27">6:27</A>&nbsp;Which of you by being over-anxious can add  a single foot to his height?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:28">6:28</A>&nbsp;And why be anxious about clothing? Learn a lesson from the wild  lilies. Watch their growth. They neither  toil nor  spin,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:29">6:29</A>&nbsp;and yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his magnificence could array himself like one of these.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:30">6:30</A>&nbsp;And if God so clothes the wild herbage which to-day flourishes and to-morrow is thrown into the  oven, is it not much more certain that He will clothe you, you men of little faith?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:31">6:31</A>&nbsp;Do not be  over-anxious, therefore, asking `What shall we eat?' or `What shall we drink?' or `What shall we wear?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:32">6:32</A>&nbsp;For all these are questions that Gentiles are always asking;  but your Heavenly Father knows that you need these things--all of them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:33">6:33</A>&nbsp;But make His Kingdom and righteousness your chief aim, and then these things shall all be given you in addition.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:34">6:34</A>&nbsp;Do not be  over-anxious, therefore, about to-morrow, for to-morrow will bring its own cares. Enough for each day are its own troubles.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:1">7:1</A>&nbsp;"Judge not, that you may not be judged;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:2">7:2</A>&nbsp;for your own judgement will be dealt--and your own measure meted--to yourselves.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:3">7:3</A>&nbsp;And why do you look at the splinter in your brother's eye, and not notice the beam which is in your own eye?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:4">7:4</A>&nbsp;Or how say to your brother, `Allow me to take the splinter out of your eye,' while the beam is in your own eye?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:5">7:5</A>&nbsp;Hypocrite, first take the beam out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly how to remove the splinter from your brother's eye.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:6">7:6</A>&nbsp;"Give not that which is holy to the dogs, nor throw your pearls to the swine; otherwise they will trample them under their feet and then turn and  attack you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:7">7:7</A>&nbsp;"Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:8">7:8</A>&nbsp;For it is always he who asks that receives, he who seeks that finds, and he who knocks that has the door opened to him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:9">7:9</A>&nbsp;What man is there among you, who if his son shall ask him for bread will offer him a stone?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:10">7:10</A>&nbsp;Or if the son shall ask him for a fish will offer him a snake?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:11">7:11</A>&nbsp;If you then, imperfect as you are, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in Heaven give good things to those who ask Him!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:12">7:12</A>&nbsp;Everything, therefore, be it what it may, that you would have men do to you, do you also the same to them; for in this the Law and the Prophets are summed up.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:13">7:13</A>&nbsp;"Enter by the narrow gate; for wide is the  gate and broad the road which leads to ruin, and many there are who enter by it;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:14">7:14</A>&nbsp;because narrow is the gate and contracted the road which leads  to Life, and few are those who find it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:15">7:15</A>&nbsp;"Beware of the false  teachers--men who come to you in sheep's fleeces, but beneath that disguise they are ravenous wolves.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:16">7:16</A>&nbsp;By their fruits you will easily recognize them. Are grapes gathered from  thorns or figs from  brambles?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:17">7:17</A>&nbsp;Just so every good tree produces good fruit, but a poisonous tree produces bad fruit.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:18">7:18</A>&nbsp;A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor a poisonous tree good fruit.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:19">7:19</A>&nbsp;Every tree which does not yield good fruit is cut down and thrown aside for burning.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:20">7:20</A>&nbsp;So by their fruits at any rate, you will easily recognize them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:21">7:21</A>&nbsp;"Not every one who says to me, `Master, Master,'  will enter the Kingdom of the Heavens, but only those who are obedient to my Father who is in Heaven.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:22">7:22</A>&nbsp;Many will say to me on that day, "`Master, Master, have we not prophesied in Thy name, and in Thy name expelled demons, and in Thy name performed many mighty works?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:23">7:23</A>&nbsp;"And then I will tell them plainly, "`I never knew you: begone from me, you doers of  wickedness.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:24">7:24</A>&nbsp;"Every one who hears  these my teachings and acts upon them  will be found to resemble a wise man who builds his house upon rock;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:25">7:25</A>&nbsp;and the heavy rain falls, the swollen torrents come, and the winds blow and beat against the house; yet it does not fall, for its foundation is on rock.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:26">7:26</A>&nbsp;And every one who hears these my teachings and does not act upon them will be found to resemble a fool who builds his house upon sand.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:27">7:27</A>&nbsp;The heavy rain descends, the swollen torrents come, and the winds blow and burst upon the house, and it falls; and disastrous is the fall."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:28">7:28</A>&nbsp;When Jesus had concluded this discourse, the crowds were  filled with amazement at His teaching,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:29">7:29</A>&nbsp;for He had been teaching them as one who had authority, and not as their Scribes taught.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:1">8:1</A>&nbsp;Upon descending from the hill country He was followed by immense crowds.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:2">8:2</A>&nbsp;And a leper came to Him, and throwing himself at His feet, said,  "Sir, if only you are willing you are able to cleanse me."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:3">8:3</A>&nbsp;So Jesus put out His hand and touched him, and said, "I am willing: be cleansed." Instantly he was cleansed from his leprosy;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:4">8:4</A>&nbsp;and Jesus said to him, "Be careful to tell no one, but go and show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift which Moses appointed as evidence for them."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:5">8:5</A>&nbsp;After His entry into Capernaum a  Captain came to Him, and entreated Him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:6">8:6</A>&nbsp;"Sir," he said, "my  servant at home is lying ill with paralysis, and is suffering great  pain."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:7">8:7</A>&nbsp;"I will come and cure him," said Jesus.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:8">8:8</A>&nbsp;"Sir," replied the Captain, "I am not  a fit person to receive you under my roof: merely say  the word, and my servant will be cured.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:9">8:9</A>&nbsp;For I myself am also  under authority, and have soldiers under me. To one I say `Go,' and he goes, to another `Come,' and he comes, and to my slave `Do this or that,' and he does it."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:10">8:10</A>&nbsp;Jesus listened to this reply, and was astonished, and said to the people following Him, "I solemnly tell you that  in no Israelite have I found faith as great as this.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:11">8:11</A>&nbsp;And I tell you that many will come from the east and from the west and will  recline at table with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the Kingdom of the Heavens,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:12">8:12</A>&nbsp;while the natural heirs of the Kingdom will be driven out into the darkness outside: there will be  the weeping aloud and the gnashing of teeth."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:13">8:13</A>&nbsp;And Jesus said to the Captain, "Go, and just as you have believed, so be it for you." And the servant recovered precisely at that time.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:14">8:14</A>&nbsp;After this Jesus went to the house of Peter, whose mother-in-law he  found ill in bed with fever.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:15">8:15</A>&nbsp;He touched her hand and the fever left her: and then she  rose and  waited upon Him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:16">8:16</A>&nbsp;In the evening many demoniacs were brought to Him, and with a word He expelled the demons; and He cured all the sick,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:17">8:17</A>&nbsp;in order that this prediction of the Prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled, &lt;"He took on Him our weaknesses, and bore the burden of our diseases."&gt;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:18">8:18</A>&nbsp;Seeing  great crowds about Him Jesus had given directions to cross to the other side of the Lake,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:19">8:19</A>&nbsp;when  a Scribe came and said to Him, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:20">8:20</A>&nbsp;"Foxes have holes," replied Jesus, "and birds have  nests; but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:21">8:21</A>&nbsp;Another of the disciples said to Him, "Sir, allow me first to go and bury my father."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:22">8:22</A>&nbsp;"Follow me," said Jesus, "and leave the  dead to bury their own dead."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:23">8:23</A>&nbsp;Then He went on board a fishing-boat, and His disciples followed Him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:24">8:24</A>&nbsp;But  suddenly there arose a great storm on the Lake, so that the waves threatened to engulf the boat; but He was asleep.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:25">8:25</A>&nbsp;So they came and woke Him, crying, "Master, save us, we are drowning!"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:26">8:26</A>&nbsp;"Why are you so easily frightened," He replied, "you men of little faith?" Then He rose and reproved the winds and the waves, and there was a perfect calm;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:27">8:27</A>&nbsp;and the men, filled with amazement, exclaimed, "What kind of man is this? for the very winds and waves obey him!"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:28">8:28</A>&nbsp;On His arrival at the other side, in the country of the Gadarenes, there met Him two men possessed by demons, coming  from among the tombs: they were so dangerously fierce that no one was able to pass that way.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:29">8:29</A>&nbsp;They cried aloud, "What hast Thou to do with us, Thou Son of God? Hast Thou come here to torment us before the time?"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:30">8:30</A>&nbsp;Now at some distance from them a vast herd of swine were feeding.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:31">8:31</A>&nbsp;So the demons entreated Him. "If Thou drivest us out," they said, "send us into the herd of swine."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:32">8:32</A>&nbsp;"Go," He replied. Then they came out from the men and went into the swine, whereupon the entire herd  instantly rushed down the cliff into the Lake and perished in the water.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:33">8:33</A>&nbsp;The  swineherds fled, and went and told the whole story in the town, including what had happened to the demoniacs.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:34">8:34</A>&nbsp;So at once the whole population came out to meet Jesus; and when they saw Him, they besought Him to leave their country.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:1">9:1</A>&nbsp;Accordingly He went on board, and crossing over came to  His own town.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:2">9:2</A>&nbsp;Here they brought to Him a paralytic lying on a  bed. Seeing their faith Jesus said to the paralytic, "Take courage, my child; your sins are pardoned."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:3">9:3</A>&nbsp;"Such language is impious," said some of the Scribes  among themselves.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:4">9:4</A>&nbsp;Knowing their thoughts Jesus said, "Why are you cherishing evil thoughts in your hearts?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:5">9:5</A>&nbsp;Why, which is easier? --to say, `Your sins are pardoned,' or to say `Rise up and walk'?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:6">9:6</A>&nbsp;But, to prove to you that the Son of Man has authority on earth to pardon sins" --He then says to the paralytic, "Rise, and take up your bed and go home."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:7">9:7</A>&nbsp;And he got up, and went off home.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:8">9:8</A>&nbsp;And the crowds were awe-struck when they saw it, and ascribed the glory to God who had  entrusted such power  to a man.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:9">9:9</A>&nbsp;Passing on thence Jesus saw a man called Matthew  sitting at the Toll Office, and said to him,  "Follow me." And he arose, and followed Him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:10">9:10</A>&nbsp;And while He was reclining  at table, a large number of  tax-gathers and notorious sinners were of the party with Jesus and His disciples.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:11">9:11</A>&nbsp;The Pharisees noticed this, and they inquired of His disciples, "Why does your Teacher eat with the tax-gatherers and notorious sinners?"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:12">9:12</A>&nbsp;He heard the question and replied, "It is not men in good health who require a doctor, but the sick.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:13">9:13</A>&nbsp;But  go and learn what this means, &lt;`It is mercy that I desire, not sacrifice';&gt; for I did not come to appeal to the righteous, but to sinners."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:14">9:14</A>&nbsp;At that time John's disciples came and asked Jesus, "Why do we and the Pharisees  fast, but your disciples do not?"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:15">9:15</A>&nbsp;"Can the bridegroom's party mourn," He replied, "as long as the bridegroom is with them? But other days will come (when the Bridegroom has been taken from them) and then they will fast.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:16">9:16</A>&nbsp;No one ever mends an old cloak with a patch of newly woven cloth. Otherwise, the patch put on would tear away some of the old, and a worse hole would be made.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:17">9:17</A>&nbsp;Nor do people pour new wine into old  wineskins. Otherwise, the skins would split, the wine  would escape, and the skins be destroyed. But they put new wine into fresh skins, and both are saved."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:18">9:18</A>&nbsp;While He was thus speaking, a  Ruler came up and  profoundly bowing said, "My daughter is just dead; but come and put your hand upon her and she will return to life."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:19">9:19</A>&nbsp;And Jesus rose and followed him, as did also His disciples.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:20">9:20</A>&nbsp;But a woman who for twelve years had been afflicted with haemorrhage came behind Him and  touched the  tassel of His cloak;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:21">9:21</A>&nbsp;for she said to herself, "If I but touch His cloak, I shall be cured."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:22">9:22</A>&nbsp;And Jesus turned and saw her, and said, "Take courage, daughter; your faith has  cured you." And the woman was restored to health from that moment.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:23">9:23</A>&nbsp;Entering the Ruler's house, Jesus saw the flute-players and the  crowd loudly wailing,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:24">9:24</A>&nbsp;and He said, "Go out of the room; the little girl is not dead, but asleep." And they laughed at Him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:25">9:25</A>&nbsp;When however the place was cleared of the crowd, Jesus went in, and on His taking the little girl by the hand, she  rose up.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:26">9:26</A>&nbsp;And the report of this spread throughout all that district.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:27">9:27</A>&nbsp;As Jesus passed on, two blind men followed Him, shouting and saying, "Pity us, Son of David."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:28">9:28</A>&nbsp;And when He had gone indoors, they came to Him. "Do you believe that I can do this?" He asked them. "Yes,  Sir," they replied.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:29">9:29</A>&nbsp;So He touched their eyes and said, "According to your faith let it be to you."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:30">9:30</A>&nbsp;Then their eyes were opened. And assuming a stern tone Jesus said to them, "Be careful to let no one know."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:31">9:31</A>&nbsp;But they went out and published His fame in all that district.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:32">9:32</A>&nbsp;And as they were leaving His presence a  dumb demoniac was brought to Him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:33">9:33</A>&nbsp;When the demon was expelled, the dumb man could speak. And the crowds exclaimed in astonishment, "Never was such a thing seen in Israel."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:34">9:34</A>&nbsp;But the Pharisees maintained, "It is  by the power of the Prince of the demons that he drives out the demons."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:35">9:35</A>&nbsp;And Jesus continued His circuits through all the towns and the villages, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the Good News of the Kingdom, and curing every kind of disease and infirmity.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:36">9:36</A>&nbsp;And when He saw the crowds He was touched with pity for them, because they were distressed and were fainting on the ground like sheep which have no shepherd.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:37">9:37</A>&nbsp;Then He said to His disciples, "The harvest is abundant, but the reapers are few;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:38">9:38</A>&nbsp;therefore entreat the Owner of the Harvest to send out reapers into His  fields."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:1">10:1</A>&nbsp;Then He called to Him His twelve disciples and gave them authority over foul spirits, to drive them out; and to cure every kind of disease and infirmity.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:2">10:2</A>&nbsp;Now the names of the twelve  Apostles were these: first, Simon called Peter, and his brother Andrew; James the son of Zabdi, and his brother John;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:3">10:3</A>&nbsp;Philip and Bartholomew, Thomas and Matthew the tax-gatherer, James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:4">10:4</A>&nbsp;Simon the  Cananaean, and Judas the  Iscariot, who also betrayed Him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:5">10:5</A>&nbsp;These twelve Jesus  sent on a mission, after giving them their instructions: "Go not," He said, "among the Gentiles, and enter no Samaritan town;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:6">10:6</A>&nbsp;but, instead of that, go to the  lost sheep of Israel's race.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:7">10:7</A>&nbsp;And as you go, preach and say, `The Kingdom of the Heavens is close at hand.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:8">10:8</A>&nbsp;Cure the sick,  raise the dead to life, cleanse lepers, drive out demons: you have received without payment, give without payment.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:9">10:9</A>&nbsp;"Provide no gold, nor even silver nor copper to carry in your pockets;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:10">10:10</A>&nbsp;no bag for your journey, nor change of linen, nor shoes, nor stick; for the labourer deserves his food.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:11">10:11</A>&nbsp;"Whatever town or village you enter, inquire for some good man; and make his house your home till you leave the place.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:12">10:12</A>&nbsp;When you enter the house,  salute it;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:13">10:13</A>&nbsp;and if the house deserves it, the peace you invoke shall come upon it. If not, your peace shall return to you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:14">10:14</A>&nbsp;And whoever refuses to receive you or even to listen to your Message, as you leave that house or town,  shake off the very dust  from your feet.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:15">10:15</A>&nbsp;I solemnly tell you that it will be more endurable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of Judgement than for that town.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:16">10:16</A>&nbsp;"Remember it is I who am sending you out, as sheep into the midst of wolves; prove yourselves as sagacious as serpents, and as innocent as  doves.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:17">10:17</A>&nbsp;But beware of men; for they will deliver you up to appear before  Sanhedrins, and will flog you in their synagogues;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:18">10:18</A>&nbsp;and you will even be put on trial before governors and kings for my sake, to bear witness to them and to the Gentiles.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_11:1">11:1</A>&nbsp;When Jesus had concluded His instructions to His twelve disciples, He left in order to teach and to  proclaim His Message in the neighbouring towns.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:2">11:2</A>&nbsp;Now John had heard in prison about the Christ's doings, and he sent  some of his disciples to inquire:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:3">11:3</A>&nbsp;"Are you the Coming One, or is it a different person that we are to expect?"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:4">11:4</A>&nbsp;"Go and report to John what you see and hear," replied Jesus;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:5">11:5</A>&nbsp;"blind eyes  receive sight, and cripples walk; lepers are cleansed, and deaf ears hear; the dead  are raised to life, and the poor have the Good News proclaimed to them;</p>

<p><A NAME="an_11:7">11:7</A>&nbsp;When the messengers had taken their leave, Jesus proceeded to say to the multitude concerning John, "What did you go out into the Desert to gaze at? A reed waving in the wind?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:8">11:8</A>&nbsp;But what did you go out to see? A man luxuriously dressed? Those who wear luxurious clothes are to be found in kings' palaces.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:9">11:9</A>&nbsp;But why did you go out? To see a prophet? Yes, I tell you, and far more than a prophet.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:10">11:10</A>&nbsp;This is he of whom it is written, &lt;"`See I am sending My  messenger before Thy face, and he will make Thy road ready before Thee.'&gt;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:11">11:11</A>&nbsp;"I solemnly tell you that among all of woman born no greater has ever been raised up than John the Baptist; yet one who is of lower rank in the Kingdom of the Heavens is greater than he.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:12">11:12</A>&nbsp;But from  the time of John the Baptist till now, the Kingdom of the Heavens  has been suffering violent assault, and the violent have been seizing it by force.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:13">11:13</A>&nbsp;For all the Prophets and the Law  taught until John.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:14">11:14</A>&nbsp;And (if you are willing to receive it) he is the Elijah who  was to come.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:15">11:15</A>&nbsp;Listen, every one who has  ears!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:16">11:16</A>&nbsp;"But to what shall I compare the present generation? It is like children sitting in the open places, who call  to their playmates.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:17">11:17</A>&nbsp;"`We have played the flute to you,' they say, `and you have not danced: we have sung dirges, and you have not beaten your breasts.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:18">11:18</A>&nbsp;"For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, `He has a demon.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:19">11:19</A>&nbsp;The Son of Man came  eating and drinking, and they exclaim, `See this man! --given to gluttony and tippling, and a friend of tax-gatherers and notorious sinners!' And yet Wisdom  is vindicated by her  actions."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:20">11:20</A>&nbsp;Then began He to upbraid the towns where most of His mighty works had been done--because they had not repented.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:21">11:21</A>&nbsp;"Alas for  thee, Chorazin!" He cried. "Alas for thee,  Bethsaida! For had the mighty works been done in Tyre and Sidon which have been done in  both of you, they would long ere now have repented, covered with sackcloth and ashes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:22">11:22</A>&nbsp;Only I tell you that it will be more endurable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of Judgement than for you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:23">11:23</A>&nbsp;And thou, Capernaum, shalt thou be exalted even to Heaven? Even to  Hades shalt thou  descend. For had the mighty works been done in Sodom which have been done in thee, it would have remained until now.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:24">11:24</A>&nbsp;Only I tell  you all, that it will be more endurable for the land of Sodom on the day of Judgement than for thee."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:25">11:25</A>&nbsp;About that time  Jesus exclaimed, "I heartily praise Thee, Father,  Lord of Heaven and of earth, that Thou hast hidden these things from sages and men of discernment, and hast unveiled them to babes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:26">11:26</A>&nbsp;Yes, Father, for such has been Thy gracious will.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:27">11:27</A>&nbsp;"All things have been handed over to me by my Father, and no one fully knows the Son except the Father, nor does any one fully know the Father except the Son and all to whom the Son chooses to reveal Him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:28">11:28</A>&nbsp;"Come to me, all you toiling and burdened ones, and *I* will give you rest.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:29">11:29</A>&nbsp;Take my yoke upon you and learn from me; for I am  gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:30">11:30</A>&nbsp;For  it is good to bear my yoke, and my burden is light."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:1">12:1</A>&nbsp;About that time Jesus passed on the Sabbath through the wheatfields; and His disciples  became hungry, and began to gather ears of wheat and eat them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:2">12:2</A>&nbsp;But the Pharisees saw it and said to Him, "Look! your disciples are doing what the Law forbids them to do on the Sabbath."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:3">12:3</A>&nbsp;"Have you never read," He replied, "what David did when he and his men were hungry?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:4">12:4</A>&nbsp;how he entered the House of God  and ate the Presented Loaves, which it was not lawful for him or his men to eat,  nor for any except the priests?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:5">12:5</A>&nbsp;And have you not read in the Law how on the Sabbath the priests in the Temple  break the Sabbath without incurring guilt?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:6">12:6</A>&nbsp;But I tell you that there is here  that which is greater than the Temple.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:7">12:7</A>&nbsp;And if you knew what this means, &lt;`It is mercy I desire, not sacrifice'&gt;, you would not have condemned those who are without guilt.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:8">12:8</A>&nbsp;For the Son of Man is the Lord of the Sabbath."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:9">12:9</A>&nbsp;Departing thence  He went to their synagogue,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:10">12:10</A>&nbsp;where there was a man with a shrivelled  arm. And they questioned Him,  "Is it right to cure people on the Sabbath?" Their intention was to bring a charge against Him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:11">12:11</A>&nbsp;"Which of you is there," He replied, "who, if he has but a single sheep and it falls into a hole on the Sabbath, will not lay hold of it and lift it out?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:12">12:12</A>&nbsp;Is not a man, however, far superior to a sheep? Therefore it is right to do good on the Sabbath."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:13">12:13</A>&nbsp;Then He said to the man, "Stretch out your arm." And he stretched it out, and it was restored quite sound like the other.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:14">12:14</A>&nbsp;But the Pharisees after leaving the synagogue consulted together against Him, how they might destroy Him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:15">12:15</A>&nbsp;Aware of this, Jesus departed elsewhere; and a great number of people followed Him, all of whom He cured.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:16">12:16</A>&nbsp;But He gave them strict injunctions not to blaze abroad His doings,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:17">12:17</A>&nbsp;that those words of the Prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:18">12:18</A>&nbsp;&lt;"This is My servant whom I have chosen, My dearly loved One in whom My soul  takes pleasure. I will put My spirit upon Him, and He will announce justice to the nations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:19">12:19</A>&nbsp;He will not wrangle or raise His voice, nor will His voice be heard in the broadways.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:20">12:20</A>&nbsp;A crushed reed He will not utterly break, nor will He quench the still smouldering wick, until He has led on Justice to victory.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:21">12:21</A>&nbsp;And on His name shall the nations  rest their hopes."&gt;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:22">12:22</A>&nbsp;At that time a demoniac was brought to Him, blind and  dumb; and He cured him, so that the dumb man could speak and see.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:23">12:23</A>&nbsp;And the crowds of people were all filled with amazement and said, "Can this be  the Son of David?"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:24">12:24</A>&nbsp;The Pharisees heard it and said, "This man only expels demons by the power of Baal-zebul, the Prince of demons."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:25">12:25</A>&nbsp;Knowing their thoughts He said to them, "Every kingdom in which civil war has raged suffers desolation; and every city or house in which there is internal strife will be brought low.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:26">12:26</A>&nbsp;And if Satan is expelling Satan, he has  begun to make war on himself: how therefore shall his kingdom last?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:27">12:27</A>&nbsp;And if it is by Baal-zebul's power that I expel the demons, by whose power do your  disciples expel them? They therefore shall be your judges.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:28">12:28</A>&nbsp;But if it is by the power of the Spirit of God that I expel the demons, it is evident that the  Kingdom of God  has come upon you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:29">12:29</A>&nbsp;Again, how can any one enter the house of  a strong man and carry off his goods, unless first of all he masters and secures the strong man: then he will ransack his house.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:30">12:30</A>&nbsp;"The man who is not with me is against me, and he who is not gathering with me is scattering abroad.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:31">12:31</A>&nbsp;This is why I tell you that  men may find forgiveness for every other sin and impious word, but that for impious speaking against the Holy Spirit they shall find no forgiveness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:32">12:32</A>&nbsp;And whoever  shall speak against the Son of Man may obtain forgiveness; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, neither in this nor in the coming age shall he obtain forgiveness."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:33">12:33</A>&nbsp;"Either grant the tree to be wholesome and its fruit wholesome, or the tree poisonous and its fruit poisonous; for the tree is known by its fruit.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:34">12:34</A>&nbsp;O vipers'  brood, how can you speak what is good when you are evil? For it is from the overflow of the heart that the mouth speaks.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:35">12:35</A>&nbsp;A good man from his good store produces good things, and a bad man from his bad store produces bad things.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:36">12:36</A>&nbsp;But I tell you that for every careless word that men shall speak they will be held accountable on the day of Judgement.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:37">12:37</A>&nbsp;For each of you by his words shall be justified, or by his words shall be condemned."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:38">12:38</A>&nbsp;Then He was accosted by some of the Scribes and of the Pharisees who said, "Teacher, we wish to see a sign  given by you."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:39">12:39</A>&nbsp;"Wicked and faithless generation!" He replied, "they clamour for a sign, but none shall be given to them except the sign of the Prophet Jonah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:40">12:40</A>&nbsp;For just as &lt;Jonah was  three days in the sea-monster's belly,&gt; so will the Son of Man be three days in the heart of the earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:41">12:41</A>&nbsp;There will stand up men of Nineveh at the Judgement together with the present generation, and will condemn it; because they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and mark! there is  One greater than Jonah here.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:42">12:42</A>&nbsp;The Queen of the south will awake at the Judgement together with the present generation, and will condemn it; because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and mark! there is One greater than Solomon here.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:43">12:43</A>&nbsp;"No sooner however has  the foul spirit gone out of the man, then he  roams about in places where there is no water, seeking rest but finding none.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:44">12:44</A>&nbsp;Then he says, `I will return to my house that I left;' and he comes and finds it unoccupied, swept clean, and  in good order.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:45">12:45</A>&nbsp;Then he goes and brings back with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they come in and dwell there; and in the end that man's condition becomes worse than it was at first. So will it be also with  the present wicked generation."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:46">12:46</A>&nbsp;While He was still addressing the people His mother and His brothers were standing on the edge of the crowd desiring to speak to Him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:47">12:47</A>&nbsp;So some one told Him, "Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, and desire to speak to you."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:48">12:48</A>&nbsp;"Who is my mother?" He said to the man; "and who are my brothers?"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:49">12:49</A>&nbsp;And pointing to His disciples He added, "See here are my mother and my brothers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:50">12:50</A>&nbsp;To obey my Father who is in Heaven--that is to be my brother and my sister and my mother."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:1">13:1</A>&nbsp;That same day Jesus had left the house and was sitting on the shore of the Lake,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:2">13:2</A>&nbsp;when a vast multitude of people crowded round Him. He therefore went on board a boat and sat there, while all the people stood on the shore.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:3">13:3</A>&nbsp;He then spoke many things to them in  figurative language. "The sower  goes out," He said, "to sow.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:4">13:4</A>&nbsp;As he sows, some of the seed falls by the way-side, and the birds come and peck it up.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:5">13:5</A>&nbsp;Some falls on rocky ground, where it has but scanty soil. It quickly shows itself above ground, because it has no depth of earth;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:6">13:6</A>&nbsp;but when the sun is risen, it is scorched by the heat, and through having no root it withers up.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:7">13:7</A>&nbsp;Some falls  among the thorns; but the thorns spring up and stifle it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:8">13:8</A>&nbsp;But a portion falls upon good ground, and  gives a return, some a hundred for one, some sixty, some thirty.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:9">13:9</A>&nbsp;Listen, every one who has ears!" </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:10">13:10</A>&nbsp;(And His disciples  came and asked Him, "Why do you speak to them in figurative language?"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:11">13:11</A>&nbsp;"Because," He replied, "while to you it is granted to know the secrets of the Kingdom of the Heavens, to them it is not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:12">13:12</A>&nbsp;For whoever has, to him more shall be given, and he shall have abundance; but whoever has not, from him even what he has shall be taken away.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:13">13:13</A>&nbsp;I speak to them in figurative language for this reason, that while looking they do not see, and while hearing they neither hear nor understand.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:14">13:14</A>&nbsp;And in regard to them the prophecy of Isaiah is receiving signal fulfilment: &lt;"`You will hear and hear and by no means understand, and you will look and look and by no means see.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:15">13:15</A>&nbsp;For this people's  mind  is stupefied, their hearing has become dull, and their eyes they have closed; to prevent their ever seeing with their eyes, or hearing with their ears, or understanding with their minds, and turning back,  so that I might heal them.'&gt;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:16">13:16</A>&nbsp;"But as for you, blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:17">13:17</A>&nbsp;For I solemnly tell you that many Prophets and holy men have longed to see the sights you see, and have not seen them, and to hear the words you hear, and have not heard them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:18">13:18</A>&nbsp;"To you then I will explain the parable of the Sower.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:19">13:19</A>&nbsp;When a man hears the Message concerning the Kingdom and does not understand it, the Evil one comes and catches away what has been sown in his heart. This is he who  has received the seed by the road-side.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:20">13:20</A>&nbsp;He who  has received the seed on the rocky ground is the man who hears the Message and immediately receives it with joy.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:21">13:21</A>&nbsp;It has struck no root, however, within him. He continues for a time, but when suffering comes, or persecution, because of the Message, he at once stumbles and falls.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:22">13:22</A>&nbsp;He who  has received the seed among the thorns is the man who hears the Message, but the cares of the present age and the delusions of riches quite stifle the Message, and it becomes unfruitful.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:23">13:23</A>&nbsp;But he who  has received the seed on good ground is he who hears and understands. Such hearers give a return, and yield one a hundred for one, another sixty, another thirty.")</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:24">13:24</A>&nbsp;Another parable He put before them. "The Kingdom of the Heavens," He said,  "may be compared to a man who has sown good seed in his field,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:25">13:25</A>&nbsp;but  during the night his enemy comes, and over the first seed he sows darnel among the wheat, and goes away.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:26">13:26</A>&nbsp;But when the blade shoots up and the grain is formed, then appears the darnel also.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:27">13:27</A>&nbsp;"So the farmer's  men come and ask him, "`Sir, was it not good seed that you sowed on your land? Where then does the darnel come from?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:28">13:28</A>&nbsp;"`Some enemy has done this,' he said. "`Shall we go, and collect it?' the  men inquire.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:29">13:29</A>&nbsp;"`No,' he replied, `for fear that while collecting the darnel you should at the same time root up the wheat with it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:30">13:30</A>&nbsp;Leave both to grow together until the harvest, and at harvest-time I will direct the reapers, Collect the darnel  first, and make it up into bundles to burn it, but  bring  all the wheat into my barn.'"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:31">13:31</A>&nbsp;Another parable He put before them. "The Kingdom of the Heavens," He said, "is like a mustard-seed, which a man takes and sows in his ground.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:32">13:32</A>&nbsp;It is  the smallest of all seeds, and yet when full-grown it is larger than any  herb and forms a tree, so that the birds come and build in its branches."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:33">13:33</A>&nbsp;Another parable He spoke to them. "The Kingdom of the Heavens," He said, "is like  yeast which a woman takes and buries in a bushel of flour, for it to work there till the whole mass has risen."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:34">13:34</A>&nbsp;All this Jesus spoke to the people in figurative language, and except in figurative language He spoke nothing to them,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:35">13:35</A>&nbsp;in fulfilment of the saying of  the Prophet, &lt;"I will open my mouth in figurative language, I will utter things kept hidden since the creation of all things."&gt;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:36">13:36</A>&nbsp;When He had dismissed the people and had returned to the house, His disciples came to Him with the request, "Explain to us the parable of the darnel sown in the field."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:37">13:37</A>&nbsp;"The sower of the good seed," He replied, "is the Son of Man;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:38">13:38</A>&nbsp;the field is the world; the good seed--these are the  sons of the Kingdom; the darnel, the sons of the Evil one.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:39">13:39</A>&nbsp;The enemy who sows the darnel is *the Devil*; the harvest is the  Close of the Age; the reapers are the angels.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:40">13:40</A>&nbsp;As then the darnel is collected together and burnt up with fire, so will it be at the Close of the Age.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:41">13:41</A>&nbsp;The Son of Man will commission His angels, and they will gather out of His Kingdom all  causes of sin and all who violate His laws;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:42">13:42</A>&nbsp;and these they will throw into the fiery furnace. There will be  the weeping aloud and the gnashing of teeth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:43">13:43</A>&nbsp;Then will the righteous shine out  like the sun in  their Father's Kingdom. Listen, every one who has ears! </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:44">13:44</A>&nbsp;"The Kingdom of the Heavens is like treasure buried in the open country, which a man finds, but buries again, and, in his joy about it, goes and sells all he has and buys that piece of ground.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:45">13:45</A>&nbsp;"Again the Kingdom of the Heavens is like  a jewel merchant who is in quest of choice pearls.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:46">13:46</A>&nbsp;He finds one most costly pearl; he goes away; and though it costs all he has, he buys it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:47">13:47</A>&nbsp;"Again the Kingdom of the Heavens is like a draw-net let down into the sea, which encloses fish of all sorts.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:48">13:48</A>&nbsp;When full, they haul it up on the beach, and sit down and collect the good fish in baskets, while  the worthless they throw away.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:49">13:49</A>&nbsp;So will it be at the  Close of the Age. The angels will go forth and separate the wicked from among the righteous,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:50">13:50</A>&nbsp;and will throw them into the fiery furnace. There will be the weeping aloud and the gnashing of teeth."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:51">13:51</A>&nbsp;"Have you understood all this?" He asked. "Yes," they said.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:52">13:52</A>&nbsp;"Therefore," He said, "remember that every Scribe well trained for the Kingdom of the Heavens is like a householder who brings out of his storehouse new things and old."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:53">13:53</A>&nbsp;Jesus concluded this series of parables and then departed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:54">13:54</A>&nbsp;And He came into His own  country and proceeded to teach in their synagogue, so that they were filled with astonishment and exclaimed, "Where did he obtain such wisdom, and these wondrous powers?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:55">13:55</A>&nbsp;Is not  this the carpenter's son? Is not his mother called Mary? And are not his brothers, James, Joseph, Simon and Judah?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:56">13:56</A>&nbsp;And his sisters--are they not all living here among us? Where then did he get all this?"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:57">13:57</A>&nbsp;So they  turned angrily away from Him. But Jesus said to them, "There is no prophet left without honour except in his own country and among his own  family."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:58">13:58</A>&nbsp;And He performed but few mighty deeds there because of their want of faith.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:1">14:1</A>&nbsp;About that time Herod the Tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:2">14:2</A>&nbsp;and he said to his courtiers, "This is John the Baptist: he has come back to life--and that is why these miraculous Powers are working in him."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:3">14:3</A>&nbsp;For Herod had arrested John, and had put him in chains, and imprisoned him, for the sake of Herodias his brother Philip's wife,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:4">14:4</A>&nbsp;because John had persistently said to him, "It is not lawful for you to have her."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:5">14:5</A>&nbsp;And he would have liked to put him to death, but was afraid of the people, because they regarded John as a Prophet.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:6">14:6</A>&nbsp;But when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before all the company, and so pleased Herod</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:7">14:7</A>&nbsp;that with an oath he promised to give her whatever she asked.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:8">14:8</A>&nbsp;So she, instigated by her mother, said, "Give me here on a dish the head of John the Baptist."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:9">14:9</A>&nbsp;The king was deeply vexed, yet because of his repeated oath and of the guests at his table he ordered it to be given her,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:10">14:10</A>&nbsp;and he sent and beheaded John in the prison.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:11">14:11</A>&nbsp;The head was brought on a dish and given to the young girl, and she took it to her mother.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:12">14:12</A>&nbsp;Then John's disciples went and removed the body and buried  it, and came and informed Jesus.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:13">14:13</A>&nbsp;Upon receiving these tidings, Jesus went away by boat to an uninhabited and secluded district; but the people heard of it and followed Him in crowds from the towns by land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:14">14:14</A>&nbsp;So Jesus  went out and saw an immense multitude, and felt compassion for them, and cured those of them who were out of health.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:15">14:15</A>&nbsp;But when  evening was come, the disciples came to Him and said, "This is an uninhabited place, and the best of the day is now gone; send the people away to go into the villages and buy something to eat."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:16">14:16</A>&nbsp;"They need not go away," replied Jesus; "you yourselves must give them something to eat."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:17">14:17</A>&nbsp;"We have nothing here," they said, "but five loaves and a couple of fish."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:18">14:18</A>&nbsp;"Bring them here to me," He said,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:19">14:19</A>&nbsp;and He told all the people to sit down on the grass. Then He took the five loaves and the two fish, and after looking up to heaven and blessing them, He broke up the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples distributed them to the people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:20">14:20</A>&nbsp;So all ate, and were fully satisfied. The  broken portions that remained over they gathered up, filling twelve baskets.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:21">14:21</A>&nbsp;Those who had eaten were about 5,000 adult men, without reckoning women and children.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:22">14:22</A>&nbsp;Immediately afterwards He made the disciples go on board the boat and cross to the opposite shore, leaving Him to dismiss the people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:23">14:23</A>&nbsp;When He had done this, He climbed the hill to pray in solitude.  Night came on, and he was there alone.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:24">14:24</A>&nbsp;Meanwhile the boat was  far out on the Lake, buffeted and tossed by the waves, the wind being adverse.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:25">14:25</A>&nbsp;But  towards daybreak He went to them, walking over the waves.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:26">14:26</A>&nbsp;When the disciples saw Him walking on the waves, they were greatly alarmed. "It is a spirit," they exclaimed, and they cried out with terror.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:27">14:27</A>&nbsp;But instantly Jesus spoke to them, and said, "There is no danger;  it is I; do not be afraid."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:28">14:28</A>&nbsp;"Master," answered Peter, "if it is you, bid me come to you upon the water."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:29">14:29</A>&nbsp;"Come," said Jesus. Then Peter climbed down from the boat and walked upon the water  to go to Him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:30">14:30</A>&nbsp;But when he  felt  the wind he  grew frightened, and beginning to sink he cried out, "Master, save me."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:31">14:31</A>&nbsp;Instantly Jesus stretched out His hand and caught hold of him, saying to him, "O little faith, why did you doubt?"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:32">14:32</A>&nbsp;So they climbed into the boat, and the wind lulled;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:33">14:33</A>&nbsp;and the men on board fell down before him and said, "You are indeed God's Son."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:34">14:34</A>&nbsp;When they had quite crossed over, they put ashore at Gennesaret;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:35">14:35</A>&nbsp;and the men of the place, recognizing Him, sent word into all the country round. So they brought all the sick to Him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:36">14:36</A>&nbsp;and they entreated Him that they might but touch the tassel of His outer garment; and all who did so were restored to perfect health.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:1">15:1</A>&nbsp;Then there came to Jesus a party of Pharisees and Scribes from Jerusalem, who inquired,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:2">15:2</A>&nbsp;"Why do your disciples transgress the tradition of the Elders by not washing their hands  before meals?"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:3">15:3</A>&nbsp;"Why do you, too," He retorted, "transgress God's commands  for the sake of  your tradition?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:4">15:4</A>&nbsp;For God said, &lt;`Honour thy father and thy mother';&gt; and &lt;`Let him who  reviles father or mother  be certainly put to death';&gt;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:5">15:5</A>&nbsp;but you--this is what you say: `If a man says to his father or mother, That is  consecrated, whatever it is, which otherwise you should have received from me--</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:6">15:6</A>&nbsp;he shall be absolved from honouring his father';  and so you have abrogated God's  Word for the sake of your tradition.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:7">15:7</A>&nbsp;Hypocrites! well did Isaiah prophesy of you,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:8">15:8</A>&nbsp;&lt;"`This is a People who honour Me with their lips, while their heart is far away from Me;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:9">15:9</A>&nbsp;but it is in vain they worship Me, while they lay down precepts which are mere human rules.'"&gt;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:10">15:10</A>&nbsp;Then, when He had called the people to Him, Jesus said, "Hear and understand.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:11">15:11</A>&nbsp;It is not what goes into a man's mouth that  defiles him; but it is what comes out of his mouth--*that* defiles a man."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:12">15:12</A>&nbsp;Then His disciples came and said to Him, "Do you know that the Pharisees were greatly  shocked when they heard those words?"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:13">15:13</A>&nbsp;"Every plant," He replied, "which my Heavenly Father has not planted will be rooted up.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:14">15:14</A>&nbsp;Leave them alone. They are blind guides  of the blind; and if a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into some  pit."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:15">15:15</A>&nbsp;"Explain to us this figurative language," said Peter.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:16">15:16</A>&nbsp;"Are even you," He answered, "still without intellingence?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:17">15:17</A>&nbsp;Do you not understand that whatever enters the mouth passes into the stomach and is afterwards ejected from the body?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:18">15:18</A>&nbsp;But the things that come out of the mouth proceed from the heart, and it is these that defile the man.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:19">15:19</A>&nbsp;For out of the heart proceed wicked  thoughts, murder, adultery, fornication, theft, perjury, impiety of speech.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:20">15:20</A>&nbsp;These are the things which defile the man; but eating with unwashed hands does not defile."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:21">15:21</A>&nbsp;Leaving that place, Jesus withdrew into the vicinity of Tyre and Sidon.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:22">15:22</A>&nbsp;Here a Canaanitish woman of the district came out and  persistently cried out, "Sir, Son of David, pity me; my daughter is cruelly harassed by a demon."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:23">15:23</A>&nbsp;But He answered her not a word. Then the disciples interposed, and begged Him, saying, "Send her away because she keeps crying behind us."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:24">15:24</A>&nbsp;"I have only been sent to the  lost sheep of the house of Israel," He replied.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:25">15:25</A>&nbsp;Then she  came and  threw herself at His feet and entreated Him. "O Sir, help me," she said.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:26">15:26</A>&nbsp;"It is not right," He said, "to take the children's bread and throw it to the  dogs."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:27">15:27</A>&nbsp;"Be it so, Sir," she said,  "for even the dogs eat the scraps which fall from their  masters' tables."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:28">15:28</A>&nbsp;"O woman," replied Jesus, "great is your faith: be it done to you as you desire." And from that moment her daughter was restored to health.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:29">15:29</A>&nbsp;Again, moving thence, Jesus went along by the Lake of Galilee; and ascending  the hill, He  sat down there.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:30">15:30</A>&nbsp;Soon great crowds came to Him, bringing with them those who were crippled in feet or hands, blind or  dumb, and many besides, and they hastened to lay them at His feet. And He cured them,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:31">15:31</A>&nbsp;so that the people were amazed to see the dumb speaking,  the maimed with their hands perfect, the lame walking, and the blind seeing; and they gave the glory to the God of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:32">15:32</A>&nbsp;But Jesus called His disciples to Him and said, "My heart yearns over this mass of people, for it is now  the third day that they have been with me and they have nothing to eat. I am unwilling to send them away hungry, lest they should faint on the road."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:33">15:33</A>&nbsp;"Where can we," asked the disciples, "get bread enough in this remote place to satisfy so vast a multitude?"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:34">15:34</A>&nbsp;"How many loaves have you?" Jesus asked. "Seven," they said, "and a few small fish."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:35">15:35</A>&nbsp;So He bade all the people sit down on the ground,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:36">15:36</A>&nbsp;and He took the seven loaves and the fish, and after giving thanks He broke them up and then distributed them to the disciples, and they to the people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:37">15:37</A>&nbsp;And they all ate and were satisfied. The broken portions that remained over they took up--seven full  hampers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:38">15:38</A>&nbsp;Those who ate were 4,000 adult men, without reckoning women and children.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:39">15:39</A>&nbsp;He then dismissed the people, went on board the boat, and came into the district of Magadan.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:1">16:1</A>&nbsp;Here the Pharisees and Sadducees came to Him; and, to make trial of Him, they asked Him to show them a sign  in the sky.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:2">16:2</A>&nbsp;He replied,  "In the evening you say, `It will be fine weather, for the sky is red;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:3">16:3</A>&nbsp;and in the morning, `It will be rough weather to-day, for the sky is red and murky.' You learn how to distinguish the aspect of the heavens, but the signs of the times you cannot.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:4">16:4</A>&nbsp;A wicked and faithless generation are eager for a sign; but none shall be given to them except the sign of Jonah." and He left them and went away.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:5">16:5</A>&nbsp;When the disciples arrived at the other side  of the Lake, they found that they  had forgotten to bring any bread;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:6">16:6</A>&nbsp;and when Jesus said to them, "See to it: beware of the  yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees,"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:7">16:7</A>&nbsp;they reasoned among themselves, saying,  "It is because we have not brought any bread."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:8">16:8</A>&nbsp;Jesus perceived this and said, "Why are you reasoning among yourselves, you men of little faith, because  you have no bread?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:9">16:9</A>&nbsp;Do you not yet understand? nor even remember the 5,000 and the five loaves, and how many basketfuls you carried away,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:10">16:10</A>&nbsp;nor the 4,000 and the seven loaves, and how many hampers you carried away?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:11">16:11</A>&nbsp;How is it you do not understand that it was not about bread that I spoke to you? But beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:12">16:12</A>&nbsp;Then they perceived that He had not warned them against bread-yeast, but against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:13">16:13</A>&nbsp;When He arrived in the neighbourhood of Caesarea Philippi, Jesus  questioned His disciples. "Who do people  say that the Son of Man is?" He asked.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:14">16:14</A>&nbsp;"Some say John the Baptist," they replied; "others Elijah; others Jeremiah or one of the Prophets."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:15">16:15</A>&nbsp;"But you, who do you say that I am?" He asked again.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:16">16:16</A>&nbsp;"You," replied  Simon Peter, "are the Christ, the Son of the  ever-living God."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:17">16:17</A>&nbsp;"Blessed are you, Simon Bar-jonah," said Jesus; "for  mere human nature has not revealed this to you, but my Father in Heaven.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:18">16:18</A>&nbsp;And I declare to you that you are  Peter, and that upon this  Rock I will build my Church, and the  might of Hades shall not triumph over it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:19">16:19</A>&nbsp;I will give  you the keys of the Kingdom of the Heavens; and whatever you bind on earth shall  remain bound in Heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall remain loosed in Heaven."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:20">16:20</A>&nbsp;Then He urged His disciples to tell no one that He was the Christ.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:21">16:21</A>&nbsp;From this time  Jesus began to explain to His disciples that He  must go to Jerusalem, and suffer much cruelty from the Elders and the High Priests and the Scribes, and be put to death, and on the third day  be raised to life again.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:22">16:22</A>&nbsp;Then Peter  took Him aside and began taking Him to task. "Master," he said,  "God forbid; this  will not be your lot."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:23">16:23</A>&nbsp;But He turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me,  Adversary; you are a  hindrance to me, because your thoughts are not God's thoughts, but men's."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:24">16:24</A>&nbsp;Then Jesus said to His disciples, "If any one desires to follow me, let him renounce self and take up his cross, and so be my follower.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:25">16:25</A>&nbsp;For whoever desires to save his  life shall lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake  shall find it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:26">16:26</A>&nbsp;Why, what benefit will it be to a man if he gains the whole world but  forfeits his life? Or what shall a man give  to buy back his life?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:27">16:27</A>&nbsp;For the Son of Man is soon to come in the glory of the Father with  His angels, and then will He requite every man according to his actions.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:28">16:28</A>&nbsp;I solemnly tell you that some of those who are standing here will certainly not taste death till they have  seen the Son of Man coming in His Kingdom."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:1">17:1</A>&nbsp;Six day later, Jesus took with Him Peter and the brothers James and John, and brought them up  a high mountain to a solitary place.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:2">17:2</A>&nbsp;There in their presence His form underwent a change; His face shone like the sun, and His raiment became as white as the light.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:3">17:3</A>&nbsp;And suddenly Moses and Elijah appeared to them conversing with Him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:4">17:4</A>&nbsp;Then Peter said to Jesus, "Master,  we are thankful to you that we are here. If you approve, I will put up three tents here, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:5">17:5</A>&nbsp;He was still speaking when a luminous cloud  spread over them; and a voice was heard from within the cloud, which said, "This is My Son dearly beloved, in whom is My delight. Listen to Him."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:6">17:6</A>&nbsp;On hearing this voice, the disciples fell on their faces and were filled with terror.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:7">17:7</A>&nbsp;But Jesus came and touched them, and said, "Rouse yourselves and have no fear."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:8">17:8</A>&nbsp;So they looked up, and saw no one but Jesus.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:9">17:9</A>&nbsp;As they were descending the mountain, Jesus laid a command upon them. "Tell no one," He said, "of the sight you have seen till the Son of Man has risen from among the dead."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:10">17:10</A>&nbsp;"Why then," asked the disciples, "do the Scribes say that Elijah must first come?"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:11">17:11</A>&nbsp;"Elijah was indeed to come," He replied, "and would reform everything.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:12">17:12</A>&nbsp;But I tell you that he has already come, and they did not recognize him, but dealt with him as they chose. And before long the Son of Man will be treated by them in a similar way."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:13">17:13</A>&nbsp;Then it dawned upon the disciples that it was John the Baptist about whom He had spoken to them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:14">17:14</A>&nbsp;When they had returned to the people, there came to Him a man who fell on his knees before Him and besought Him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:15">17:15</A>&nbsp;"Sir," he said, "have pity on my son, for he is an epileptic and is very ill. Often he falls into the fire and often into the water.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:16">17:16</A>&nbsp;I have brought him to your disciples, and they have not been able to cure him."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:17">17:17</A>&nbsp;"O unbelieving and  perverse generation!" replied Jesus; "how long shall I be with you? how long shall I endure you? Bring him  to me."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:18">17:18</A>&nbsp;Then Jesus reprimanded the demon, and it came out and left him; and the boy was cured from that moment.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:19">17:19</A>&nbsp;Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and asked Him, "Why could not we expel the demon?"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:20">17:20</A>&nbsp;"Because your faith is so small," He replied; "for I solemnly declare to you that if you have faith  like a mustard-seed, you shall say to this mountain, `Remove from this place to that,' and it will remove; and nothing shall be impossible to you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:21">17:21</A>&nbsp;But an evil spirit of this kind is only driven out by prayer and fasting."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:22">17:22</A>&nbsp;As they were  travelling about in Galilee, Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:23">17:23</A>&nbsp;they will put Him to death, but on the third day He will be raised to life again." And they were exceedingly distressed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:24">17:24</A>&nbsp;After their arrival at Capernaum the collectors of the half-shekel came and asked Peter, "Does not your Teacher pay  the half-shekel?"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:25">17:25</A>&nbsp;"Yes," he replied, and then went into the house. But before he spoke a word Jesus said, "What think you, Simon? From whom do this world's kings receive customs or capitation tax? from their own children, or from others?"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:26">17:26</A>&nbsp;"From others," he replied. "Then  the children go free," said Jesus.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:27">17:27</A>&nbsp;"However, lest we  cause them to sin, go and throw a hook into the Lake, and take the first fish that comes up. When you open its mouth, you will find a shekel in it: bring that coin and give it to them  for yourself and me."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:1">18:1</A>&nbsp;Just  then the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Who  ranks higher than others in the Kingdom of the Heavens?"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:2">18:2</A>&nbsp;So He called a young child to Him, and, bidding him stand in the midst of them,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:3">18:3</A>&nbsp;said, "In solemn truth I tell you that unless you  turn and become like little children, you will in no case be admitted into the Kingdom of the Heavens.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:4">18:4</A>&nbsp;Whoever therefore shall humble himself as this young child, he it is who  is superior to others in the Kingdom of the Heavens.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:5">18:5</A>&nbsp;And whoever for my sake receives one young child such as this, receives me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:6">18:6</A>&nbsp;But whoever shall  occasion the fall of one of these little ones who believe in me, it would be better for him to have a  millstone hung round his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:7">18:7</A>&nbsp;"Alas for the world because of causes of falling! They cannot but come, but alas for each man through whom they come!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:8">18:8</A>&nbsp;If your hand or your foot is causing you to fall into sin, cut it off and away with it. It is better for you to enter  into Life crippled in hand or foot than to remain in possession of two sound hands or feet but be thrown into the fire  of the Ages.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:9">18:9</A>&nbsp;And if your eye is causing you to fall into sin, tear it out and away with it; it is better for you to enter into Life with only one eye, than to remain in possession of two eyes but be thrown into the  Gehenna of fire.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:10">18:10</A>&nbsp;"Beware of ever despising one of these little ones, for I tell you that in Heaven  their angels  have continual access to my Father who is in Heaven.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:11">18:11</A>&nbsp;[]</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:12">18:12</A>&nbsp;What do you yourselves think? Suppose a man gets a hundred sheep and one of them strays away, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go and look for the one that is straying?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:13">18:13</A>&nbsp;And if he succeeds in finding it, in solemn truth I tell you that he rejoices over it more than he does over the ninety-nine that have not gone astray.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:14">18:14</A>&nbsp;Just so it is not the will  of your Father in Heaven that one of these little ones should be lost.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:15">18:15</A>&nbsp;"If your brother  acts wrongly  towards you, go and point out his fault to him when only you and he are there. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:16">18:16</A>&nbsp;But if he will not listen to you, go again, and ask one or two to go with you, that every word spoken may be attested by two or three witnesses.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:17">18:17</A>&nbsp;If he refuses to hear them, appeal to  the Church; and if he refuses to hear even  the Church,  regard him just as you regard a Gentile or a tax-gatherer.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:18">18:18</A>&nbsp;I solemnly tell you that whatever you  as a Church bind on earth will in Heaven be held as bound, and whatever you loose on earth will in Heaven be held to be loosed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:19">18:19</A>&nbsp;I also solemnly tell you that if two of you here on earth agree together concerning anything whatever that they shall ask, the boon will come to them from my Father who is in Heaven.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:20">18:20</A>&nbsp;For where there are two or three assembled in my name, there am I  in the midst of them."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:21">18:21</A>&nbsp;At this point Peter came to Him with the question, "Master, how often shall my brother act wrongly towards me and I forgive him? seven times?"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:22">18:22</A>&nbsp;"I do not say seven times," answered Jesus, "but  seventy times seven times.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:23">18:23</A>&nbsp;"For this reason the Kingdom of the Heavens  may be compared to  a king who determined to have a settlement of accounts with his  servants.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:24">18:24</A>&nbsp;But as soon as he began the settlement, one was brought before him who owed  10,000 talents,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:25">18:25</A>&nbsp;and was unable to pay. So his  master ordered that he and his wife and children and everything that he had should be sold, and payment be made.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:26">18:26</A>&nbsp;The servant therefore falling down, prostrated himself at his feet and entreated him. "`Only give me time,' he said, `and I will pay you the whole.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:27">18:27</A>&nbsp;"Whereupon his master, touched with compassion, set him free and forgave him the  debt.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:28">18:28</A>&nbsp;But no sooner had that servant gone out, than he met with one of his fellow servants who owed him 100  shillings; and seizing him by the throat and nearly strangling him he exclaimed, "`Pay me all you owe.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:29">18:29</A>&nbsp;"His fellow servant therefore fell at his feet and entreated him, "`Only give me time,' he said, `and I will pay you.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:30">18:30</A>&nbsp;"He would not, however, but went and threw him into prison until he should pay what was due.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:31">18:31</A>&nbsp;His fellow servants, therefore, seeing what had happened, were exceedingly angry; and they came and told their master without reserve all that had happened.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:32">18:32</A>&nbsp;At once his master called him and said, "`Wicked servant, I forgave you all that debt, because you entreated me:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:33">18:33</A>&nbsp;ought not you also to have had pity on your fellow servant, just as I had pity on you?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:34">18:34</A>&nbsp;"So his master, greatly incensed, handed him over to the  jailers until he should pay all he owed him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:35">18:35</A>&nbsp;"In the same way  my Heavenly Father will deal with you, if you do not all of you forgive one another from your hearts."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:1">19:1</A>&nbsp;When Jesus had finished these discourses, He removed from Galilee and came into that  part of Judaea which lay beyond the Jordan.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:2">19:2</A>&nbsp;And a vast multitude followed him, and He cured them there.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:3">19:3</A>&nbsp;Then came  some of the Pharisees to Him to put Him to the proof by the question, "Has a man a right to divorce his wife  whenever he chooses?"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:4">19:4</A>&nbsp;"Have you not read," He replied, "that He who made them &lt;`made them'&gt; from the beginning &lt;`male and female,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:5">19:5</A>&nbsp;and said, For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and  be united to his wife, and the two shall be  one'?&gt;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:6">19:6</A>&nbsp;Thus they are no longer two, but  `one'! What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:7">19:7</A>&nbsp;"Why then," said they, "did Moses command the husband to give her `a written notice of divorce,' and so put her away?"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:8">19:8</A>&nbsp;"Moses," He replied,  "in consideration of the  hardness of your nature permitted you to put away your wives, but it has not been so from the beginning.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:9">19:9</A>&nbsp;And I tell you that whoever divorces his wife for any reason except her unfaithfulness, and marries another woman,  commits adultery."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:10">19:10</A>&nbsp;"If this is the case with a man in relation to his wife," said the disciples to Him, "it is better not to marry."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:11">19:11</A>&nbsp;"It is not every man," He replied, "who can receive this teaching, but  only those on whom the grace has been bestowed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:12">19:12</A>&nbsp;There are men who from their birth have been disabled from marriage, others who have been so disabled by men, and others who have disabled themselves for the sake of the Kingdom of the Heavens. He who is able to receive this, let him receive it."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:13">19:13</A>&nbsp;Then young children were brought to Him for Him to put His hands on them and pray; but the disciples interfered.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:14">19:14</A>&nbsp;Jesus however said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them; for it is to those who are childlike that the Kingdom of the Heavens belongs."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:15">19:15</A>&nbsp;So He laid His hands upon them and went away.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:16">19:16</A>&nbsp;"Teacher," said one man, coming up to Him, "what that is good shall I do in order to win the Life  of the Ages?"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:17">19:17</A>&nbsp;"Why do you ask me," He replied, "about what is good? There is only One who is truly good. But if you desire to enter into Life, keep the Commandments."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:18">19:18</A>&nbsp;"Which Commandments?" he asked. Jesus answered, &lt;"`Thou shalt not kill;' `Thou shalt not commit adultery;' `Thou shalt not steal;' `Thou shalt not lie in giving evidence;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:19">19:19</A>&nbsp;`Honour thy father and thy mother'; and `Thou shalt love thy fellow man as much as thyself.'"&gt;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:20">19:20</A>&nbsp;"All of these," said the young man, "I have  carefully kept. What do I still lack?"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:21">19:21</A>&nbsp;"If you desire to be perfect," replied Jesus, "go and sell all that you have, and give to the poor, and you shall have wealth in Heaven; and come, follow me."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:22">19:22</A>&nbsp;On hearing those words the young man went away much cast down; for he had much property.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:23">19:23</A>&nbsp;So Jesus said to His disciples, "I solemnly tell you that it is with difficulty that a rich man will enter the Kingdom of the Heavens.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:24">19:24</A>&nbsp;Yes, I tell you, it is easier for a  camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:25">19:25</A>&nbsp;These words utterly amazed the disciples, and they asked, "Who then can be saved?"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:26">19:26</A>&nbsp;Jesus looked at them and said, "With men this is impossible, but with God everything is possible."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:27">19:27</A>&nbsp;Then Peter said to Jesus, "See, *we* have forsaken everything and followed you; what then will be *our* reward?"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:28">19:28</A>&nbsp;"I solemnly tell you," replied Jesus, "that  in the New Creation, when the Son of Man has taken His seat on  His glorious throne, all of you who have followed me shall also sit on twelve thrones and judge the twelve tribes of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:29">19:29</A>&nbsp;And whoever has forsaken houses, or brothers or sisters, or father  or mother, or children or lands, for my sake, shall receive  many times as much and shall have as his inheritance the Life  of the Ages.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:30">19:30</A>&nbsp;"But many who are now first will be last, and many who are now last will be first.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:1">20:1</A>&nbsp;"For the Kingdom of the Heavens is like  an employer who went out early in the morning to hire men to work in his vineyard,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:2">20:2</A>&nbsp;and having made an agreement with them for a shilling a day, sent them into his vineyard.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:3">20:3</A>&nbsp;About nine o'clock he went out and saw others loitering in the market-place.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:4">20:4</A>&nbsp;To these also he said, "`You also, go into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:5">20:5</A>&nbsp;"So they went. Again about twelve, and about three o'clock, he went out and did the same.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:6">20:6</A>&nbsp;And going out about five o'clock he found others loitering, and he asked them, "`Why  have you been standing here all day long, doing nothing?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:7">20:7</A>&nbsp;"`Because  no one has hired us,' they replied. "`You also, go into the vineyard,' he said.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:8">20:8</A>&nbsp;"When evening came, the master said to his steward, "`Call the men and pay them their wages. Begin with the last set and finish with the first.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:9">20:9</A>&nbsp;"When those came who had begun at five o'clock, they received a shilling apiece;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:10">20:10</A>&nbsp;and when the first came, they expected to get more, but they also each got  the shilling.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:11">20:11</A>&nbsp;So when they had received it, they grumbled against the employer, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:12">20:12</A>&nbsp;"`These who came last  have done  only one hour's work, and  you have put them on a level with us who have worked the whole day and have borne the scorching heat.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:13">20:13</A>&nbsp;"`My friend,' he answered to one of them, `I am doing you no injustice.  Did you not agree with me for a shilling?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:14">20:14</A>&nbsp;Take your money and go. I choose to give this last comer just as much as I give you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:15">20:15</A>&nbsp;Have I not a right to do what I choose with my own property? Or are you envious because I am  generous?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:16">20:16</A>&nbsp;"So the last shall be first, and the first last." </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:17">20:17</A>&nbsp;Jesus was now going up to Jerusalem, and He took the twelve disciples aside by themselves, and on the way He said to them,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:18">20:18</A>&nbsp;"We are going up to Jerusalem, and there the Son of Man will be betrayed to the High Priests and Scribes. They will condemn Him to death,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:19">20:19</A>&nbsp;and hand Him over to the Gentiles to be made sport of and scourged and crucified; and on the third day He  will be raised to life."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:20">20:20</A>&nbsp;Then the mother of the sons of Zabdi came to Him with her sons, and knelt before Him to make a request of Him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:21">20:21</A>&nbsp;"What is it you desire?" He asked. "Command," she replied, "that these my two sons may sit one at your right hand and one at your left in  your Kingdom."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:22">20:22</A>&nbsp;"None of you know what you are asking for," said Jesus; "can you drink  out of the cup  from which I am about to drink?" "We can," they replied.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:23">20:23</A>&nbsp;"You shall drink out of my cup," He said, "but a seat at my right hand or at my left it is not for me to allot, but it belongs to those for whom it has been  prepared by my Father."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:24">20:24</A>&nbsp;The  other ten heard of this, and their indignation was aroused  against the two brothers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:25">20:25</A>&nbsp;But Jesus called them to Him, and said, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great men exercise authority over them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:26">20:26</A>&nbsp;Not so  shall it be among you; but whoever desires to be great among you shall be your servant,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:27">20:27</A>&nbsp;and whoever desires to be first among you shall be your bondservant;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:28">20:28</A>&nbsp;just as the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give His life as the  redemption-price  for many."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:29">20:29</A>&nbsp;As they were leaving Jericho, an immense crowd following Him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:30">20:30</A>&nbsp;two blind men sitting by the roadside heard that it was Jesus who was passing by, and cried aloud, "Sir, Son of David, pity us."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:31">20:31</A>&nbsp;The people angrily tried to silence them, but they cried all the louder. "O Sir, Son of David, pity us," they said.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:32">20:32</A>&nbsp;So Jesus stood still and called to them. "What shall I do for you?" He asked.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:33">20:33</A>&nbsp;"Sir, let our eyes be opened," they replied.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:34">20:34</A>&nbsp;Moved with compassion, Jesus touched their eyes, and immediately they regained their sight and followed Him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:1">21:1</A>&nbsp;When they were come near Jerusalem and had arrived at Bethphage and the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of the disciples on in front,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:2">21:2</A>&nbsp;saying to them, "Go to the village you see facing you, and as you enter it you will find a she-ass tied up and a foal with her. Untie her and  bring them to me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:3">21:3</A>&nbsp;And if any one says anything to you, say,  `The Master needs them,' and he will at once send them."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:4">21:4</A>&nbsp;This  took place in order that the Prophet's prediction might be fulfilled:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:5">21:5</A>&nbsp;&lt;"Tell the  Daughter of Zion, `See, thy King is coming  to thee, gentle,  and yet mounted on an ass, even on a colt the  foal of a beast of burden.'"&gt;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:6">21:6</A>&nbsp;So the disciples went and did as Jesus had instructed them:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:7">21:7</A>&nbsp;they brought the she-ass and the foal, and threw their outer garments on them. So He sat on them;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:8">21:8</A>&nbsp;and most of the crowd kept spreading their garments along the road, while others  cut branches from the trees and  carpeted the road with them,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:9">21:9</A>&nbsp;and the multitudes--some of the people preceding Him and some following--sang aloud,  &lt;"God save the Son of David! Blessings on Him who comes in the Lord's name! God in the highest Heavens save Him!"&gt;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:10">21:10</A>&nbsp;When He thus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was thrown into commotion, every one inquiring, "Who is this?"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:11">21:11</A>&nbsp;"This is Jesus, the Prophet, from Nazareth in Galilee," replied the crowds.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:12">21:12</A>&nbsp;Entering  the Temple, Jesus drove out all who were buying and selling there, and overturned the money-changers' tables and the seats of the pigeon-dealers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:13">21:13</A>&nbsp;"It is written," He said, &lt;"`My House shall be called  the House of Prayer',&gt; but you are making it &lt;a robbers' cave."&gt;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:14">21:14</A>&nbsp;And  the blind and the lame came to Him in the Temple, and He cured them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:15">21:15</A>&nbsp;But when the High Priests and the Scribes saw the wonderful things that He had done and the children who were crying aloud in the Temple, &lt;"God save the Son of David,"&gt; they were filled with indignation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:16">21:16</A>&nbsp;"Do you hear," they asked Him, "what these children are saying?" "Yes," He replied; "have you never read, &lt;`Out of the mouths of infants and of babes at the breast Thou hast brought forth the praise which is due'?"&gt;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:17">21:17</A>&nbsp;So He left them and went out of the city to Bethany and passed the night there.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:18">21:18</A>&nbsp;Early in the morning  as He was on His way to return to the city He was hungry,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:19">21:19</A>&nbsp;and seeing  a fig-tree on the road-side He went up to it, but found nothing on it but leaves. "On you," He said, "no fruit shall ever again grow." And immediately the fig-tree withered away.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:20">21:20</A>&nbsp;When the disciples saw it they exclaimed in astonishment, "How instantaneously the fig-tree has withered away!"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:21">21:21</A>&nbsp;"I solemnly tell you," said Jesus, "that if you have an unwavering faith, you shall not only perform such a miracle as this of the fig-tree, but that even if you say to this mountain, `Be thou lifted up and hurled into the sea,' it shall be done;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:22">21:22</A>&nbsp;and everything, whatever it be, that you ask for in your prayers, if you have faith, you shall obtain."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:23">21:23</A>&nbsp;He entered the Temple; and while He was teaching, the High Priests and the Elders of the people came to Him and asked Him, "By  what authority are you doing  these things? and who gave you this authority?"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:24">21:24</A>&nbsp;"And I also have a question to ask *you*," replied Jesus, "and if you answer me, I in turn will tell you by what authority I do these things.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:25">21:25</A>&nbsp;John's Baptism, whence was it? --had it a heavenly or a human origin?" So they debated the matter among themselves. "If we say `a heavenly origin,'" they argued, "he will say, `Why then did you not believe him?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:26">21:26</A>&nbsp;and if we say `a human origin' we have the people to fear, for they all hold John to have been a Prophet."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:27">21:27</A>&nbsp;So they answered Jesus, "We do not know."  "Nor do I tell you," He replied, "by what authority I do these things."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:28">21:28</A>&nbsp;"But give me your judgement. There was a man who had two  sons. He came to the elder of them, and said, "`My  son, go and work in the vineyard to-day.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:29">21:29</A>&nbsp;"`I will not,' he replied. "But afterwards he was sorry, and went.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:30">21:30</A>&nbsp;He came to the second and spoke in the same manner. His answer was, "`I will go, Sir.' "But he did not go.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:31">21:31</A>&nbsp;Which of the two did as his father desired?"  "The first," they said. "I solemnly tell you,' replied Jesus, "that the tax-gatherers and the notorious sinners are entering the Kingdom of God  in front of you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:32">21:32</A>&nbsp;For John came to you observing all sorts of ritual, and you put no faith in him: the tax-gatherers and the notorious sinners did put faith in him, and you, though you saw this example set you, were not even afterwards sorry so as to believe him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:33">21:33</A>&nbsp;"Listen to another parable. There was a householder who planted a vineyard, made a fence round it, dug a wine-tank in it, and built a strong lodge; then let the place to vine-dressers, and went abroad.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:34">21:34</A>&nbsp;When vintage-time approached, he sent his  servants to the vine-dressers to receive his share of the  grapes;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:35">21:35</A>&nbsp;but the vine-dressers seized the servants, and one they cruelly beat, one they killed, one they pelted with stones.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:36">21:36</A>&nbsp;Again he sent another party of servants more numerous than the first; and these they treated in the same manner.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:37">21:37</A>&nbsp;Later still he sent to them  his son,  saying, "`They will respect my son.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:38">21:38</A>&nbsp;"But the vine-dressers, when they saw the son, said to one another, "`Here is the heir: come, let us kill him and get his inheritance.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:39">21:39</A>&nbsp;"So they seized him, dragged him out of the vineyard, and killed him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:40">21:40</A>&nbsp;When then the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those vine-dressers?"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:41">21:41</A>&nbsp;"He will put the wretches to a wretched death," was the reply, "and will entrust the vineyard to other vine-dressers who will render the produce to him at the vintage season."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:42">21:42</A>&nbsp;"Have you never read in the Scriptures," said Jesus, &lt;"`The Stone which the builders rejected has been made the Cornerstone: this Cornerstone  came from the Lord, and is wonderful in our eyes'?&gt;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:43">21:43</A>&nbsp;"That, I tell you, is the reason why the Kingdom of God will be taken away from you, and given to a nation  that will exhibit the power  of it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:44">21:44</A>&nbsp;He who  falls on this stone will be severely hurt; but he on whom it falls will be utterly crushed."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:45">21:45</A>&nbsp;After listening to His parables the High Priests and the Pharisees perceived that He was speaking about them;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:46">21:46</A>&nbsp;but though they were eager to lay hands upon Him, they were afraid of the people, for by them He was regarded as a Prophet.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:1">22:1</A>&nbsp;Again Jesus spoke to them in figurative language.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:2">22:2</A>&nbsp;"The Kingdom of the Heavens," He said,  "may be compared to  a king who celebrated the marriage of his son,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:3">22:3</A>&nbsp;and sent his  servants to call the invited guests to the wedding, but they were unwilling to come.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:4">22:4</A>&nbsp;"Again he sent other servants with a message to those who were invited. "`My  breakfast is now ready," he said, `my bullocks and fat cattle are killed, and every preparation is made: come to the wedding.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:5">22:5</A>&nbsp;"They however gave no heed, but went, one to his home in the country, another to his business;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:6">22:6</A>&nbsp;and the rest seized the king's servants, maltreated them, and murdered them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:7">22:7</A>&nbsp;So the king's anger was stirred, and he sent his troops and destroyed those murderers and burnt their city.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:8">22:8</A>&nbsp;Then he said to his servants, "`The wedding banquet is ready, but those who were invited were unworthy of it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:9">22:9</A>&nbsp;Go out therefore to the crossroads, and everybody you meet invite to the wedding.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:10">22:10</A>&nbsp;"So they went out into the roads and gathered together all they  could find, both bad and good, and the  banqueting hall was filled with guests.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:11">22:11</A>&nbsp;"Now the king came in to see the guests; and among them he discovered one who was not wearing a wedding-robe.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:12">22:12</A>&nbsp;"`My friend,' he said, `how is it that you came in here without a wedding robe?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:13">22:13</A>&nbsp;"The man  stood speechless. Then the king said to the servants, "`Bind him hand and foot and fling him into the darkness outside: there will be the weeping aloud and the gnashing of teeth.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:14">22:14</A>&nbsp;"For there are many called, but few chosen."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:15">22:15</A>&nbsp;Then the Pharisees went and consulted together how they might entrap Him in His conversation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:16">22:16</A>&nbsp;So they sent to Him their disciples together with the Herodians;  who said, "Teacher, we know that you are truthful and that you faithfully teach God's truth; and that no fear of man misleads you, for you  are not biased by men's wealth or rank.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:17">22:17</A>&nbsp;Give us your judgement therefore: is it allowable for us to pay a poll-tax to Caesar, or not?"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:18">22:18</A>&nbsp;Perceiving their wickedness, Jesus replied, "Why are you hypocrites trying to ensnare me?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:19">22:19</A>&nbsp;Show me the tribute coin." And they brought Him a shilling.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:20">22:20</A>&nbsp;"Whose likeness and inscription," He asked, "is this?"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:21">22:21</A>&nbsp;"Caesar's," they replied. "Pay therefore," He rejoined, "what is Caesar's to Caesar; and what is God's to God."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:22">22:22</A>&nbsp;They heard this, and were astonished; then left Him, and went their way.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:23">22:23</A>&nbsp;On the same day a party of Sadducees came to Him, contending that there is no resurrection. And they put this case to Him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:24">22:24</A>&nbsp;"Teacher," they said, "Moses enjoined, &lt;`If a man die childless, his brother shall marry his widow, and raise up a family for him.'&gt;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:25">22:25</A>&nbsp;Now we had among us seven brothers. The eldest of them married, but died childless, leaving his wife to his brother.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:26">22:26</A>&nbsp;So also did the second and the third, down to the seventh,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:27">22:27</A>&nbsp;till the woman also died, after surviving them all.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:28">22:28</A>&nbsp;At the Resurrection, therefore, whose wife of the seven will she be? for they all married her."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:29">22:29</A>&nbsp;The reply of Jesus was, "You are in error, through ignorance of the Scriptures and of the power of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:30">22:30</A>&nbsp;For in the Resurrection, men neither marry nor are women given in marriage, but they are like  angels in Heaven.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:31">22:31</A>&nbsp;But as to the Resurrection of the dead, have you never read what God says to you,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:32">22:32</A>&nbsp;&lt;`I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'?&gt; He is not the God of dead, but of living men."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:33">22:33</A>&nbsp;All the crowd heard this, and were filled with amazement at His teaching.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:34">22:34</A>&nbsp;Now the Pharisees came up when they heard that He  had silenced the Sadducees,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:35">22:35</A>&nbsp;and one of them, an expounder of the Law, asked Him as a test question,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:36">22:36</A>&nbsp;"Teacher,  which is the  greatest Commandment in the Law?"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:37">22:37</A>&nbsp;&lt;"`Thou shalt love the Lord thy God,'"&gt; He answered,  &lt;"`with thy whole heart, thy whole soul, thy whole mind.'&gt;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:38">22:38</A>&nbsp;This is the greatest and foremost Commandment.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:39">22:39</A>&nbsp;And the second is similar to it: &lt;`Thou shalt love thy fellow man  as much as thyself.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:40">22:40</A>&nbsp;The whole of the Law and the Prophets is summed up in these two Commandments."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:41">22:41</A>&nbsp;While the Pharisees were still assembled there, Jesus put a question to them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:42">22:42</A>&nbsp;"What think you about the Christ," He said, "whose son is He?" "David's," they replied.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:43">22:43</A>&nbsp;"How then," He asked, "does David,  taught by the Spirit, call Him Lord, when he says,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:44">22:44</A>&nbsp;&lt;"`The Lord said to my Lord, sit at My right hand until I have put thy foes beneath thy feet'?&gt;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:45">22:45</A>&nbsp;"If therefore David calls Him Lord, how can He be his son?"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:46">22:46</A>&nbsp;No one could say a word in reply, nor from that day did any one venture again to put a question to Him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:1">23:1</A>&nbsp;Then Jesus addressed the crowds and His disciples.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:2">23:2</A>&nbsp;"The Scribes," He said, "and the Pharisees  sit in the chair of Moses.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:3">23:3</A>&nbsp;Therefore do and observe everything that they command you; but do not imitate their lives, for though they tell others what to do, they do not do it themselves.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:4">23:4</A>&nbsp;Heavy  and cumbrous burdens they bind together and load men's shoulders with them, while as for themselves, not with one finger do they choose to lift them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:5">23:5</A>&nbsp;And everything they do they do with a view to being observed by men; for they widen their  phylacteries and make the tassels large,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:6">23:6</A>&nbsp;and love the best seats at a dinner party or in the synagogues,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:7">23:7</A>&nbsp;and like to be bowed to in places of public resort, and to be addressed by men as `Rabbi.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:8">23:8</A>&nbsp;"As for you, do not accept the title of `Rabbi,' for one alone is your Teacher, and you are all brothers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:9">23:9</A>&nbsp;And call no one on earth your Father, for One alone is your Father--the Heavenly Father.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:10">23:10</A>&nbsp;And do not accept the name of `leader,' for your Leader is one alone--the Christ.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:11">23:11</A>&nbsp;He who is the greatest among you shall be your servant;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:12">23:12</A>&nbsp;and one who exalts himself shall be abased, while one who abases himself shall be exalted.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:13">23:13</A>&nbsp;"But alas for you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you lock the door of the Kingdom of the Heavens against men; you yourselves do not enter, nor do you allow those to enter who are seeking to do so.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:14">23:14</A>&nbsp;[]</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:15">23:15</A>&nbsp;"Alas for you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you scour sea and land in order to win one convert--and when he is gained, you make him twice as much a son of Gehenna as yourselves.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:16">23:16</A>&nbsp;"Alas for you, you blind guides, who say, "`Whoever swears by  the Sanctuary it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the Sanctuary, is bound by the oath.'</p>

<p><A NAME="an_23:18">23:18</A>&nbsp;And you say, "`Whoever swears by the altar, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the offering lying on it is bound by the oath.'</p>

<p><A NAME="an_23:20">23:20</A>&nbsp;He who swears by the altar swears both by it and by everything on it;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:21">23:21</A>&nbsp;he who swears by the Sanctuary swears both by it and by Him who  dwells in it;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:22">23:22</A>&nbsp;and he who swears by Heaven swears both by the throne of God and by Him who sits upon it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:23">23:23</A>&nbsp;"Alas for you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you pay the tithe on mint, dill, and cumin, while you have neglected the weightier requirements of the Law--just judgement, mercy, and faithful dealing. These things you ought to have done, and yet you ought not to have left the others undone.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:24">23:24</A>&nbsp;You blind guides, straining out the gnat while you gulp down the camel!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:25">23:25</A>&nbsp;"Alas for you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you wash clean the outside of the cup or dish, while within they are full of greed and  self-indulgence.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_23:27">23:27</A>&nbsp;"Alas for you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you are just like whitewashed sepulchres, the outside of which pleases the eye, though inside they are full of dead men's bones and of all that is unclean.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:28">23:28</A>&nbsp;The same is true of you: outwardly you seem to the human eye to be good and honest men, but, within, you are full of insincerity and  disregard of God's Law.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:29">23:29</A>&nbsp;"Alas for you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you repair the sepulchres of the Prophets and  keep in order the tombs of the righteous,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:30">23:30</A>&nbsp;and your boast is, "`If we had lived in the time of our forefathers, we should not have been implicated with them in the murder of the Prophets.'</p>

<p><A NAME="an_23:33">23:33</A>&nbsp;O serpents, O vipers' brood, how are you  to escape  condemnation to  Gehenna?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:34">23:34</A>&nbsp;"For this reason I am sending to you Prophets and wise men and Scribes. Some of them you will put to death--nay, crucify; some of them you will flog in your synagogues and chase from town to town;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:35">23:35</A>&nbsp;that all the innocent blood  shed upon earth may come on you, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah the son of Berechiah whom you murdered between the Sanctuary and the altar.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:36">23:36</A>&nbsp;I tell you in solemn truth that all these things will come upon the present generation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:37">23:37</A>&nbsp;"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem! thou who murderest the Prophets and stonest those who have been sent to thee! how often have I desired to gather thy children to me, just as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings, and you would not come!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:38">23:38</A>&nbsp;See, your house  will now be left to you  desolate!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:39">23:39</A>&nbsp;For I tell you that you will never see me again until you say,  &lt;`Blessed be He who comes in the name of the Lord.'"&gt;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:1">24:1</A>&nbsp;Jesus had left  the Temple and was going on His way, when His disciples came and called His attention to the Temple  buildings.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:2">24:2</A>&nbsp;"You see all these?" He replied; "in solemn truth I tell you that there will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be pulled down."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:3">24:3</A>&nbsp;Afterwards He was on the Mount of Olives and was seated there when the disciples came to Him, apart from the others, and said, "Tell us when this will be; and what will be the sign of your  Coming and of the Close of the  Age?"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:4">24:4</A>&nbsp;"Take care that no one misleads you," answered Jesus;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:5">24:5</A>&nbsp;"for many will come  assuming my name and saying `I am the Christ;' and they will mislead many.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:6">24:6</A>&nbsp;And before long you will hear of wars and rumours of wars. Do not be alarmed, for such things must be; but the  End is not yet.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_24:9">24:9</A>&nbsp;"At that time they will deliver you up to punishment and will put you to death; and you will be objects of hatred to all the nations because you are called by my name.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_24:14">24:14</A>&nbsp;And  this Good News of the Kingdom shall be proclaimed throughout  the whole world to set the evidence before all the  Gentiles; and then  the End will come.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:15">24:15</A>&nbsp;"When you have seen (to use the language of the Prophet Daniel) the &lt;`Abomination of Desolation',&gt; standing in the Holy Place" --let the reader observe those words--</p>

<p><A NAME="an_24:31">24:31</A>&nbsp;And He will send out His angels  &lt;with a loud trumpet-blast,&gt; and &lt;they will  bring together His own People to Him from north, south, east and west--from one extremity of the world to the other.&gt;</p>

<p><A NAME="an_24:50">24:50</A>&nbsp;the master of that servant will arrive on a day when he is not expecting him and at an hour of which he has not been informed;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:51">24:51</A>&nbsp;he will  treat him with the utmost severity and assign him a place among the  hypocrites: there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:1">25:1</A>&nbsp;"Then will the Kingdom of the Heavens  be found to be like ten bridesmaids who took their torches and went out to meet the bridegroom.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:2">25:2</A>&nbsp;Five of them were foolish and five were wise.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:3">25:3</A>&nbsp;For the foolish, when they took their torches, did not provide themselves with oil;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:4">25:4</A>&nbsp;but the wise, besides their  torches, took oil in their  flasks.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:5">25:5</A>&nbsp;The bridegroom was a long time in coming, so that meanwhile they all became drowsy and fell asleep.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:6">25:6</A>&nbsp;But at midnight there is a loud cry, "`The bridegroom! Go out and meet him!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:7">25:7</A>&nbsp;"Then all those bridesmaids roused themselves and trimmed their torches.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:8">25:8</A>&nbsp;"`Give us some of your oil,' said the foolish ones to the wise, `for our torches are going out.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:9">25:9</A>&nbsp;"`But perhaps,' replied the wise, `there will not be enough for all of us. Go to the shops rather, and buy some for yourselves.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:10">25:10</A>&nbsp;"So they went to buy. But meanwhile the bridegroom came; those bridesmaids who were ready went in with him to the wedding banquet; and the door was shut.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:11">25:11</A>&nbsp;"Afterwards the other bridesmaids came and cried, "`Sir, Sir, open the door to us.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:12">25:12</A>&nbsp;"`In solemn truth I tell you,' he replied, `I do not know you.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:13">25:13</A>&nbsp;"Keep awake therefore; for you know neither the day nor the hour.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:14">25:14</A>&nbsp;"Why, it is like a man who, when going on his travels, called his  bondservants and entrusted his property to their care.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:15">25:15</A>&nbsp;To one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one--to each according to his individual capacity; and then started from home.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:16">25:16</A>&nbsp;Without delay the one who had received the five talents went and employed them in business, and gained five more.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:17">25:17</A>&nbsp;In the same way he who had the two gained two more.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:18">25:18</A>&nbsp;But the man who had received the one went and dug a hole and buried his  master's money.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:19">25:19</A>&nbsp;"After a long lapse of time the master of those servants returned, and had a reckoning with them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:20">25:20</A>&nbsp;The one who had received the five talents came and brought five more, and said, "`Sir, it was five talents that you entrusted to me: see, I have gained five more.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:21">25:21</A>&nbsp;"`You have done well,  good and  trustworthy servant,' replied his master; `you have been trustworthy in the management of a little, I will put you in charge of much: share your master's joy.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:22">25:22</A>&nbsp;"The second, who had received the two talents, came and said, "`Sir, it was two talents you entrusted to me: see, I have gained two more.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:23">25:23</A>&nbsp;"`Good and trustworthy servant, you have done well,' his master replied; `you have been trustworthy in the management of a little, I will put you in charge of much:  share your master's joy.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:24">25:24</A>&nbsp;"But, next, the man who had the one talent in his keeping came and said, "`Sir,  I knew you to be a severe man, reaping where you had not sown and garnering  what you had not winnowed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:25">25:25</A>&nbsp;So being afraid I went and buried your talent in the ground: there you have what belongs to you.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:26">25:26</A>&nbsp;"`You wicked and slothful servant,' replied his master, `did you know that I reap where I have not sown, and garner what I have not winnowed?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:27">25:27</A>&nbsp;Your duty then was to deposit my money in some bank, and so when I came I should have got back my property with interest.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:28">25:28</A>&nbsp;So take away the talent from him, and give it to the man who has the ten.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:29">25:29</A>&nbsp;(For to every one who has, more shall be given, and he shall have abundance; but from him  who has nothing, even what he has shall be taken away.)</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:30">25:30</A>&nbsp;`But as for this worthless servant, put him out into the darkness outside: *there* will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:31">25:31</A>&nbsp;"When the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the angels with Him, then will He sit upon His glorious throne,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:32">25:32</A>&nbsp;and  all the nations will be gathered into His presence. And He will separate  them from one another, just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:33">25:33</A>&nbsp;and will make the sheep stand at His right hand, and the goats at His left.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:34">25:34</A>&nbsp;"Then the King will say to those at His right, "`Come, my Father's blessed ones, receive your inheritance of the Kingdom which has been  divinely intended for you ever since the creation of the world.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:35">25:35</A>&nbsp;For when I was hungry, you gave me food; when I was thirsty, you gave me drink; when I was homeless, you gave me a welcome;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:36">25:36</A>&nbsp;when I was ill-clad, you clothed me; when I was sick, you visited me; when I was in prison, you came to see me.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:37">25:37</A>&nbsp;"`When, Lord,' the righteous will reply, `did we see  Thee hungry, and feed Thee; or thirsty, and give Thee drink?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:38">25:38</A>&nbsp;When did we see Thee homeless, and give Thee a welcome? or ill-clad, and clothe Thee?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:39">25:39</A>&nbsp;When did we see Thee sick or in prison, and come to see Thee?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:40">25:40</A>&nbsp;"But the King will answer them, "`In solemn truth I tell you that in so far as you rendered such services to one of the humblest of these my brethren, you rendered them to myself.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:41">25:41</A>&nbsp;"Then will He say to those at His left, "`Begone from me, with the curse resting upon you, into the Fire  of the Ages, which has been  prepared for the Devil and his angels.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:42">25:42</A>&nbsp;For when I was hungry, you gave me nothing to eat; when thirsty, you gave me nothing to drink;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:43">25:43</A>&nbsp;when homeless, you gave me no welcome; ill-clad, you clothed me not; sick or in prison, you visited me not.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:44">25:44</A>&nbsp;"Then will they also answer, "`Lord, when did we see Thee hungry or thirsty or homeless or ill-clad or sick or in prison, and not come to serve Thee?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:45">25:45</A>&nbsp;"But he will reply, "`In solemn truth I tell you that in so far as you withheld such services from one of the humblest of these, you withheld them from me.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:46">25:46</A>&nbsp;"And these shall go away into the  Punishment  of the Ages, but the righteous into the Life  of the Ages."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:1">26:1</A>&nbsp;When Jesus had ended all these discourses, He said to His disciples,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:2">26:2</A>&nbsp;"You know that in  two days' time the Passover comes. And the Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:3">26:3</A>&nbsp;Then the High Priests and Elders of the People assembled in the court of the palace of the High Priest Caiaphas,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:4">26:4</A>&nbsp;and consulted how to get Jesus into their power by stratagem and put Him to death.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:5">26:5</A>&nbsp;But they said, "Not during the Festival, lest there be a riot among the people."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:6">26:6</A>&nbsp;Now when Jesus was come to Bethany and was at the house of Simon the Leper,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:7">26:7</A>&nbsp;a woman came to Him with a jar of very costly, sweet-scented ointment, which she poured over His head as He reclined at table.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:8">26:8</A>&nbsp;"Why such waste?" indignantly exclaimed the disciples;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:9">26:9</A>&nbsp;"for this might have been sold for a considerable sum, and the money given to the poor."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:10">26:10</A>&nbsp;But Jesus heard it, and said to them, "Why are you vexing her? For she has done a most gracious act towards me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:11">26:11</A>&nbsp;The poor you always have with you, but me you have not always.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:12">26:12</A>&nbsp;In pouring this ointment over me, her object was to prepare me for burial.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:13">26:13</A>&nbsp;In solemn truth I tell you that wherever in the whole world this Good News shall be proclaimed, this deed of hers shall be spoken of in memory of her."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:14">26:14</A>&nbsp;At that time one of the Twelve, the one called Judas Iscariot, went to the High Priests</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:15">26:15</A>&nbsp;and said, "What are you willing to give me if I betray him to you?" So they weighed out to him thirty shekels,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:16">26:16</A>&nbsp;and from that moment he was on the look out for an opportunity to betray Him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:17">26:17</A>&nbsp;On the first day of the Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus with the question, "Where shall we make preparations for you to eat the Passover?"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:18">26:18</A>&nbsp;"Go into the city," He replied, "to a certain man, and tell him, `The Teacher says, My time is close at hand. It is at your house that I shall keep the Passover with my disciples.'"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:19">26:19</A>&nbsp;The disciples did as Jesus directed them, and got the Passover ready.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:20">26:20</A>&nbsp;When evening came, He  was at table with the twelve  disciples,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:21">26:21</A>&nbsp;and the meal was proceeding, when Jesus said, "In solemn truth I tell you that one of you will betray me."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:22">26:22</A>&nbsp;Intensely grieved they began one after another to ask Him, "Can it be I, Master?"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:23">26:23</A>&nbsp;"The one who has dipped his fingers in the bowl with me," He answered, "is the man who will betray me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:24">26:24</A>&nbsp;The Son of Man is indeed going as is written concerning Him; but alas for that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It had been a happy thing for that man if he had  never been born."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:25">26:25</A>&nbsp;Then Judas, the disciple who was betraying Him, asked, "Can it be I, Rabbi?"  "It is you," He replied.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:26">26:26</A>&nbsp;During the meal Jesus took  a Passover biscuit, blessed it and broke it. He then gave it to the disciples, saying, "Take this and eat it: it  is my body."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:27">26:27</A>&nbsp;And He  took the cup and gave thanks, and gave it to them saying, "Drink from it, all of you;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:28">26:28</A>&nbsp;for this is my blood which is to be poured out for many for the remission of sins--the blood which ratifies  the Covenant.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:29">26:29</A>&nbsp;I tell you that I will never again take the produce of the vine till that day when I shall drink  the new wine with you in my Father's Kingdom."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:30">26:30</A>&nbsp;So they sang  the hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:31">26:31</A>&nbsp;Then said Jesus, "This night all of you will stumble and fail in your fidelity to me; for it is written, &lt;`I will strike the Shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered in all directions.'&gt;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:32">26:32</A>&nbsp;But after I have risen to life again I will go before you into Galilee."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:33">26:33</A>&nbsp;"All may stumble and fail," said Peter, "but I never will."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:34">26:34</A>&nbsp;"In solemn truth I tell you," replied Jesus, "that this very night,  before the cock crows, you will three times disown me."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:35">26:35</A>&nbsp;"Even if I must die with you," declared Peter, "I will never disown you." In like manner protested all the disciples.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:36">26:36</A>&nbsp;Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane. And He said to the disciples, "Sit down here, whilst I go yonder and there pray."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:37">26:37</A>&nbsp;And He took with Him Peter and the two sons of Zabdi. Then He began to be full of anguish and distress,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:38">26:38</A>&nbsp;and He said to them, "My soul is  crushed with anguish to the very point of death; wait here, and keep awake with me."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:39">26:39</A>&nbsp;Going forward a short distance He fell on His face and prayed. "My Father," He said, "if it is possible, let this  cup pass away from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as Thou willest."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:40">26:40</A>&nbsp;Then He came to the disciples and found them asleep, and He said to Peter, "Alas, none of you could keep awake with me for even a single hour!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:41">26:41</A>&nbsp;Keep awake, and pray that you may not enter into temptation:  the spirit is  right willing, but the  body is frail."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:42">26:42</A>&nbsp;Again a second time He went away and prayed, saying, "My Father, if it is impossible for this cup to pass without my drinking it, Thy will be done."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:43">26:43</A>&nbsp;He came and again found them asleep, for  they were very tired.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:44">26:44</A>&nbsp;So He left them, and went away once more and prayed a third time, again using the same words.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:45">26:45</A>&nbsp;Then He came to the disciples and said, "Sleep on and rest. See, the moment is close at hand when the Son of Man is to be betrayed into the hands of sinful men.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:46">26:46</A>&nbsp;Rouse yourselves. Let us be going. My betrayer is close at hand."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:47">26:47</A>&nbsp;He had scarcely finished speaking when Judas came--one of the Twelve--accompanied by a great crowd of men armed with swords and bludgeons, sent by the High Priests and Elders of the People.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:48">26:48</A>&nbsp;Now the betrayer had agreed upon a sign with them, to direct them. He had said, "The one whom I kiss is the man: lay hold of him."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:49">26:49</A>&nbsp;So he went straight to Jesus and said,  "Peace to you, Rabbi!" And he kissed Him  eagerly.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:50">26:50</A>&nbsp;"Friend," said Jesus,  "carry out your intention." Then they came and laid their hands on Jesus and seized Him firmly.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:51">26:51</A>&nbsp;But one of those with Jesus drew his sword and struck the High Priest's  servant, cutting off his ear.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:52">26:52</A>&nbsp;"Put back your sword again," said Jesus, "for all who  draw the sword shall perish by the sword.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:53">26:53</A>&nbsp;Or do you suppose I cannot entreat my Father and He would instantly  send to my help more than twelve legions of angels?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:54">26:54</A>&nbsp;In that case how are the Scriptures to be fulfilled which declare that thus it must be?"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:55">26:55</A>&nbsp;Then said Jesus to the crowds, "Have you come out as if to fight with a robber, with swords and bludgeons to apprehend me? Day after day I  have been sitting teaching in the Temple, and you did not arrest me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:56">26:56</A>&nbsp;But all this has taken place in order that the writings of the Prophets may be fulfilled." At this point the disciples all left Him and fled.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:57">26:57</A>&nbsp;But the officers who had laid hold of Jesus led Him away to Caiaphas the High Priest, at whose house the Scribes and the Elders had assembled.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:58">26:58</A>&nbsp;And Peter kept following Him at a distance, till he came even to the court of the High Priest's palace, where he entered and sat down among the  officers to see the issue.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:59">26:59</A>&nbsp;Meanwhile the High Priests and the whole Sanhedrin were seeking false testimony against Jesus in order to put Him to death;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:60">26:60</A>&nbsp;but they could find none, although many false witnesses came forward. At length there came two</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:61">26:61</A>&nbsp;who testified, "This man said, `I am able to pull down the Sanctuary of God and three days afterwards to build a new one.'"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:62">26:62</A>&nbsp;Then the High Priest stood up and asked Him, "Have you no answer to make? What is it these men are saying in evidence against you?"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:63">26:63</A>&nbsp;Jesus however remained silent. Again the High Priest addressed Him. "In the name of the  ever-living God," he said,  "I now put you on your oath. Tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:64">26:64</A>&nbsp;"I am He," replied Jesus. "But I tell you that,  later on, you will see &lt;the Son of Man sitting at the right hand&gt; of Omnipotence, &lt;and coming on the clouds of the sky."&gt;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:65">26:65</A>&nbsp;Then the High Priest tore his robes and exclaimed, "Impious language! What further need have we of witnesses! See, you have now heard the impiety.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:66">26:66</A>&nbsp;What is your verdict?" "He deserves to die," they replied.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:67">26:67</A>&nbsp;Then they spat in His face, and struck Him--some with the fist, some  with the open hand--</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:68">26:68</A>&nbsp;while they taunted Him, saying, "Christ,  prove yourself a Prophet by telling us who it was that struck you."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:69">26:69</A>&nbsp;Peter meanwhile was sitting outside in the court of the palace, when  one of the maidservants came over to him and said, "You too were with Jesus the Galilaean."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:70">26:70</A>&nbsp;He denied it before them all, saying, "I do not know what you mean."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:71">26:71</A>&nbsp;Soon afterwards he went out and stood in the gateway, when another girl saw him, and said, addressing the people there,  "This man was with Jesus the Nazarene."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:72">26:72</A>&nbsp;Again he denied it with an oath. "I do not know the man," he said.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:73">26:73</A>&nbsp;A short time afterwards the people  standing there came and said to Peter, "Certainly you too are one of them, for your brogue shows it."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:74">26:74</A>&nbsp;Then with curses and oaths he declared, "I do not know the man." Immediately a cock crowed,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:75">26:75</A>&nbsp;and Peter recollected the words of Jesus, how He had said, "Before the cock crows you will three times disown me." And he went out and wept  aloud, bitterly.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:1">27:1</A>&nbsp;When morning came all the High Priests and the Elders of the people consulted together against Jesus to put Him to death;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:2">27:2</A>&nbsp;and binding Him they led Him away and handed Him over to Pilate the Governor.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:3">27:3</A>&nbsp;Then when Judas,  who had betrayed Him, saw that He was condemned, smitten with remorse he brought back the thirty shekels to the High Priests and Elders</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:4">27:4</A>&nbsp;and said, "I have sinned, in betraying to death one who is innocent." "What does that matter to us?" they replied; it is your business."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:5">27:5</A>&nbsp;Flinging the shekels into the Sanctuary he left the place, and went and hanged himself.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:6">27:6</A>&nbsp;When the High Priests had gathered up the money they said, "It is illegal to put it into the Treasury, because it is the price of blood."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:7">27:7</A>&nbsp;So after consulting together they spent the money in the purchase of the Potter's Field as a burial place for people not belonging to the city;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:8">27:8</A>&nbsp;for which reason that piece of ground received the name, which it still bears, of `the Field of Blood.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:9">27:9</A>&nbsp;Then were fulfilled the words spoken by the Prophet Jeremiah, &lt;"And I took the thirty shekels, the price of the prized one on whom Israelites had set a price,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:10">27:10</A>&nbsp;and  gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord directed me."&gt;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:11">27:11</A>&nbsp;Meanwhile Jesus was brought before the Governor, and the latter put the question, "Are you the King of the Jews?"  "I am their King," He answered.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:12">27:12</A>&nbsp;When however the High Priests and the Elders kept bringing their charges against Him, He said not a word in reply.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:13">27:13</A>&nbsp;"Do you not hear," asked Pilate, "what a mass of  evidence they are bringing against you?"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:14">27:14</A>&nbsp;But He made no reply to a single accusation, so that the Governor was greatly astonished.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:15">27:15</A>&nbsp;"Now it was the Governor's custom at the Festival to release some one prisoner, whomsoever the populace desired;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:16">27:16</A>&nbsp;and at this time they had a notorious prisoner called  Barabbas.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:17">27:17</A>&nbsp;So when they were now assembled Pilate appealed to them. "Whom shall I release to you," he said,  "Barabbas, or Jesus the so-called Christ?"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:18">27:18</A>&nbsp;For he knew that it was from envious hatred that Jesus had been brought before him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:19">27:19</A>&nbsp;While he was sitting on the tribunal a message came to him from his wife. "Have nothing to do with that innocent man," she said, "for during the night I have suffered terribly in a dream through him."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:20">27:20</A>&nbsp;The High Priests, however, and the Elders  urged the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to demand the death of Jesus.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:21">27:21</A>&nbsp;So when the Governor  a second time asked them, "Which of the two shall I release to you?" --they cried, "Barabbas!"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:22">27:22</A>&nbsp;"What then," said Pilate, "shall I do with Jesus, the so-called Christ?" With one voice they shouted, "Let him be crucified!" </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:23">27:23</A>&nbsp;"Why, what crime has he committed?" asked Pilate. But they kept on furiously shouting, "Let him be crucified!"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:24">27:24</A>&nbsp;So when he saw that he could gain nothing, but that on the contrary there was a riot threatening, he called for water and washed his hands in sight of them all, saying, "I am  not responsible for this murder: you must answer for it."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:25">27:25</A>&nbsp;"His blood," replied all the people, "be on us and on our children!"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:26">27:26</A>&nbsp;Then he released Barabbas to them, but Jesus he ordered to be  scourged, and gave Him up to be crucified.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:27">27:27</A>&nbsp;Then the Governor's soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium, and called together the whole  battalion  to make sport of Him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:28">27:28</A>&nbsp;Stripping off His garments, they put on Him a general's short  crimson cloak.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:29">27:29</A>&nbsp;They twisted a wreath of thorny twigs and put it on His head, and they put a sceptre of cane in His right hand, and kneeling to Him they shouted in mockery,  "Long live the King of the Jews!"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:30">27:30</A>&nbsp;Then they spat upon Him, and taking the cane they repeatedly struck Him on the head with it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:31">27:31</A>&nbsp;At last, having finished their sport, they took off the cloak, clothed Him again in His own garments, and led Him away for crucifixion.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:32">27:32</A>&nbsp;Going out they met a Cyrenaean named Simon; whom they compelled to carry His cross,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:33">27:33</A>&nbsp;and so they came to a place called Golgotha, which means `Skull-ground.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:34">27:34</A>&nbsp;Here they gave Him a mixture of  wine and gall to drink, but having tasted it He refused to drink it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:35">27:35</A>&nbsp;After crucifying Him, they divided His garments among them by lot,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:36">27:36</A>&nbsp;and sat down there on guard.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:37">27:37</A>&nbsp;Over His head they placed a written statement of the charge against Him: THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:38">27:38</A>&nbsp;At the same time two robbers were crucified with Him, one at His right hand and the other at His left.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:39">27:39</A>&nbsp;And the passers-by reviled Him. They shook their heads at Him</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:40">27:40</A>&nbsp;and said, "You who would pull down the Sanctuary and build a new one within three days, save yourself. If you are God's Son, come down from the cross."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:41">27:41</A>&nbsp;In like manner the High Priests also, together with the Scribes and the Elders, taunted Him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:42">27:42</A>&nbsp;"He saved others," they said,  "himself he cannot save! He is the King of Israel! Let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe in him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:43">27:43</A>&nbsp;His trust is in God: let God deliver him now, if He will have him; for he said, `I am God's Son.'"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:44">27:44</A>&nbsp;Insults of the same kind were heaped on Him even by the  robbers who were being crucified with Him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:45">27:45</A>&nbsp;Now from noon until three o'clock in the afternoon there was darkness over the whole  land;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:46">27:46</A>&nbsp;but about three o'clock Jesus cried out in a loud voice, &lt;"Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?"&gt; that is to say, &lt;"My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken me?"&gt;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:47">27:47</A>&nbsp;"The man is calling for Elijah," said some of the bystanders.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:48">27:48</A>&nbsp;One of them ran forthwith, and filling a sponge with  sour wine put it on the end of a cane and offered it Him to drink;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:49">27:49</A>&nbsp;while the rest said, "Let us see whether Elijah is coming to deliver him."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:50">27:50</A>&nbsp;But Jesus uttered another loud cry and then yielded up His spirit.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:51">27:51</A>&nbsp;Immediately the curtain of the Sanctuary  was torn in two  from top to bottom: the earth quaked; the rocks split;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:52">27:52</A>&nbsp;the tombs opened; and many of God's people who were asleep in death  awoke.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:53">27:53</A>&nbsp;And coming out of their tombs after Christ's resurrection they entered the holy city and showed themselves to many.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:54">27:54</A>&nbsp;As for the Captain and the soldiers who were with Him keeping guard over Jesus, when they witnessed the earthquake and the other occurrences they were filled with terror, and exclaimed, "Assuredly he was God's Son."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:55">27:55</A>&nbsp;And there were a number of women there looking on from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee ministering to His necessities;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:56">27:56</A>&nbsp;among them being Mary of Magdala, Mary the mother of James and  Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zabdi.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:57">27:57</A>&nbsp;Towards sunset there came a wealthy inhabitant of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who himself also had become a disciple of Jesus.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:58">27:58</A>&nbsp;He went to Pilate and begged to have the body of Jesus, and Pilate ordered it to be given to him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:59">27:59</A>&nbsp;So Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean sheet of fine linen.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:60">27:60</A>&nbsp;He then laid it in his own  new tomb which he had hewn in the solid rock, and after rolling a great stone against the door of the tomb he went home.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:61">27:61</A>&nbsp;Mary of Magdala and the other Mary were both present there, sitting opposite to the sepulchre.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:62">27:62</A>&nbsp;On the next day, the day after the Preparation, the High Priests and the Pharisees came in a body to Pilate.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:63">27:63</A>&nbsp;"Sir," they said, "we recollect that during his lifetime that impostor pretended that after two days he was to rise to life again.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:64">27:64</A>&nbsp;So give orders for the sepulchre to be securely guarded till the third day, for fear his disciples should come by night and steal  the body, and then tell the people that he has come back to life; and so the last imposture will be more serious than the first."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:65">27:65</A>&nbsp;"You can have a guard," said Pilate: "go and make all safe, as best you can."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:66">27:66</A>&nbsp;So they went and made the sepulchre secure, sealing the stone besides setting the guard.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:1">28:1</A>&nbsp;After the Sabbath, in the early dawn of the first day of the week, Mary of Magdala and the other Mary came to see the sepulchre.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:2">28:2</A>&nbsp;But to their amazement there  had been a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord had descended from Heaven, and had come and rolled back the stone, and was sitting upon it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:3">28:3</A>&nbsp;His appearance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:4">28:4</A>&nbsp;For fear of him the guards trembled violently, and became like dead men.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:5">28:5</A>&nbsp;But the angel said to the women, "As for you,  dismiss your fears. I know that it is Jesus that you are looking for--the crucified One.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:6">28:6</A>&nbsp;He is not here: He has  come back to life, as He foretold. Come and see the place  where He lay.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:7">28:7</A>&nbsp;And go quickly and tell His disciples that He has risen from the dead and is going before you into Galilee: there you shall see Him. Remember, I have told you."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:8">28:8</A>&nbsp;They quickly left the tomb and ran, still terrified but full of unspeakable joy, to carry the news to His disciples.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:9">28:9</A>&nbsp;And then suddenly they saw Jesus coming to meet them. "Peace be to you," He said. And they came and clasped His feet,  bowing to the ground before Him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:10">28:10</A>&nbsp;Then He said, "Dismiss all fear! Go and take word to my brethren to go into Galilee, and there they shall see me."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:11">28:11</A>&nbsp;While they went on this errand, some of the guards came into the city and reported to the High Priests every detail of what had happened.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:12">28:12</A>&nbsp;So the latter held a conference with the Elders, and after consultation with them they heavily bribed the soldiers,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:13">28:13</A>&nbsp;telling them to say, "His disciples came during the night and stole  his body while we were asleep."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:14">28:14</A>&nbsp;"And if this," they added,  "is reported to the Governor, we will satisfy him and screen you from punishment."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:15">28:15</A>&nbsp;So they took the money and did as they were instructed; and this story was noised about among the Jews, and is current to this day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:16">28:16</A>&nbsp;As for the eleven disciples, they proceeded into Galilee, to the hill where Jesus had arranged to meet them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:17">28:17</A>&nbsp;There they saw Him and  prostrated themselves before Him. Yet some doubted.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:18">28:18</A>&nbsp;Jesus however came near and said to them, "All  power in Heaven and  over the earth has been given to me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:19">28:19</A>&nbsp;Go  therefore and make disciples of all the nations; baptize them  into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:20">28:20</A>&nbsp;and teach them to obey every command which I have given you. And remember, I am with you always, day by day, until the  Close of the  Age."</p>
