<p><A NAME="an_iii.vii-p1"></A>It<A NAME="an_iii.vii-p1.1"></A> is unnecessary to examine in detail the mistakes&#8212;in  ecclesiastical language, the heresies&#8212;into which men have been  led by a feeble, a deformed, or an arrogant mystical sense. The number  of these mistakes is countless; their wildness almost inconceivable to  those who have not been forced to study them. Too often the loud  voices and strange declarations of their apostles have drowned the  quieter accents of the orthodox.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vii-p2"></A>It seems as though the moment of puberty were far more  critical in the spiritual than it is in the physical life: the  ordinary dangers of adolescence being intensified when they appear  upon the higher levels of consciousness. In the condition of psychic  instability which is characteristic of his movement to new states, man  is unusually at the mercy of the suggestions and impressions which he  receives. Hence in every period of true mystical activity we find an  outbreak of occultism, illuminism, or other perverted spirituality  and&#8212;even more dangerous and confusing for the student&#8212;a  borderland region where the mystical and psychical meet. In the youth  of the Christian Church, side by side with genuine mysticism  descending from the Johannine writings or brought in by the Christian  Neoplatonists, we have the arrogant and disorderly transcendentalism  of the Gnostics: their attempted fusion of the ideals of mysticism and  magic. During the Middle Ages and the Renaissance there are the  spurious mysticism of the <a name="page_150"><font size="1" color="green">p. 150</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.vii-Page_150"></A> Brethren of  the Free Spirit, the occult propaganda of Paracelsus, the  Rosicrucians, the Christian Kabalists; and the innumerable  pantheistic, Manichean, mystery-making, and Quietist heresies which  made war upon Catholic tradition. In the modern world, Theosophy in  its various forms is probably the most widespread and respectable  representative of the occult tradition.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vii-p3"></A>The root idea from which these varied beliefs and  practices develop is always the same; and, since right doctrine is  often most easily defined by contrast with its opposite, its study is  likely to help us to fix more precisely the true characters of  mysticism. Leaving therefore the specifically mystical error of  Quietism until we come to the detailed discussion of the contemplative  states, we will consider here some of those other supernormal  activities of the self which we have already agreed to classify as  magic: and learn through them more of those hidden and  half-comprehended forces which she has at her command.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vii-p4"></A>The word &#8220;magic&#8221; is out of fashion, though  its spirit was never more widely diffused than at the present time.  Thanks to the gradual debasement of the verbal currency, it suggests  to the ordinary reader the production of optical illusions and other  parlour tricks. It has dragged with it in its fall the terrific verb  &#8220;to conjure,&#8221; which, forgetting that it once undertook to  compel the spirits of men and angels, is now content to produce  rabbits from top-hats. These facts would have little importance, were  it not that modern occultists&#8212;annoyed, one supposes, by this  abuse of their ancient title&#8212;constantly arrogate to their tenets  and practices the name of &#8220;Mystical Science.&#8221; Vaughan, in  his rather supercilious survey of the mystics, classed all forms of  white magic, alchemy, and occult philosophy as &#8220;theurgic  mysticism,&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_305"></A><A HREF="#fn_305"><FONT SIZE="1">306</FONT></A>
    and, on the other side of the shield, the occultists display an  increasing eagerness to claim the mystics as masters in their school.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_306"></A><A HREF="#fn_306"><FONT SIZE="1">307</FONT></A>
    Even the &#8220;three-fold way&#8221; of mysticism has been adopted  by them and relabelled &#8220;Probation, Enlightenment,  Initiation.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_307"></A><A HREF="#fn_307"><FONT SIZE="1">308</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vii-p8"></A>In our search for the characteristics of mysticism we  have already marked the boundary which separates it from magic: and  tried to define the true nature and intention of occult philosophy.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_308"></A><A HREF="#fn_308"><FONT SIZE="1">309</FONT></A>
    We saw that it represented the instinctive human &#8220;desire to  know more&#8221; applied to suprasensible things. For good or ill this  desire, and the occult sciences and magic arts which express it, have  haunted humanity from the earliest times. No student of man <a name="page_151"><font size="1" color="green">p. 151</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.vii-Page_151"></A> can neglect their investigation, however  distasteful to his intelligence their superficial absurdities may be.  The starting-point of all magic, and of all magical religion&#8212;the  best and purest of occult activities&#8212;is, as in mysticism,  man&#8217;s inextinguishable conviction that there are other planes of  being than those which his senses report to him; and its proceedings  represent the intellectual and individualistic results of this  conviction&#8212;his craving for the hidden knowledge. It is, in the  eyes of those who really practise it, a <i>moyen de parvenir</i>:  not the performance of illicit tricks, but a serious attempt to solve  the riddle of the world. Its result, according to a modern writer upon  occult philosophy, &#8220;comprises an actual, positive, and  realizable knowledge concerning the worlds which we denominate  invisible, because they transcend the imperfect and rudimentary  faculties of a partially developed humanity, and concerning the latent  potentialities which constitute&#8212;by the fact of their  latency&#8212;the interior man. In more strictly philosophical  language, the Hermetic science is a method of transcending the  phenomenal world and attaining to the reality which is behind  phenomena.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_309"></A><A HREF="#fn_309"><FONT SIZE="1">310</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vii-p11"></A>Though fragments of this enormous claim seem able to  justify themselves in experience, the whole of it cannot be admitted.  The last phrase in particular is identical with the promise which we  have seen to be characteristic of mysticism. It presents magic as a  pathway to reality; a promise which it cannot fulfil, for the mere  transcending of phenomena does not entail the attainment of the  Absolute. Magic even at its best extends rather than escapes the  boundaries of the phenomenal world. It stands, where genuine, for that  form of transcendentalism which does abnormal things, but does not  lead anywhere: and we are likely to fall victims to some kind of magic  the moment that the declaration &#8220;I want to know&#8221; ousts the  declaration &#8220;I want to be&#8221; from the chief place in our  consciousness. The true &#8220;science of ultimates&#8221; must be a  science of pure Being, for reasons which the reader is now in a  position to discover for himself. But magic is merely a system whereby  the self tries to assuage its transcendental curiosity by extending  the activities of the will beyond their usual limits; sometimes,  according to its own account, obtaining by this means an experimental  knowledge of planes of existence usually&#8212;but  inaccurately&#8212;regarded as &#8220;supernatural.&#8221;</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vii-p12"></A>Even this modified claim needs justification. For most  persons who do not specialize in the eccentric sciences the occultist  can only be said to exist in either the commercial or the academic  sense. The fortune-teller represents one class; the annotator of  improper <i>grimoires</i> the other. In neither department is the thing  supposed <a name="page_152"><font size="1" color="green">p. 152</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.vii-Page_152"></A> to be taken seriously: it is  merely the means of obtaining money, or of assuaging a rather morbid  curiosity.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vii-p13"></A>Such a view is far from accurate. In magic, whether  regarded as a superstition or a science, we have at any rate the  survival of a great and ancient tradition, the true meaning of whose  title should hardly have been lost in a Christian country; for it  claims to be the science of those Magi whose quest of the symbolic  Blazing Star brought them once, at least, to the cradle of the  Incarnate God. Its laws, and the ceremonial rites which express those  laws, have come down from immemorial antiquity. They appear to  enshrine a certain definite knowledge, and a large number of less  definite theories, concerning the sensual and supersensual worlds, and  concerning powers which man, according to occult thinkers, may develop  if he will. Orthodox persons should be careful how they condemn the  laws of magic: for they unwittingly conform to many of them whenever  they go to church. All ceremonial religion contains some elements of  magic. The art of medicine will never wholly cast it off: many  centuries ago it gave birth to that which we now call modern science.  It seems to possess inextinguishable life. This is not surprising when  we perceive how firmly occultism is rooted in psychology: how  perfectly it is adapted to certain perennial characteristics of the  human mind&#8212;its curiosity, its arrogance, its love of  mystery.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vii-p14"></A>Magic, in its uncorrupted form, claims to be a  practical, intellectual, highly individualistic science; working  towards the declared end of enlarging the sphere on which the human  will can work, and obtaining experimental knowledge of planes of being  usually regarded as transcendental. It is the last descendant of a  long line of teaching&#8212;the whole teaching, in fact, of the  mysteries of Egypt and Greece&#8212;which offered to initiate man into  a certain secret knowledge and understanding of things. &#8220;In  every man,&#8221; says a modern occultist, &#8220;there are latent  faculties by means of which he can acquire for himself knowledge of  the higher worlds . . . as long as the human race has existed there  have always been schools in which those who possessed these higher  faculties gave instruction to those who were in search of them. Such  are called the occult schools, and the instruction which is imparted  therein is called esoteric science or the occult teaching.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_310"></A><A HREF="#fn_310"><FONT SIZE="1">311</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vii-p16"></A>These occult schools, as they exist in the present  day, state their doctrine in terms which seem distressingly prosaic to  the romantic inquirer; borrowing from physics and psychology theories  of vibration, attraction, mental suggestion and subconscious activity  which can be reapplied for their own purposes. According to its modern  teachers, magic is simply an extension of the theory <a name="page_153"><font size="1" color="green">p. 153</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.vii-Page_153"></A> and practice of volition beyond the usual  limits. The will, says the occultist, is king, not only of the House  of Life, but of the universe outside the gates of sense. It is the key  to &#8220;man limitless&#8221; the true &#8220;ring of Gyges,&#8221;  which can control the forces of nature known and unknown. This aspect  of occult philosophy informs much of the cheap American  transcendentalism which is so lightly miscalled mystical by its  teachers and converts; Menticulture, &#8220;New&#8221; or  &#8220;Higher Thought,&#8221; and the scriptures of the so-called  &#8220;New Consciousness.&#8221; The ingenious authors of  &#8220;Volo,&#8221; &#8220;The Will to be Well,&#8221; and &#8220;Just  How to Wake the Solar Plexus,&#8221; the seers who assure their eager  disciples that by &#8220;Concentration&#8221; they may acquire not  only health, but also that wealth which is &#8220;health of  circumstance,&#8221; are no mystics. They are magicians; and teach,  though they know it not, little else but the cardinal doctrines of  Hermetic science, omitting only their picturesque ceremonial  accompaniments.   &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_311"></A><A HREF="#fn_311"><FONT SIZE="1">312</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vii-p18"></A>These cardinal doctrines, in fact, have varied little  since their first appearance early in the world&#8217;s history:  though, like the doctrines of theology, they have needed re-statement  from time to time. In discussing them I shall quote chiefly from the  works of Eliphas L&eacute;vi; the pseudonym under which Alphonse Louis  Constant, the most readable occult philosopher of the nineteenth  century, offered his conclusions to the world.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vii-p19"></A>The tradition of magic, like most other ways of escape  which man has offered to his own soul, appears to have originated in  the East. It was formulated, developed, and preserved by the religion  of Egypt. It made an early appearance in that of Greece. It has its  legendary grand master in Hermes Trismegistus, who gave to it its  official name of Hermetic Science, and whose status in occultism is  much the same as that occupied by Moses in the tradition of the Jews.  Fragmentary writings attributed to this personage and said to be  derived from the Hermetic books, are the primitive scriptures of  occultism: and the probably spurious Table of Emerald, which is said  to have been discovered in his tomb, ranks as the magician&#8217;s  Table of Stone.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_312"></A><A HREF="#fn_312"><FONT SIZE="1">313</FONT></A>
    In Gnosticism, in the allegories of the Kabalah, in theosophy, in  secret associations which still exist in England, France, and  Germany&#8212;and even in certain practices embedded in the ceremonial  of the Christian Church&#8212;<a name="page_154"><font size="1" color="green">p. 154</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.vii-Page_154"></A> the main  conceptions which constitute the &#8220;secret wisdom&#8221; of  magical tradition have wandered down the centuries. The baser  off-shoots of that tradition are but too well known, and need not be  particularized.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_313"></A><A HREF="#fn_313"><FONT SIZE="1">314</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vii-p22"></A>Like the world which it professes to interpret, magic  has a body and a soul: an outward vesture of words and ceremonies and  an inner doctrine. The outward vesture, which is all that the  uninitiated are permitted to perceive, consists of a series of  confusing and often ridiculous symbolic veils: of strange words and  numbers, grotesque laws and ritual acts, personifications and  mystifications. The outward vestures of our religious, political, and  social systems&#8212;which would probably appear equally irrational to  a wholly ignorant yet critical observer&#8212;offer an instructive  parallel to this aspect of occult philosophy. Stripped of these  archaic formulae, symbols, and mystery-mongerings, however, magic as  described by its apologists, is found to rest upon three fundamental  axioms which can hardly be dismissed as ridiculous by those who listen  respectfully to the ever-shifting hypotheses of psychology and  physics.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vii-p23"></A>(1) The first axiom declares the existence of an  imponderable &#8220;medium&#8221; or &#8220;universal agent,&#8221;  which is described as beyond the plane of our normal sensual  perceptions yet interpenetrating and binding up the material world.  This agent, which is not luminous and has nothing to do with the  stars, is known to the occultists by the unfortunate name of  &#8220;Astral Light&#8221;: a term originally borrowed from the  Martinists by Eliphas L&eacute;vi. To live in conscious communication  with the &#8220;Astral Light&#8221; is to live upon the &#8220;Astral  Plane,&#8221; or in the Astral World: to have achieved, that is to  say, a new level of consciousness. The education of the occultist is  directed towards this end.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vii-p24"></A>This doctrine of the Astral Plane, like most of our  other diagrams of the transcendent, possesses a respectable ancestry,  and many prosperous relations in the world of philosophic thought.  Traces of it may even be detected under veils in the speculations of  orthodox physics. It is really identical with the &#8220;Archetypal  World&#8221; or  <i>Yesod</i> of the Kabalah&#8212;the &#8220;Perfect Land&#8221;  of old Egyptian religion&#8212;in which the true or spirit forms of  all created things are held to exist. It may be connected with the  &#8220;real world&#8221; described by such visionaries as Boehme and  Blake, many of whose <a name="page_155"><font size="1" color="green">p. 155</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.vii-Page_155"></A> experiences are  far more occult than mystical in character.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_314"></A><A HREF="#fn_314"><FONT SIZE="1">315</FONT></A>
    A persistent tradition as to the existence of such a plane of being  or of consciousness is found all over the world: in Indian, Greek  Egyptian, Celtic, and Jewish thought. &#8220;Above this visible nature  there exists another, unseen and eternal, which, when all things  created perish, does not perish,&#8221; says the Bhagavad Gita.  According to the Kabalists it is &#8220;the seat of life and vitality,  and the nourishment of all the world.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_315"></A><A HREF="#fn_315"><FONT SIZE="1">316</FONT></A>
    Vitalism might accept it as one of those aspects of the universe  which can be perceived by a more extended rhythm than that of normal  consciousness. Various aspects of the Astral have been identified with  the &#8220;Burning Body of the Holy Ghost&#8221; of Christian  Gnosticism and with the Odic force of the old-fashioned  spiritualists.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vii-p27"></A>Further, the Astral Plane is regarded as constituting  the &#8220;Cosmic Memory,&#8221; where the images of all beings and  events are preserved, as they are preserved in the memory of man.</p>   <blockquote><A NAME="an_iii.vii-p27.1"></A> &#8220;The high that proved too high, the heroic for  earth too hard<br>   The passion that left the ground to lose itself in  the sky&#8221;&#8212;<br>  </blockquote>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vii-p28"></A>all are living in the Astral World. There too  the concepts of future creation are present in their completeness in  the Eternal Now before being brought to birth in the material sphere.  On this theory prophecy, and also clairvoyance&#8212;one of the great  objects of occult education&#8212;consist in opening the eyes of the  mind upon this timeless Astral World: and spiritualists, evoking the  phantoms of the dead, merely call them up from the recesses of  universal instead of individual remembrance. The reader who feels his  brain to be whirling amidst this medley of solemn statement and  unproven fairy tale must remember that the dogmatic part of the occult  tradition can only represent the attempt of an extended or otherwise  abnormal consciousness to find an explanation of its own  experiences.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vii-p29"></A>Further, our whole selves&#8212;not merely our  sentient selves&#8212;are regarded as being bathed in the Astral  Light, as in the ether of physics. Hence in occult language it is a  &#8220;universal agent&#8221; connecting soul with soul, and becomes  the possible vehicle of hypnotism, telepathy, clairvoyance, and all  those supernormal phenomena which are the subject-matter of  &#8220;psychical research.&#8221; This hypothesis also accounts for  the confusing fact of an initial similarity of experience in many of  the proceedings of mystic and occultist. Both must pass through the  plane of consciousness which the concept of the &#8220;Astral&#8221;  represents, because this plane <a name="page_156"><font size="1" color="green">p. 156</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.vii-Page_156"></A> of  perception is the one which lies &#8220;next beyond&#8221; our normal  life. The transcendental faculties may become aware of this world;  only, in the case of the mystic, to pass through it as quickly as they  can. But the occultist, the medium, the psychic, rest in the  &#8220;Astral&#8221; and develop their perceptions of this aspect of  the world. It is the medium in which they work.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vii-p30"></A>From earliest times, occult philosophy has insisted on  the existence of this medium: as a scientific fact, outside the range  of our normal senses, but susceptible of verification by the trained  powers of the &#8220;initiate.&#8221; The possessor of such trained  powers, not the wizard or the fortune-teller, is regarded as the true  magician: and it is the declared object of occult education, or  initiation, to actualize this supersensual plane of experience, to  give the student the power of entering into conscious communion with  it, and teach him to impose upon its forces the directive force of his  own will, as easily as he imposes that will upon the  &#8220;material&#8221; things of senses.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_316"></A><A HREF="#fn_316"><FONT SIZE="1">317</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vii-p32"></A>(2) This brings us to the second axiom of magic, which  also has a curiously modern air: for it postulates simply the  limitless power of the disciplined human will. This dogma has been  &#8220;taken over&#8221; without acknowledgment from occult philosophy  to become the trump card of menticulture, &#8220;Christian  Science,&#8221; and &#8220;New Thought.&#8221; The preachers of  &#8220;Joy Philosophy&#8221; and other dilute forms of mental  discipline, the Liberal Catholic &#8220;priest&#8221; producing  &#8220;a vast bubble of etheric astromental matter, a thought-edifice,  ethereal, diaphanous, a bubble which just includes the  congregation&#8212;&#8220;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_317"></A><A HREF="#fn_317"><FONT SIZE="1">318</FONT></A>
    these are the true hierophants of magic in the modern world.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_318"></A><A HREF="#fn_318"><FONT SIZE="1">319</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vii-p35"></A>The first lesson of the would-be magus is  self-mastery. &#8220;By means of persevering and gradual  athletics,&#8221; says Eliphas L&eacute;vi, &#8220;the powers of the  body can be developed to an amazing extent. It is the same with the  powers of the soul. Would you govern yourself and others? Learn how to  will. How may one learn how to will? This is the first secret of  magical initiation; and it was to make the foundations of this secret  thoroughly understood that the antique keepers of the mysteries  surrounded the approach to the sanctuary with so many terrors and  illusions. They did not believe in a will until it had given its  proofs; and they were right. <a name="page_157"><font size="1" color="green">p. 157</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.vii-Page_157"></A> Strength  cannot prove itself except by conquest. Idleness and negligence are  the enemies of the will, and this is the reason why all religions have  multiplied their practices and made their cults difficult and minute.  The more trouble one gives oneself for an idea, the more power one  acquires in regard to that idea. . . . Hence the power of religions  resides entirely in the inflexible will of those who practise  them.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_319"></A><A HREF="#fn_319"><FONT SIZE="1">320</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vii-p37"></A>This last sentence alone is enough to define the  distinction between mysticism and magic, and clear the minds of those  who tend to confuse the mystical and magical elements of religion. In  accordance with it, real &#8220;magical initiation&#8221; is in  essence a form of mental discipline, strengthening and focussing the  will. This discipline, like that of the religious life, consists  partly in physical austerities and a deliberate divorce from the  world, partly in the cultivation of will-power: but largely in a  yielding of the mind to the influence of suggestions which have been  selected and accumulated in the course of ages because of their power  over that imagination which Eliphas L&eacute;vi calls &#8220;The eye of  the soul.&#8221; There is nothing supernatural about it. Like the more  arduous, more disinterested self-training of the mystic, it is  character-building with an object, conducted upon an heroic scale. In  magic the &#8220;will to know&#8221; is the centre round which the  personality is rearranged. As in mysticism, unconscious factors are  dragged from the hiddenness to form part of that personality. The  uprushes of thought, the abrupt intuitions which reach us from the  subliminal region, are developed, ordered, and controlled by rhythms  and symbols which have become traditional because the experience of  centuries has proved, though it cannot explain, their efficacy: and  powers of apprehension which normally lie below the threshold may thus  be liberated and enabled to report their discoveries.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vii-p38"></A>&#8220;The fundamental principle,&#8221; says A. E.  Waite, speaking of occult evocations, &#8220;was in the exercise of a  certain occult force resident in the magus, and strenuously exerted  for the establishment of such a correspondence between two planes of  nature as would effect his desired end. This exertion was termed the  evocation, conjuration, or calling of the spirit, but   <i>that which in reality was raised was the energy of the inner  man</i>   ; tremendously developed and exalted by combined will and aspiration,  this energy germinated by sheer force a new intellectual faculty of  sensible psychological perception. To assist and stimulate this energy  into the most powerful possible operation, artificial means were  almost invariably used. . . . The synthesis of these methods and  processes <a name="page_158"><font size="1" color="green">p. 158</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.vii-Page_158"></A> was called Ceremonial Magic,  which in effect was a tremendous forcing-house of the latent faculties  of man&#8217;s spiritual nature.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_320"></A><A HREF="#fn_320"><FONT SIZE="1">321</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vii-p40"></A>This is the psychological explanation of those  apparently absurd rituals of preparation, doctrines of signs and  numbers, pentacles, charms, angelical names, the &#8220;power of the  word&#8221; which made up ceremonial magic. The power of such  artifices is known amongst the Indian mystics; who, recognizing in the    <i>Mantra,</i>    or occult and rhythmic formula, consciously held and repeated, an  invaluable help to the attainment of the true ecstatic state, are not  ashamed to borrow from the magicians. So, too, the modern American  schools of mental healing and New Thought recommend concentration upon  a carefully selected word as the starting-point of efficacious  meditation. This fact of the psychical effect of certain verbal  combinations, when allowed to dominate the field of consciousness, may  have some bearing upon that need of a formal liturgy which is felt by  nearly every great religion; for religion, on its ceremonial side, has  certain affinities with magic. It, too, seeks by sensible means to  stimulate supra-sensible energies. The true magic &#8220;word&#8221;  or spell is untranslatable; because its power resides only partially  in that outward sense which is apprehended by the reason, but chiefly  in the rhythm, which is addressed to the subliminal mind. Symbols,  religious and other, and symbolic acts which appear meaningless when  judged by the intellect alone, perform a similar office. They express  the deep-seated instinct of the human mind that it must have a focus  on which to concentrate its volitional powers, if those powers are to  be brought to their highest state of efficiency. The nature of the  focus matters little: its office matters much.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vii-p41"></A>&#8220;. . . All these figures, and acts analogous to  them,&#8221; says L&eacute;vi, &#8220;all these dispositions of numbers  and of characters [  <i>i.e.</i>    sacred words, charms, pentacles, etc.] are, as we have said, but  instruments for the education of the will, of which they fix and  determine the habits. They serve also to concentrate in action all the  powers of the human soul, and to strengthen the creative power of the  imagination. . . . A practice, even though it be superstitious and  foolish, may be efficacious because it is a realization of the will. .  . . We laugh at the poor woman who denies herself a ha&#8217;porth of  milk in the morning, that she may take a little candle to burn upon  the magic triangle in some chapel. But those who laugh are ignorant,  and the poor woman does not pay too dearly for the courage and  resignation which she thus obtains.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_321"></A><A HREF="#fn_321"><FONT SIZE="1">322</FONT></A>

<p><A NAME="an_iii.vii-p43"></A>Magic symbols, therefore, from penny candles to  Solomon&#8217;s seal, fall in modern technical language into two  classes. The first contains instruments of self-suggestion,  exaltation, and will direction. To this belong all spells, charms,  rituals, perfumes: from the magician&#8217;s vervain wreath to the  &#8220;Youth! Health! Strength!&#8221; which the student of New  Thought repeats when she is brushing her hair in the morning. The  second class contains   <i>autoscopes: i.e.</i>   , material objects which focus and express the subconscious  perceptions of the operator. The dowser&#8217;s divining rod,  fortuneteller&#8217;s cards, and crystal-gazer&#8217;s ball, are  characteristic examples. Both kinds are rendered necessary rather by  the disabilities of the human than by the peculiarities of the  superhuman plane: and the great adept may attain heights at which he  dispenses with these &#8220;outward and visible signs.&#8221;  &#8220;Ceremonies being, as we have said, artificial methods of  creating certain habits of the will, they cease to be necessary when  these habits have become fixed.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_322"></A><A HREF="#fn_322"><FONT SIZE="1">323</FONT></A>
    These facts, now commonplaces of psychology, have long been known and  used by students of magic. Those who judge the philosophy by the  apparent absurdity of its symbols and ceremonies should remember that  the embraces, gestures, grimaces, and other ritual acts by which we  all concentrate, liberate, or express love, wrath, or enthusiasm, will  ill endure the cold revealing light of a strictly rational  inquiry.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vii-p45"></A>(3) The dogmas of the &#8220;Astral Light&#8221; or  universal agent and the &#8220;power of the will&#8221; are completed  by a third: the doctrine of Analogy, of an implicit correspondence  between appearance and reality, the microcosm of man and the macrocosm  of the universe the seen and the unseen worlds. In this, occultism  finds the basis of its transcendental speculations. <A NAME="an_iii.vii-p45.1"></A>   <i>Quod superius sicut quod inferius</i>    &#8212;the first words of that Emerald Table which  was once attributed to Hermes Trismegistus himself&#8212;is an axiom  which must be agreeable to all Platonists. It plays a great part in  the theory of mysticism; which, whilst maintaining an awed sense of  the total &#8220;otherness&#8221; and incomprehensibility of the  Divine, has always assumed that the path of the individual soul  towards loving union with the Absolute is somehow analogous with the  path on which the universe moves to its consummation in God.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vii-p46"></A>The notion of analogy ultimately determines the  religious concepts of every race, and resembles the verities of faith  in the breadth of its application. It embraces alike the appearances  of the visible world&#8212;which thus become the mirrors of the  invisible&#8212;the symbols of religion, the tiresome arguments of  Butler&#8217;s &#8220;Analogy,&#8221; the allegories of the Kabalah  and the spiritual alchemists, and that childish &#8220;doctrine of  signatures&#8221; on which <a name="page_160"><font size="1" color="green">p. 160</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.vii-Page_160"></A> much of  mediaeval science was built. &#8220;Analogy,&#8221; says L&eacute;vi,  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_323"></A><A HREF="#fn_323"><FONT SIZE="1">324</FONT></A>
    &#8220;is the last word of science and the first word of faith . . .  the   <i>sole possible mediator</i>    between the visible and the invisible, between the finite and the  infinite.&#8221; Here Magic clearly defines her own limitations;  stepping incautiously from the useful to the universal, and laying  down a doctrine which no mystic could accept&#8212;which, carried to  its logical conclusion, would turn the adventure of the infinite into  a guessing game.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vii-p48"></A>The argument by analogy is carried by the occultists  to lengths which cannot be described here. Armed with this torch, they  explore the darkest, most terrible mysteries of life: and do not  hesitate to cast the grotesque shadows of these mysteries upon the  unseen world. The principle of correspondence is no doubt sound so  long as it works within reasonable limits. It was admitted into the  system of the Kabalah, though that profound and astute philosophy was  far from giving to it the importance which it assumes in Hermetic  &#8220;science.&#8221; It has been eagerly accepted by many of the  mystics. Boehme and Swedenborg availed themselves of its method in  presenting their intuitions to the world. It is implicitly  acknowledged by thinkers of many other schools: its influence  permeates the best periods of literature. Sir Thomas Browne spoke for  more than himself when he said, in a well-known passage of the  &#8220;Religio Medici&#8221;: &#8220;The severe schools shall never  laugh me out of the philosophy of Hermes [  <i>i.e.</i>   , Trismegistus] that this visible world is but a picture of the  invisible, wherein, as in a portrait, things are not truly but in  equivocal shapes, and as they counterfeit some real substance in that  invisible framework.&#8221; Such a sense of analogy, whatever the  &#8220;severe schools&#8221; may say, is indeed the foundation of  every perfect work of art. &#8220;Intuitive perception of the hidden  analogies of things,&#8221; says Hazlitt in &#8220;English  Novelists,&#8221; &#8220;or, as it may be called, his   <i>instinct of the imagination,</i>    is perhaps what stamps the character of genius on the productions of  art more than any other circumstance.&#8221;</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vii-p49"></A>The central doctrine of magic may now be summed up  thus:&#8212;</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vii-p50"></A>(1) That a supersensible and real &#8220;cosmic  medium&#8221; exists, which interpenetrates, influences, and supports  the tangible and apparent world, and is amenable to the categories  both of philosophy and of physics.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vii-p51"></A>(2) That there is an established analogy and  equilibrium between the real and unseen world, and the illusory  manifestations which we call the world of sense.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vii-p52"></A>(3) That this analogy may be discerned, and this  equilibrium controlled, by the disciplined will of man, which thus  becomes master of itself and of fate. <a name="page_161"><font size="1" color="green">p. 161</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.vii-Page_161"></A></p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vii-p53"></A>We must now examine in more detail the third of these  propositions&#8212;that which ascribes abnormal powers to the educated  and disciplined will&#8212;for this assumption lies at the root of all  magical practices, old and new. &#8220;Magical operations,&#8221; says  Eliphas L&eacute;vi, &#8220;are the exercise of a power which is  natural, but superior to the ordinary powers of nature. They are the  result of a science, and of habits, which exalt the human will above  its usual limits.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_324"></A><A HREF="#fn_324"><FONT SIZE="1">325</FONT></A>
    This power of the will is now recognized as playing an important part  both in the healing of the body and the healing of the soul; for our  most advanced theories on these subjects are little more than the old  wine of magic in new bottles. The ancient occultists owed much of  their power, and also of their evil reputation, to the fact that they  were psychologists before their time. Effective methods of suggestion,  recipes for the alteration and exaltation of personality and  enhancement of will-power, the artificial production of hypnotic  states, photisms, automatism and ecstasy, with the opening up of the  subliminal field which accompanies these phenomena&#8212;concealed  from the profane by a mass of confusing allegories and  verbiage&#8212;form the backbone of all genuine occult rituals. Their  authors were aware that ceremonial magic has no objective importance,  but depends solely on its effect upon the operator&#8217;s mind. That  this effect might be enhanced, it was given an atmosphere of sanctity  and mystery; its rules were strict, its higher rites difficult of  attainment. These rules and rites constituted at once a test of the  student&#8217;s earnestness and a veil guarding the sanctuary from the  profane. The long and difficult preparations, majestic phrases, and  strange ceremonies of an evocation had power, not over the spirit of  the dead, but over the consciousness of the living; who was thus  caught up from the world of sense to a new plane of perception. Thus,  according to its apologists, the education of the genuine occult  student tends to awaken in him a new view and a new attitude. It  adjusts the machinery of his cinematograph to the registering of new  intervals in the stream of things, which passed it by before; and thus  introduces new elements into that picture by which ordinary men are  content to know and judge the&#8212;or rather   <i>their&#8212;</i>   universe.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vii-p55"></A>So much for the principles which govern occult  education. Magic therapeutics, or as it is now called, &#8220;mental  healing,&#8221; is but the application of these principles upon  another plane. It results, first, from a view of humanity which sees a  difference only of degree between diseases of body and of soul, and  can state seriously and in good faith that &#8220;moral maladies are  more contagious than physical, and there are some triumphs of  infatuation and fashion which are comparable to leprosy or  cholera.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_325"></A><A HREF="#fn_325"><FONT SIZE="1">326</FONT></A>
    Secondly, it is <a name="page_162"><font size="1" color="green">p. 162</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.vii-Page_162"></A> worked by that  enhancement of will power, that ability to alter and control weaker  forms of life, which is claimed as the reward of the occult  discipline. &#8220;All the power of the occult healer lies in his  conscious will and all his art consists in producing faith in the  patient.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_326"></A><A HREF="#fn_326"><FONT SIZE="1">327</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vii-p58"></A>This simple truth was in the possession of occult  thinkers at a time when Church and State saw no third course between  the burning or beatification of its practitioners. Now, under the  polite names of mental hygiene, suggestion, and psycho-therapeutics,  it is steadily advancing to the front rank of medical shibboleths. Yet  it is still the same &#8220;magic art&#8221; which has been employed  for centuries, with varying ritual accompaniments, by the adepts of  occult science. The methods of Brother Hilarian Tissot, who is  described as curing lunacy and crime by &#8220;the unconscious use of  the magnetism of Paracelsus,&#8221; who attributed his cases  &#8220;either to disorder of the will or to the perverse influence of  external wills,&#8221; and would &#8220;regard all crimes as acts of  madness and treat the wicked as diseased,&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_327"></A><A HREF="#fn_327"><FONT SIZE="1">328</FONT></A>
    anticipated in many respects those of the most modern  psychologists.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vii-p60"></A>The doctrine of magic which has here been described  shows us the &#8220;Secret Wisdom&#8221; at its best and sanest. But  even on these levels, it is dogged by the defects which so decisively  separate the occultist from the mystic. The chief of these is the  peculiar temper of mind, the cold intellectual arrogance, the  intensely individual point of view which occult studies seem to induce  by their conscious quest of exclusive power and knowledge, their  implicit neglect of love. At bottom, every student of occultism is  striving towards a point at which he may be able to &#8220;touch the  button&#8221; and rely on the transcendental world &#8220;springing to  do the rest.&#8221; In this hard-earned acquirement of power over the  Many, he tends to forget the One. In Levi&#8217;s words, &#8220;Too  deep a study of the mysteries of nature may estrange from God the  careless investigator, in whom mental fatigue paralyses the ardours of  the heart.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_328"></A><A HREF="#fn_328"><FONT SIZE="1">329</FONT></A>
    When he wrote this sentence L&eacute;vi stood, as the greater  occultists have often done, at the frontiers of mysticism. The best of  the Hermetic philosophers, indeed, are hardly ever without such  mystical hankerings, such flashes of illumination; as if the  transcendental powers of man, once roused from sleep, cannot wholly  ignore the true end for which they were made.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vii-p62"></A>In Levi&#8217;s case, as is well known, the discord  between the occult and mystical ideals was resolved by his return to  the Catholic Church. Characteristically, he &#8220;read into&#8221;  Catholicism much <a name="page_163"><font size="1" color="green">p. 163</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.vii-Page_163"></A> that the orthodox  would hardly allow; so that it became for him, as it were, a romantic  gloss on the occult tradition. He held that the Christian Church,  nursing mother of the mystics, was also the heir of the magi; and that  popular piety and popular magic veiled the same ineffable truths. He  had more justification than at first appears probable for this  apparently wild and certainly heretical statement. Religion, as we  have seen, can never entirely divorce herself from magic: for her  rituals and sacraments must have, if they are to be successful in  their appeal to the mind, a certain magical character. All persons who  are naturally drawn towards the ceremonial aspect of religion are  acknowledging the strange power of subtle rhythms, symbolic words and  movements, over the human will. An &#8220;impressive service&#8221;  conforms exactly to the description which I have already quoted of a  magical rite: it is &#8220;a tremendous forcing-house of the latent  faculties of man&#8217;s spiritual nature.&#8221; Sacraments, too,  however simple their beginnings, always tend, as they evolve, to  assume upon the phenomenal plane a magical aspect&#8212;a fact which  does not invalidate their claim to be the vehicles of supernatural  grace. Those who have observed with understanding, for instance, the  Roman rite of baptism, with its spells and exorcisms, its truly  Hermetic employment of salt, anointing chrism and ceremonial lights,  must have seen in it a ceremony far nearer to the operations of white  magic than to the simple lustrations practiced by St. John the  Baptist.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vii-p63"></A>There are obvious objections to the full working out  of this subject in a book which is addressed to readers of all shades  of belief; but any student who is interested in this branch of  religious psychology may easily discover for himself the occult  elements in the liturgies of the Christian&#8212;or indeed of any  other&#8212;Church. There are invocative arrangements of the Names of  God which appear alike in   <i>grimoire</i>    and in Missal. Sacred numbers, ritual actions, perfumes,  purifications, words of power, are all used, and rightly used by  institutional religion in her work of opening up the human mind to the  messages of the suprasensible world. In certain minor observances, and  charm-like prayers, we seem to stand on the very borderland between  magician and priest.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vii-p64"></A>It is surely inevitable that this should be so. The  business of the Church is to appeal to the whole man, as she finds him  living in the world of sense. She would hardly be adequate to this  task did she neglect the powerful weapons which the occultist has  developed for his own ends. She, who takes the simplest and most  common gifts of nature and transmutes them into heavenly food, takes  also every discovery which the self has made concerning its own  potentialities, and turns them to her own high purposes. Founding her  external system on sacraments and symbols, on <a name="page_164"><font size="1" color="green">p. 164</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.vii-Page_164"></A> rhythmic invocations and ceremonial acts of  praise, insisting on the power of the pure and self-denying will and  the &#8220;magic chain&#8221; of congregational worship, she does but  join hands with those Magi whose gold, frankincense, and myrrh were  the first gifts that she received.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vii-p65"></A>But she pays for this; sharing some of the limitations  of the system which her Catholic nature has compelled her to absorb.  It is true, of course, that she purges it of all its baser  elements&#8212;its arrogance, its curiosity&#8212;true also that she  is bound to adopt it, because it is the highest common measure which  she can apply to the spirituality of that world to which she is sent.  But she cannot&#8212;and her great teachers have always known that she  cannot&#8212;extract finality from a method which does not really seek  after ultimate things. This method may and does teach men goodness,  gives them happiness and health. It can even induce in them a certain  exaltation in which they become aware, at any rate for a moment, of  the existence of the supernatural world&#8212;a stupendous  accomplishment. But it will not of itself make them citizens of that  world: give to them the freedom of Reality.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vii-p66"></A>&#8220;The work of the Church in the world,&#8221;  says Patmore, &#8220;is not to teach the mysteries of life, so much as  to persuade the soul to that arduous degree of purity at which God  Himself becomes her teacher. The work of the Church ends when the  knowledge of God begins.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_329"></A><A HREF="#fn_329"><FONT SIZE="1">330</FONT></A>
