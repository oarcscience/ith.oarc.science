<p><A NAME="an_i_1-p1"></A>  <A NAME="an_i_1-p1.1"></A>Since this book first appeared, nineteen years ago, the study of  mysticism&#8212;not only in England, but also in France, Germany and  Italy&#8212;has been almost completely transformed. From being  regarded, whether critically or favourably, as a byway of religion, it  is now more and more generally accepted by theologians, philosophers  and psychologists, as representing in its intensive form the essential  religious experience of man. The labours of a generation of religious  psychologists&#8212;following, and to some extent superseding the  pioneer work of William James&#8212;have already done much to  disentangle its substance from the psycho-physical accidents which  often accompany mystical apprehension. Whilst we are less eager than  our predecessors to dismiss all accounts of abnormal experience as the  fruit of superstition or disease, no responsible student now  identifies the mystic and the ecstatic; or looks upon visionary and  other &#8220;extraordinary phenomena&#8221; as either guaranteeing or  discrediting the witness of the mystical saints. Even the remorseless  explorations and destructive criticisms of the psycho-analytic school  are now seen to have effected a useful work; throwing into relief the  genuine spiritual activities of the psyche, while explaining in a  naturalistic sense some of their less fortunate psycho-physical  accompaniments. The philosophic and theological landscape also, with  its increasing emphasis on Transcendence, its new friendliness to the  concept of the Supernatural, is becoming ever more favourable to the  metaphysical claims of the mystics. On one hand the prompt welcome  given to the work of Rudolf Otto and Karl Barth, on the other the  renewed interest in Thomist philosophy, seem to indicate a growing  recognition of the distinctness and independence of the Spiritual  Order. and a revival <a name="page_xiv"><font size="1" color="green">p. xiv</font></A> <A NAME="an_i_1-Page_xiv"></A> of the creaturely  sense, strongly contrasting with the temper of late nineteenth-century  thought.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_i_1-p2"></A>Were I, then, now planning this book for the first  time, its arguments would be differently stated. More emphasis would  be given (a) to the concrete, richly living yet unchanging character  of the Reality over against the mystic, as the first term, cause and  incentive of his experience; (b) to that paradox of utter contrast yet  profound relation between the Creator and the creature, God and the  soul, which makes possible his development; (c) to the predominant  part played in that development by the free and prevenient action of  the Supernatural&#8212;in theological language, by  &#8220;grace&#8221;&#8212;as against all merely evolutionary or  emergent theories of spiritual transcendence. I feel more and more  that no psychological or evolutionary treatment of man&#8217;s  spiritual history can be adequate which ignores the element of  &#8220;given-ness&#8221; in all genuine mystical knowledge. Though the  mystic Life means organic growth, its first term must be sought in  ontology; in the Vision of the Principle, as St. Gregory the Great  taught long ago. For the real sanction of that life does not inhere in  the fugitive experiences or even the transformed personality of the  subject; but in the metaphysical Object which that subject  apprehends.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_i_1-p3"></A>Again, it now seems to me that a critical realism,  which found room for the duality of our full human  experience&#8212;the Eternal and the Successive, supernatural and  natural reality&#8212;would provide a better philosophic background to  the experience of the mystics than the vitalism which appeared, twenty  years ago, to offer so promising a way of escape from scientific  determinism. Determinism&#8212;more and more abandoned by its old  friends the physicists&#8212;is no longer the chief enemy to such a  spiritual interpretation of life as is required by the experience of  the mystics. It is rather a naturalistic monism, a shallow doctrine of  immanence unbalanced by any adequate sense of transcendence, which now  threatens to re-model theology in a sense which leaves no room for the  noblest and purest reaches of the spiritual life.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_i_1-p4"></A>Yet in spite of the adjustments required by such a  shifting at the philosophic outlook, and by nearly twenty years of  further <a name="page_xv"><font size="1" color="green">p. xv</font></A> <A NAME="an_i_1-Page_xv"></A> study and meditation, the final  positions which seem to me to be required by the existence of  mysticism remain substantially unchanged. Twenty years ago, I was  already convinced that the facts of man&#8217;s spiritual experience  pointed to a limited dualism; a diagram which found place for his  contrasting apprehension of Absolute and Contingent, Being and  Becoming, Simultaneous and Successive. Further, that these facts  involved the existence in him too of a certain doubleness, a higher  and lower, natural and transcendental self&#8212;something equivalent  to that &#8220;Funklein&#8221; spark, or apex of the soul on which the  mystics have always insisted as the instrument of their special  experience. Both these opinions were then unpopular. The second, in  particular, has been severely criticized by Professor Pratt and other  authorities on the psychology of religion. Yet the constructive work  which has since been done on the metaphysical implications of mystical  experience has tended more and more to establish their necessity, at  least as a basis of analysis; and they can now claim the most  distinguished support.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_i_1-p5"></A>The recovery of the concept of the  Supernatural&#8212;a word which no respectable theologian of the last  generation cared to use&#8212;is closely linked with the great name of  Friedrich von H&uuml;gel. His persistent opposition to all merely  monistic, pantheist and immanental philosophies of religion, and his  insistence on the need of a &#8220;two-step diagram&#8221; of the  Reality accessible to man, though little heeded in his life-time, are  now bearing fruit. This re-instatement of the Transcendent, the  &#8220;Wholly Other,&#8221; as   <i>the</i>    religious fact, is perhaps the most fundamental of the philosophic  changes which have directly affected the study of mysticism. It thus  obtains a metaphysical background which harmonizes with its greatest  declarations, and supports its claim to empirical knowledge of the  Truth on which all religion rests. Closely connected with the  transcendence of its Object, are the twin doctrines emphasized in all  Von H&uuml;gel&#8217;s work. First, that while mysticism is an  essential element in full human religion, it can never be the whole  content of such religion. It requires to be embodied in some degree in  history, dogma and institutions if it is to reach the  sense-conditioned human mind. Secondly, that the antithesis between  the religions of &#8220;authority&#8221; and of <a name="page_xvi"><font size="1" color="green">p. xvi</font></A> <A NAME="an_i_1-Page_xvi"></A> &#8220;spirit,&#8221; the &#8220;Church&#8221;  and the &#8220;mystic,&#8221; is false. Each requires the other. The  &#8220;exclusive&#8221; mystic, who condemns all outward forms and  rejects the support of the religious complex, is an abnormality. He  inevitably tends towards pantheism, and seldom exhibits in its  richness the Unitive Life. It is the &#8220;inclusive&#8221; mystic,  whose freedom and originality are fed but not hampered by the  spiritual tradition within which he appears, who accepts the  incarnational status of the human spirit, and can &#8220;find the  inward in the outward as well as the inward in the inward,&#8221; who  shows us in their fullness and beauty the life-giving possibilities of  the soul transfigured in God.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_i_1-p6"></A>Second in importance among the changes which have come  over the study of mysticism, I should reckon the work done during the  last decade upon the psychology of prayer and contemplation. I cannot  comment here upon the highly technical discussions between experts as  to the place where the line is to be drawn between  &#8220;natural&#8221; and &#8220;supernatural,&#8221;  &#8220;active&#8221; and &#8220;infused&#8221; operations of the soul  in communion with God; or the exact distinction between  &#8220;ordinary&#8221; and &#8220;extraordinary&#8221; contemplation.  But the fact that these discussions have taken place is itself  significant; and requires from religious psychology the  acknowledgement of a genuine two-foldness in human nature&#8212;the  difference in kind between   <i>Animus</i>    the surface-self and   <i>Anima</i>    the transcendental self, in touch with supernatural realities. Here,  the most important work has been done in France; and especially by the  Abb&eacute; Bremond, whose &#8220;Pri&egrave;re et Po&eacute;sie&#8221; and  &#8220;Introduction a la Philosophie de la  Pri&egrave;re&#8221;&#8212;based on a vast acquaintance with mystical  literature&#8212;mark, I believe, the beginning of a new understanding  of the character of contemplation. The Thomist philosophy of Maritain,  and the psychological researches of Mar&eacute;chal, tend to support  this developing view of the mystical experience, even in its  elementary forms, as an activity of the transcendental self; genuinely  supernatural, yet not necessarily involving any abnormal  manifestations, and linked by the ascending &#8220;degrees of  prayer&#8221; with the subject&#8217;s &#8220;ordinary&#8221;  religious life. This disentangling of the substance of mysticism from  the psycho-physical accidents of trance, ecstasy, vision and other  abnormal phenomena which often <a name="page_xvii"><font size="1" color="green">p. xvii</font></A> <A NAME="an_i_1-Page_xvii"></A>  accompany it, and its vindication as something which gives the self a  genuine knowledge of transcendental Reality&#8212;with its  accompanying demonstration of the soberness and sanity of the greatest  contemplative saints&#8212;is the last of the beneficent changes which  have transformed our study of the mystics. In this country it is  identified with the work of two Benedictine scholars; Abbot Chapman of  Downside and Dom Cuthbert Butler, whose &#8220;Western  Mysticism&#8221; is a masterly exhibition of the religious and  psychological normality of the Christian contemplative life, as  developed by its noblest representatives.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_i_1-p7"></A>Since this book was written, our knowledge of the  mystics has been much extended by the appearance of critical texts of  many writings which had only been known to us in garbled versions; or  in translations made with an eye to edification rather than accuracy.  Thus the publication of the authentic revelations of Angela of  Foligno&#8212;one of the most interesting discoveries of recent  years&#8212;has disclosed the unsuspected splendour of her mystical  experience. The critical texts of St. Teresa and St. John of the Cross  which are now available amend previous versions in many important  respects. We have reliable editions of Tauler and Ruysbroeck; of  &#8220;The Cloud of Unknowing,&#8221; and of Walter Hilton&#8217;s  works. The renewed interest in seventeenth-century mysticism, due in  part to the Abb&eacute; Bremond&#8217;s great work, has resulted in the  publication of many of its documents. So too the literary, social and  historical links between the mystics, the influence of environment,  the great part played by forgotten spiritual movements and  inarticulate saints, are beginning to be better understood. Advantage  has been taken of these facts in preparing the present edition. All  quotations from the mystics have been revised by comparison with the  best available texts. The increased size of the historical appendix  and bibliography is some indication of the mass of fresh material  which is now at the disposal of students; material which must be  examined with truth-loving patience, with sympathy, and above all with  humility, by those who desire to make valid additions to our knowledge  of the conditions under which the human spirit has communion with  God.</p>
