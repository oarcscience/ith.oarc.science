<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p1"></A>In<A NAME="an_iii.vi-p1.1"></A> our study of theology we saw the Christian mystic adopting, as chart  and pilot book of his voyages and adventures, the scheme of faith, and  diagram of the spiritual world, which is accepted by ordinary  Christian men. We saw that he found in it a depth and richness of  content which the conventional believer in that theology, the  &#8220;good churchman,&#8221; seldom suspects: and that which is true  of the Christian mystic is also true in its measure and as regards  their respective theologies, of the Pagan, the Mahommedan and the  Buddhist.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p2"></A>But since the spiritual adventures of the mystic are  not those of ordinary men, it will follow that this map, though always  true for him, is not complete. He can press forward to countries which  unmystical piety must mark as unexplored, Pushing out from harbour to  &#8220;the vast and stormy sea of the divine,&#8221; he can take  soundings, and mark dangers the existence of which such piety never  needs to prove. Hence it is not strange that certain maps, artistic  representations or symbolic schemes, should have come into being which  describe or suggest the special experiences of the mystical  consciousness, and the doctrines to which these experiences have given  birth. Many of these maps have an uncouth, even an impious appearance  in the eyes of those unacquainted with the facts which they attempt to  translate: as the charts of the deep-sea sailor seem ugly and  unintelligible things to those who have never been out of sight of  land. Others&#8212;and these the most pleasing, most easily  understood&#8212;have already been made familiar, perhaps tiresomely  familiar, to us by the poets; who, intuitively recognizing their  suggestive qualities, their links with <a name="page_126"><font size="1" color="green">p. 126</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.vi-Page_126"></A>  truth, have borrowed and adapted them to their own business of  translating Reality into terms of rhythm and speech. Ultimately,  however, they owe their origin to the mystics, or to that mystical  sense which is innate in all true poets: and in the last resort it is  the mystic&#8217;s kingdom, and the mystic&#8217;s experience, which  they affect to describe.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p3"></A>These special mystical diagrams, these symbolic and  artistic descriptions of man&#8217;s inward history&#8212;his secret  adventures with God&#8212;are almost endless in their variety: since  in each we have a picture of the country of the soul seen through a  different temperament. To describe all would be to analyse the whole  field of mystical literature, and indeed much other literature as  well; to epitomize in fact all that has been dreamed and written  concerning the so-called &#8220;inner life&#8221;&#8212;a dreary and a  lengthy task. But the majority of them, I think, express a  comparatively small number of essential doctrines or fundamental ways  of seeing things; and as regards their imagery, they fall into three  great classes, representative of the three principal ways in which  man&#8217;s spiritual consciousness reacts to the touch of Reality,  the three primary if paradoxical facts of which that consciousness  must be aware. Hence a consideration of mystic symbols drawn from each  of these groups may give us a key with which to unlock some at least  of the verbal riddles of the individual adventurer.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p4"></A>Thanks to the spatial imagery inseparable from human  thinking and human expression, no direct description of spiritual  experience is or can be possible to man. It must always be symbolic,  allusive, oblique: always suggest, but never tell, the truth: and in  this respect there is not much to choose between the fluid and  artistic language of vision and the arid technicalities of philosophy.  In another respect, however, there is a great deal to choose between  them: and here the visionary, not the philosopher, receives the palm.  The greater the suggestive quality of the symbol used, the more  answering emotion it evokes in those to whom it is addressed, the more  truth it will convey. A good symbolism, therefore, will be more than  mere diagram or mere allegory: it will use to the utmost the resources  of beauty and of passion, will bring with it hints of mystery and  wonder, bewitch with dreamy periods the mind to which it is addressed.  Its appeal will not be to the clever brain, but to the desirous heart,  the intuitive sense, of man.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p5"></A>The three great classes of symbols which I propose to  consider, appeal to three deep cravings of the self, three great  expressions of man&#8217;s restlessness, which only mystic truth can  fully satisfy. The first is the craving which makes him a pilgrim and  wanderer. It is the longing to go out from his normal world in search  of a lost home, a &#8220;better country&#8221;; an Eldorado, a Sarras,  a Heavenly <a name="page_127"><font size="1" color="green">p. 127</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.vi-Page_127"></A> Syon. The next is that  craving of heart for heart, of the soul for its perfect mate, which  makes him a lover. The third is the craving for inward purity and  perfection, which makes him an ascetic, and in the last resort a  saint.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p6"></A>These three cravings, I think, answer to three ways in  which mystics of different temperaments attack the problem of the  Absolute: three different formulae under which their transcendence of  the sense-world can be described. In describing this transcendence,  and the special adventures involved in it, they are describing a  change from the state of ordinary men, in touch with the sense-world,  responding to its rhythms, to the state of spiritual consciousness in  which, as they say, they are &#8220;in union&#8221; with Divine  Reality, with God. Whatever be the theological creed of the mystic, he  never varies in declaring this close, definite, and actual intimacy to  be the end of his quest. &#8220;Mark me like the tulip with Thine own  streaks,&#8221; says the Sufi.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_257"></A><A HREF="#fn_257"><FONT SIZE="1">258</FONT></A>
    &#8220;I would fain be to the Eternal Goodness what his own hand is  to a man,&#8221; says the German contemplative.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_258"></A><A HREF="#fn_258"><FONT SIZE="1">259</FONT></A>
    &#8220;My   <i>me</i>    isGod, nor do I know my self-hood save in Him,&#8221; says the  Italian saint.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_259"></A><A HREF="#fn_259"><FONT SIZE="1">260</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p10"></A>But, since this Absolute God is for him substance,  ground or underlying Reality of all that   <i>is</i>   : present yet absent, near yet far: He is already as truly immanent in  the human soul as in the Universe. The seeker for the Real may  therefore objectify his quest in two apparently contradictory, yet  really mutually explanatory ways. First he may see it as an outgoing  journey from the world of illusion to the real or transcendental  world: a leaving of the visible for the invisible. Secondly, it may  appear to him as an inward alteration, remaking or regeneration, by  which his personality or character is so changed as to be able to  enter into communion with that Fontal Being which he loves and  desires; is united with and dominated by the indwelling God who is the  fount of his spiritual life. In the first case, the objective idea  &#8220;God&#8221; is the pivot of his symbolism: the Blazing Star, or  Magnet of the Universe which he has seen far off, and seeing, has  worshipped and desired. In the second case, the emphasis falls on the  subjective idea &#8220;Sanctity,&#8221; with its accompanying  consciousness of a disharmony to be abolished. The Mystic Way will  then be described, not as a journey, but as an alteration of  personality, the transmuting of &#8220;earthly&#8221; into  &#8220;heavenly&#8221; man. Plainly these two aspects are obverse and  reverse of one whole. They represent that mighty pair of opposites,  Infinite and Finite, God and Self, which it is the business of  mysticism to carry up into a higher synthesis. <a name="page_128"><font size="1" color="green">p. 128</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.vi-Page_128"></A> Whether the process be considered as outward  search or inward change, its object and its end are the same. Man  enters into that Order of Reality for which he was made, and which is  indeed the inciting cause of his pilgrimage and his purification: for  however great the demand on the soul&#8217;s own effort may be, the  initiative always lies with the living Divine World itself.  Man&#8217;s small desire is evoked, met, and fulfilled by the Divine  Desire, his &#8220;separated will&#8221; or life becomes one with the  great Life of the All.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p11"></A>From what has been said in the last chapter, it will  be clear that the symbolism of outward search and of inward change  will be adopted respectively by the two groups of selves whose  experience of &#8220;union with the Divine&#8221; leans (1) to the  Transcendent or external, (2) to the Immanent or internal way of  apprehending Reality. A third or intermediate group of images will be  necessary to express the experience of those to whom mystic  feeling&#8212;the satisfaction of love&#8212;is the supreme factor in  the mystic life. According, then, to whether man&#8217;s instinct  prompts him to describe the Absolute Reality which he knows and craves  for as a Place, a Person, or a State&#8212;all three of course but  partial and inadequate translations of the one Indescribable  Truth&#8212;so will he tend to adopt a symbolism of one or other of  these three types.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p12"></A>A. Those who conceive the Perfect as a beatific vision  exterior to them and very far off, who find in the doctrine of  Emanations something which answers to their inward experience, will  feel the process of their entrance into reality to be a quest, an  arduous journey from the material to the spiritual world. They move  away from, rather than transmute to another form, the life of sense.  The ecstasies of such mystics will answer to the root-meaning of that  much perverted word, as a &#8220;standing out&#8221; from themselves;  a flight to happier countries far away. For them, the soul is outward  bound towards its home.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p13"></A>B. Those for whom mysticism is above all things an  intimate and personal relation, the satisfaction of a deep  desire&#8212;who can say with Gertrude More, &#8220;never was there or  can there be imagined such a love, as is between an humble soul and  Thee&#8221;&#8212;will fall back upon imagery drawn largely from the  language of earthly passion. Since the Christian religion insists upon  the personal aspect of the Godhead, and provides in Christ an object  of such intimacy, devotion and desire, an enormous number of Christian  mystics inevitably describe their experiences under symbolism of this  kind.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p14"></A>C. Those who are conscious rather of the Divine as a  Transcendent Life immanent in the world and the self, and of a strange  spiritual seed within them by whose development man, moving to higher  levels of character and consciousness, attains his end, <a name="page_129"><font size="1" color="green">p. 129</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.vi-Page_129"></A> will see the mystic life as involving inward  change rather than outgoing search. Regeneration is their watchword,  and they will choose symbols of growth or transmutation: saying with  St. Catherine of Genoa, &#8220;my Being is God, not by simple  participation, but by a true transformation of my Being.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_260"></A><A HREF="#fn_260"><FONT SIZE="1">261</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p16"></A>These three groups of mystics, then, stand for three  kinds of temperament; and we may fairly take as their characteristic  forms of symbolic expression the Mystic Quest, the Marriage of the  Soul, and the &#8220;Great Work&#8221; of the Spiritual  Alchemists.</p>   <h4 align="center"><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p16.1"></A>I</h4>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p17"></A>The pilgrimage idea, the outgoing quest, appears in  mystical literature under two different aspects. One is the search for  the &#8220;Hidden Treasure which desires to be found.&#8221; Such is  the &#8220;quest of the Grail&#8221; when regarded in its mystic  aspect as an allegory of the adventures of the soul. The other is the  long, hard journey towards a known and definite goal or state. Such  are Dante&#8217;s &#8220;Divine Comedy&#8221; and Bunyan&#8217;s  &#8220;Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress&#8221;; each in their manner faithful  descriptions of the Mystic Way. The goal of the quest&#8212;the  Empyrean of Dante, the Beatific Vision or fulfilment of love&#8212;is  often called Jerusalem by the Christian mystics: naturally enough  since that city was for the mediaeval mind the supreme end of  pilgrimage. By Jerusalem they mean not only the celestial country  Heaven, but also the spiritual life, which is &#8220;itself a  heaven.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_261"></A><A HREF="#fn_261"><FONT SIZE="1">262</FONT></A>
    &#8220;Right as a true pilgrim going to Jerusalem,&#8221; says  Hilton, &#8220;leaveth behind him house and land, wife and child, and  maketh himself poor and bare from all that he hath, that he may go  lightly without letting: right so, if thou wilt be a ghostly pilgrim,  thou shalt make thyself naked from all that thou hast . . . then shalt  thou set in thy heart wholly and fully that thou wouldst be at  Jerusalem, and at none other place but there.&#8221;  &#8220;Jerusalem,&#8221; he says in this same chapter, &#8220;is as  much as to say a sight of peace; and betokeneth contemplation in  perfect love of God.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_262"></A><A HREF="#fn_262"><FONT SIZE="1">263</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p20"></A>Under this image of a pilgrimage&#8212;an image as  concrete and practical, as remote from the romantic and picturesque,  for the mediaeval writers who used it, as a symbolism of hotel and  railway train would be to us&#8212;the mystics contrived to summarize  and suggest much of the life history of the ascending soul; the  developing spiritual consciousness. The necessary freedom and  detachment of the traveller, his departure from his normal life and  interests, the difficulties, enemies, and hardships encountered on  <a name="page_130"><font size="1" color="green">p. 130</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.vi-Page_130"></A> the road&#8212;the length of the  journey, the variety of the country, the dark night which overtakes  him, the glimpses of destination far away&#8212;all these are seen  more and more as we advance in knowledge to constitute a transparent  allegory of the incidents of man&#8217;s progress from the unreal to  the real. Bunyan was but the last of a long series of minds which  grasped this fact.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p21"></A>The Traveller, says the Sufi &#8216;Aziz bin Mahommed  Nafasi, in whose book, &#8220;The Remotest Aim,&#8221; the  pilgrimage-symbolism is developed in great detail, is the Perceptive  or Intuitive Sense of Man. The goal to which he journeys is Knowledge  of God. This mysterious traveller towards the only country of the soul  may be known of other men by his detachment, charity, humility, and  patience. These primary virtues, however&#8212;belonging to ethical  rather than to spiritual life&#8212;are not enough to bring his quest  to a successful termination. They make him, say the Sufis,  &#8220;perfect in knowledge of his goal but deficient in the power of  reaching it.&#8221; Though he has fraternal love for his  fellow-pilgrims, detachment from wayside allurements, untiring  perseverance on the road, he is still encumbered and weakened by  unnecessary luggage. The second stage of his journey, therefore, is  initiated like that of Christian by a casting off of his burden: a  total self-renouncement, the attainment of a Franciscan poverty of  spirit whereby he becomes &#8220;Perfectly Free.&#8221;</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p22"></A>Having got rid of all impediments to the spiritual  quest, he must now acquire or develop in their stead the  characteristic mystical qualities, or Three Aids of the Pilgrim; which  are called in this system Attraction, Devotion, and Elevation.  Attraction is consciousness of the mutual desire existing between  man&#8217;s spirit and the Divine Spirit: of the link of love which  knits up reality and draws all things to their home in God. This is  the universal law on which all mysticism is based. It is St.  Augustine&#8217;s &#8220;Thou hast made us for Thyself and our hearts  can find no rest except in Thee.&#8221; This &#8220;natural  magnetism,&#8221; then, once he is aware of it, will draw the pilgrim  irresistibly along the road from the Many to the One. His second aid,  Devotion, says the &#8220;Remotest Aim&#8221; in a phrase of great  depth and beauty, is &#8220;the prosecution of the journey   <i>to</i>    God and   <i>in</i>    God.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_263"></A><A HREF="#fn_263"><FONT SIZE="1">264</FONT></A>
    It embraces, in fact, the whole contemplative life. It is the next  degree of spiritual consciousness after the blind yielding to the  attraction of the Real, and the setting in order of man&#8217;s  relation to his source.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p24"></A>The Traveller&#8217;s journey   <i>to</i>    God is complete when he attains <a name="page_131"><font size="1" color="green">p. 131</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.vi-Page_131"></A>  knowledge of Him&#8212;&#8220;Illumination,&#8221; in the language of  European mystics. The point at which this is reached is called the  Tavern or resting-place upon the road, where he is fed with the Divine  Mysteries. There are also &#8220;Wine Shops&#8221; upon the way, where  the weary pilgrim is cheered and refreshed by a draught of the wine of  Divine Love.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_264"></A><A HREF="#fn_264"><FONT SIZE="1">265</FONT></A>
    Only when the journey   <i>to</i>    God is completed begins the &#8220;Journey   <i>in</i>    God&#8221;&#8212;that which the Christian mystics call the Unitive  Way&#8212;and this, since it is the essence of Eternal Life, can have  no end. Elevation, the pilgrim&#8217;s third aid, is the exalted or  ecstatic form of consciousness peculiar to the contemplative, and  which allows the traveller a glimpse of the spiritual city towards  which he goes.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_265"></A><A HREF="#fn_265"><FONT SIZE="1">266</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p27"></A>The Sufi poet &#8216;Attar, in his mystical poem,  &#8220;The Colloquy of the Birds,&#8221; has described the stages of  this same spiritual pilgrimage with greater psychological insight, as  the journey through &#8220;Seven Valleys.&#8221; The lapwing, having  been asked by other birds what is the length of the road which leads  to the hidden Palace of the King, replies that there are Seven Valleys  through which every traveller must pass: but since none who attain the  End ever come back to describe their adventures, no one knows the  length of the way.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p28"></A>(1) The first valley, says the lapwing, is the Valley  of the Quest. It is long and toilsome: and there the traveller must  strip himself of all earthly things, becoming poor, bare, and  desolate: and so stay till the Supernal Light casts a ray on his  desolation. It is in fact, Dante&#8217;s Purgatorio, the Christian Way  of Purgation: the period of self-stripping and purification which no  mystic system omits.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p29"></A>(2) When the ray of Supernal Light has touched the  pilgrim he enters the limitless Valley of Love: begins, that is to  say, the mystic life. It is Dante&#8217;s &#8220;Earthly  Paradise,&#8221; or, in the traditional system of the mystics, the  onset of Illumination.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p30"></A>(3) Hence he passes to the Valley of Knowledge or  Enlightenment&#8212;the contemplative state&#8212;where each finds in  communion with Truth the place that belongs to him. No Dante student  will fail to see here a striking parallel with those planetary heavens  where each soul partakes of the Divine, &#8220;not supremely in the  absolute sense,&#8221; as St. Bonaventura has it, but &#8220;supremely  in respect of   <i>himself.&#8221;</i>    The mystery of Being is now revealed to the traveller. He sees  Nature&#8217;s secret, and God in all things. It is the height of  illumination. <a name="page_132"><font size="1" color="green">p. 132</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.vi-Page_132"></A></p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p31"></A>(4) The next stage is the Valley of Detachment, of  utter absorption in Divine Love&#8212;the Stellar Heaven of the  Saints&#8212;where Duty is seen to be all in all. This leads  to&#8212;</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p32"></A>(5) The Valley of the Unity, where the naked Godhead  is the one object of contemplation. This is the stage of ecstasy, or  the Beatific Vision: Dante&#8217;s condition in the last canto of the  &#8220;Paradiso.&#8221; It is transient, however, and leads  to&#8212;</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p33"></A>(6) The Valley of Amazement; where the Vision, far  transcending the pilgrim&#8217;s receptive power, appears to be taken  from him and he is plunged in darkness and bewilderment. This is the  state which Dionysius the Areopagite, and after him many mediaeval  mystics, called the Divine Dark, and described as the truest and  closest of all our apprehensions of the Godhead. It is the Cloud of  Unknowing, &#8220;dark from excessive bright.&#8221; The final stage  is&#8212;</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p34"></A>(7) The Valley of Annihilation of Self: the supreme  degree of union or theopathetic state, in which the self is utterly  merged &#8220;like a fish in the sea&#8221; in the ocean of Divine  Love.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_266"></A><A HREF="#fn_266"><FONT SIZE="1">267</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p36"></A>Through all these metaphors of pilgrimage to a  goal&#8212;of a road followed, distance overpassed, fatigue  endured&#8212;there runs the definite idea that the travelling self in  undertaking the journey is fulfilling a destiny, a law of the  transcendental life; obeying an imperative need. The chosen Knights  are destined or   <i>called</i>    to the quest of the Grail. &#8220;All men are   <i>called</i>    to their origin,&#8221; says Rulman Merswin, and the fishes which he  sees in his Vision of Nine Rocks are impelled to struggle, as it were  &#8220;against nature,&#8221; uphill from pool to pool towards their  source.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_267"></A><A HREF="#fn_267"><FONT SIZE="1">268</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p38"></A>All mystical thinkers agree in declaring that there is  a mutual attraction between the Spark of the Soul, the free divine  germ in man, and the Fount from which it came forth. &#8220;We long  for the Absolute,&#8221; says Royce, &#8220;only in so far as in us  the Absolute also longs, and seeks, through our very temporal  striving, the peace that is nowhere in Time, but only, and yet  Absolutely, in Eternity.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_268"></A><A HREF="#fn_268"><FONT SIZE="1">269</FONT></A>
    So, many centuries before the birth of American philosophy, Hilton  put the same truth of experience in lovelier words. &#8220;He it is  that desireth in thee, and He it is that is desired. He is all and He  doth all if thou might see Him.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_269"></A><A HREF="#fn_269"><FONT SIZE="1">270</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p41"></A>The homeward journey of man&#8217;s spirit, then, may  be thought of as due to the push of a divine life within, answering to  the pull of <a name="page_133"><font size="1" color="green">p. 133</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.vi-Page_133"></A> a divine life without.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_270"></A><A HREF="#fn_270"><FONT SIZE="1">271</FONT></A>
    It is only possible because there is already in that spirit a certain  kinship with the Divine, a capacity for Eternal Life; and the mystics,  in undertaking it, are humanity&#8217;s pioneers on the only road to  rest. Hence that attraction which the Moslem mystic discerned as the  traveller&#8217;s necessary aid, is a fundamental doctrine of all  mysticism: and as a consequence, the symbolism of mutual desire is  here inextricably mingled with that of pilgrimage. The spiritual  pilgrim goes because he is called; because he wants to go, must go, if  he is to find rest and peace. &#8220;God   <i>needs</i>    man,&#8221; says Eckhart. It is Love calling to love: and the  journey, though in one sense a hard pilgrimage, up and out, by the  terraced mount and the ten heavens to God, in another is the  inevitable rush of the roving comet, caught at last, to the Central  Sun. &#8220;My weight is my love,&#8221; said St. Augustine.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_271"></A><A HREF="#fn_271"><FONT SIZE="1">272</FONT></A>
    Like gravitation, it inevitably compels, for good or evil, every  spirit to its own place. According to another range of symbols, that  love flings open a door, in order that the larger Life may rush in and  it and the soul be &#8220;one thing.&#8221;</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p44"></A>Here, then, we run through the whole gamut of symbolic  expression; through Transcendence, Desire, and Immanence. All are seen  to point to one consummation, diversely and always allusively  expressed: the need of union between man&#8217;s separated spirit and  the Real, his remaking in the interests of transcendent life, his  establishment in that Kingdom which is both &#8220;near and  far.&#8221;</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p45"></A>&#8220;In the book of Hidden Things it is  written,&#8221; says Eckhart, &#8220;&#8216;I stand at the door and  knock and wait&#8217; . . . thou needst not seek Him here or there: He  is no farther off than the door of the heart. There He stands and  waits and waits until He finds thee ready to open and let Him in. Thou  needst not call Him from a distance; to wait until thou openest is  harder for Him than for thee. He needs thee a thousand times more than  thou canst need Him.   <i>Thy opening and His entering are but one moment</i>   .&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_272"></A><A HREF="#fn_272"><FONT SIZE="1">273</FONT></A>
    &#8220;God,&#8221; he says in another place, &#8220;can as little do  without us, as we without Him.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_273"></A><A HREF="#fn_273"><FONT SIZE="1">274</FONT></A>
    Our attainment of the Absolute is not a one-sided ambition, but the  fulfilment of a mutual desire. &#8220;For our natural Will,&#8221;  says Lady Julian, &#8220;is to have God, and the Good will of <a name="page_134"><font size="1" color="green">p. 134</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.vi-Page_134"></A> God is to have us; and we may never cease from  longing till we have Him in fullness of joy.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_274"></A><A HREF="#fn_274"><FONT SIZE="1">275</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p49"></A>So, in the beautiful poem or ritual called the  &#8220;Hymn of Jesus,&#8221; contained in the apocryphal &#8220;Acts  of John&#8221; and dating from primitive Christian times, the Logos,  or Eternal Christ, is thus represented as matching with His own  transcendent, self-giving desire every need of the soul.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_275"></A><A HREF="#fn_275"><FONT SIZE="1">276</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p51"></A>The Soul says:&#8212;</p>   <blockquote><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p51.1"></A> &#8220;&#8216;I would be saved.&#8217;&#8221;<br>  </blockquote>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p52"></A>Christ replies:&#8212;</p>   <blockquote><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p52.1"></A> &#8220;&#8216;And I would save.&#8217;  Amen.&#8221;<br>  </blockquote>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p53"></A>The Dialogue continues:&#8212;</p>   <blockquote><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p53.1"></A> &#8220;&#8216;I would be loosed.&#8217;<br>   &#8216;And I would loose.&#8217; Amen.<br>   &#8216;I would be pierced.&#8217;<br>   &#8216;And I would pierce.&#8217; Amen.<br>   &#8216;I would be born.&#8217;<br>   &#8216;And I would bear.&#8217; Amen.<br>   &#8216;I would eat.&#8217;<br>   &#8216;And I would be eaten.&#8217; Amen.<br>   &#8216;I would hear.&#8217;<br>   &#8216;And I would be heard.&#8217; Amen.&#8221;<br>   &#8220;&#8216;I am a Lamp to thee who beholdest  Me,<br>   I am a Mirror to thee who perceivest Me,<br>   I am a Door to thee, who knockest at Me,<br>   I am a Way to thee a wayfarer.&#8217;&#8221;<br>  </blockquote>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p54"></A>The same fundamental idea of the mutual quest of the  Soul and the Absolute is expressed in the terms of another symbolism  by the great Mahommedan mystic:&#8212;</p>   <blockquote><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p54.1"></A> &#8220;No lover ever seeks union with his  beloved,<br>   But his beloved is also seeking union with him.<br>   But the lover&#8217;s love makes his body lean<br>   While the beloved&#8217;s love makes her fair and  lusty.<br>   When in   <i>this</i>    heart the lightning spark of love arises,<br>   Be sure this love is reciprocated in   <i>that</i>    heart.<br>   When the love of God arises in thy heart,<br>   Without doubt God also feels love for thee.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_276"></A><A HREF="#fn_276"><FONT SIZE="1">277</FONT></A>
  <br>  </blockquote>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p56"></A>The mystic vision, then, is of a spiritual universe  held within <a name="page_135"><font size="1" color="green">p. 135</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.vi-Page_135"></A> the bonds of love:   &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_277"></A><A HREF="#fn_277"><FONT SIZE="1">278</FONT></A>
   and of the free and restless human soul, having within it the spark of  divine desire, the &#8220;tendency to the Absolute,&#8221; pnly  finding satisfaction and true life when united with this Life of God.  Then, in Patmore&#8217;s lovely image, &#8220;the babe is at its  mother&#8217;s breast,&#8221; &#8220;the lover has returned to the  beloved.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_278"></A><A HREF="#fn_278"><FONT SIZE="1">279</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p63"></A>Whatever their outward sense, all true mystic symbols  express aspects of this &#8220;secret of the world,&#8221; this primal  verity. But whereas such great visionary schemes as those of  &#8216;Attar and of Dante show it in its cosmic form, in many symbolic  descriptions&#8212;particularly those which we meet in the writings of  the ecstatic saints&#8212;the personal subjective note, the  consciousness of an individual relation between that one self and the  Supernal Self, overpowers all general applications. Then philosophy  and formal allegory must step aside: the sacramental language of  exalted emotion, of profoundly felt experience, takes its place. The  phases of mutual love, of wooing and combat, awe and delight&#8212;the  fevers of desire, the ecstasy of surrender&#8212;are drawn upon and  made to contribute something to the description of the great and  secret drama of the soul.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p64"></A>To such symbolic transcripts of intimate experience  belongs one amazing episode of the spiritual life-history which,  because it has been given immortal expression by the greatest mystical  poet of modern times, is familiar to thousands of readers who know  little or nothing of the more normal adventures incidental to  man&#8217;s attainment of the Absolute. In &#8220;The Hound of  Heaven&#8221; Francis Thompson described with an almost terrible  power, not the self&#8217;s quest of adored Reality, but  Reality&#8217;s quest of the unwilling self. He shows to us the  remorseless, untiring seeking and following of the soul by the Divine  Life to which it will not surrender: the inexorable onward sweep of  &#8220;this tremendous Lover,&#8221; hunting the separated spirit,  &#8220;strange piteous futile thing&#8221; that flees Him &#8220;down  the nights and down the days.&#8221; This idea of the love-chase, of  the spirit rushing in terror from the overpowering presence of God,  but followed, sought, conquered in the end, is common to all the  mediaeval mystics: it is the obverse of their general doctrine of the  necessary fusion of human and divine life, &#8220;escape from the  flame of separation.&#8221;</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p65"></A>&#8220;I chased thee, for in this was my  pleasure,&#8221; says the voice of Love to Mechthild of Magdeburg;  &#8220;I captured thee, for this was my desire; I bound thee, and I  rejoice in thy bonds; I have <a name="page_136"><font size="1" color="green">p. 136</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.vi-Page_136"></A> wounded  thee, that thou mayst be united to me. If I gave thee blows, it was  that I might be possessed of thee.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_279"></A><A HREF="#fn_279"><FONT SIZE="1">280</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p67"></A>So in the beautiful Middle English poem of &#8220;Quia  amore langueo,&#8221;&#8212;</p>   <blockquote><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p67.1"></A> &#8220;I am true love that fals was nevere,<br>   Mi sistyr, mannis soule, I loved hir thus;<br>   Bicause we wolde in no wise discevere<br>   I lefte my Kyngdom glorious.<br>   I purveyde for hir a paleis precious;<br>   She fleyth, I folowe, I sought hir so.<br>   I suffride this peyne piteous<br>   Quia amore langueo,&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_280"></A><A HREF="#fn_280"><FONT SIZE="1">281</FONT></A>
  <br>  </blockquote>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p69"></A>Meister Eckhart has the same idea of the  inexorable Following Love, impossible to escape, expressed under less  personal images. &#8220;Earth,&#8221; he says, &#8220;cannot escape  the sky; let it flee up or down, the sky flows into it, and makes it  fruitful whether it will or no. So God does to man. He who will escape  Him only runs to His bosom; for all corners are open to Him.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_281"></A><A HREF="#fn_281"><FONT SIZE="1">282</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p71"></A>We find in all the mystics this strong sense of a  mysterious spiritual life&#8212;a Reality&#8212;over against man,  seeking him and compelling him to Its will. It is not for him, they  think, to say that he will or will not aspire to the transcendental  world.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_282"></A><A HREF="#fn_282"><FONT SIZE="1">283</FONT></A>
    Hence sometimes this inversion of man&#8217;s long quest of God. The  self resists the pull of spiritual gravitation, flees from the touch  of Eternity; and the Eternal seeks it, tracks it ruthlessly down. The  Following Love, the mystics say, is a fact of experience, not a poetic  idea. &#8220;Those strong feet that follow, follow after,&#8221; once  set upon the chase, are bound to win. Man, once conscious of Reality,  cannot evade it. For a time his separated spirit, his disordered  loves, may wilfully frustrate the scheme of things: but he must be  conquered in the end. Then the mystic process unfolds itself: Love  triumphs: the &#8220;purpose of the worlds&#8221; fulfils itself in  the individual life.</p>   <h4 align="center"><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p72.1"></A>II</h4>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p73"></A>It was natural and inevitable that the imagery of  human love and marriage should have seemed to the mystic the best of  all images of his own &#8220;fulfilment of life&#8221;; his  soul&#8217;s surrender, first to the call, finally to the embrace of  Perfect Love. It lay ready to <a name="page_137"><font size="1" color="green">p. 137</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.vi-Page_137"></A> his hand:  it was understood of all men: and moreover, it certainly does offer,  upon lower levels, a strangely exact parallel to the sequence of  states in which man&#8217;s spiritual consciousness unfolds itself,  and which form the consummation of the mystic life.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p74"></A>It has been said that the constant use of such imagery  by Christian mystics of the mediaeval period is traceable to the  popularity of the Song of Songs, regarded as an allegory of the  spiritual life. I think that the truth lies rather in the opposite  statement: namely, that the mystic loved the Song of Songs because he  there saw reflected, as in a mirror, the most secret experiences of  his soul. The sense of a desire that was insatiable, of a personal  fellowship so real, inward, and intense that it could only be compared  with the closest link of human love, of an intercourse that was no  mere spiritual self-indulgence, but was rooted in the primal duties  and necessities of life&#8212;more, those deepest, most intimate  secrets of communion, those self-giving ecstasies which all mystics  know, but of which we, who are not mystics, may not speak&#8212;all  these he found symbolized and suggested, their unendurable glories  veiled in a merciful mist, in the poetry which man has invented to  honour that august passion in which the merely human draws nearest to  the divine.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p75"></A>The great saints who adopted and elaborated this  symbolism, applying it to their pure and ardent passion for the  Absolute, were destitute of the prurient imagination which their  modern commentators too often possess. They were essentially pure of  heart; and when they &#8220;saw God&#8221; they were so far from  confusing that unearthly vision with the products of morbid sexuality,  that the dangerous nature of the imagery which they employed did not  occur to them. They knew by experience the unique nature of spiritual  love: and no one can know anything about it in any other way.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p76"></A>Thus for St. Bernard, throughout his deeply mystical  sermons on the Song of Songs, the Divine Word is the Bridegroom, the  human soul is the Bride: but how different is the effect produced by  his use of these symbols from that with which he has been charged by  hostile critics! In the place of that &#8220;sensuous imagery&#8221;  which is so often and so earnestly deplored by those who have hardly a  nodding acquaintance with the writings of the saints, we find images  which indeed have once been sensuous; but which are here anointed and  ordained to a holy office, carried up, transmuted, and endowed with a  radiant purity, an intense and spiritual life.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p77"></A>&#8220;  <i>&#8216;Let Him kiss me</i>      <i>with the kisses of His mouth.&#8217;</i>    Who is it speaks these words? It is the Bride. Who is the Bride? It  is the Soul thirsting for God. . . . She who asks this is held by the  bond of love to him from whom she asks it. Of all the sentiments of  nature, <a name="page_138"><font size="1" color="green">p. 138</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.vi-Page_138"></A> this of love is the most  excellent, especially when it is rendered back to Him who is the  principle and fountain of it&#8212;that is, God. Nor are there found  any expressions equally sweet to signify the mutual affection between  the Word of God and the soul, as those of Bridegroom and of Bride;  inasmuch as between individuals who stand in such relation to each  other all things are in common, and they possess nothing separate or  divided. They have one inheritance, one dwelling-place, one table, and  they are in fact one flesh. If, then, mutual love is especially  befitting to a bride and bridegroom, it is not unfitting that the name  of Bride is given to a soul which loves.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_283"></A><A HREF="#fn_283"><FONT SIZE="1">284</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p79"></A>To women mystics of the Catholic Church, familiar with  the antique and poetic metaphor which called every cloistered nun the  Bride of Christ, that crisis in their spiritual history in which they  definitely vowed themselves to the service of Transcendent Reality  seemed, naturally enough, the veritable betrothal of the soul. Often,  in a dynamic vision, they saw as in a picture the binding vows  exchanged between their spirits and their God.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_284"></A><A HREF="#fn_284"><FONT SIZE="1">285</FONT></A>
    That further progress on the mystic way which brought with it a sharp  and permanent consciousness of union with the Divine Will, the  constant sustaining presence of a Divine Companion, became, by an  extension of the original simile, Spiritual Marriage. The elements of  duty, constancy, irrevocableness, and loving obedience involved in the  mediaeval conception of the marriage tie, made it an apt image of a  spiritual state in which humility, intimacy, and love were the  dominant characteristics. There is really no need to seek a  pathological explanation of these simple facts.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_285"></A><A HREF="#fn_285"><FONT SIZE="1">286</FONT></A>
    Moreover with few exceptions, the descriptions of spiritual marriage  which the great mystics have left are singularly free from physical  imagery. &#8220;So mysterious is the secret,&#8221; says St. Teresa,  &#8220;and so sublime the favour that God thus bestows instantaneously  on the soul, that it feels a supreme delight, only to be described by  saying that our Lord vouchsafes for the moment to reveal to it His own  heavenly glory in a far more subtle way than by any vision or  spiritual delight. As far as can be understood, the soul, I mean the  spirit of this soul, is made one with God, who is <a name="page_139"><font size="1" color="green">p. 139</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.vi-Page_139"></A> Himself a spirit, and Who has been pleased to  show certain persons how far His love for us extends in order that we  may praise His greatness. He has thus deigned to unite Himself to His  creature: He has bound Himself to her as firmly as two human beings  are joined in wedlock and will never separate Himself from her.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_286"></A><A HREF="#fn_286"><FONT SIZE="1">287</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p83"></A>The great Richard of St. Victor, in one of his most  splendid mystical treatises,  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_287"></A><A HREF="#fn_287"><FONT SIZE="1">288</FONT></A>
    has given us perhaps the most daring and detailed application of the  symbolism of marriage to the adventures of the spirit of man. He  divides the &#8220;steep stairway of love,&#8221; by which the  contemplative ascends to union with the Absolute, into four stages.  These he calls the betrothal, the marriage, the wedlock, and the  fruitfulness of the soul.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_288"></A><A HREF="#fn_288"><FONT SIZE="1">289</FONT></A>
    In the betrothal, he says, the soul &#8220;thirsts for the  Beloved&#8221;; that is to say, it longs to experience the delights of  Reality. &#8220;The Spirit comes to the Soul, and seems sweeter than  honey.&#8221; It is conversion, the awakening to mystical truth; the  kindling of the passion for the Absolute. &#8220;Then the Soul with  pertinacity demands more&#8221;: and because of her burning desire she  attains to pure contemplation, and so passes to the second degree of  love. In this she is &#8220;led in bridal&#8221; by the Beloved.  Ascending &#8220;above herself&#8221; in contemplation, she  &#8220;sees the Sun of Righteousness.&#8221; She is now confirmed in  the mystic life; the irrevocable marriage vows are made between her  spirit and her God. At this point she can &#8220;see the  Beloved,&#8221; but &#8220;cannot yet come in to Him,&#8221; says  Richard. This degree, as we shall see later, answers more or less to  that which other mystics call the Illuminative Way: but any attempt to  press these poetic symbols into a cast-iron series, and establish  exact parallels, is foredoomed to failure, and will merely succeed in  robbing them of their fragrance and suggestive power. In  Richard&#8217;s &#8220;third stage,&#8221; however, that of union, or  wedlock, it is clear that the soul enters upon the &#8220;Unitive  Way.&#8221; She has passed the stages of ecstatic and significant  events, and is initiated into the Life. She is &#8220;deified,&#8221;  &#8220;passes utterly   <i>into</i>    God, and is glorified in Him&#8221;: is transfigured, he says, by  immediate contact with the Divine Substance, into an utterly different  quality of being. &#8220;Thus,&#8221; says St. John of the Cross,  &#8220;the soul, when it shall have driven away from itself all that  is contrary to the divine will, becomes transformed in God by love.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_289"></A><A HREF="#fn_289"><FONT SIZE="1">290</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p87"></A>&#8220;The Soul,&#8221; says Richard again, &#8220;is  utterly concentrated on the One.&#8221; She is &#8220;caught up to the  divine light.&#8221; The expression of <a name="page_140"><font size="1" color="green">p. 140</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.vi-Page_140"></A>  the personal passion, the intimate relation, here rises to its height.  But this is not enough. Where most mystical diagrams leave off,  Richard of St. Victor&#8217;s &#8220;steep stairway of Love&#8221;  goes on: with the result that this is almost the only symbolic system  bequeathed to us by the great contemplatives in which all the  implications contained in the idea of the spiritual marriage have been  worked out to their term. He saw clearly that the union of the soul  with its Source could not be a barren ecstasy. That was to mistake a  means for an end; and to frustrate the whole intention of life, which  is, on all levels, fruitful and creative. Therefore he says that in  the fourth degree, the Bride who has been so greatly honoured, caught  up to such unspeakable delight, sinks her own will and &#8220;is  humiliated below herself.&#8221; She accepts the pains and duties in  the place of the raptures of love; and becomes a source, a  &#8220;parent&#8221; of fresh spiritual life. The <A NAME="an_iii.vi-p87.1"></A>   <i>Sponsa Dei</i>     develops into the <A NAME="an_iii.vi-p87.2"></A>   <i>Mater Divinae gratiae.</i>     That imperative need of life, to push on, to create,  to spread, is here seen operating in the spiritual sphere. This forms  that rare and final stage in the evolution of the great mystics, in  which they return to the world which they forsook; and there live, as  it were, as centres of transcendental energy, the creators of  spiritual families, the partners and fellow-labourers with the Divine  Life.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_290"></A><A HREF="#fn_290"><FONT SIZE="1">291</FONT></A>
 </p>   <h4 align="center"><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p88.1"></A>III</h4>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p89"></A>We come now to the symbols which have been adopted by  those mystics in whom temperamental consciousness of their own  imperfection, and of the unutterable perfection of the Absolute Life  for which they longed, has overpowered all other aspects of  man&#8217;s quest of reality. The &#8220;seek, and ye shall  find&#8221; of the pilgrim, the &#8220;by Love shall He be gotten and  holden&#8221; of the bride, can never seem an adequate description of  experience to minds of this type. They are intent on the inexorable  truth which must be accepted in some form by both these classes: the  crucial fact that &#8220;we behold that which we are,&#8221; or, in  other words, that &#8220;only the Real can know Reality.&#8221; Hence  the state of the inward man, the &#8220;unrealness&#8221; of him when  judged by any transcendental standard, is their centre of interest.  His remaking or regeneration appears to them as the primal necessity,  if he is ever to obtain rights of citizenship in the &#8220;country of  the soul.&#8221;</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p90"></A>We have seen that this idea of the New Birth, the  remaking or transmutation of the self, clothed in many different  symbols, runs through the whole of mysticism and much of theology. It  is the mystic&#8217;s subjective reading of those necessary  psychological <a name="page_141"><font size="1" color="green">p. 141</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.vi-Page_141"></A> and moral changes which  he observes within himself as his spiritual consciousness grows. His  hard work of renunciation, of detachment from the things which that  consciousness points out as illusory or impure, his purifications and  trials, all form part of it. If that which is whole or perfect is to  come, then that which is in part must be done away: &#8220;for in what  measure we put off the creature, in the same measure are we able to  put on the Creator: neither more nor less.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_291"></A><A HREF="#fn_291"><FONT SIZE="1">292</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p92"></A>Of all the symbolic systems in which this truth has  been enshrined none is so complete, so picturesque, and now so little  understood as that of the &#8220;Hermetic Philosophers&#8221; or  Spiritual Alchemists. This fact would itself be sufficient to justify  us in examining some of the chief features of their symbolism. There  is a further excuse for this apparently eccentric proceeding, however,  in the fact that the language of alchemy was largely&#8212;though not  always accurately and consistently&#8212;used by the great mystic  Jacob Boehme, and after him by his English disciple, William Law.  Without, then, some knowledge of the terms which they employed, but  seldom explained, the writings of this important school can hardly be  understood.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p93"></A>The alchemic symbols, especially as applied to the  mystic life, are full of an often deliberate obscurity; which makes  their exact interpretation a controversial matter at the best.  Moreover, the authors of the various Hermetic writings do not always  use them in the same sense, and whilst many of these writings are  undoubtedly mystical, others clearly deal with the physical quest of  gold: nor have we any sure standard by which to divide class from  class. The elements from which the spiritual alchemists built up their  allegories of the mystic life are, however, easily grasped: and these  elements, with the significance generally attributed to them, are as  much as those who are not specialists can hope to unravel from this  very tangled skein. First, there are the metals; of course the obvious  materials of physical alchemy. These are usually called by the names  of their presiding planets: thus in Hermetic language Luna means  silver, Sol gold, etc. Then there is the Vessel, or Athanor, in which  the transmutation of base metal to gold took place: an object whose  exact nature is veiled in much mystery. The Fire, and various solvents  and waters, peculiar to the different alchemistic recipes, complete  the apparatus necessary to the &#8220;Great Work.&#8221;</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p94"></A>The process of this work, sometimes described in  chemical, and sometimes in astrological terms, is more often than not  disguised in a strange heraldic and zoological symbolism dealing with  Lions, Dragons, Eagles, Vultures, Ravens and Doves: which, <a name="page_142"><font size="1" color="green">p. 142</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.vi-Page_142"></A> delightful in its picturesqueness, is  unequalled in its power of confusing the anxious and unwary inquirer.  It is also the subject of innumerable and deliberate allegories, which  were supposed to convey its secrets to the elect, whilst most  certainly concealing them from the crowd. Hence it is that the author  of &#8220;A Short Enquiry concerning the Hermetic Art&#8221; speaks  for all investigators of this subject when he describes the  &#8220;Hermetic science&#8221; as a &#8220;great Labyrinth, in which  are abundance of enquirers rambling to this day, many of them  undiscerned by one another.&#8221; Like him, I too &#8220;have taken  several Turns in it myself, wherein one shall meet with very few; for  &#8216;tis so large, and almost every one taking a different Path,  that they seldom meet. But finding it a very melancholy place, I  resolved to get out of it, and rather content myself to walk in the  little garden before the entrance, where many things, though not all,  were orderly to be seen. Choosing rather to stay there, and  contemplate on the Metaphor set up, than venture again into the  wilderness.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_292"></A><A HREF="#fn_292"><FONT SIZE="1">293</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p96"></A>Coming, then, to the &#8220;contemplation of the  Metaphor set up,&#8221;&#8212;by far the most judicious course for  modern students of the Hermetic art&#8212;we observe first that the  prime object of alchemy was held to be the production of the  Philosopher&#8217;s Stone, that perfect and incorrupt substance or  &#8220;noble Tincture,&#8221; never found upon our imperfect earth in  its natural state, which could purge all baser metals of their dross,  and turn them to pure gold. The quest of the Stone, in fact, was but  one aspect of man&#8217;s everlasting quest of perfection, his hunger  for the Absolute; and hence an appropriate symbol of the mystic life.  But this quest was not conducted in some far off transcendental  kingdom. It was prosecuted in the Here and Now within the physical  world.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p97"></A>Gold, the Crowned King, or Sol, as it is called in the  planetary symbolism of the alchemists, was their standard of  perfection, the &#8220;Perfect Metal.&#8221; Towards it, as the  Christian towards sanctity, their wills were set. It had for them a  value not sordid but ideal. Nature, they thought, is always trying to  make gold, this incorruptible and perfect thing; and the other metals  are merely the results of the frustration of her original design. Nor  is this aiming at perfection and achieving of imperfection limited to  the physical world. <A NAME="an_iii.vi-p97.1"></A>   <i>Quod superius, sicut quod inferius.</i>     Upon the spiritual plane also they held that the  Divine Idea is always aiming at &#8220;Spiritual  Gold&#8221;&#8212;divine humanity, the New Man, citizen of the  transcendental world&#8212;and &#8220;natural man&#8221; as we  ordinarily know him is a lower metal, silver at best. He is a  departure from the &#8220;plan,&#8221; who yet bears within himself,  if we could find it, the spark or seed of absolute perfection: the  &#8220;tincture&#8221; which makes gold. &#8220;The <a name="page_143"><font size="1" color="green">p. 143</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.vi-Page_143"></A> smattering I have of the Philosopher&#8217;s  Stone,&#8221; says Sir Thomas Browne, &#8220;(which is something more  than the perfect exaltation of gold) hath taught me a great deal of  divinity, and instructed my belief how that immortal spirit and  incorruptible substance of my soul may lie obscure, and sleep awhile  within this house of flesh.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_293"></A><A HREF="#fn_293"><FONT SIZE="1">294</FONT></A>
    This &#8220;incorruptible substance&#8221; is man&#8217;s goldness,  his perfect principle: for &#8220;the highest mineral virtue resides  in Man,&#8221; says Albertus Magnus, &#8220;and God may be found  everywhere.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_294"></A><A HREF="#fn_294"><FONT SIZE="1">295</FONT></A>
    Hence the prosecution of a spiritual chemistry is a proper part of  the true Hermetic science.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p100"></A>The art of the alchemist, whether spiritual or  physical, consists in completing the work of perfection, bringing  forth and making dominant, as it were, the &#8220;latent  goldness&#8221; which &#8220;lies obscure&#8221; in metal or man. The  ideal adept of alchemy was therefore an &#8220;auxiliary of the  Eternal Goodness.&#8221; By his search for the &#8220;Noble  Tincture&#8221; which should restore an imperfect world, he became a  partner in the business of creation, assisting the Cosmic Plan. Thus  the proper art of the Spiritual Alchemist, with whom alone we are here  concerned, was the production of the spiritual and only valid tincture  or Philosopher&#8217;s Stone; the mystic seed of transcendental life  which should invade, tinge, and wholly transmute the imperfect self  into spiritual gold. That this was no fancy of seventeenth-century  allegorists, but an idea familiar to many of the oldest writers upon  alchemy&#8212;whose quest was truly a spiritual search into the  deepest secrets of the soul&#8212;is proved by the words which bring  to an end the first part of the antique &#8220;Golden Treatise upon  the Making of the Stone,&#8221; sometimes attributed to Hermes  Trismegistus. &#8220;This, O Son,&#8221; says that remarkable tract,  &#8220;is the Concealed Stone of Many Colours, which is born and  brought forth in one colour; know this and conceal it . . . it leads  from darkness into light, from this desert wilderness to a secure  habitation, and from poverty and straits to a free and ample  fortune.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_295"></A><A HREF="#fn_295"><FONT SIZE="1">296</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p102"></A>Man, then, was for the alchemists &#8220;the true  laboratory of the Hermetic art&#8221;; which concealed in an  entanglement of vague and contradictory symbols the life-process of  his ascension to that perfect state in which he was able to meet God.  This state must not be confused with a merely moral purity, but is to  be understood as involving utter transmutation into a &#8220;new  form.&#8221; It <a name="page_144"><font size="1" color="green">p. 144</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.vi-Page_144"></A> naturally followed from  this that the indwelling Christ, the &#8220;Corner Stone,&#8221; the  Sun of Righteousness, became, for many of the Christian alchemists,  identified with the <A NAME="an_iii.vi-p102.1"></A>   <i>Lapis Philosophorum</i>     and with Sol: and was regarded both as the image and  as the earnest of this &#8220;great work.&#8221; His spirit was the  &#8220;noble tincture&#8221; which &#8220;can bring that which is  lowest in the death to its highest ornament or glory;&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_296"></A><A HREF="#fn_296"><FONT SIZE="1">297</FONT></A>
    transmuting the natural to the supernatural, operating the &#8220;New  Birth.&#8221; &#8220;This,&#8221; says Boehme, &#8220;is the noble  precious Stone <A NAME="an_iii.vi-p103.1"></A>  <i>(Lapis Philosophorum),</i>     the Philosopher&#8217;s Stone, which the Magi (or  wise men) find which   <i>tinctureth nature,</i>    and generateth a new son in the old. He who findeth that, esteemeth  more highly of it than of this (outward) world. For the Son is many  thousand times greater than the Father.&#8221; Again, &#8220;If you  take the   <i>spirit</i>    of the tincture, then indeed you go on a way in which   <i>many have found</i>    Sol; but they have followed on the way to   <i>the heart</i>    of Sol, where the spirit of the heavenly tincture hath laid hold on   <i>them,</i>    and brought them into the liberty, into the Majesty, where they have   <i>Known</i>    the Noble Stone, <A NAME="an_iii.vi-p103.2"></A>  <i>Lapis Philosophorum,</i>     the Philosopher&#8217;s Stone, and have stood amazed  at man&#8217;s blindness, and seen his labouring in vain. Would you  fain find the Noble Stone? Behold, we will show it you plain enough,  if you be a   <i>Magus,</i>    and worthy, else you shall remain blind still: therefore fall to work  thus: for it hath no more but   <i>three numbers.</i>    First tell from   <i>one</i>    till you come to the Cross, which is ten (X) . . . and   <i>there</i>    lieth the   <i>Stone</i>    without any great painstaking, for it is pure and not defiled with  any earthly nature.&#8221;</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p104"></A>&#8220;In this stone there lieth hidden, whatsoever  God and the Eternity, also heaven, the stars and elements contain and  are able to do. There never was from eternity anything better or more  precious than this, and it is offered by God and bestowed upon man;  every one may have it . . . it is in a simple form, and hath the power  of the whole Deity in it.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_297"></A><A HREF="#fn_297"><FONT SIZE="1">298</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p106"></A>Boehme is here using alchemic symbols, according to  his custom, in a loose and artistic manner; for the true Hermetic  Philosopher&#8217;s Stone is not something which can be found but  something which must be made. The alchemists, whether their search be  for a physical or a spiritual &#8220;tincture,&#8221; say always that  this tincture is the product of the furnace and Athanor: and further  that it is composed of &#8220;three numbers&#8221; or elements, which  they call Sulphur, Salt, and Mercury. These, when found, and forced  into the proper combination, form the &#8220;Azoth&#8221; or  &#8220;Philosopher&#8217;s Egg&#8221;&#8212;the stuff or First Matter  of the Great Work. Sulphur, Salt, <a name="page_145"><font size="1" color="green">p. 145</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.vi-Page_145"></A> and  Mercury, however, must not be understood in too literal a sense.  &#8220;You need not look for our metallic seed among the  elements,&#8221; says Basil the Monk, &#8220;it need not be sought so  far back. If you can only rectify the Mercury, Sulphur, and Salt  (understand   <i>those of the sages)</i>    until the metallic spirit and body are inseparably joined together by  means of the metallic soul, you thereby firmly rivet the chain of love  and prepare the palace for the Coronation.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_298"></A><A HREF="#fn_298"><FONT SIZE="1">299</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p108"></A>Of these three ingredients, the important one is the  spiritual principle, the unseizable Mercury; which is far from being  the metal which we ordinarily know by that name. The Mercury which the  alchemists sought&#8212;often in strange places&#8212;is a hidden and  powerful substance. They call it &#8220;Mercury of the Wise&#8221;;  and he who can discover it, they say, is on the way towards success.  The reader in search of mystical wisdom already begins to be  bewildered; but if he persevere in this labyrinth of symbolism, he  presently discovers&#8212;as Basil the Monk indeed hints&#8212;that  the Sulphur and the Salt, or &#8220;metallic soul and body&#8221; of  the spiritual chemistry, represent something analogous to the body and  mind of man&#8212;Sulphur his earthly nature, seasoned with  intellectual Salt. The Mercury is Spirit in its most mystic sense, the  Synteresis or holy Dweller in the Innermost, the immanent spark or  Divine Principle of his life. Only the &#8220;wise,&#8221; the  mystically awakened, can know this Mercury, the agent of man&#8217;s  transmutation: and until it has been discovered, brought out of the  hiddenness, nothing can be done. &#8220;This Mercury or Snowy  Splendour, is a Celestial Body drawn from the beams of the Sun and the  Moon. It is the only Agent in the world for this art.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_299"></A><A HREF="#fn_299"><FONT SIZE="1">300</FONT></A>
    It is the divine-human &#8220;spark of the soul,&#8221; the bridge  between Gold and Silver, God and man.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p110"></A>The Three Principles being enclosed in the vessel, or  Athanor, which is man himself, and subjected to a gentle  fire&#8212;the <A NAME="an_iii.vi-p110.1"></A>  <i>Incendium Amoris</i>    &#8212;the process of the Great Work, the mystic  transmutation of natural into spiritual man, can begin. This work,  like the ingredients which compose it, has &#8220;three  numbers&#8221;: and the first matter, in the course of its  transmutation, assumes three successive colours: the Black, the White,  and the Red. These three colours are clearly analogous to the three  traditional stages of the Mystic Way: Purgation, Illumination,  Union.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p111"></A>The alchemists call the first stage, or Blackness,  Putrefaction. In it the three principles which compose the  &#8220;whole man&#8221; of body, soul and spirit, are  &#8220;sublimated&#8221; till they appear as a black powder full of  corruption, and the imperfect body is &#8220;dissolved and purified by  subtle Mercury&#8221;; as man is purified by the darkness, <a name="page_146"><font size="1" color="green">p. 146</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.vi-Page_146"></A> misery, and despair which follows the  emergence of his spiritual consciousness. As psychic uproar and  disorder seems part of the process of mental growth, so &#8220;  <A NAME="an_iii.vi-p111.1"></A>   <i>Solve et coagula</i>     &#8221;&#8212;break down that you may build  up&#8212;is the watchword of the spiritual alchemist. The &#8220;black  beast,&#8221; the passional element, of the lower nature must emerge  and be dealt with before anything further can be done. &#8220;There is  a black beast in our forest,&#8221; says the highly allegorical  &#8220;Book of Lambspring,&#8221; &#8220;his name is Putrefaction, his  blackness is called the Head of the Raven; when it is cut off,  Whiteness appears.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_300"></A><A HREF="#fn_300"><FONT SIZE="1">301</FONT></A>
    This Whiteness, the state of Luna, or Silver, the &#8220;chaste and  immaculate Queen,&#8221; is the equivalent of the Illuminative Way:  the highest point which the mystic can attain short of union with the  Absolute. This White Stone is pure, and precious; but in it the Great  Work of man&#8217;s spiritual evolution has not yet reached its term.  That term is the attainment of the Red, the colour of Perfection or  alchemic gold; a process sometimes called the &#8220;Marriage of Luna  and Sol&#8221;&#8212;the fusion of the human and divine spirit. Under  this image is concealed the final secret of the mystic life: that  ineffable union of finite and infinite&#8212;that loving reception of  the inflowing vitality of God&#8212;from which comes forth the   <i>Magnum Opus:</i>    deified or spiritual man.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p113"></A>&#8220;This,&#8221; says the author of &#8220;A  Suggestive Enquiry,&#8221; &#8220;is the union supersentient, the  nuptials sublime, <A NAME="an_iii.vi-p113.1"></A>  <i>Mentis et Universi</i>       . . . .    Lo! behold I will open to thee a mystery, cries the Adept, the  bridegroom crowneth the bride of the north [  <i>i.e.</i>   , she who comes out of the cold and darkness of the lower nature]. In  the darkness of the north, out of the crucifixion of the cerebral  life, when the sensual dominant is occultated in the Divine Fiat, and  subdued, there arises a Light wonderfully about the summit, which  wisely returned and multiplied according to the Divine Blessing, is  made substantial in life.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_301"></A><A HREF="#fn_301"><FONT SIZE="1">302</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p115"></A>I have said, that side by side with the metallic and  planetary language of the alchemists, runs a strange heraldic  symbolism in which they take refuge when they fear&#8212;generally  without reason&#8212;that they are telling their secrets too plainly  to an unregenerate world. Many of these heraldic emblems are used in  an utterly irresponsible manner; and whilst doubtless conveying a  meaning to the individual alchemist and the disciples for whom he  wrote, are, and must ever be, unintelligible to other men. But others  are of a more general application; and appear so frequently in  seventeenth-century literature, whether mystical or non-mystical, that  some discussion of them may well be of use.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p116"></A>Perhaps the quaintest and most celebrated of all these  allegories <a name="page_147"><font size="1" color="green">p. 147</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.vi-Page_147"></A> is that which describes the  quest of the Philosopher&#8217;s Stone as &#8220;the hunting of the  Green Lion.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_302"></A><A HREF="#fn_302"><FONT SIZE="1">303</FONT></A>
    The Green Lion, though few would divine it, is the First Matter of  the Great Work: hence, in spiritual alchemy, natural man in his  wholeness&#8212;Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury in their crude state. He is  called green because, seen from the transcendent standpoint, he is  still unripe, his latent powers undeveloped; and a Lion, because of  his strength, fierceness, and virility. Here the common opinion that a  pious effeminacy, a diluted and amiable spirituality, is the proper  raw material of the mystic life, is emphatically contradicted. It is  not by the education of the lamb, but by the hunting and taming of the  wild intractable lion, instinct with vitality, full of ardour and  courage, exhibiting heroic qualities on the sensual plane, that the  Great Work is achieved. The lives of the saints enforce the same  law.</p>   <blockquote><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p117.1"></A> &#8220;Our lyon wanting maturitie<br>   Is called greene for his unripeness trust me:<br>   And yet full quickly he can run,<br>   And soon can overtake the Sun.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_303"></A><A HREF="#fn_303"><FONT SIZE="1">304</FONT></A>
  <br>  </blockquote>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p119"></A>The Green Lion, then, in his strength and wholeness is  the only creature potentially able to attain Perfection. It needs the  adoption and purification of all the wealth and resources of  man&#8217;s nature, not merely the encouragement of his transcendental  tastes, if he is to &#8220;overtake the Sun&#8221; and achieve the  Great Work. The Kingdom of Heaven is taken by violence, not by amiable  aspiration. &#8220;The Green Lion,&#8221; says one alchemist,  &#8220;is the priest by whom Sol and Luna are wed.&#8221; In other  words, the raw stuff of indomitable human nature is the means by which  man is to attain union with the Absolute. The duty of the alchemist,  the transmuting process, is therefore described as the hunting of the  Green Lion through the forest of the sensual world. He, like the Hound  of Heaven, is on a love chase down the nights and down the days.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p120"></A>When the lion is caught, when Destiny overtakes it,  its head must be cut off as the preliminary to the necessary taming  process. This is called by the alchemists &#8220;the head of the  Raven,&#8221; the Crow, or the Vulture, &#8220;for its  blackness.&#8221; It represents the fierce and corrupt life of the  passions: and its removal is that &#8220;death of the lower  nature&#8221; which is the object of all asceticism&#8212;  <i>i.e.</i>   , Purgation. The lion, the whole man, Humanity in its strength, is as  it were &#8220;slain to the world,&#8221; and then resuscitated; but  in a very different shape. By its passage through this mystic death or  the &#8220;putrefaction <a name="page_148"><font size="1" color="green">p. 148</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.vi-Page_148"></A> of the Three  Principles&#8221; the &#8220;colour of unripeness&#8221; is taken  away. Its taming completed, it receives wings, wherewith it may fly up  to Sol, the Perfect or Divine; and is transmuted, say the alchemists,  into the Red Dragon. This is to us a hopelessly grotesque image: but  to the Hermetic philosophers, whose sense of wonder was uncorrupt, it  was the deeply mystical emblem of a new, strange, and transcendental  life, powerful alike in earth and in heaven. As the angel to the man,  so was the dragon to the world of beasts: a creature of splendour and  terror, a super-brute, veritably existent if seldom seen. We realize  something of the significance of this symbol for the alchemic writers,  if we remember how sacred a meaning it has for the Chinese: to whom  the dragon is the traditional emblem of free spiritual life, as the  tiger represents the life of the material plane in its intensest form.  Since it is from China that alchemy is supposed to have reached the  European world, it may yet be found that the Red Dragon is one of the  most antique and significant symbols of the Hermetic Art.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p121"></A>For the Spiritual Chemistry, then, the Red Dragon  represents Deified Man; whose emergence must always seem like the  birth of some monstrous and amazing creature when seen from the  standpoint of the merely natural world. With his coming forth, the  business of the alchemist, in so far as he be a mystic, is done. Man  has transcended his lower nature, has received wings wherewith to live  on higher levels of reality. The Tincture, the latent goldness, has  been found and made dominant, the   <i>Magnum Opus</i>    achieved. That the trite and inward business of that Work, when  stripped of its many emblematic veils, was indeed the reordering of  spiritual rather than material elements, is an opinion which rests on  a more solid foundation than personal interpretations of old  allegories and alchemic-tracts. The Norwich physician&#8212;himself  deeply read in the Hermetic science&#8212;has declared to us his own  certainty concerning it in few but lovely words. In them is contained  the true mystery of man&#8217;s eternal and interior quest of the  Stone: its reconciliation with that other, outgoing quest of  &#8220;the Hidden Treasure that desires to be found.&#8221;</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p122"></A>&#8220;Do but extract from the corpulency of bodies,  or resolve things beyond their First Matter, and you discover the  habitation of Angels: which, if I call it the ubiquitary and  omnipresent Essence of God, I hope I shall not offend Divinity.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_304"></A><A HREF="#fn_304"><FONT SIZE="1">305</FONT></A>

This movement of pure    Freedom cannot succeed unless there is an equivalent movement within    the Absolute itself.&#8221;</p></P>

<p><A NAME="an_iii.vi-p81"></A>          Professor Pratt, by no means an enthusiastic witness, most justly    observes &#8220;There are several excellent reasons why the mystics    almost inevitably make use of the language of human love in    describing the joy of the love of God. The first and simplest is    this: that they have no other language to use . . . the mystic must    make use of expressions drawn from earthly love to describe his    experience, or give up the attempt of describing it at all. It is    the only way he has of even suggesting to the non-mystical what he    has felt&#8221; (&#8220;The Religious Consciousness,&#8221; p.    418).</p></P>
