<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p1"></A>In<A NAME="an_iii.v-p1.1"></A> the last chapter we tried to establish a distinction between the  mystic who tastes supreme experience and the mystical philosopher who  cogitates upon the data so obtained. We have now, however, to take  account of the fact that often the true mystic is also a mystical  philosopher; though there are plenty of mystical philosophers who are  not and could never be mystics.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p2"></A>Because it is characteristic of the human self to  reflect upon its experience, to use its percepts as material for the  construction of a concept, most mystics have made or accepted a theory  of their own adventures. Thus we have a mystical philosophy or  theology&#8212;the comment of the intellect on the proceedings of  spiritual intuition&#8212;running side by side with true or empirical  mysticism: classifying its data, criticizing it, explaining it, and  translating its vision of the supersensible into symbols which are  amenable to dialectic.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p3"></A>Such a philosophy is most usually founded upon the  formal creed which the individual mystic accepts. It is characteristic  of him that in so far as his transcendental activities are healthy he  is generally an acceptor and not a rejector of such creeds. The view  which regards the mystic as a spiritual anarchist receives little  support from history; which shows us, again and again, <a name="page_96"><font size="1" color="green">p. 96</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.v-Page_96"></A> the great mystics as faithful sons of the great  religions. Almost any religious system which fosters unearthly love is  potentially a nursery for mystics: and Christianity, Islam,  Brahmanism, and Buddhism each receives its most sublime interpretation  at their hands. Thus St. Teresa interprets her ecstatic apprehension  of the Godhead in strictly Catholic terms, and St. John of the Cross  contrives to harmonize his intense transcendentalism with  incarnational and sacramental Christianity. Thus Boehme believed to  the last that his explorations of eternity were consistent with the  teaching of the Lutheran Church. The Sufis were good Mohammedans,  Philo and the Kabalists were orthodox Jews. Plotinus even  adapted&#8212;though with what difficulty&#8212;the relics of paganism  to his doctrine of the Real.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p4"></A>Attempts, however, to limit mystical truth&#8212;the  direct apprehension of the Divine Substance&#8212;by the formula of  any one religion, are as futile as the attempt to identify a precious  metal with the die which converts it into current coin. The dies which  the mystics have used are many. Their peculiarities and excrescences  are always interesting and sometimes highly significant. Some give a  far sharper, more coherent, impression than others. But the gold from  which this diverse coinage is struck is always the same precious  metal: always the same Beatific Vision of a Goodness, Truth, and  Beauty which is   <i>one.</i>    Hence its substance must always be distinguished from the accidents  under which we perceive it: for this substance has an absolute, and  not a denominational, importance.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p5"></A>Nevertheless, if we are to understand the language of  the mystics, it is evident that we must know a little of accident as  well as of substance: that is to say, of the principal philosophies or  religions which they have used in describing their adventures to the  world. This being so, before we venture to apply ourselves to the  exploration of theology proper, it will be well to consider the two  extreme forms under which both mystics and theologians have been  accustomed to conceive Divine Reality: that is to say, the so-called  &#8220;emanation-theory&#8221; and &#8220;immanence-theory&#8221; of  the transcendental world.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p6"></A>Emanation and Immanence are formidable words; which  though perpetually tossed to and fro by amateurs of religious  philosophy, have probably, as they stand, little actuality for  practical modern men. They are, however, root-ideas for the maker of  mystical diagrams: and his best systems are but attempts towards their  reconciliation. Since the aim of every mystic is union with God, it is  obvious that the vital question in his philosophy must be the place  which this God, the Absolute of his quest, occupies in the scheme.  Briefly, He has been conceived&#8212;or, it were better to say, <a name="page_97"><font size="1" color="green">p. 97</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.v-Page_97"></A> presented&#8212;by the great mystics under two  apparently contradictory modes.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p7"></A>(1) The opinion which is represented in its most  extreme form by the theory of   <i>Emanations,</i>    declares His utter transcendence. This view appears early in the  history of Greek philosophy. It is developed by Dionysius, by the  Kabalists, by Dante: and is implied in the language of Rulman Merswin,  St. John of the Cross and many other Christian ecstatics.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p8"></A>The solar system is an almost perfect symbol of this  concept of Reality; which finds at once its most rigid and most  beautiful expression in Dante&#8217;s &#8220;Paradiso.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_181"></A><A HREF="#fn_181"><FONT SIZE="1">182</FONT></A>
    The Absolute Godhead is conceived as removed by a vast distance from  the material world of sense; the last or lowest of that system of  dependent worlds or states which, generated by or emanating from the  Unity or Central Sun, become less in spirituality and splendour,  greater in multiplicity, the further they recede from their source.  That Source&#8212;the Great Countenance of the Godhead&#8212;can  never, say the Kabalists, be discerned by man. It is the Absolute of  the Neoplatonists, the Unplumbed Abyss of later mysticism: the Cloud  of Unknowing wraps it from our sight. Only by its  &#8220;emanations&#8221; or manifested attributes can we attain  knowledge of it. By the outflow of these same manifested attributes  and powers the created universe exists, depending in the last resort  on the <A NAME="an_iii.v-p12.1"></A>   <i>latens Deitas:</i>     Who is therefore conceived as external to the world  which He illuminates and vivifies.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p13"></A>St. Thomas Aquinas virtually accepts the doctrine of  Emanations when he writes:  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_182"></A><A HREF="#fn_182"><FONT SIZE="1">183</FONT></A>
    &#8220;As all the perfections of Creatures descend in order from God,  who is the height of perfection, man should begin from the lower  creatures and ascend by degrees, and so advance to the knowledge of  God. . . . And because in that roof and crown of all things, God, we  find the most perfect unity, and everything is stronger and more  excellent the more thoroughly it is one; it follows that diversity and  variety increase in things, the further they are removed from Him who  is the first principle of all.&#8221; Suso, whose mystical system,  like that of most Dominicans, is entirely consistent with Thomist  philosophy, is really glossing Aquinas when he writes: &#8220;The  supreme and superessential Spirit has ennobled man by illuminating him  with a ray from the Eternal Godhead. . . . Hence from out the great  ring which represents the <a name="page_98"><font size="1" color="green">p. 98</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.v-Page_98"></A> Eternal  Godhead there flow forth . . . little rings, which may be taken to  signify the high nobility of natural creatures.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_183"></A><A HREF="#fn_183"><FONT SIZE="1">184</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p16"></A>Obviously, if this theory of the Absolute be accepted  the path of the soul&#8217;s ascent to union with the divine must be  literally a transcendence: a journey &#8220;upward and outward,&#8221;  through a long series of intermediate states or worlds till, having  traversed the &#8220;Thirty-two paths of the Tree of Life,&#8221; she  at last arrives, in Kabalistic language, at the Crown: fruitive  knowledge of God, the Abyss or Divine Dark of the Dionysian school,  the Neoplatonic One. Such a series of worlds is symbolized by the Ten  Heavens of Dante, the hierarchies of Dionysius, the Tree of Life or  Sephiroth of the Kabalah: and receives its countersign in the inward  experience, in the long journey of the self through Purgation and  Illumination to Union. &#8220;We ascend,&#8221; says St. Augustine,  &#8220;thy ways that be in our heart, and sing a song of degrees; we  glow inwardly with thy fire, with thy good fire, and we go, because we  go upwards to the peace of Jerusalem.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_184"></A><A HREF="#fn_184"><FONT SIZE="1">185</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p18"></A>This theory postulates, under normal and non-mystical  conditions, the complete separation of the human and the divine; the  temporal and the eternal worlds. &#8220;Never forget,&#8221; says St.  John of the Cross, &#8220;that God is inaccessible. Ask not therefore  how far your powers may comprehend Him, your feeling penetrate Him.  Fear thus to content yourself with too little, and deprive your soul  of the agility which it needs in order to mount up to Him.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_185"></A><A HREF="#fn_185"><FONT SIZE="1">186</FONT></A>
    The language of pilgrimage, of exile, comes naturally to the mystic  who apprehends reality under these terms. To him the mystical  adventure is essentially a &#8220;going forth&#8221; from his normal  self and from his normal universe. Like the Psalmist &#8220;in his  heart he hath disposed to ascend by steps in this vale of tears&#8221;  from the less to the more divine. He, and with him the  Cosmos&#8212;for to mystical philosophy the soul of the individual  subject is the microcosm of the soul of the world&#8212;has got to  retrace the long road to the Perfection from which it originally came  forth; as the fish in Rulman Merswin&#8217;s Vision of Nine Rocks must  struggle upwards from pool to pool until they reach their Origin.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p20"></A>Such a way of conceiving Reality accords with the type  of mind which William James called the &#8220;sick soul.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_186"></A><A HREF="#fn_186"><FONT SIZE="1">187</FONT></A>
    It is the mood of the penitent; of the utter humility which, appalled  by the sharp contrast between itself and the Perfect which it  contemplates, can only cry &#8220;out of the depths.&#8221; It comes  naturally to the temperament which leans to pessimism, which sees a  &#8220;great gulf fixed&#8221; between itself and its desire, and is  above all things sensitive <a name="page_99"><font size="1" color="green">p. 99</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.v-Page_99"></A> to the  elements of evil and imperfection in its own character and in the  normal experience of man. Permitting these elements to dominate its  field of consciousness, wholly ignoring the divine aspect of the World  of Becoming, such a temperament constructs from its perceptions and  prejudices the concept of a material world and a normal self which are  very far from God.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p22"></A>(2)   <i>Immanence.</i>    At the opposite pole from this way of sketching Reality is the  extreme theory of Immanence, which plays so large a part in modern  theology. To the holders of this theory, who commonly belong to  James&#8217;s &#8220;healthy minded&#8221; or optimistic class, the  quest of the Absolute is no long journey, but a realization of  something which is implicit in the self and in the universe: an  opening of the eyes of the soul upon the Reality in which it is  bathed. For them earth is literally &#8220;crammed with heaven.&#8221;  &#8220;Thou wert I, but dark was my heart, I knew not the secret  transcendent,&#8221; says T&eacute;wekkul B&eacute;g, a Moslem mystic of  the seventeenth century.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_187"></A><A HREF="#fn_187"><FONT SIZE="1">188</FONT></A>
    This is always the cry of the temperament which leans to a theology  of immanence, once its eyes are opened on the light.  &#8220;God,&#8221; says Plotinus, &#8220;is not external to anyone,  but is present with all things, though they are ignorant that He is  so.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_188"></A><A HREF="#fn_188"><FONT SIZE="1">189</FONT></A>
    In other and older words, &#8220;The Spirit of God is within  you.&#8221; The Absolute Whom all seek does not hold Himself aloof  from an imperfect material universe, but dwells within the flux of  things: stands as it were at the very threshold of consciousness and  knocks awaiting the self&#8217;s slow discovery of her treasures.  &#8220;He is not far from any one of us, for in Him we live and move  and have our being,&#8221; is the pure doctrine of Immanence: a  doctrine whose teachers are drawn from amongst the souls which react  more easily to the touch of the Divine than to the sense of alienation  and of sin, and are naturally inclined to love rather than to awe.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p25"></A>Unless safeguarded by limiting dogmas, the theory of  Immanence, taken alone, is notoriously apt to degenerate into  pantheism; and into those extravagant perversions of the doctrine of  &#8220;deification&#8221; in which the mystic holds his transfigured  self to be identical with the Indwelling God. It is the philosophical  basis of that practice of introversion, the turning inward of the  soul&#8217;s faculties in contemplation, which has been the  &#8220;method&#8221; of the great practical mystics of all creeds.  That God, since He is in all&#8212;in a sense,   <i>is</i>    all&#8212;may most easily be found within ourselves, is the doctrine  of these adventurers;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_189"></A><A HREF="#fn_189"><FONT SIZE="1">190</FONT></A>
    who, denying or ignoring the existence of those intervening  &#8220;worlds&#8221; or &#8220;planes&#8221; between the material  <a name="page_100"><font size="1" color="green">p. 100</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.v-Page_100"></A> world and the Absolute, which are  postulated by the theory of Emanations, claim with Ruysbroeck that  &#8220;by a simple introspection in fruitive love&#8221; they  &#8220;meet God without intermediary.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_190"></A><A HREF="#fn_190"><FONT SIZE="1">191</FONT></A>
    They hear the Father of Lights &#8220;saying eternally, without  intermediary or interruption, in the most secret part of the spirit,  the one, unique, and abysmal Word.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_191"></A><A HREF="#fn_191"><FONT SIZE="1">192</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p29"></A>This discovery of a &#8220;divine&#8221; essence or  substance, dwelling, as Ruysbroeck says, at the apex of man&#8217;s  soul is that fundamental experience&#8212;found in some form or degree  in all genuine mystical religion&#8212;which provides the basis of the  New Testament doctrine of the indwelling spirit. It is, variously  interpreted, the &#8220;spark of the soul&#8221; of Eckhart, the  &#8220;ground&#8221; of Tauler, the Inward Light of the Quakers, the  &#8220;Divine Principle&#8221; of some modern transcendentalists; the  fount and source of all true life. At this point logical exposition  fails mystic and theologian alike. A tangle of metaphors takes its  place. We are face to face with the &#8220;wonder of  wonders&#8221;&#8212;that most real, yet most mysterious, of all the  experiences of religion, the union of human and divine, in a nameless   <i>something</i>    which is &#8220;great enough to be God, small enough to be me.&#8221;  In the struggle to describe this experience, the &#8220;spark of the  soul,&#8221; the point of juncture, is at one moment presented to us  as the divine to which the self attains: at another, as that  transcendental aspect of the self which is in contact with God. On  either hypothesis, it is here that the mystic encounters Absolute  Being. Here is his guarantee of God&#8217;s immediate presence in the  human heart; and, if in the human heart, then in that universe of  which man&#8217;s soul resumes in miniature the essential  characteristics.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p30"></A>According to the doctrine of Immanence, creation, the  universe, could we see it as it is, would be perceived as the  self-development, the self-revelation of this indwelling Deity. The  world is not projected from the Absolute, but immersed in God.  &#8220;I understood,&#8221; says St. Teresa, &#8220;how our Lord was  in all things, and how He was in the soul: and the illustration of a  sponge filled with water was suggested to me.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_192"></A><A HREF="#fn_192"><FONT SIZE="1">193</FONT></A>
    The world-process, then, is the slow coming to fruition of that  Divine Spark which is latent alike in the Cosmos and in man.  &#8220;If,&#8221; says Boehme, &#8220;thou conceivest a small minute  circle, as small as a grain of mustard seed, yet the Heart of God is  wholly and perfectly therein: and if thou art born in God, then there  is in thyself (in the circle of thy life) the whole <a name="page_101"><font size="1" color="green">p. 101</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.v-Page_101"></A> Heart of God undivided.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_193"></A><A HREF="#fn_193"><FONT SIZE="1">194</FONT></A>
    The idea of Immanence has seldom been more beautifully expressed.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p33"></A>It is worth noticing that both the theological  doctrines of reality which have been acceptable to the mystics  implicitly declare, as science does, that the universe is not static  but dynamic; a World of Becoming. According to the doctrine of  Immanence this universe is free, self-creative. The divine action  floods it: no part is more removed from the Godhead than any other  part. &#8220;God,&#8221; says Eckhart, &#8220;is nearer to me than I  am to myself; He is just as near to wood and stone, but they do not  know it.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_194"></A><A HREF="#fn_194"><FONT SIZE="1">195</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p35"></A>These two apparently contradictory explanations of the  Invisible have both been held, and that in their extreme form, by the  mystics: who have found in both adequate, and indeed necessary,  diagrams by which to suggest something of their rich experience of  Reality.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_195"></A><A HREF="#fn_195"><FONT SIZE="1">196</FONT></A>
    Some of the least lettered and most inspired amongst them&#8212;for  instance, St. Catherine of Siena, Julian of Norwich&#8212;and some of  the most learned, as Dionysius the Areopagite and Meister Eckhart,  have actually used in their rhapsodies language appropriate to both  the theories of Emanation and of Immanence. It would seem, then, that  both these theories convey a certain truth; and that it is the  business of a sound mystical philosophy to reconcile them. It is too  often forgotten by quarrelsome partisans of a concrete turn of mind  that at best all these transcendental theories are only symbols,  methods, diagrams; feebly attempting the representation of an  experience which in its fullness is always the same, and of which the  dominant characteristic is ineffability. Hence they insist with  tiresome monotony that Dionysius must be wrong if Tauler be right:  that it is absurd to call yourself the Friend of God if unknowableness  be that God&#8217;s first attribute: that Plato&#8217;s Perfect Beauty  and St. Catherine of Siena&#8217;s Accepter of Sacrifices cannot be  the same: that the &#8220;courteous and dear-worthy Lord&#8221; who  said to Lady Julian, &#8220;My darling, I am glad that thou art come  to Me, in all thy woe I have ever been with thee,&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_196"></A><A HREF="#fn_196"><FONT SIZE="1">197</FONT></A>
    rules out the formless and impersonal One of Plotinus, the  &#8220;triple circle&#8221; of Suso and Dante. Finally, that if God be  truly immanent in the material world it is either sin or folly to  refuse that world in order that we may find Him; and if introversion  be right, a plan of the universe which postulates intervening planes  between Absolute Being and the phenomenal world must be wrong.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p38"></A>Now as regards the mystics, of whom we hold both these  <a name="page_102"><font size="1" color="green">p. 102</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.v-Page_102"></A> doctrines, these ways of seeing  truth&#8212;for what else is a doctrine but that?&#8212;it is well to  remind ourselves that their teaching about the relation of the  Absolute to the finite, of God to the phenomenal world, must be  founded in the first instance on what they know by experience of the  relation between that Absolute and the individual self. This  experience is the valid part of mysticism, the thing which gives to it  its unique importance amongst systems of thought, the only source of  its knowledge. Everything else is really guessing aided by analogy.  When therefore the mystic, applying to the universe what he knows to  be true in respect of his own soul, describes Divine Perfection as  very far removed from the material world, yet linked with it by a  graduated series of &#8220;emanations&#8221;&#8212;states or qualities  which have each of them something of the godlike, though they be not  God&#8212;he is trying to describe the necessary life-process which he  has himself passed through in the course of his purgation and  spiritual ascent from the state of the &#8220;natural man&#8221; to  that other state of harmony with the spiritual universe, sometimes  called &#8220;deification,&#8221; in which he is able to contemplate,  and unite with, the divine. We have in the &#8220;Divina  Commedia&#8221; a classic example of such a twofold vision of the  inner and the outer worlds: for Dante&#8217;s journey up and out to  the Empyrean Heaven is really an inward alchemy, an ordering and  transmuting of his nature, a purging of his spiritual sight  till&#8212;transcending all derived beatitude&#8212;it can look for an  instant on the Being of God.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p39"></A>The mystic assumes&#8212;because he tends to assume an  orderly basis for things&#8212;that there is a relation, an analogy,  between this microcosm of man&#8217;s self and the macrocosm of the  world-self. Hence his experience, the geography of the individual  quest, appears to him good evidence of the geography of the Invisible.  Since he must transcend his natural life in order to attain  consciousness of God, he conceives of God as essentially transcendent  to the natural world. His description of that geography,  however&#8212;of his path in a land where there is no time and space,  no inner and no outer, up or down&#8212;will be conditioned by his  temperament, by his powers of observation, by the metaphor which comes  most readily to his hand, above all by his theological education. The  so-called journey itself is a psychological and spiritual experience:  the purging and preparation of the self, its movement to higher levels  of consciousness, its unification with that more spiritual but  normally unconscious self which is in touch with the transcendental  order, and its gradual or abrupt entrance into union with the Real.  Sometimes it seems to the self that this performance is a retreat  inwards to that &#8220;ground of the soul&#8221; where, as St. Teresa  says, &#8220;His Majesty awaits us&#8221;: sometimes <a name="page_103"><font size="1" color="green">p. 103</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.v-Page_103"></A> a going forth from the Conditioned to the  Unconditioned, the &#8220;supernatural flight&#8221; of Plotinus and  Dionysius the Areopagite. Both are but images under which the self  conceives the process of attaining conscious union with that God who  is &#8220;at once immanent and transcendent in relation to the Soul  which shares His life.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_197"></A><A HREF="#fn_197"><FONT SIZE="1">198</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p41"></A>He has got to find God. Sometimes his temperament  causes him to lay most stress on the length of the search; sometimes  the abrupt rapture which brings it to a close makes him forget that  preliminary pilgrimage in which the soul is &#8220;not outward bound  but rather on a journey to its centre.&#8221; The habitations of the  Interior Castle through which St. Teresa leads us to that hidden  chamber which is the sanctuary of the indwelling God: the hierarchies  of Dionysius, ascending from the selfless service of the angels, past  the seraphs&#8217; burning love, to the God enthroned above time and  space: the mystical paths of the Kabalistic Tree of Life which lead  from the material world of Malkuth through the universes of action and  thought, by Mercy, Justice and Beauty, to the Supernal Crown;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_198"></A><A HREF="#fn_198"><FONT SIZE="1">199</FONT></A>
    all these are different ways of describing this same pilgrimage.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p43"></A>As every one is born a disciple of either Plato or  Aristotle, so every human soul leans to one of these two ways of  apprehending reality. The artist, the poet, every one who looks with  awe and rapture on created things, acknowledges in this act the  Immanent God. The ascetic, and that intellectual ascetic the  metaphysician, turning from the created, denying the senses in order  to find afar off the uncreated, unconditioned Source, is  really&#8212;though often he knows it not&#8212;obeying that  psychological law which produced the doctrine of Emanations.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p44"></A>A good map then, a good mystical philosophy, will  leave room for both these ways of interpreting our experience. It will  mark the routes by which many different temperaments claim to have  found their way to the same end. It will acknowledge both the aspects  under which the <A NAME="an_iii.v-p44.1"></A>  <i>patria splendida</i>     Truth has appeared to its lovers: the aspects which  have called forth the theories of emanation and immanence and are  enshrined in the Greek and Latin names of God.   <i>Deus,</i>    whose root means day, shining, the Transcendent Light; and   <i>Theos,</i>    whose true meaning is supreme desire or prayer&#8212;the Inward  Love&#8212;do not contradict, but complete each other. They form, when  taken together, an almost perfect definition of that Godhead which is  the object of the mystic&#8217;s desire: the Divine Love which,  immanent in the soul spurs on that soul to union with the transcendent  and Absolute <a name="page_104"><font size="1" color="green">p. 104</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.v-Page_104"></A> Light&#8212;at once the  source, the goal, the life of created things.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p45"></A>The true mystic&#8212;the person with a genius for  God&#8212;hardly needs a map himself. He steers a compass course  across the &#8220;vast and stormy sea of the divine.&#8221; It is  characteristic of his intellectual humility, however, that he is  commonly willing to use the map of the community in which he finds  himself, when it comes to showing other people the route which he has  pursued. Sometimes these maps have been adequate. More, they have  elucidated the obscure wanderings of the explorer; helped him; given  him landmarks; worked out right. Time after time he puts his finger on  some spot&#8212;some great hill of vision, some city of the  soul&#8212;and says with conviction,   <i>&#8220;Here</i>    have I been.&#8221; At other times the maps have embarrassed him,  have refused to fit in with his description. Then he has tried, as  Boehme did and after him Blake, to make new ones. Such maps are often  wild in drawing, because good draughtsmanship does not necessarily go  with a talent for exploration. Departing from the usual convention,  they are hard&#8212;sometimes impossible&#8212;to understand. As a  result, the orthodox have been forced to regard their makers as madmen  or heretics: when they were really only practical men struggling to  disclose great matters by imperfect means.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p46"></A>Without prejudice to individual beliefs, and without  offering an opinion as to the exclusive truth of any one religious  system or revelation&#8212;for here we are concerned neither with  controversy nor with apologetics&#8212;we are bound to allow as a  historical fact that mysticism, so far, has found its best map in  Christianity. Christian philosophy, especially that Neoplatonic  theology which, taking up and harmonizing all that was best in the  spiritual intuitions of Greece, India, and Egypt, was developed by the  great doctors of the early and mediaeval Church, supports and  elucidates the revelations of the individual mystic as no other system  of thought has been able to do.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p47"></A>We owe to the great fathers of the first five  centuries&#8212;to Clement of Alexandria and Irenaeus, Gregory of  Nyssa and Augustine; above all to Dionysius the Areopagite, the great  Christian contemporary of Proclus&#8212;the preservation of that  mighty system of scaffolding which enabled the Catholic mystics to  build up the towers and bulwarks of the City of God. The peculiar  virtue of this Christian philosophy, that which marks its superiority  to the more coldly self-consistent systems of Greece, is the fact that  it re-states the truths of metaphysics in terms of personality: thus  offering a third term, a &#8220;living mediator&#8221; between the  Unknowable God, the unconditioned Absolute, and the conditioned self.  This was the priceless gift which the Wise Men <a name="page_105"><font size="1" color="green">p. 105</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.v-Page_105"></A> received in return for their gold,  frankincense, and myrrh. This solves the puzzle which all explorers of  the supersensible have sooner or later to face: <A NAME="an_iii.v-p47.1"></A>   <i>come si convenne l&#8217;imago al cerchio,</i>      &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_199"></A><A HREF="#fn_199"><FONT SIZE="1">200</FONT></A>
    the reconciliation of Infinite and intimate, both known and felt, but  neither understood. Such a third term, such a stepping-stone, was  essential if mysticism were ever to attain that active union that  fullness of life which is its object, and develop from a blind and  egoistic rapture into fruitful and self-forgetting love.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p49"></A>Where non-Christian mystics, as a rule, have made a  forced choice between the two great dogmatic expressions of their  experience, (  <i>a</i>   ) the long pilgrimage towards a transcendent and unconditioned  Absolute, (  <i>b</i>   ) the discovery of that Absolute in the &#8220;ground&#8221; or  spiritual principle of the self; it has been possible to Christianity,  by means of her central doctrine of the Trinity, to find room for both  of them and to exhibit them as that which they are in fact&#8212;the  complementary parts of a whole. Even Dionysius, the godfather of the  emanation doctrine, combines with his scheme of descending hierarchies  the dogma of an indwelling God: and no writer is more constantly  quoted by Meister Eckhart, who is generally considered to have  preached immanence in its most extreme and pantheistic form.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p50"></A>Further, the Christian atmosphere is the one in which  the individual mystic has most often been able to develop his genius  in a sane and fruitful way; and an overwhelming majority of the great  European contemplatives have been Christians of a strong impassioned  and personal type. This alone would justify us in regarding it as  embodying, at any rate in the West, the substance of the true  tradition: providing the &#8220;path of least resistance&#8221;  through which that tradition flows. The very heretics of Christianity  have often owed their attraction almost wholly to the mystical element  in their teachings. The Gnostics, the Fraticelli, the Brethren of the  Free Spirit, the Quietists, the Quakers, are instances of this. In  others, it was to an excessive reliance on reason when dealing with  the suprarational, and a corresponding absence of trust in mystical  intuition that heresy was due. Arius and Pelagius are heretics of this  type.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p51"></A>The greatest mystics, however, have not been heretics  but Catholic saints. In Christianity the &#8220;natural  mysticism&#8221; which like &#8220;natural religion,&#8221; is latent  in humanity, and at a certain point of development breaks out in every  race, came to itself; and attributing for the first time true and  distinct personality to its Object, brought into focus the confused  and unconditioned God which Neoplatonism had constructed from the  abstract concepts of philosophy blended with the intuitions of Indian  ecstatics, and <a name="page_106"><font size="1" color="green">p. 106</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.v-Page_106"></A> made the basis of its  meditations on the Real. It is a truism that the chief claim of  Christian philosophy on our respect does not lie in its exclusiveness  but in its Catholicity: in the fact that it finds truth in a hundred  different systems, accepts and elucidates Greek, Jewish, and Indian  thought, fuses them in a coherent theology, and says to speculative  thinkers of every time and place, &#8220;Whom therefore ye ignorantly  worship, Him declare I unto you.&#8221;</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p52"></A>The voice of that Truth which spoke once for all on  Calvary, and there declared the ground plan of the universe, was heard  more or less perfectly by all the great seers, the intuitive leaders  of men, the possessors of genius for the Real. There are few of the  Christian names of God which were not known to the teachers of  antiquity. To the Egyptians He was the Saviour, to the Platonists the  Good, Beautiful and True, to the Stoics the Father and Companion. The  very words of the Fourth Gospel are anticipated by Cleanthes.  Heracleitus knew the Energizing Fire of which St. Bonaventura and  Mechthild of Magdeburg speak. Countless mystics, from St. Augustine to  St. John of the Cross, echo again and again the language of Plotinus.  It is true that the differentia which mark off Christianity from all  other religions are strange and poignant: but these very differentia  make of it the most perfect of settings for the mystic life. Its note  of close intimacy, of direct and personal contact with a spiritual  reality given here and now&#8212;its astonishing combination of  splendour and simplicity, of the sacramental and  transcendent&#8212;all these things minister to the needs of the  mystical type.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p53"></A>Hence the Christian system, or some colourable  imitation of it, has been found essential by almost all the great  mystics of the West. They adopt its nomenclature, explain their  adventures by the help of its creed, identify their Absolute with the  Christian God. Amongst European mystics the most usually quoted  exception to this rule is Blake; yet it is curious to notice that the  more inspired his utterance, the more passionately and dogmatically  Christian even this hater of the Churches becomes:&#8212;</p>   <blockquote><A NAME="an_iii.v-p53.1"></A> &#8220;We behold<br>   Where Death eternal is put off eternally. O Lamb<br>   Assume the dark satanic body in the Virgin&#8217;s  womb!<br>   O Lamb divine ! it cannot thee annoy! O pitying  One<br>   Thy pity is from the foundation of the world, and thy  Redemption<br>   Begins already in Eternity.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_200"></A><A HREF="#fn_200"><FONT SIZE="1">201</FONT></A>
  <br>  </blockquote>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p55"></A>This is the doctrine of the Incarnation in a nutshell:  here St. Thomas himself would find little to correct. Of the two  following extracts from &#8220;Jerusalem,&#8221; the first is but a  poet&#8217;s gloss on <a name="page_107"><font size="1" color="green">p. 107</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.v-Page_107"></A> the  Catholic&#8217;s cry, <A NAME="an_iii.v-p55.1"></A>  <i>&#8220;O felix culpa!&#8221;</i>     the second is an almost perfect epitome of Christian  theology and ethics:&#8212;</p>   <blockquote><A NAME="an_iii.v-p55.2"></A> &#8220;If I were pure, never could I taste the  sweets<br>   Of the forgiveness of sins. If I were holy I never  could behold the tears<br>   Of Love . . . O Mercy! O divine Humanity!<br>   O Forgiveness, O Pity and Compassion!

  <br>  </blockquote>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p57"></A>Whether the dogmas of Christianity be or be not  accepted on the scientific and historical plane, then, those dogmas  are necessary to an adequate description of mystical  experience&#8212;at least, of the fully developed dynamic mysticism of  the West. We must therefore be prepared in reading the works of the  contemplatives for much strictly denominational language; and shall be  wise if we preface the encounter by some consideration of this  language, and of its real meaning for those who use and believe  it.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p58"></A>No one needs, I suppose, to be told that the two chief  features of Christian schematic theology are the dogmas of the Trinity  and the Incarnation. They correlate and explain each other: forming  together, for the Christian, the &#8220;final key&#8221; to the riddle  of the world. The history of practical and institutional Christianity  is the history of the attempt to exhibit their meaning in space and  time. The history of mystical philosophy is the history&#8212;still  incomplete&#8212;of the demonstration of their meaning in  eternity.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p59"></A>Some form of Trinitarian dogma is found to be  essential, as a method of describing observed facts, the moment that  mysticism begins either (  <i>a</i>   ) to analyse its own psychological conditions, or (  <i>b</i>   ) to philosophize upon its intuitive experience of God. It must, that  is to say, divide the aspects under which it knows the Godhead, if it  is to deal with them in a fruitful or comprehensible way. The  Unconditioned One, which is, for Neoplatonic and Catholic mystic  alike, the final object of their quest, cannot of itself satisfy the  deepest instincts of humanity: for man is aware that diversity in  unity is a necessary condition if perfection of character is to be  expressed. Though the idea of unity alone may serve to define the  End&#8212;and though the mystics return to it again and again as a  relief from that &#8220;heresy of multiplicity&#8221; by which they  are oppressed&#8212;it cannot by itself be adequate to the description  of the All. <a name="page_108"><font size="1" color="green">p. 108</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.v-Page_108"></A></p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p60"></A>The first question, then, must be&#8212;How many of  such aspects are necessary to a satisfactory presentment of the  mystic&#8217;s position? How many faces of Reality does he see? We  observe that his experience involves at least a twofold apprehension.  (  <i>a</i>   ) That Holy Spirit within, that Divine Life by which his own life is  transfused and upheld, and of which he becomes increasingly conscious  as his education proceeds. (  <i>b</i>   ) That Transcendent Spirit without, the &#8220;Absolute,&#8221;  towards union with which the indwelling and increasingly dominant  spirit of love presses the developing soul. In his ecstasy, it seems  to the mystic that these two experiences of God become one. But in the  attempt to philosophize on his experiences he is bound to separate  them. Over and over again the mystics and their critics acknowledge,  explicitly or implicitly, the necessity of this discrimination for  human thought.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p61"></A>Thus even the rigid monotheism of Israel and Islam  cannot, in the hands of the Kabalists and the Sufis, get away from an  essential dualism in the mystical experience. According to the Zohar  &#8220;God is considered as immanent in all that has been created or  emanated, and yet is transcendent to all.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_202"></A><A HREF="#fn_202"><FONT SIZE="1">203</FONT></A>
    So too the Sufis. God, they say, is to be contemplated   <i>(a)</i>    outwardly in the imperfect beauties of the earth; (b) inwardly, by  meditation. Further, since He is One, and in all things, &#8220;to  conceive one&#8217;s self as separate from God is an error: yet   <i>only when one sees oneself as separate from God, can one reach out  to God.</i>   &#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_203"></A><A HREF="#fn_203"><FONT SIZE="1">204</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p64"></A>Thus Delacroix, speaking purely as a psychologist, and  denying to the mystical revelation&#8212;which he attributes  exclusively to the normal content of the subliminal mind&#8212;any  transcendental value, writes with entire approval of St. Teresa, that  she &#8220;set up externally to herself the definite God of the Bible,  at the same time as she set up within her soul the confused God of the  Pseudo-Areopagite: the One of Neoplatonism. The first is her guarantee  of the orthodoxy of the second, and prevents her from losing herself  in an indistinction which is non-Christian. The confused God within is  highly dangerous. . . . St. Teresa knew how to avoid this peril, and,  served by her rich subconscious life, by the exaltation of her mental  images, by her faculty of self-division on the one hand, on the other  by her   <i>rare powers of unification,</i>    she realized simultaneously a double state in which the two Gods [  <i>i.e.</i>   , the two ways of apprehending God, transcendence and immanence] were  guarantees of each other, mutually consolidating and enriching one  another: such is the intellectual vision of the Trinity in the Seventh  Habitation.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_204"></A><A HREF="#fn_204"><FONT SIZE="1">205</FONT></A>
    <a name="page_109"><font size="1" color="green">p. 109</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.v-Page_109"></A></p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p66"></A>It is probable that St. Teresa, confronted by this  astonishing analysis, would have objected that her Trinity, unlike  that of her eulogist, consisted of three and not two Persons. His  language concerning confused interior and orthodox exterior Gods would  certainly have appeared to her delicate and honest mind both clumsy  and untrue: nor could she have allowed that the Unconditioned One of  the Neoplatonists was an adequate description of the strictly personal  Divine Majesty, Whom she found enthroned in the inmost sanctuary of  the Castle of the Soul. What St. Teresa really did was to actualize in  her own experience, apprehend in the &#8220;ground of her soul&#8221;  by means of her extraordinarily developed transcendental perceptions,  the three distinct and personal Aspects of the Godhead which are  acknowledged by the Christian religion.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p67"></A>First, the Father, pure transcendent Being, creative  Source and Origin of all that Is: the Unconditioned and Unknowable One  of the Neoplatonists: Who is &#8220;neither This nor That&#8221; and  must be conceived,   <i>pace</i>    M. Delacroix, as utterly transcendent to the subject rather than  &#8220;set up within the soul.&#8221;</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p68"></A>Secondly, in the Person of Christ, St. Teresa isolated  and distinguished the Logos or Creative Word; the expression, or  outbirth, of the Father&#8217;s thought. Here is the point at which  the Divine Substance first becomes apprehensible by the spirit of man;  that mediating principle &#8220;raised up between heaven and  earth&#8221; which is at once the Mirror of Pure Being and the Light  of a finite world. The Second Person of the Christian Trinity is for  the believer not only the brightness or express image of Deity, but  also the personal, inexhaustible, and responsive Fount of all life and  Object of all love: Who, because of His taking up (in the Incarnation)  of humanity into the Godhead, has become the Bridge between finite and  infinite, between the individual and the Absolute Life, and hence in  mystic language the &#8220;true Bridegroom&#8221; of every human  soul.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p69"></A>Thirdly, she recognized within herself the germ of  that Absolute Life, the indwelling Spirit which is the source of  man&#8217;s transcendental consciousness and his link with the Being  of God. That is to say, the Holy Spirit of Divine Love, the Real  Desirous seeking for the Real Desired, without Whose presence any  knowledge of or communion with God on man&#8217;s part would be  inconceivable.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p70"></A>In the supreme Vision of the Trinity which was  vouchsafed to St. Teresa in the Seventh Habitation of the soul, these  three aspects became fused in One. In the deepest recesses of her  spirit, in that abyss where selfhood ceases to have meaning, and the  individual soul touches the life of the All, distinction vanished and  she &#8220;saw God in a point.&#8221; Such an experience, such an  intuition of simple and undifferentiated Godhead&#8212;the  Unity&#8212;beyond <a name="page_110"><font size="1" color="green">p. 110</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.v-Page_110"></A> those three centres  of Divine Consciousness which we call the Trinity of Persons, is  highly characteristic of mysticism. The German  mystics&#8212;temperamentally miles asunder from St.  Teresa&#8212;described it as the attainment of the &#8220;still  wilderness&#8221; or &#8220;lonely desert of Deity&#8221;: the  limitless Divine Abyss, impersonal, indescribable, for ever hid in the  Cloud of Unknowing, and yet the true Country of the Soul.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_205"></A><A HREF="#fn_205"><FONT SIZE="1">206</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p72"></A>These statements, which appear when thus laid down to  be hopelessly academic, violently divorced from life, were not for St.  Teresa or any other Christian mystic abstract propositions; but  attempts towards the description of first-hand experience.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p73"></A>&#8220;By some mysterious manifestation of the  truth,&#8221; she says, &#8220;the three Persons of the most Blessed  Trinity reveal themselves, preceded by an illumination which shines on  the spirit like a most dazzling cloud of light. The three Persons are  distinct from one another; a sublime knowledge is infused into the  soul, imbuing it with a certainty of the truth that the Three are of  one substance, power, and knowledge, and are one God. Thus that which  we hold as a doctrine of faith, the soul now, so to speak, understands  by sight, though it beholds the Blessed Trinity neither by the eyes of  the body nor of the soul, this being no imaginary vision. All the  Three Persons here communicate Themselves to the soul, speak to it,  and make it understand the words of our Lord in the Gospel, that He  and the Father and the Holy Ghost will come and make their abode with  the soul which loves Him and keeps His commandments.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p74"></A>O my God, how different from merely hearing and  believing these words is it to realize their truth in this way! Day by  day a growing astonishment takes possession of this soul, for the  three Persons of the Blessed Trinity seem never to depart; that They  dwell far within its own centre and depths; though for want of  learning it cannot describe how, it is conscious of the indwelling of  these divine Companions.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_206"></A><A HREF="#fn_206"><FONT SIZE="1">207</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p76"></A>Mystical writers constantly remind us that life as  perceived by the human minds shows an inveterate tendency to arrange  itself in triads: that if they proclaim the number Three in the  heavens, they can also point to it as dominating everywhere upon the  earth. Here Christianity did but give form to a deep instinct of the  human mind: an instinct which made Pythagoras call Three the number of  God, because beginning, middle, and end were contained therein. Thus  to Hindu thought the Absolute Godhead was unknowable, but He disclosed  three faces to man&#8212;Brahma the <a name="page_111"><font size="1" color="green">p. 111</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.v-Page_111"></A>  Creator, Shiva the Destroyer, Krishna the Repairer&#8212;and these  three were One. So too the Neoplatonists distinguished three worlds;  the Sensible or Phenomenal, the Rational or Intellectual, the  Intelligible or Spiritual; and three aspects of God&#8212;the  Unconditioned Absolute, the Logos or Artificer, and the divine Essence  or Soul of the World which is both absolute and created. Perhaps we  have in such triads a first sketch of the Christian Trinity; though  falling far short of the requirements of man&#8217;s spiritual  experience. The dry bones await the breath of more abundant life.  Corresponding with this diagram of God&#8217;s nature the Platonists  see also three grades of beauty; the Corporeal, the Spiritual, and the  Divine.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p77"></A>Man, that &#8220;thing of threes,&#8221; of body, soul  and spirit, of understanding, memory and will, follows in his path  towards unity the Threefold Way: for &#8220;our soul,&#8221; says Lady  Julian, &#8220;is made-trinity like to the unmade blissful Trinity,  known and loved from without beginning, and in the making oned to the  Maker.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_207"></A><A HREF="#fn_207"><FONT SIZE="1">208</FONT></A>
    We still tend to analyse our psychic life into emotional, volitional,  and intellectual elements. Even the Subject and Object implied in  every experience required a third term, the relation between them,  without which no thought can be complete. Thus the very principle of  analogy imposes upon man a Trinitarian definition of Reality as the  one with which his mind is best able to cope.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_208"></A><A HREF="#fn_208"><FONT SIZE="1">209</FONT></A>
    It is easy for the hurried rationalist to demonstrate the absurdity  of this fact but he will find it a very different matter when it comes  to disproving it.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p80"></A>&#8220;I could wish,&#8221; says St. Augustine,  &#8220;that men would consider these three things that are in  themselves . . . To Be, to Know, and to Will. For I am, and I know,  and I will, I am knowing and willing, and I know myself to be and to  will; and I will to be and to know. In these three therefore let him  who can, see how inseparable a life there is&#8212;even one life, one  mind, one essence: finally how inseparable is the distinction, and yet  a distinction. Surely a man hath it before him: let him look into  himself and see and tell me. But when he discovers and can see  anything of these, let him not think that he has discovered that which  is above these Unchangeable: which Is unchangeably and Knows  unchangeably and Wills unchangeably.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_209"></A><A HREF="#fn_209"><FONT SIZE="1">210</FONT></A>

<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p82"></A>In a well-known passage, Julian of Norwich tells us  how she <a name="page_112"><font size="1" color="green">p. 112</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.v-Page_112"></A> saw the Trinity of the Divine  Nature shining in the phenomenal as well as in the spiritual world.  &#8220;He showed me,&#8221; she says, &#8220;a little thing, the  quantity of an hazel nut, in the palm of my hand; and it was as round  as a ball. I looked thereupon with the eye of my understanding, and  thought,   <i>What may this be?</i>    And it was answered generally thus:   <i>It is all that is made. . . .</i>    In this Little Thing I saw three properties. The first is that God  made it, the second is that God loveth it, the third is that God  keepeth it. But what is to me verily the Maker, the Keeper, and the  Lover, I cannot tell.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_210"></A><A HREF="#fn_210"><FONT SIZE="1">211</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p84"></A>Julian, a simple and deeply human Englishwoman of  middle age dwelling alone in her churchyard cell, might well be called  the poet of the Trinity. She treats this austere and subtle  dogma&#8212;of which the mediaeval mystics write with a passion little  understood by those who look upon it as &#8220;orthodoxy reduced to  mathematics&#8221;&#8212;with an intimacy and vigour which carry with  them a conviction of her own direct and personal apprehension of the  theological truth she struggles to describe. &#8220;I beheld,&#8221;  she says of a vision which is close to that of St. Teresa in the  &#8220;Seventh Habitation of the Soul,&#8221; and more lucidly if less  splendidly expressed, &#8220;the working of all the blessed Trinity:  in which beholding, I saw and understood these three properties: the  property of the Fatherhood, the property of the Motherhood, and the  property of the Lordhood, in one God. In our Father Almighty we have  our keeping and our bliss as anent our natural Substance,  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_211"></A><A HREF="#fn_211"><FONT SIZE="1">212</FONT></A>
    which is to us by our making, without beginning. And in the Second  Person in wit and wisdom we have our keeping as anent our Sense-soul:  our restoring and our saving; for He is our Mother, Brother, and  Saviour. And in our good Lord, the Holy Ghost, we have our rewarding  and our meed-giving for our living and our travail, and endless  overpassing of all that we desire, in His marvellous courtesy of His  high plenteous grace. For all our life is in   <i>three:</i>    in the first we have our Being, in the second we have our Increasing,  and in the third we have our Fulfilling; the first is Nature, the  second is Mercy, and the third is Grace.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_212"></A><A HREF="#fn_212"><FONT SIZE="1">213</FONT></A>

  <br>  </blockquote>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p92"></A>Any attempt towards a definition of God which does not  account for and acknowledge these three aspects is found in experience  to be incomplete. They provide objectives for the heart, the  intellect, and the will: for they offer to the Self material for its  highest love, its deepest thought, its act of supreme volition. Under  the familiar Platonic terms of Goodness, Truth, and Beauty, they  represent the divine source and end of Ethics, Science, and Art, the  three supreme activities of man. Thus the ideals of artist, student,  and philanthropist, who all seek under different modes the same  reality, are gathered up in the mystic&#8217;s One; as the pilgrimage  of the three kings ended in the finding of one Star</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p93"></A>&#8220;What is God?&#8221; says St. Bernard.  &#8220;Length, breadth, height, and depth. &#8216;What,&#8217; you  say, &#8216;you do after all profess to believe in the fourfold  Godhead which was an abomination to you?&#8217; Not in the least. . .  . God is designated One to suit our comprehension, not to describe his  character.   <i>His character is capable of division, He Himself is not.</i>    The words are different, the paths are many, but one thing is  signified; the paths lead to one Person.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_216"></A><A HREF="#fn_216"><FONT SIZE="1">217</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p95"></A>All possible ways of conceiving this One Person in His  living richness are found in the end to range themselves under three  heads. He is &#8220;above all and through all and in you all,&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_217"></A><A HREF="#fn_217"><FONT SIZE="1">218</FONT></A>
    said St. Paul, anticipating the Councils in a flash of mystic  intuition and giving to the infant Church the shortest and most  perfect definition of its Triune God. Being, which is above all,  manifests itself as Becoming; as the dynamic omnipresent Word of Life.  The Divine Love immanent in the heart and in the world comes forth  from, and returns to, the Absolute One. &#8220;Thou, my God, who art  <a name="page_114"><font size="1" color="green">p. 114</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.v-Page_114"></A> Love,&#8221; says Nicolas of Cusa,  &#8220;art Love that loveth, and Love that is loveable, and Love that  is the bond between these twain.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_218"></A><A HREF="#fn_218"><FONT SIZE="1">219</FONT></A>
    Thus is completed &#8220;the Eternal Circle from Goodness, through  Goodness, to Goodness.&#8221; It is true that to these fundamental  respects of the perceived Godhead&#8212;that Being, Becoming, and  Desire whereto the worlds keep time&#8212;the mystics have given many  and various names; for they have something of the freedom of true  intimates in treating of the Reality which they love. In particular,  those symbols of the Absolute which are drawn from the great and  formless forces of the universe, rather than from the orthodox but  necessarily anthropomorphic imagery of human relationship, have always  appealed to them. Their intense apprehension of Spirit seems to find  freer and more adequate expression in such terms, than in those in  which the notion of space is involved, or which suggest a concrete  picture to the mind. Though they know as well as the philosophers that  &#8220;there must always he something symbolic in our way of  expressing the spiritual life,&#8221; since &#8220;that unfathomable  infinite whose spiritual character is first recognized in our human  experience, can never reveal itself fully and freely under the  limitations of our earthly existence&#8221;;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_219"></A><A HREF="#fn_219"><FONT SIZE="1">220</FONT></A>
    yet they ever seek, like the artists they are, some new and vital  image which is not yet part of the debased currency of formal  religion, and conserves its original power of stinging the imagination  to more vivid life.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p99"></A>Thus &#8220;the Kingdom of Heaven,&#8221; says Law,  &#8220;stands in this threefold life, where three are one, because it  is a manifestation of the Deity, which is Three and One; the Father  has His distinct manifestation in the Fire, which is always generating  the Light; the Son has His distinct manifestation in the Light, which  is always generated from the Fire; the Holy Ghost has His  manifestation in the Spirit, that always proceeds from both, and is  always united with them. It is this eternal unbeginning Trinity in  Unity of Fire, Light, and Spirit, that constitutes Eternal Nature, the  Kingdom of Heaven, the heavenly Jerusalem, the Divine Life, the  Beatific Visibility, the majestic Glory and Presence of God. Through  this Kingdom of Heaven, or Eternal Nature, is the invisible God, the  incomprehensible Trinity, eternally breaking forth and manifesting  itself in a boundless height and depth of blissful wonders, opening  and displaying itself to all its creatures as in an infinite variation  and endless multiplicity of its powers, beauties, joys, and  glories.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_220"></A><A HREF="#fn_220"><FONT SIZE="1">221</FONT></A>

<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p101"></A>Perhaps an easier, better, more beautiful example of  these abstract symbols of the Trinity than Law&#8217;s Fire, Light,  and Spirit is that of Light, Life, and Love: a threefold picture of  the Real which is constantly dwelt upon and elaborated by the  Christian mystics. Transcendent Light, intangible but unescapable,  ever emanating Its splendour through the Universe: indwelling,  unresting, and energizing Life: desirous and directive  Love&#8212;these are cardinal aspects of Reality to which they return  again and again in their efforts to find words which will express  something of the inexpressible truth.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p102"></A>(  <i>a</i>   ) LIGHT, ineffable and uncreated, the perfect symbol of pure  undifferentiated Being: above the intellect, as St. Augustine reminds  us, but known to him who loves.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_221"></A><A HREF="#fn_221"><FONT SIZE="1">222</FONT></A>
    This Uncreated Light is the &#8220;deep yet dazzling darkness&#8221;  of the Dionysian school, &#8220;dark from its surpassing brightness .  . . as the shining of the sun on his course is as darkness to weak  eyes.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_222"></A><A HREF="#fn_222"><FONT SIZE="1">223</FONT></A>

   : the Eternal Father, or Fount of Things. &#8220;For well we  know,&#8221; says Ruysbroeck &#8220;that the bosom of the Father is  our ground and origin, wherein our life and being is begun.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_224"></A><A HREF="#fn_224"><FONT SIZE="1">225</FONT></A>

This out-birth or Concept of the Father&#8217;s  Mind, which He possesses within Himself, as Battista Vernazza was told  in her ecstasy,  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_225"></A><A HREF="#fn_225"><FONT SIZE="1">226</FONT></A>
    is that Word of Creation which since It is alive and infinite, no  formula can contain. the Word eternally &#8220;spoken&#8221; or  generated by the Transcendent Light. &#8220;This is why,&#8221; says  Ruysbroeck again, &#8220;all that lives in the Father unmanifested in  the Unity, is also in the Son actively poured forth in  manifestation.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_226"></A><A HREF="#fn_226"><FONT SIZE="1">227</FONT></A>
    This life, then, is the flawless expression or character of the  Father, <A NAME="an_iii.v-p109.1"></A>  <i>Sapientia Patris.</i>     It is at once the personal and adorable comrade of  the mystic&#8217;s adventure and the inmost principle, the sustaining  power, of a dynamic universe; for that which intellect defines as the  Logos or Creative Spirit, contemplative love   <i>knows</i>    as Wonderful, Counsellor, and Prince of Peace.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p110"></A>Since Christ, for the Christian philosopher, is Divine  Life Itself&#8212;the drama of Christianity expressing this fact and  its implications &#8220;in a point&#8221;&#8212;it follows that His  active spirit is to be discerned, not symbolically, but in the most  veritable sense, in the ecstatic and abounding life of the world. In  the rapturous vitality <a name="page_116"><font size="1" color="green">p. 116</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.v-Page_116"></A> of the birds, in  their splendid glancing flight: in the swelling of buds and the  sacrificial beauty of the flowers: in the great and solemn rhythms of  the sea&#8212;there is somewhat of Bethlehem in all these things,  somewhat too of Calvary in their self-giving pains. It was this  re-discovery of Nature&#8217;s Christliness which Blake desired so  passionately when he sang&#8212;</p>   <blockquote><A NAME="an_iii.v-p110.1"></A> &#8220;I will not cease from mental fight,<br>   Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand<br>   Till we have built Jerusalem<br>   In England&#8217;s green and pleasant  land.&#8221;<br>  </blockquote>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p111"></A>Here then it is, on this pinnacle of faith, at the  utmost boundaries of human speech, that mystical theology suddenly  shows herself&#8212;not as the puzzle-headed constructor of impossible  creeds, but as accepting and transmuting to a more radiant life those  two profound but apparently contradictory metaphysical definitions of  Reality which we have already discussed.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_227"></A><A HREF="#fn_227"><FONT SIZE="1">228</FONT></A>
    Eternal Becoming, God immanent and dynamic, striving with and in His  world: the unresting &#8220;flux of things&#8221; of Heracleitus, the  crying aloud of that Word &#8220;which is through all things  everlastingly&#8221;&#8212;the evolutionary world-process beloved of  modern philosophers&#8212;is here placed once for all in true relation  with pure transcendent and unmoved Being; the Absolute One of  Xenophanes and the Platonists. This Absolute is discerned by mystic  intuition as the &#8220;End of Unity&#8221; in whom all diversities  must cease;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_228"></A><A HREF="#fn_228"><FONT SIZE="1">229</FONT></A>
    the Ocean to which that ceaseless and painful Becoming, that  unresting river of life, in which we are immersed, tends to return:  the Son going to the Father.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p114"></A>(  <i>c</i>   ) LOVE, the principle of attraction, which seems to partake at once of  the transcendental and the created worlds. If we consider the Father  as Supreme Subject&#8212;&#8220;origin,&#8221; as Aquinas says,  &#8220;of the entire procession of Deity&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_229"></A><A HREF="#fn_229"><FONT SIZE="1">230</FONT></A>
   &#8212;and the Son or generated Logos as the Object of His thought, in  whom, says Ruysbroeck, &#8220;He contemplates Himself and all things  in an eternal Now&#8221;;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_230"></A><A HREF="#fn_230"><FONT SIZE="1">231</FONT></A>
    then this personal Spirit of Love, <A NAME="an_iii.v-p116.1"></A>   <i>il desiro e il velle,</i>     represents the relation between the two, and  constitutes the very character of God. &#8220;The heavenly  Father,&#8221; says Ruysbroeck, &#8220;as a living Ground, with all  that lives in Him, is actively turned towards His Son as to His own  Eternal Wisdom. And that same Wisdom, with all that lives in it, is  actively turned back towards the Father, that is towards that very  ground from which it comes forth. And of this meeting is born the  third Person, between the Father and the <a name="page_117"><font size="1" color="green">p. 117</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.v-Page_117"></A> Son, that is the Holy Spirit, their mutual  Love.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_231"></A><A HREF="#fn_231"><FONT SIZE="1">232</FONT></A>
    Proceeding, according to Christian doctrine, from Light and Life, the  Father and Son&#8212;implicit, that is, in both the Absolute Source  and dynamic flux of things&#8212;this divine spirit of desire is found  enshrined in our very selfhood; and is the agent by which that  selfhood is merged in the Absolute Self. &#8220;My love is my  weight,&#8221; said St. Augustine.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_232"></A><A HREF="#fn_232"><FONT SIZE="1">233</FONT></A>
    It is the spiritual equivalent of that gravitation which draws all  things to their place. Thus Bernard Holland says in his Introduction  to Boehme&#8217;s &#8220;Dialogues,&#8221; &#8220;In a deep sense, the  desire of the Spark of Life in the Soul to return to its Original  Source is part of the longing desire of the universal Life for its own  heart or centre. Of this longing, the universal attraction striving  against resistance, towards a universal centre, proved to govern the  phenomenal or physical world, is but the outer sheath and visible  working.&#8221; Again, &#8220;Desire is everything in Nature; does  everything. Heaven is Nature filled with divine Life attracted by  Desire.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_233"></A><A HREF="#fn_233"><FONT SIZE="1">234</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p120"></A>&#8220;The best masters say,&#8221; says Eckhart,  &#8220;that the love wherewith we love is the Holy Spirit.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_234"></A><A HREF="#fn_234"><FONT SIZE="1">235</FONT></A>
    Some deny it. But this is always true: all those motives by which we  are moved to love, in these is nothing else than the Holy  Spirit.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_235"></A><A HREF="#fn_235"><FONT SIZE="1">236</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p123"></A>&#8220;God wills,&#8221; says Ruysbroeck, gathering  these scattered symbols to unity again, &#8220;that we should come  forth from ourselves in this Eternal Light; that we should reunite  ourselves in a supernatural manner with that image which is our true  Life, and that we should possess it with Him actively and fruitively  in eternal blessedness . . . this going forth of the contemplative is  also in Love: for by fruitive love he overpasses his created being and  finds and tastes the riches and delights which are God Himself, and  which He causes to pour forth without ceasing in the most secret  chamber of the soul, at that place where it is most like unto the  nobility of God.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_236"></A><A HREF="#fn_236"><FONT SIZE="1">237</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p125"></A>Here only, in the innermost sanctuary of being, the  soul&#8217;s &#8220;last habitation,&#8221; as St. Teresa said, is the  truth which these symbols express truly known: for &#8220;as to how  the Trinity is one and the Trinity in the Unity of the nature is one,  whilst nevertheless the Trinity comes forth from the Unity, this  cannot be expressed in <a name="page_118"><font size="1" color="green">p. 118</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.v-Page_118"></A> words,&#8221;  says Suso, &#8220;owing to the simplicity of that deep abyss. Hither  it is, into this intelligible   <i>where</i>    that the spirit, spiritualizing itself, soars up; now flying in the  measureless heights, now swimming in the soundless deeps, of the  sublime marvels of the Godhead!&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_237"></A><A HREF="#fn_237"><FONT SIZE="1">238</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p127"></A>Mystical philosophy, then, has availed itself gladly  of the doctrine of the Trinity in expressing its vision of the nature  of that Absolute which is found, by those who attain the deep Abyss of  the Godhead, to be essentially One. But it is by the complementary  Christian dogma of the Incarnation that it has best been able to  describe and explain the nature of the inward and personal mystic  experience. The Incarnation, which is for traditional Christianity  synonymous with the historical birth and earthly life of Christ, is  for mystics of a certain type, not only this but also a perpetual  Cosmic and personal process. It is an everlasting bringing forth, in  the universe and also in the individual ascending soul, of the divine  and perfect Life, the pure character of God, of which the one  historical life dramatized the essential constituents. Hence the soul,  like the physical embryo, resumes in its upward progress the spiritual  life-history of the race. &#8220;The one secret, the greatest of  all,&#8221; says Patmore, is &#8220;the doctrine of the Incarnation,  regarded not as an historical event which occurred two thousand years  ago, but as an event which is renewed in the body of every one who is  in the way to the fulfilment of his original destiny.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_238"></A><A HREF="#fn_238"><FONT SIZE="1">239</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p129"></A>We have seen that for mystical theology the Second  Person of the Trinity is the Wisdom of the Father, the Word of Life.  The fullness of this Word could therefore only be communicated to the  human consciousness by a Life. In the Incarnation this Logos, this  divine character of Reality, penetrated the illusions of the sensual  world&#8212;in other words, the illusions of all the selves whose  ideas compose that world&#8212;and &#8220;saved&#8221; it by this  infusion of truth. A divine, suffering, self-sacrificing Personality  was then shown as the sacred heart of a living, striving universe: and  for once the Absolute was exhibited in the terms of finite human  existence. Some such event as this breaking through of the divine and  archetypal life into the temporal world is perceived by the mystical  philosopher to be a necessity, if man was ever to see in terms of life  that greatness of life to which he belongs: learn to transcend the  world of sense, and rebuild his life upon the levels of reality.  &#8220;For Thou art,&#8221; says Nicolas of Cusa, &#8220;the Word of  God humanified, and Thou art man deified.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_239"></A><A HREF="#fn_239"><FONT SIZE="1">240</FONT></A>
    Thus it is that the <a name="page_119"><font size="1" color="green">p. 119</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.v-Page_119"></A> Catholic priest in  the Christmas Mass gives thanks, not for the setting in hand of any  commercial process of redemption, but for a revelation of reality,  &#8220;Quia per incarnati Verbi mysterium nova mentis nostrae oculis  lux tuae claritatis infulsit: ut dum visibiliter Deum cognoscimus, per  hunc in invisibilium amorem rapiamur.&#8221; The essence of mystical  Christianity seems to be summed up in these lovely words.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_240"></A><A HREF="#fn_240"><FONT SIZE="1">241</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p132"></A>&#8220;The Son of God, the Eternal Word in the Father,  who is the glance, or brightness, and the power of the light  eternity&#8221; says Boehme, &#8220;must become man and be born in  you, if you will know God: otherwise you are in the dark stable and go  about groping.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_241"></A><A HREF="#fn_241"><FONT SIZE="1">242</FONT></A>
    &#8220;The Word,&#8221; says Ruysbroeck finely, &#8220;is no other  than See. And this is the coming forth and the birth of the Son of the  Eternal Light, in Whom all blessedness is seen and known.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_242"></A><A HREF="#fn_242"><FONT SIZE="1">243</FONT></A>
    Once at any rate, they say in effect, the measure of that which it  was possible for the Spirit of Life to do and for living creatures to  be, was filled to the brim. By this event, all were assured that the  ladder of Creation was made whole; in this hypostatic union, the  breach between appearance and reality, between God and man, was  healed. The Bridge so made&#8212;to use St. Catherine of Siena&#8217;s  allegory again&#8212;is eternal, since it was &#8220;laid before the  foundation of the world&#8221; in the &#8220;Eternal Now.&#8221; Thus  the voice of the Father says to her in that vision, &#8220;I also wish  thee to look at the Bridge of My only-begotten Son, and see the  greatness thereof, for it reaches from Heaven to earth; that is, that  the earth of your humanity is joined to the greatness of the Deity  thereby. I say, then, that this Bridge reaches from Heaven to earth,  and constitutes the union which I have made with man. . . . So the  height of the Divinity, humbled to the earth, and joined with your  humanity made the Bridge and reformed the road. Why was this done? In  order that man might come to his true happiness with the angels. And  observe that it is not enough, in order that you should have life,  that My son should have made you this Bridge, unless you walk  thereon.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_243"></A><A HREF="#fn_243"><FONT SIZE="1">244</FONT></A>
    &#8220;Our high Father God Almighty, which is Being,&#8221; says Lady  Julian, &#8220;He knew and loved us from afore any time.

 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p137"></A>It is of course this assertion of the quickening  communication <a name="page_120"><font size="1" color="green">p. 120</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.v-Page_120"></A> of grace to nature, of  God to man&#8212;an influx of ultimate reality, possible of  assimilation by all&#8212;which constitutes the strength of the  Christian religion. Instead of the stony diet of the philosophers, it  offers to the self hungry for the Absolute that <A NAME="an_iii.v-p137.1"></A>   <i>Panis Angelorum,</i>     the vivifying principle of the world. That is to  say, it gives concrete and experimental knowledge of a supreme  Personality&#8212;absorption into His mystical body&#8212;instead of  the artificial conviction produced by concentration on an idea. It  knits up the universe; shows the phenomenal pierced in all directions  by the real, the natural as the vehicle of the supernatural. It  provides a solid basis for mysticism, a basis which is at once  metaphysical and psychological: and shows that state towards which the  world&#8217;s deepest minds have always instinctively aspired, as a  part of the cosmic return through Christ to God.</p>   <blockquote><A NAME="an_iii.v-p137.2"></A> &#8220;Quivi &egrave; la sapienza e la possanza<br>   ch&#8217; apr&igrave; le strade intra il cielo e la  terra<br>   onde fu gi&agrave; s&igrave; lunga disianza.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_245"></A><A HREF="#fn_245"><FONT SIZE="1">246</FONT></A>
  <br>  </blockquote>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p139"></A>This is what the Christian mystics mean to express  when they declare over and over again that the return to the Divine  Substance, the Absolute, which is the end of the soul&#8217;s ascent,  can only be made through the humanity of Christ. The Son, the Word, is  the character of the Father: that in which the Ineffable Godhead knows  Himself, as we only know ourselves in our own characters. He is thus a  double link: the means of God&#8217;s self-consciousness, the means of  man&#8217;s consciousness of God. How then, asks mystic theology,  could such a link complete its attachments without some such process  as that which the Incarnation dramatized in time and space? The  Principle of Life is also the Principle of Restitution; by which the  imperfect and broken life of sense is mended and transformed into the  perfect life of spirit. Hence the title of Repairer applied by Boehme  to the Second Person of the Trinity.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p140"></A>In the last resort, the doctrine of the Incarnation is  the only safeguard of the mystics against the pantheism to which they  always tend. The Unconditioned Absolute, so soon as it alone becomes  the object of their contemplation, is apt to be conceived merely as  Divine Essence; the idea of Personality evaporates. The union of the  soul with God is then thought of in terms of absorption. The  distinction between Creator and creature is obliterated and loving  communion is at an end. This is probably the reason why many of the  greatest contemplatives&#8212;Suso and St. Teresa are cases in  point&#8212;have found that deliberate meditation upon the humanity of  Christ, difficult and uncongenial as <a name="page_121"><font size="1" color="green">p. 121</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.v-Page_121"></A>  this concrete devotion sometimes is to the mystical temperament, was a  necessity if they were to retain a healthy and well-balanced inner  life.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p141"></A>Further, these mystics see in the historic life of  Christ an epitome&#8212;or if you will, an exhibition&#8212;of the  essentials of all spiritual life. There they see dramatized not only  the cosmic process of the Divine Wisdom, but also the inward  experience of every soul on her way to union with that Absolute  &#8220;to which the whole Creation moves.&#8221; This is why the  expressions which they use to describe the evolution of the mystical  consciousness from the birth of the divine in the spark of the soul to  its final unification with the Absolute Life are so constantly chosen  from the Drama of Faith. In this drama they see described under veils  the necessary adventures of the spirit. Its obscure and humble birth,  its education in poverty, its temptation, mortification and solitude,  its &#8220;illuminated life&#8221; of service and contemplation, the  desolation of that &#8220;dark night of the soul&#8221; in which it  seems abandoned by the Divine: the painful death of the self, its  resurrection to the glorified existence of the Unitive Way, its final  reabsorption in its Source&#8212;all these, they say, were lived once  in a supreme degree in the flesh. Moreover, the degree of closeness  with which the individual experience adheres to this Pattern is always  taken by them as a standard of the healthiness, ardour, and success of  its transcendental activities.</p>   <blockquote><A NAME="an_iii.v-p141.1"></A> &#8220;Apparve in questa forma<br>   Per dare a noi la norma.&#8221;<br>  </blockquote>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p142"></A>sang Jacopone da Todi. &#8220;And he who vainly  thinketh otherwise,&#8221; says the &#8220;Theologia Germanica&#8221;  with uncompromising vigour, &#8220;is deceived. And he who saith  otherwise, lieth.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_246"></A><A HREF="#fn_246"><FONT SIZE="1">247</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p144"></A>Those to whom such a parallel seems artificial should  remember that according to the doctrine of mysticism that drama of the  self-limitation and self-sacrifice of the Absolute Life, which was  once played out in the phenomenal world&#8212;forced, as it were, upon  the consciousness of dim-eyed men&#8212;is eternally going forward  upon the plane of reality. To them the Cross of Calvary is implicit in  the Rose of the World. The law of this Infinite Life which was in the  Incarnation expressing Its own nature in human terms, must then also  be the law of the finite life; in so far as that life aspires to  transcend individual limitations, rise to freedom, and attain union  with Infinity. It is this governing idea which justifies the  apparently fanciful allegorizations of Christian history which swarm  in the works of the mystics.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p145"></A>To exhibit these allegorizations in detail would be  tedious. All <a name="page_122"><font size="1" color="green">p. 122</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.v-Page_122"></A> that is necessary is that  the principle underlying them should be understood. I give, then, but  one example: that which is referred by mystical writers to the  Nativity, and concerns the eternal Birth or Generation of the Son or  Divine Word.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p146"></A>This Birth is in its first, or cosmic sense, the  welling forth of the Spirit of Life from the Divine Abyss of the  unconditioned Godhead. &#8220;From our proper Ground, that is to say  from the Father and all that which lives in Him, there shines,&#8221;  says Ruysbroeck, &#8220;an eternal Ray, the which is the Birth of the  Son.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_247"></A><A HREF="#fn_247"><FONT SIZE="1">248</FONT></A>
    It is of this perpetual generation of the Word that Meister Eckhart  speaks, when he says in his Christmas sermon, &#8220;We are  celebrating the feast of the Eternal Birth which God the Father has  borne and   <i>never ceases to bear</i>    in all Eternity: whilst this birth also comes to pass in Time and in  human nature. Saint Augustine says this Birth is ever taking  place.&#8221; At this point, with that strong practical instinct which  is characteristic of the mystics, Eckhart turns abruptly from  speculation to immediate experience, and continues &#8220;But if it  takes not place in me, what avails it? Everything lies in this, that  it should take place in me.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_248"></A><A HREF="#fn_248"><FONT SIZE="1">249</FONT></A>
    Here in a few words the two-fold character of this Mystic Birth is  exhibited. The interest is suddenly deflected from its cosmic to its  personal aspect; and the individual is reminded that in him, no less  than in the Archetypal Universe, real life must be born if real life  is to be lived. &#8220;When the soul brings forth the Son,&#8221; says  Eckhart in another place, &#8220;it is happier than Mary.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_249"></A><A HREF="#fn_249"><FONT SIZE="1">250</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p150"></A>Since the soul, according to mystic principles, can  only perceive Reality in proportion as she is real, know God by  becoming Godlike, it is clear that this birth is the initial  necessity. The true and definitely directed mystical life does and  must open with that most actual, though indescribable phenomenon, the  coming forth into consciousness of man&#8217;s deeper, spiritual self,  which ascetical and mystical writers of all ages have agreed to call  Regeneration or Re-birth. Nothing that is within him is able of its  own power to achieve this. It must be evoked by an energy, a  quickening Spirit, which comes from beyond the soul, and  &#8220;secretly initiates what He openly crowns.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_250"></A><A HREF="#fn_250"><FONT SIZE="1">251</FONT></A>
    <a name="page_123"><font size="1" color="green">p. 123</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.v-Page_123"></A></p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p152"></A>We nave already considered  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_251"></A><A HREF="#fn_251"><FONT SIZE="1">252</FONT></A>
    the New Birth in its purely psychological aspect, as the emergence of  the transcendental sense. Here its more profound and mystical side is  exhibited. By a process which may indifferently be described as the  birth of something new or the coming forth of something which has  slept&#8212;since both these phrases are but metaphors for another and  more secret operation&#8212;the eye is opened on Eternity, the self,  abruptly made aware of Reality, comes forth from the cave of illusion  like a child from the womb and begins to live upon the supersensual  plane. Then she feels in her inmost part a new presence, a new  consciousness&#8212;it were hardly an exaggeration to say a new  Person&#8212;weak, demanding nurture, clearly destined to pass through  many phases of development before its maturity is reached; yet of so  strange a nature, that in comparison with its environment she may well  regard it as Divine.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p154"></A>&#8220;This change, this upsetting, is called  re-birth.   <i>To be born</i>    simply means to enter into a world in which the senses dominate, in  which wisdom and love languish in the bonds of individuality. To be   <i>re-born</i>    means to return to a world where the spirit of wisdom and love  governs and animal-man obeys.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_252"></A><A HREF="#fn_252"><FONT SIZE="1">253</FONT></A>
    So Eckartshausen. It means, says Jane Lead, &#8220;the bringing forth  of a new-created Godlike similitude in the soul.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_253"></A><A HREF="#fn_253"><FONT SIZE="1">254</FONT></A>
    He is brought forth, says Eckartshausen again, in the stable  previously inhabited by the ox of passion and the ass of prejudice.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_254"></A><A HREF="#fn_254"><FONT SIZE="1">255</FONT></A>
    His mother, says Boehme, is the Virgin Sophia, the Divine Wisdom, or  Mirror of the Being of God. With the emergence of this new factor into  the conscious field&#8212;this spiritual birth&#8212;the mystic life  begins: as the Christian epoch began with the emergence of Divine  Spirit in the flesh. Paradise, says Boehme, is still in the world, but  man is not in Paradise unless he be born again. In that case, he  stands therein in the New Birth,  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_255"></A><A HREF="#fn_255"><FONT SIZE="1">256</FONT></A>
    and tastes here and now that Eternal Life for which he has been  made.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p159"></A>Here then are some characteristics of the map which  the Christian mystics are most inclined to use. There are, of course,  other great landmarks upon it: and these we shall meet as we follow in  detail the voyages of the questing soul. One warning, however, must be  given to amateur geographers before we go on. Like all other maps,  this one at its best can but represent by harsh outline and  conventional colour the living earth which those travellers trod and  the mysterious seas on which they sailed. It is a deliberately  schematic representation of Reality, a flat and sometimes arid symbol  of great landscapes, rushing rivers, awful peaks: <a name="page_124"><font size="1" color="green">p. 124</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.v-Page_124"></A> dangerous unless these its limitations be  always kept in mind. The boy who defined Canada as &#8220;very  pink&#8221; was not much further off the track than those who would  limit the Adorable Trinity to the definitions of the  &#8220;Athanasian&#8221; Creed; however useful that chart may be, and  is, within the boundaries imposed by its form.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p160"></A>Further, all such maps, and we who treat of them, can  but set down in cold blood and with a dreadful pretence of precision,  matters which the true explorers of Eternity were only able to  apprehend in the ardours of such a passion, in the transports of such  a union as we, poor finite slaves of our frittered emotions, could  hardly look upon and live. &#8220;If you would truly know how these  things come to pass,&#8221; says St. Bonaventura, in a passage which  all students of theology should ever keep in mind, &#8220;ask it of  grace, not of doctrine; of desire, not of intellect; of the ardours of  prayer, not of the teachings of the schools; of the Bridegroom, not of  the Master; of God, not of man; of the darkness, not of the day; not  of illumination, but of that Fire which enflames all and wraps us in  God with great sweetness and most ardent love. The which Fire most  truly is God, and the hearth thereof is in Jerusalem.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_256"></A><A HREF="#fn_256"><FONT SIZE="1">257</FONT></A>

<p><A NAME="an_iii.v-p121"></A>         The doctrine is found in St. Augustine, and is frequently reproduced    by the mediaeval mystics. Eckhart is perhaps here quoting St. Thomas    Aquinas, a usual source of his more orthodox utterances. Compare    &#8220;Summa Contra Gentiles,&#8221; I. iv. cap. xxiii: &#8220;Since    the Holy Ghost proceeds as the love wherewith God loves Himself, and    since God loves with the same love Himself and other beings for the    sake of His own goodness, it is clear that the love wherewith God    loves us belongs to the Holy Ghost. In like manner also the love    wherewith we love God.&#8221;</p></P>

The    extreme antiquity of this idea is illustrated by the Catholic    practice, dating from Patristic times, of celebrating three Masses    on Christmas Day. Of these the first, at midnight, commemorates the    Eternal Generation of the Son; the second, at dawn, His incarnation    upon earth; the third His birth in the heart of man. Compare the    Roman Missal: also Kellner, &#8220;Heortology&#8221; (English    translation, London, 1908), p. 156.</p></P>
