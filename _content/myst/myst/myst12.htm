<p><A NAME="an_iv.i-p1"></A>We<A NAME="an_iv.i-p1.1"></A> are now to turn from general principles and study those principles in  action: to describe the psychological process, or &#8220;Mystic  Way,&#8221; by which that peculiar type of personality which is able  to set up direct relations with the Absolute is usually developed. The  difficulty of this description will lie in the fact that all mystics  differ one from another; as all the individual objects of our  perception, &#8220;living&#8221; and &#8220;not living,&#8221; do. The  creative impulse in the world, so far as we are aware of it, appears  upon ultimate analysis to be free and original not bound and  mechanical: to express itself, in defiance of the determinists, with a  certain artistic spontaneity. Man, when he picks out some point of  likeness as a basis on which to arrange its productions in groups, is  not discovering its methods; but merely making for his own convenience  an arbitrary choice of one or two&#8212;not necessarily  characteristic&#8212;qualities, which happen to appear in a certain  number of different persons or things. Hence the most scientific  classification is a rough-and-ready business at the best.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_330"></A><A HREF="#fn_330"><FONT SIZE="1">331</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.i-p3"></A>When we come to apply such classification to so  delicate and elusive a series of psychological states as those which  accompany the &#8220;contemplative life,&#8221; all the usual  difficulties are increased. No one mystic can be discovered in whom  all the observed characteristics of the transcendental consciousness  are resumed, and <a name="page_168"><font size="1" color="green">p. 168</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.i-Page_168"></A> who can on that  account be treated as typical. Mental states which are distinct and  mutually exclusive in one case, exist simultaneously in another. In  some, stages which have been regarded as essential are entirely  omitted: in others, their order appears to be reversed. We seem at  first to be confronted by a group of selves which arrive at the same  end without obeying any general law.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.i-p4"></A>Take, however, a number of such definitely mystical  selves and make of them, so to speak, a &#8220;composite  portrait&#8221;: as anthropologists do when they wish to discover the  character of a race. From this portrait we may expect a type to  emerge, in which all the outstanding characteristics contributed by  the individual examples are present together, and minor variations are  suppressed. Such a portrait will of course be conventional: but it  will be useful as a standard, which can be constantly compared with,  and corrected by, isolated specimens.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.i-p5"></A>The first thing we notice about this composite  portrait is that the typical mystic seems to move towards his goal  through a series of strongly marked oscillations between &#8220;states  of pleasure&#8221; and &#8220;states of pain.&#8221; The existence and  succession of these states&#8212;sometimes broken and confused,  sometimes crisply defined&#8212;can be traced, to a greater or less  degree, in almost every case of which we possess anything like a  detailed record. <A NAME="an_iv.i-p5.1"></A>   <i>Gyrans gyrando radii spiritus</i>     .    The soul, as it treads the ascending spiral of its road towards  reality, experiences alternately the sunshine and the shade. These  experiences are &#8220;constants&#8221; of the transcendental life.  &#8220;The Spiritual States of the Soul are all Eternal,&#8221; said  Blake, with the true mystical genius for psychology.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_331"></A><A HREF="#fn_331"><FONT SIZE="1">332</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.i-p7"></A>The complete series of these states&#8212;and it must  not be forgotten that few individuals present them all in perfection,  whilst in many instances several are blurred or appear to be  completely suppressed&#8212;will be, I think, most conveniently  arranged under five heads. This method of grouping means, of course,  the abandonment of the time-honoured threefold division of the Mystic  Way, and the apparent neglect of St. Teresa&#8217;s equally celebrated  Seven Degrees of Contemplation; but I think that we shall gain more  than we lose by adopting it. The groups, however, must be looked upon  throughout as diagrammatic, and only as answering loosely and  generally to experiences which seldom present themselves in so rigid  and unmixed a form. These experiences, largely conditioned as they are  by surroundings and by temperament, exhibit all the variety and  spontaneity which are characteristic of life in its highest  manifestations: and, like biological specimens, they lose something of  their essential reality in being prepared for scientific  investigation. Taken all together, they constitute phases in a <a name="page_169"><font size="1" color="green">p. 169</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.i-Page_169"></A> single process of growth; involving the  movement of consciousness from lower to higher levels of reality, the  steady remaking of character in accordance with the &#8220;independent  spiritual world.&#8221; But as the study of physical life is made  easier for us by an artificial division into infancy, adolescence,  maturity, and old age, so a discreet indulgence of the human passion  for map-making will increase our chances of understanding the nature  of the Mystic Way.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.i-p8"></A>Here, then, is the classification under which we shall  study the phases of the mystical life.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.i-p9"></A>(1) The awakening of the Self to consciousness of  Divine Reality. This experience, usually abrupt and well-marked, is  accompanied by intense feelings of joy and exaltation.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.i-p10"></A>(2) The Self, aware for the first time of Divine  Beauty, realizes by contrast its own finiteness and imperfection, the  manifold illusions in which it is immersed, the immense distance which  separates it from the One. Its attempts to eliminate by discipline and  mortification all that stands in the way of its progress towards union  with God constitute   <i>Purgation:</i>    a state of pain and effort.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.i-p11"></A>(3) When by Purgation the Self has become detached  from the &#8220;things of sense,&#8221; and acquired those virtues  which are the &#8220;ornaments of the spiritual marriage,&#8221; its  joyful consciousness of the Transcendent Order returns in an enhanced  form. Like the prisoners in Plato&#8217;s &#8220;Cave of  Illusion,&#8221; it has awakened to knowledge of Reality, has  struggled up the harsh and difficult path to the mouth of the cave.  Now it looks upon the sun. This is   <i>Illumination:</i>    a state which includes in itself many of the stages of contemplation,  &#8220;degrees of orison,&#8221; visions and adventures of the soul  described by St. Teresa and other mystical writers. These form, as it  were, a way within the Way: a <i>moyen de parvenir</i>,   a training devised by experts which will strengthen and assist the  mounting soul. They stand, so to speak, for education; whilst the Way  proper represents organic growth. Illumination is the  &#8220;contemplative state&#8221;   <i>par excellence.</i>    It forms, with the two preceding states, the &#8220;first mystic  life.&#8221; Many mystics never go beyond it; and, on the other hand,  many seers and artists not usually classed amongst them, have shared,  to some extent, the experiences of the illuminated state. Illumination  brings a certain apprehension of the Absolute, a sense of the Divine  Presence: but not true union with it. It is a state of happiness.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.i-p12"></A>(4) In the development of the great and strenuous  seekers after God, this is followed&#8212;or sometimes intermittently  accompanied&#8212;by the most terrible of all the experiences of the  Mystic Way: the final and complete purification of the Self, which is  called by some contemplatives the &#8220;mystic pain&#8221; or  &#8220;mystic death,&#8221; <a name="page_170"><font size="1" color="green">p. 170</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.i-Page_170"></A> by others  the Purification of the Spirit or   <i>Dark Night of the Soul.</i>    The consciousness which had, in Illumination, sunned itself in the  sense of the Divine Presence, now suffers under an equally intense  sense of the Divine Absence: learning to dissociate the personal  satisfaction of mystical vision from the reality of mystical life. As  in Purgation the senses were cleansed and humbled, and the energies  and interests of the Self were concentrated upon transcendental  things: so now the purifying process is extended to the very centre of  I-hood, the will. The human instinct for personal happiness must be  killed. This is the &#8220;spiritual crucifixion&#8221; so often  described by the mystics: the great desolation in which the soul seems  abandoned by the Divine. The Self now surrenders itself, its  individuality, and its will, completely. It desires nothing, asks  nothing, is utterly passive, and is thus prepared for</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.i-p13"></A>(5)   <i>Union:</i>    the true goal of the mystic quest. In this state the Absolute Life is  not merely perceived and enjoyed by the Self, as in Illumination: but  is   <i>one</i>    with it. This is the end towards which all the previous oscillations  of consciousness have tended. It is a state of equilibrium, of purely  spiritual life; characterized by peaceful joy, by enhanced powers, by  intense certitude. To call this state, as some authorities do, by the  name of Ecstasy, is inaccurate and confusing: since the term Ecstasy  has long been used both by psychologists and ascetic writers to define  that short and rapturous trance&#8212;a state with well-marked  physical and psychical accompaniments&#8212;in which the  contemplative, losing all consciousness of the phenomenal world, is  caught up to a brief and immediate enjoyment of the Divine Vision.  Ecstasies of this kind are often experienced by the mystic in  Illumination, or even on his first conversion. They cannot therefore  be regarded as exclusively characteristic of the Unitive Way. In some  of the greatest mystics&#8212;St. Teresa is an example&#8212;the  ecstatic trance seems to diminish rather than increase in frequency  after the state of union has been attained: whilst others achieve the  heights by a path which leaves on one side all abnormal phenomena.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.i-p14"></A>Union must be looked upon as the true goal of mystical  growth; that permanent establishment of life upon transcendent levels  of reality, of which ecstasies give a foretaste to the soul. Intense  forms of it, described by individual mystics, under symbols such as  those of Mystical Marriage, Deification, or Divine Fecundity, all  prove on examination to be aspects of this same experience &#8220;seen  through a temperament.&#8221;</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.i-p15"></A>It is right, however, to state here that Oriental  Mysticism insists upon a further stage beyond that of union, which  stage it regards as the real goal of the spiritual life. This is the  total annihilation or reabsorption of the individual soul in the  Infinite. <a name="page_171"><font size="1" color="green">p. 171</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.i-Page_171"></A> Such an annihilation is said  by the Sufis to constitute the &#8220;Eighth Stage of Progress,&#8221;  in which alone they truly attain to God. Thus stated, it appears to  differ little from the Buddhist&#8217;s Nirvana, and is the logical  corollary of that pantheism to which the Oriental mystic always tends.  Thus Jalalu d&#8217;Din:</p>   <blockquote><A NAME="an_iv.i-p15.1"></A> &#8220;O, let me not exist! for Non-Existence<br>   Proclaims in organ tones, &#8216;To Him we shall  return.&#8217;&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_332"></A><A HREF="#fn_332"><FONT SIZE="1">333</FONT></A>
  <br>  </blockquote>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.i-p17"></A>It is at least doubtful, however, whether the  interpretation which has been put by European students upon such  passages as this be correct. The language in which Al Ghazzali  attempts to describe the Eighth Stage is certainly more applicable to  the Unitive Life as understood by Christian contemplatives, than to  the Buddhistic annihilation of personality. &#8220;The end of  Sufi-ism,&#8221; he says, &#8220;is total absorption in God. This is  at least the relative end to that part of their doctrine which I am  free to reveal and describe. But   <i>in reality it is but the beginning</i>    of the Sufi life, for those intuitions and other things which precede  it are, so to speak, but the porch by which they enter. . . . In this  state some have imagined themselves to be amalgamated with God, others  to be identical with Him, others again to be associated with Him: but   <i>all this is sin</i>   .&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_333"></A><A HREF="#fn_333"><FONT SIZE="1">334</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.i-p19"></A>The doctrine of annihilation as the end of the  soul&#8217;s ascent, whatever the truth may be as to the Moslem  attitude concerning it, is decisively rejected by all European  mystics, though a belief in it is constantly imputed to them by their  enemies: for their aim is not the suppression of life, but its  intensification, a change in its form. This change, they say in a  paradox which is generally misunderstood, consists in the perfecting  of personality by the utter surrender of self. It is true that the  more Orientally-minded amongst them, such as Dionysius the Areopagite,  do use language of a negative kind which seems almost to involve a  belief in the annihilation rather than the transformation of the self  in God: but this is because they are trying to describe a condition of  supersensible vitality from the point of view of the normal  consciousness to which it can only seem a Nothing, a Dark, a  Self-loss. Further it will be found that this language is often an  attempt to describe the conditions of transitory perception, not those  of permanent existence: the characteristics, that is to say, of the  Ecstatic Trance, in which for a short time the whole self is lifted to  transcendent levels, and the Absolute is apprehended by a total  suspension of the surface consciousness. Hence the Divine Dark, the  Nothing, is not a state of non-being to which the mystic aspires  <a name="page_172"><font size="1" color="green">p. 172</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.i-Page_172"></A> to attain: it is rather a paradoxical  description of his experience of that Undifferentiated Godhead, that  Supernal Light whence he may, in his ecstasies, bring down fire from  heaven to light the world.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.i-p20"></A>In the mystics of the West, the highest forms of  Divine Union impel the self to some sort of active, rather than of  passive life: and this is now recognized by the best authorities as  the true distinction between Christian and non-Christian mysticism.  &#8220;The Christian mystics,&#8221; says Delacroix, &#8220;move from  the Infinite to the Definite; they aspire to infinitize life and to  define Infinity; they go from the conscious to the subconscious, and  from the subconscious to the conscious. The obstacle in their path is  not consciousness in general, but   <i>self</i>   -consciousness, the consciousness of the Ego. The Ego is the  limitation, that which opposes itself to the Infinite: the states of  consciousness free from self, lost in a vaster consciousness, may  become modes of the Infinite, and states of the Divine  Consciousness.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_334"></A><A HREF="#fn_334"><FONT SIZE="1">335</FONT></A>
    So Starbuck: &#8220;The individual learns to transfer himself from a  centre of self-activity into an organ of revelation of universal  being, and to live a life of affection for and one-ness with, the  larger life outside.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_335"></A><A HREF="#fn_335"><FONT SIZE="1">336</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.i-p23"></A>Hence, the ideal of the great contemplatives, the end  of their long education, is to become &#8220;modes of the  Infinite.&#8221; Filled with an abounding sense of the Divine Life, of  ultimate and adorable reality, sustaining and urging them on, they  wish to communicate the revelation, the more abundant life, which they  have received. Not spiritual marriage, but divine fecundity is to be  their final state. In a sense St. Teresa in the Seventh Habitation,  Suso when his great renunciation is made, have achieved the quest, yet  there is nothing passive in the condition to which they have come. Not  Galahad, but the Grail-bearer is now their type: and in their life,  words or works they are impelled to exhibit that &#8220;Hidden  Treasure which desires to be found.&#8221;</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.i-p24"></A>&#8220;You may think, my daughters,&#8221; says St.  Teresa, &#8220;that the soul in this state [of union] should be so  absorbed that she can occupy herself with nothing. You deceive  yourselves. She turns with greater ease and ardour than before to all  that which belongs to the service of God, and when these occupations  leave her free again, she remains in the enjoyment of that  companionship.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_336"></A><A HREF="#fn_336"><FONT SIZE="1">337</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.i-p26"></A>No temperament is less slothful than the mystical one;  and the &#8220;quiet&#8221; to which the mystics must school  themselves in the early stages of contemplation is often the hardest  of their tasks. The abandonment of bodily and intellectual activity is  only <a name="page_173"><font size="1" color="green">p. 173</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.i-Page_173"></A> undertaken in order that they may,  in the words of Plotinus, &#8220;energize enthusiastically&#8221; upon  another plane. Work they must but this work may take many  forms&#8212;forms which are sometimes so wholly spiritual that they  are not perceptible to practical minds. Much of the misunderstanding  and consequent contempt of the contemplative life comes from the  narrow and superficial definition of &#8220;work&#8221; which is set  up by a muscular and wage-earning community.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.i-p27"></A>All records of mysticism in the West, then, are also  the records of supreme human activity. Not only of &#8220;wrestlers in  the spirit&#8221; but also of great organizers, such as St. Teresa and  St. John of the Cross; of missionaries preaching life to the  spiritually dead, such as St. Francis of Assisi, St. Ignatius Loyola,  Eckhart, Suso Tauler, Fox; of philanthropists, such as St. Catherine  of Genoa or St. Vincent de Paul; poets and prophets, such as Mechthild  of Magdeburg, Jacopone da Todi and Blake, finally, of some immensely  virile souls whose participation in the Absolute Life has seemed to  force on them a national destiny. Of this St. Bernard, St. Catherine  of Siena, and Saint Joan of Arc are the supreme examples. &#8220;The  soul enamoured of My Truth,&#8221; said God&#8217;s voice to St.  Catherine of Siena, &#8220;never ceases to serve the whole world in  general.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_337"></A><A HREF="#fn_337"><FONT SIZE="1">338</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.i-p29"></A>Utterly remade in the interests of Reality, exhibiting  that dual condition of fruition and activity which Ruysbroeck  described as the crowning stage of human evolution, the &#8220;Supreme  summit of the Inner Life,&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_338"></A><A HREF="#fn_338"><FONT SIZE="1">339</FONT></A>
    all these lived, as it were, with both hands towards the finite and  towards the Infinite, towards God and man. It is true that in nearly  every case such &#8220;great actives&#8221; have first left the world,  as a necessary condition of establishing communion with that Absolute  Life which reinforced their own: for a mind distracted by the many  cannot apprehend the One. Hence something equivalent to the solitude  of the wilderness is an essential part of mystical education. But,  having established that communion, re-ordered their inner lives upon  transcendent levels&#8212;being united with their Source not merely in  temporary ecstasies, but in virtue of a permanent condition of the  soul, they were impelled to abandon their solitude; and resumed, in  some way, their contact with the world in order to become the medium  whereby that Life flowed out to other men. To go up alone into the  mountain and come back as an ambassador to the world, has ever been  the method of humanity&#8217;s best friends. This systole-and-diastole  motion of retreat as the preliminary to a return remains the true  ideal of Christian Mysticism in its highest development. Those in  <a name="page_174"><font size="1" color="green">p. 174</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.i-Page_174"></A> whom it is not found, however great in  other respects they may be, must be considered as having stopped short  of the final stage.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.i-p31"></A>Thus St. Catherine of Siena spent three years in  hermit-like seclusion in the little room which we still see in her  house in the Via Benincasa, entirely cut off from the ordinary life of  her family. &#8220;Within her own house,&#8221; says her legend,  &#8220;she found the desert; and a solitude in the midst of  people.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_339"></A><A HREF="#fn_339"><FONT SIZE="1">340</FONT></A>
    There Catherine endured many mortifications, was visited by ecstasies  and visions: passed, in fact, through the states of Purgation and  Illumination, which existed in her case side by side. This life of  solitude was brought to an abrupt end by the experience which is  symbolized in the vision of the Mystic Marriage, and the Voice which  then said to her, &#8220;Now will I wed thy soul, which shall ever be  conjoined and united to Me!&#8221; Catherine, who had during her long  retreat enjoyed illumination to a high degree, now entered upon the  Unitive State, in which the whole of her public life was passed. Its  effect was immediately noticeable. She abandoned her solitude, joined  in the family life, went out into the city to serve the poor and sick,  attracted and taught disciples, converted sinners, and began that  career of varied and boundless activity which has made her name one of  the greatest in the history of the fourteenth century. Nor does this  mean that she ceased to live the sort of life which is characteristic  of mystical consciousness: to experience direct contact with the  Transcendental World, to gaze into &#8220;the Abyss of Love  Divine.&#8221; On the contrary, her practical genius for affairs, her  immense power of ruling men, drew its strength from the long series of  visions and ecstasies which accompanied and supported her labours in  the world. She &#8220;descended into the valley of lilies to make  herself more fruitful,&#8221; says her legend.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_340"></A><A HREF="#fn_340"><FONT SIZE="1">341</FONT></A>
    The conscious vehicle of some &#8220;power not herself,&#8221; she  spoke and acted with an authority which might have seemed strange  enough in an uneducated daughter of the people, were it not justified  by the fact that all who came into contact with her submitted to its  influence.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.i-p34"></A>Our business, then, is to trace from its beginning a  gradual and complete change in the equilibrium of the self. It is a  change whereby that self turns from the unreal world of sense in which  it is normally immersed, first to apprehend, then to unite itself with  Absolute Reality: finally, possessed by and wholly surrendered to this  Transcendent Life, becomes a medium whereby the spiritual world is  seen in a unique degree operating directly in the world of sense. In  other words, we are to see the human mind advance from the mere  perception of phenomena, through the <a name="page_175"><font size="1" color="green">p. 175</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.i-Page_175"></A>  intuition&#8212;with occasional contact&#8212;of the Absolute under  its aspect of Divine Transcendence, to the entire realization of, and  union with, Absolute Life under its aspect of Divine Immanence.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.i-p35"></A>The completed mystical life, then, is more than  intuitional: it is theopathetic. In the old, frank language of the  mystics, it is the   <i>deified life</i>   .</p>
