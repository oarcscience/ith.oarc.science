<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p1"></A>In<A NAME="an_iv.iv-p1.1"></A> illumination we come to that state of consciousness which is  popularly supposed to be peculiar to the mystic: a form of mental  life, a kind of perception, radically different from that of  &#8220;normal&#8221; men. His preceding adventures and experiences  cannot be allowed this quality. His awakening to consciousness of the  Absolute&#8212;though often marked by a splendour and intensity which  seem to distinguish it from other psychic upheavals of that  kind&#8212;does but reproduce upon higher levels those characteristic  processes of conversion and falling in love which give depth and  actuality to the religious and passional life. The purification to  which he then sets himself&#8212;though this possesses as a rule  certain features peculiar to mystical development&#8212;is again  closely related to the disciplines and mortifications of ascetic, but  not necessarily mystical, piety. It is the most exalted form with  which we are acquainted of that   <i>catharsis&#8212;</i>   that pruning and training of the human plant&#8212;which is the  essence of all education, and a necessary stage in every kind of  transcendence. Here, the mystic does but adopt in a more drastic form  the principles which all who would live with an intense life, all  seekers after freedom, all true lovers must accept: though he may  justly claim with Ophelia that these wear their rue with a difference.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_476"></A><A HREF="#fn_476"><FONT SIZE="1">477</FONT></A>
    <a name="page_233"><font size="1" color="green">p. 233</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iv-Page_233"></A></p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p3"></A>But in the great swing back into sunshine which is the  reward of that painful descent into the &#8220;cell of  self-knowledge,&#8221; he parts company with these other pilgrims.  Those who still go with him a little way&#8212;certain prophets,  poets, artists, dreamers do so in virtue of that mystical genius, that  instinct for transcendental reality, of which all seers and creators  have some trace. The initiates of beauty or of wisdom, as the great  mystic is the initiate of love, they share in some degree the  experiences of the way of illumination. But the mystic has now a  veritable foothold in that transcendental world into which they  penetrate now and again: enjoys a certain fellowship&#8212;not yet  union&#8212;with the &#8220;great life of the All,&#8221; and thence  draws strength and peace. Really and actually, as one whose noviciate  is finished, he has &#8220;entered the Inner Choir, where the Soul  joineth hands and danceth with Sophia, the Divine Wisdom&#8221;: and,  keeping time with the great rhythms of the spiritual universe, feels  that he has found his place.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p4"></A>This change of consciousness, however abrupt and  amazing it may seem to the self which experiences it, seems to the  psychologist a normal phase in that organic process of development  which was initiated by the awakening of the transcendental sense.  Responding to the intimations received in that awakening, ordering  itself in their interest, concentrating its scattered energies on this  one thing, the self emerges from long and varied acts of purification  to find that it is able to apprehend another order of reality. It has  achieved consciousness of a world that was always there, and wherein  its substantial being&#8212;that Ground which is of God&#8212;has  always stood. Such a consciousness is &#8220;Transcendental  Feeling&#8221; <A NAME="an_iv.iv-p4.1"></A>  <i>in excelsis</i>     <i>:</i>    a deep, intuitional knowledge of the &#8220;secret plan.&#8221;</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p5"></A>&#8220;We are like a choir who stand round the  conductor,&#8221; says Plotinus, &#8220;but do not always sing in  tune, because their attention is diverted by looking at external  things. So we always move round the One&#8212;if we did not, we should  dissolve and cease to exist&#8212;but we do not always look towards  the One.&#8221; Hence, instead of that free and conscious co-operation  in the great life of the All which alone can make personal life worth  living, we move like slaves or marionettes, and, oblivious of the  whole to which our little steps contribute, fail to observe the  measure &#8220;whereto the worlds keep time.&#8221; Our minds being  distracted from the Corypheus in the midst the &#8220;energetic  Word&#8221; who sets the rhythm, we do not behold Him. We are absorbed  in the illusions of sense; the &#8220;eye which looks on  Eternity&#8221; is idle. &#8220;But when we   <i>do</i>    behold Him,&#8221; says Plotinus again, &#8220;we attain the end of  our existence and our rest. Then we no longer sing out of tune, but  form a truly divine chorus about Him; in the which chorus dance the  soul beholds the Fountain of life <a name="page_234"><font size="1" color="green">p. 234</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iv-Page_234"></A> the  Fountain of intellect, the Principle of Being, the cause of good the  root of soul.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_477"></A><A HREF="#fn_477"><FONT SIZE="1">478</FONT></A>
    Such a beholding, such a lifting of consciousness from a self-centred  to a God-centred world, is of the essence of illumination.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p7"></A>It will be observed that in these passages the claim  of the mystic is not yet to supreme communion; the &#8220;Spiritual  Marriage&#8221; of the Christian mystic, or that &#8220;flight of the  Alone to the Alone&#8221; which is the Plotinian image for the utmost  bliss of the emancipated soul. He has now got through preliminaries;  detached himself from his chief entanglements; re-orientated his  instinctive life. The result is a new and solid certitude about God,  and his own soul&#8217;s relation to God: an  &#8220;enlightenment&#8221; in which he is adjusted to new standards  of conduct and thought. In the traditional language of asceticism he  is &#8220;proficient&#8221; but not yet perfect. He achieves a real  vision and knowledge, a conscious harmony with the divine World of  Becoming: not yet self-loss in the Principle of Life, but rather a  willing and harmonious revolution about Him, that &#8220;in dancing he  may know what is done.&#8221; This character distinguishes almost  every first-hand description of illumination: and it is this which  marks it off from mystic union in all its forms. All pleasurable and  exalted states of mystic consciousness in which the sense of I-hood  persists, in which there is a loving and joyous relation between the  Absolute as object and the self as subject, fall under the head of  Illumination: which is really an enormous development of the  intuitional life at high levels. All veritable and first-hand  apprehensions of the Divine obtained by the use of symbols, as in the  religious life; all the degrees of prayer lying between meditation and  the prayer of union; many phases of poetic inspiration and  &#8220;glimpses of truth,&#8221; are activities of the illuminated  mind.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p8"></A>To &#8220;see God in nature,&#8221; to attain a  radiant consciousness of the &#8220;otherness&#8221; of natural  things, is the simplest and commonest form of illumination. Most  people, under the spell of emotion or of beauty, have known flashes of  rudimentary vision of this kind. Where such a consciousness is  recurrent, as it is in many poets,  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_478"></A><A HREF="#fn_478"><FONT SIZE="1">479</FONT></A>
    there results that partial yet often overpowering apprehension of the  Infinite Life immanent in all living things, which some modern writers  have dignified by the name of &#8220;nature-mysticism.&#8221; <a name="page_235"><font size="1" color="green">p. 235</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iv-Page_235"></A> Where it is raised to its highest  denomination, till the veil is obliterated by the light behind, and  &#8220;faith has vanished into sight,&#8221; as sometimes happened to  Blake, we reach the point at which the mystic swallows up the  poet.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p10"></A>&#8220;Dear Sir,&#8221; says that great genius in one  of his most characteristic letters, written immediately after an onset  of the illuminated vision which he had lost for many years,  &#8220;excuse my enthusiasm, or rather madness, for I am really drunk  with intellectual vision whenever I take a pencil or graver into my  hand.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_479"></A><A HREF="#fn_479"><FONT SIZE="1">480</FONT></A>
    Many a great painter, philosopher, or poet, perhaps every inspired  musician, has known this indescribable inebriation of Reality in those  moments of transcendence in which his masterpieces were conceived.  This is the &#8220;saving madness&#8221; of which Plato speaks in the  &#8220;Phaedrus&#8221;; the ecstasy of the &#8220;God-intoxicated  man,&#8221; the lover, the prophet, and the poet &#8220;drunk with  life.&#8221; When the Christian mystic, eager for his birthright, says  <A NAME="an_iv.iv-p11.1"></A>&#8220;Sanguis Christi, inebria me!&#8221;   he is asking for just such a gift of supernal  vitality, a draught of that Wine of Absolute Life which runs in the  arteries of the world. Those to whom that cup is given attain to an  intenser degree of vitality, hence to a more acute degree of  perception, a more vivid consciousness, than that which is enjoyed by  other men. For though, as Ruysbroeck warns us, this &#8220;is not  God,&#8221; yet it is for many selves &#8220;the Light in which we see  Him.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_480"></A><A HREF="#fn_480"><FONT SIZE="1">481</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p13"></A>Blake conceived that it was his vocation to bring this  mystical illumination, this heightened vision of reality, within the  range of ordinary men: to &#8220;cleanse the doors of  perception&#8221; of the race. They thought him a madman for his  pains.</p>   <blockquote><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p13.1"></A> &#8220;. . . I rest not upon my great task<br>   To open the Eternal Worlds, to open the immortal  Eyes<br>   Of Man inwards into the Worlds of Thought: into  Eternity<br>   Ever expanding in the Bosom of God, the Human  Imagination.<br>   O Saviour, pour upon me thy Spirit of meekness and  love,<br>   Annihilate the Selfhood in me: be thou all my  life.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_481"></A><A HREF="#fn_481"><FONT SIZE="1">482</FONT></A>
  <br>  </blockquote>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p15"></A>The Mysteries of the antique world appear to have been  attempts&#8212;often by way of a merely magical initiation&#8212;to  &#8220;open the immortal eyes of man inwards&#8221;: exalt his powers  of perception until they could receive the messages of a higher degree  of reality. In spite of much eager theorizing, it is impossible to  tell how far they succeeded in this task. To those who had a natural  genius for the Infinite, symbols and rituals which were doubtless  charged with ecstatic suggestions, and often dramatized the actual  course of <a name="page_236"><font size="1" color="green">p. 236</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iv-Page_236"></A> the Mystic Way, may well have  brought some enhancement of consciousness:  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_482"></A><A HREF="#fn_482"><FONT SIZE="1">483</FONT></A>
    though hardly that complete rearrangement of character which is an  essential of the mystic&#8217;s entrance on the true Illuminated  State. Hence Plato only claims that &#8220;he whose initiation is  recent&#8221; can see Immortal Beauty under mortal veils.</p>   <blockquote><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p16.1"></A> &#8220;O bless&egrave;d he in all wise,<br>   Who hath drunk the Living Fountain<br>   Whose life no folly staineth<br>   And whose soul is near to God:<br>   Whose sins are lifted pall-wise<br>   As he worships on the Mountain.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_483"></A><A HREF="#fn_483"><FONT SIZE="1">484</FONT></A>
  <br>  </blockquote>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p18"></A>Thus sang the initiates of Dionysus; that  mystery-cult in which the Greeks seem to have expressed all they knew  of the possible movement of consciousness through rites of  purification to the ecstasy of the Illuminated Life. The mere crude  rapture of illumination has seldom been more vividly expressed. With  its half-Oriental fervours, its self-regarding glory in personal  purification achieved, and the spiritual superiority conferred by  adeptship, may be compared the deeper and lovelier experience of the  Catholic poet and saint, who represents the spirit of Western  mysticism at its best. His sins, too, had been &#8220;lifted  pall-wise&#8221; as a cloud melts in the sunshine of Divine Love: but  here the centre of interest is not the little self which has been  exalted, but the greater Self which deigns thus to exalt.</p>   <blockquote><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p18.1"></A> &#8220;O burn that burns to heal!<br>   O more than pleasant wound!<br>   And O soft hand, O touch most delicate<br>   That dost new life reveal<br>   That dost in grace abound<br>   And, slaying, dost from death to life  translate.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_484"></A><A HREF="#fn_484"><FONT SIZE="1">485</FONT></A>
  <br>  </blockquote>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p20"></A>Here the joy is as passionate, the consciousness of an  exalted life as intense: but it is dominated by the distinctive  Christian concepts of humility, surrender, and intimate love.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p21"></A>We have seen that all real artists, as well as all  pure mystics, are sharers to some degree in the Illuminated Life. They  have drunk, with Blake, from that cup of intellectual vision which is  the chalice of the Spirit of Life: know something of its divine  inebriation whenever Beauty inspires them to create. Some have only  sipped <a name="page_237"><font size="1" color="green">p. 237</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iv-Page_237"></A> it. Some, like John of Parma,  have drunk deep, accepting in that act the mystic heritage with all  its obligations. But to all who have seen Beauty face to face, the  Grail has been administered; and through that sacramental communion  they are made participants in the mystery of the world.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p22"></A>In one of the most beautiful passages of the  &#8220;Fioretti&#8221; it is told how Brother Jacques of la Massa,  &#8220;unto whom God opened the door of His secrets,&#8221; saw in a  vision this Chalice of the Spirit of Life delivered by Christ into the  hands of St. Francis, that he might give his brothers to drink  thereof.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p23"></A>&#8220;Then came St. Francis to give the chalice of  life to his brothers. And he gave it first to Brother John of Parma:  who, taking it drank it all in haste, devoutly; and straightway he  became all shining like the sun. And after him St. Francis gave it to  all the other brothers in order: and there were but few among them  that took it with due reverence and devotion and drank it all. Those  that took it devoutly and drank it all, became straightway shining  like the sun; but those that spilled it all and took it not devoutly,  became black, and dark, and misshapen and horrible to see; but those  that drank part and spilled part, became partly shining and partly  dark, and more so or less according to the measure of their drinking  or spilling thereof. But the aforesaid Brother John was resplendent  above all the rest; the which had more completely drunk the chalice of  life,   <i>whereby he had the more deeply gazed into the abyss of the infinite  light divine</i>   .&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_485"></A><A HREF="#fn_485"><FONT SIZE="1">486</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p25"></A>No image, perhaps, could suggest so accurately as this  divine picture the conditions of perfect illumination: the drinking  deeply, devoutly, and in haste&#8212;that is, without prudent and  self-regarding hesitation&#8212;of the heavenly Wine of Life; that  wine of which Rolle says that it &#8220;fulfils the soul with a great  gladness through a sweet contemplation.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_486"></A><A HREF="#fn_486"><FONT SIZE="1">487</FONT></A>
    John of Parma, the hero of those Spiritual Franciscans in whose  interest this exquisite allegory was composed, stands for all the  mystics, who, &#8220;having completely drunk,&#8221; have attained the  power of gazing into the abyss of the infinite light divine. In those  imperfect brothers who dared not drink the cup of sacrifice to the  dregs, but took part and spilled part, so that they became partly  shining and partly dark, &#8220;according to the measure of their  drinking or spilling thereof,&#8221; we may see an image of the  artist, musician, prophet, poet, dreamer, more or less illuminated  according to the measure of courage and self-abandonment in which he  has drunk the cup of ecstasy: but always in comparison with the  radiance of the pure contemplative, &#8220;partly shining and partly  dark.&#8221; &#8220;Hinder me not,&#8221; says the soul to the <a name="page_238"><font size="1" color="green">p. 238</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iv-Page_238"></A> senses in Mechthild of Magdeburg&#8217;s  vision, &#8220;I would drink for a space of the unmingled wine.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_487"></A><A HREF="#fn_487"><FONT SIZE="1">488</FONT></A>
    In the artist, the senses have somewhat hindered the perfect  inebriation of the soul.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p28"></A>We have seen that a vast tract of experience&#8212;all  the experience which results from contact between a purged and  heightened consciousness and the World of Becoming in which it is  immersed; and much, too, of that which results from contact set up  between such a consciousness and the Absolute Itself&#8212;is included  in that stage of growth which the mystics call the Illuminative Way.  This is the largest and most densely populated province of the mystic  kingdom. Such different visionaries as Suso and Blake, Boehme and  Angela of Foligno, Mechthild of Magdeburg, Fox, Rolle, St. Teresa, and  countless others have left us the record of their sojourn therein.  Amongst those who cannot be called pure mystics we can detect in the  works of Plato and Heracleitus, Wordsworth, Tennyson, and Walt Whitman  indications that they too were acquainted, beyond most poets and  seers, with the phenomena of the illuminated life. In studying it  then, we shall be confronted by a mass of apparently irreconcilable  material: the results of the relation set up between every degree of  lucidity, every kind of character, and the suprasensible world.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p29"></A>To say that God is Infinite is to say that He may be  apprehended and described in an infinity of ways. That Circle whose  centre is everywhere and whose circumference is nowhere, may be  approached from every angle with a certainty of being found. Mystical  history, particularly that which deals with the Illuminative Way, is a  demonstration of this fact. Here, in the establishment of the  &#8220;first mystic life,&#8221; of conscious correspondence with  Reality, the self which has oscillated between two forms of  consciousness, has alternately opposed and embraced its growing  intuitions of the Absolute, comes for a time to rest. To a large  extent, the discordant elements of character have been purged away.  Temporally at least the mind has &#8220;unified itself&#8221; upon  high levels, and attained, as it believes, a genuine consciousness of  the divine and veritable world. The depth and richness of its own  nature will determine how intense that consciousness shall be.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p30"></A>Whatever its scope, however, this new apprehension of  reality generally appears to the illuminated Self as final and  complete. As the true lover is always convinced that he has found in  his bride the one Rose of the World, so the mystic, in the first glow  of his initiation, is sure that his quest is now fulfilled. Ignorant  as yet of that consummation of love which overpasses the proceedings  of the inward eye and ear, he exclaims with entire assurance  <A NAME="an_iv.iv-p30.1"></A>&#8220;Beati oculi qui exterioribus clausi,  interioribus autem sunt <a name="page_239"><font size="1" color="green">p. 239</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iv-Page_239"></A>  intenti,&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_488"></A><A HREF="#fn_488"><FONT SIZE="1">489</FONT></A>
    and, absorbed in this new blissful act of vision, forgets that it  belongs to those who are still <A NAME="an_iv.iv-p31.1"></A>   <i>in via</i>   . He has yet to pass through that &#8220;night of the  senses&#8221; in which he learns to distinguish the substance of  Reality from the accidents under which it is perceived; to discover  that the heavenly food here given cannot satisfy his &#8220;hunger for  the Absolute.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_489"></A><A HREF="#fn_489"><FONT SIZE="1">490</FONT></A>
    His true goal lies far beyond this joyful basking in the sunbeams of  the Uncreated Light. Only the greatest souls learn this lesson, and  tread the whole of that &#8220;King&#8217;s Highway&#8221; which leads  man back to his Source. &#8220;For the many that come to Bethlehem,  there be few that will go on to Calvary.&#8221; The rest stay here, in  this Earthly Paradise, these flowery fields; where the liberated self  wanders at will, describing to us as well as it can now this corner,  now that of the Country of the Soul.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p33"></A>It is in these descriptions of the joy of  illumination&#8212;in the outpourings of love and rapture belonging to  this state&#8212;that we find the most lyrical passages of mystical  literature. Here poet, mystic, and musician are on common ground: for  it is only by the oblique methods of the artist, by the use of  aesthetic suggestion and musical rhythm, that the wonder of that  vision can be expressed. When essential goodness, truth, and  beauty&#8212;Light, Life, and Love&#8212;are apprehended by the heart,  whether the heart be that of poet, painter, lover, or saint, that  apprehension can only be communicated in a living, that is to say, an  artistic form. The natural mind is conscious only of succession: the  special   <i>differentia</i>    of the mystic is the power of apprehending simultaneity. In the  peculiarities of the illuminated consciousness we recognize the effort  of the mind to bridge the gap between Simultaneity and Succession: the  characters of Creator and Creation. Here the successive is called upon  to carry the values of the Eternal.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p34"></A>Here, then, genius and sanctity kiss one another; and  each, in that sublime encounter, looks for an instant through the  other&#8217;s eyes. Hence it is natural and inevitable that the mystic  should here call into play all the resources of artistic expression:  the lovely imagery of Julian and Mechthild of Magdeburg, Suso&#8217;s  poetic visions, St. Augustine&#8217;s fire and light, the heavenly  harmonies of St. Francis and Richard Rolle. Symbols, too, play a major  part, not only in the description, but also in the machinery of  illumination: the intuitions of many mystics presenting themselves  directly to the surface-mind in a symbolic form. We must therefore be  prepared for a great variety and fluidity of expression, a constant  and not always conscious recourse to symbol and image, in those <a name="page_240"><font size="1" color="green">p. 240</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iv-Page_240"></A> who try to communicate the secret of this  state of consciousness. We must examine, and even classify so far as  possible, a wide variety of experience&#8212;some which is recognized  by friends and foes alike as purely &#8220;mystical,&#8221; some in  which the operation of poetic imagination is clearly discernible, some  which involves &#8220;psychic phenomena&#8221; and other abnormal  activities of the mind&#8212;refusing to be frightened away from  investigation by the strange, and apparently irreconcilable character  of our material.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p35"></A>There are three main types of experience which appear  again and again in the history of mysticism; nearly always in  connection with illumination, rather than any other phase of mystical  development. I think that they may fairly be regarded as its main  characteristics, though the discussion of them cannot cover all the  ground. In few forms of spiritual life is the spontaneity of the  individual so clearly seen as here: and in few is the ever-deadly  process of classification attended with so many risks.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p36"></A>These three characteristics are:&#8212;</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p37"></A>1. A joyous apprehension of the Absolute: that which  many ascetic writers call &#8220;the practice of the Presence of  God.&#8221; This, however, is not to be confused with that unique  consciousness of union with the divine which is peculiar to a later  stage of mystical development. The self, though purified, still  realizes itself as a separate entity over against God. It is not  immersed in its Origin, but contemplates it. This is the  &#8220;betrothal&#8221; rather than the &#8220;marriage&#8221; of the  soul.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p38"></A>2. This clarity of vision may also be enjoyed in  regard to the phenomenal world. The actual physical perceptions seem  to be strangely heightened, so that the self perceives an added  significance and reality in all natural things: is often convinced  that it knows at last &#8220;the secret of the world.&#8221; In  Blake&#8217;s words &#8220;the doors of perception are cleansed&#8221;  so that &#8220;everything appears to man as it   <i>is</i>   , infinite.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_490"></A><A HREF="#fn_490"><FONT SIZE="1">491</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p40"></A>In these two forms of perception we see the growing  consciousness of the mystic stretching in two directions, until it  includes in its span both the World of Being and the World of  Becoming;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_491"></A><A HREF="#fn_491"><FONT SIZE="1">492</FONT></A>
    that dual apprehension of reality as transcendent yet immanent which  we found to be one of the distinguishing marks of the mystic type.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p42"></A>3. Along with this two-fold extension of  consciousness, the energy of the intuitional or transcendental self  may be enormously increased. The psychic upheavals of the Purgative  Way have tended to make it central for life: to eliminate from the  character all those elements which checked its activity. Now it seizes  upon <a name="page_241"><font size="1" color="green">p. 241</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iv-Page_241"></A> the ordinary channels of  expression; and may show itself in such forms as (a) auditions, (b)  dialogues between the surface consciousness and another intelligence  which purports to be divine, (c) visions, and sometimes (d) in  automatic writings. In many selves this automatic activity of those  growing but still largely subconscious powers which constitute the  &#8220;New Man,&#8221; increases steadily during the whole of the  mystic life.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p43"></A>Illumination, then, tends to appear mainly under one  or all of these three forms. Often all are present; though, as a rule,  one is dominant. The balance of characteristics will be conditioned in  each case by the self&#8217;s psychic make-up; its temperamental  leaning towards &#8220;pure contemplation,&#8221; &#8220;lucid  vision,&#8221; or automatic expression; emanation or immanence, the  metaphysical, artistic, or intimate aspects of truth. The possible  combinations between these various factors are as innumerable as the  possible creations of Life itself.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p44"></A>In the wonderful rhapsodies of St. Augustine, in St.  Bernard&#8217;s converse with the Word, in Angela of Foligno&#8217;s  apprehensions of Deity, in Richard Rolle&#8217;s &#8220;state of  song,&#8221; when &#8220;sweetest heavenly melody he took, with him  dwelling in mind,&#8221; or in Brother Lawrence&#8217;s  &#8220;practice of the Presence of God,&#8221; we may see varied  expressions of the first type of illuminated consciousness. Jacob  Boehme is rightly looked upon as a classic example of the second;  which is also found in one of its most attractive forms in St. Francis  of Assisi. Suso and St. Teresa, perhaps, may stand for the third,  since in them the visionary and auditory phenomena were peculiarly  well marked. A further study of each characteristic in order, will  help us to disentangle the many threads which go to the psychical  make-up of these great and complex mystic types. The rest of this  chapter will, then, be given to the analysis of the two chief forms of  illuminated consciousness: the self&#8217;s perception of Reality in  the eternal and temporal worlds. The important subject of voices and  visions demands a division to itself.</p>   <h4 align="center"><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p44.1"></A>I. The Consciousness of the Absolute, or &#8220;Sense of the  Presence of God&#8221;</h4>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p45"></A>This consciousness, in its various forms and degrees,  is perhaps the most constant characteristic of Illumination; and makes  it, for the mystic soul, a pleasure-state of the intensest kind. I do  not mean by this that the subject passes months or years in a  continuous ecstasy of communion with the Divine. Intermittent periods  of spiritual fatigue or &#8220;aridity&#8221;&#8212;renewals of the  temperamental conflicts experienced in purgation&#8212;the oncoming  gloom of the Dark Night&#8212;all these may be, and often are,  experienced <a name="page_242"><font size="1" color="green">p. 242</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iv-Page_242"></A> at intervals during the  Illuminated Life; as flashes of insight, indistinguishable from  illumination, constantly break the monotony of the Purgative Way. But  a deep certitude of the Personal Life omnipresent in the universe has  been achieved; and this can never be forgotten, even though it be  withdrawn. The &#8220;spirit stretching towards God&#8221; declares  that it has touched Him; and its normal condition henceforth is joyous  consciousness of His Presence with &#8220;many privy touchings of  sweet spiritual sights and feeling, measured to us as our simpleness  may bear it.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_492"></A><A HREF="#fn_492"><FONT SIZE="1">493</FONT></A>
    Where he prefers less definite or more pantheistic language, the  mystic&#8217;s perceptions may take the form of &#8220;harmony with  the Infinite&#8221;&#8212;the same divine music transposed to a lower  key.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p47"></A>This &#8220;sense of God&#8221; is not a metaphor.  Innumerable declarations prove it to be a consciousness as sharp as  that which other men have, or think they have, of colour, heat, or  light. It is a well-known though usually transitory experience in the  religious life: like the homing instinct of birds, a fact which can  neither be denied nor explained. &#8220;How that presence is felt, it  may better be known by experience than by any writing,&#8221; says  Hilton, &#8220;for it is the life and the love, the might and the  light, the joy and the rest of a chosen soul. And therefore he that  hath soothfastly once felt it he may not forbear it without pain; he  may not undesire it, it is so good in itself and so comfortable. . . .  He cometh privily sometimes when thou art least aware of Him, but thou  shalt well know Him or He go; for wonderfully He stirreth and mightily  He turneth thy heart into beholding of His goodness, and doth thine  heart melt delectably as wax against the fire into softness of His  love.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_493"></A><A HREF="#fn_493"><FONT SIZE="1">494</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p49"></A>Modern psychologists have struggled hard to discredit  this &#8220;sense of the presence&#8221;; sometimes attributing it to  the psychic mechanism of projection, sometimes to  &#8220;wish-fulfilments&#8221; of a more unpleasant origin.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_494"></A><A HREF="#fn_494"><FONT SIZE="1">495</FONT></A>
    The mystics, however, who discriminate so much more delicately than  their critics between true and false transcendental experience, never  feel any doubt about its validity. Even when their experience seems  inconsistent with their theology, they refuse to be disturbed.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p51"></A>Thus St. Teresa writes of her own experience, with her  usual simplicity and directness, &#8220;In the beginning it happened  to me that I was ignorant of one thing&#8212;I did not know that God  was in all things: and when He seemed to me to be so near, I thought  it impossible. Not to believe that He was present was not in my <a name="page_243"><font size="1" color="green">p. 243</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iv-Page_243"></A> power; for it seemed to me, as it were,  evident that I felt there His very presence. Some unlearned men used  to say to me, that He was present only by His grace.   <i>I</i>      <i>could not believe that,</i>    because, as I am saying, He seemed to me to be present Himself: so I  was distressed. A most learned man, of the Order of the glorious  Patriarch St. Dominic, delivered me from this doubt, for he told me  that He was present, and how He communed with us: this was a great  comfort to me.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_495"></A><A HREF="#fn_495"><FONT SIZE="1">496</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p53"></A>Again, &#8220;An interior peace, and the little  strength which either pleasures or displeasures have to remove this  presence (during the time it lasts) of the Three Persons, and that  without power to doubt of it, continue in such a manner that I clearly  seem to experience what St. John says,   <i>That He will dwell in the soul,</i>    and this not only by grace, but that He will also make her perceive  this presence.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_496"></A><A HREF="#fn_496"><FONT SIZE="1">497</FONT></A>
    St. Teresa&#8217;s strong &#8220;immanental&#8221; bent comes out  well in this passage.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p55"></A>Such a sense of the divine presence may go side by  side with the daily life and normal mental activities of its  possessor; who is not necessarily an ecstatic or an abstracted  visionary, remote from the work of the world. It is true that the  transcendental consciousness has now become, once for all, his centre  of interest, its perceptions and admonitions dominate and light up his  daily life. The object of education, in the Platonic sense, has been  achieved: his soul has &#8220;wheeled round from the perishing  world&#8221; to &#8220;the contemplation of the real world and the  brightest part thereof.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_497"></A><A HREF="#fn_497"><FONT SIZE="1">498</FONT></A>
    But where vocation and circumstances require it, the duties of a busy  outward life continue to be fulfilled with steadiness and success: and  this without detriment to the soul&#8217;s contemplation of the  Real.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p57"></A>In many temperaments of the unstable or artistic type,  however, this intuitional consciousness of the Absolute becomes  ungovernable: it constantly breaks through, obtaining forcible  possession of the mental field and expressing itself in the  &#8220;psychic&#8221; phenomena of ecstasy and rapture. In others,  less mobile, it wells up into an impassioned apprehension, a  &#8220;flame of love&#8221; in which the self seems to &#8220;meet God  in the ground of the soul.&#8221; This is &#8220;pure  contemplation&#8221;: that state of deep orison in which the subject  seems to be &#8220;seeing, feeling and thinking all at once.&#8221; By  this spontaneous exercise of all his powers under the dominion of  love, the mystic attains that &#8220;Vision of the Heart&#8221; which,  &#8220;more interior, perhaps, than the visions of dream or  ecstasy,&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_498"></A><A HREF="#fn_498"><FONT SIZE="1">499</FONT></A>
    stretches <a name="page_244"><font size="1" color="green">p. 244</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iv-Page_244"></A> to the full those very  faculties which it seems to be holding in suspense; as a top  &#8220;sleeps&#8221; when it is spinning fast. <A NAME="an_iv.iv-p58.1"></A>   <i>Ego dormio et cor meum vigilat</i>     .    This act of contemplation, this glad surrender to an overwhelming  consciousness of the Presence of God, leaves no sharp image on the  mind: only a knowledge that we have been lifted up, to a veritable  gazing upon That which eye hath not seen.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p59"></A>St. Bernard gives in one of his sermons a simple,  ingenuous and obviously personal account of such &#8220;privy  touchings,&#8221; such convincing but elusive contacts of the soul  with the Absolute. &#8220;Now bear with my foolishness for a  little,&#8221; he says, &#8220;for I wish to tell you, as I have  promised, how such events have taken place in me. It is, indeed, a  matter of no importance. But I put myself forward only that I may be  of service to you; and if you derive any benefit I am consoled for my  egotism. If not, I shall but have displayed my foolishness. I confess,  then, though I say it in my foolishness, that the Word has visited me,  and even very often. But, though He has frequently entered into my  soul, I have never at any time been sensible of the precise moment of  His coming. I have felt that He was present, I remember that He has  been with me; I have sometimes been able even to have a presentiment  that He would come: but never to feel His coming nor His departure.  For whence He came to enter my soul, or whither He went on quitting  it, by what means He has made entrance or departure, I confess that I  know not even to this day; according to that which is said,  <A NAME="an_iv.iv-p59.1"></A>   <i>Nescis unde veniat aut quo vadat</i>     .    Nor is this strange, because it is to Him that the psalmist has said  in another place, <A NAME="an_iv.iv-p59.2"></A>   <i>Vestigia tua non cognoscentur</i>     . </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p60"></A>&#8220;It is not by the eyes that He enters, for He is  without form or colour that they can discern; nor by the ears, for His  coming is without sound; nor by the nostrils, for it is not with the  air but with the mind that He is blended. . . . By what avenue then  has He entered? Or perhaps the fact may be that He has not entered at  all, nor indeed come at all from outside: for not one of these things  belongs to outside. Yet it has not come from within me, for it is  good, and I know that in me dwelleth no good thing. I have ascended  higher than myself, and lo! I have found the Word above me still. My  curiosity has led me to descend below myself also, and yet I have  found Him still at a lower depth. If I have looked without myself, I  have found that He is beyond that which is outside of me, and if  within, He was at an inner depth still. And thus have I learned the  truth of the words I have read, <A NAME="an_iv.iv-p60.1"></A>  <i>In</i>      <i>ipso enim vivimus et movemur et sumus</i>   .&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_499"></A><A HREF="#fn_499"><FONT SIZE="1">500</FONT></A>
    <a name="page_245"><font size="1" color="green">p. 245</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iv-Page_245"></A></p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p62"></A>Such a lifting up, such a condition of consciousness  as that which St. Bernard is here trying to describe, seems to snatch  the spirit for a moment into a state which it is hard to distinguish  from that of true &#8220;union.&#8221; This is what the contemplatives  call passive or infused contemplation, or sometimes the &#8220;orison  of union&#8221;: a brief foretaste of the Unitive State, often enjoyed  for short periods in the Illuminative Way, which reinforces their  conviction that they have now truly attained the Absolute. It is but a  foretaste, however, of that attainment: the precocious effort of a  soul still in that stage of &#8220;Enlightening&#8221; which the  &#8220;Theologia Germanica&#8221; declares to be &#8220;belonging to  such as are growing.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_500"></A><A HREF="#fn_500"><FONT SIZE="1">501</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p64"></A>This distinction between the temporary experience of  union and the achievement of the Unitive Life is well brought out in a  fragment of dialogue between Soul and Self in Hugh of St.  Victor&#8217;s mystical tract, &#8220;De Arrha Animae.&#8221;</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p65"></A>  <i>The Soul says,</i>    &#8220;Tell me, what can be this thing of delight that merely by its  memory touches and moves me with such sweetness and violence that I am  drawn out of myself and carried away, I know not how? I am suddenly  renewed: I am changed: I am plunged into an ineffable peace. My mind  is full of gladness, all my past wretchedness and pain is forgot. My  soul exults: my intellect is illuminated: my heart is afire: my  desires have become kindly and gentle: I know not where I am, because  my Love has embraced me. Also, because my Love has embraced me I seem  to have become possessed of something, and I know not what it is; but  I try to keep it, that I may never lose it. My soul strives in  gladness that she may not be separated from That which she desires to  hold fast for ever: as if she had found in it the goal of all her  desires. She exults in a sovereign and ineffable manner, seeking  nought, desiring nought, but to rest in this. Is   <i>this,</i>    then, my Beloved? Tell me that I may know Him, and that if He come  again I may entreat Him to leave me not, but to stay with me for  ever.&#8221;</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p66"></A>  <i>Man says,</i>    &#8220;It is indeed thy Beloved who visits thee; but He comes in an  invisible shape, He comes disguised, He comes incomprehensibly. He  comes to touch thee, not to be seen of thee: to arouse thee, not to be  comprehended of thee. He comes not to give Himself wholly, but to be  tasted by thee: not to fulfil thy desire, but to lead upwards thy  affection. He gives a foretaste of His delights, brings not the  plenitude of a perfect satisfaction: and the earnest of thy betrothal  consists chiefly in this, that He who shall afterwards give Himself to  be seen and possessed by thee perpetually, now permits Himself to be  sometimes tasted, that thou mayest learn how sweet He is. This shall  console thee <a name="page_246"><font size="1" color="green">p. 246</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iv-Page_246"></A> for His absence: and the  savour of this gift shall keep thee from all despair.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_501"></A><A HREF="#fn_501"><FONT SIZE="1">502</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p68"></A>The real distinction between the Illuminative and the  Unitive Life is that in Illumination the individuality of the  subject&#8212;however profound his spiritual consciousness, however  close his apparent communion with the Infinite&#8212;remains separate  and intact. His heightened apprehension of reality lights up rather  than obliterates the rest of his life: and may even increase his power  of dealing adequately with the accidents of normal existence. Thus  Brother Lawrence found that his acute sense of reality, his  apprehension of the Presence of God, and the resulting detachment and  consciousness of liberty in regard to mundane things, upheld and  assisted him in the most unlikely tasks; as, for instance, when he was  sent into Burgundy to buy wine for his convent, &#8220;which was a  very unwelcome task to him, because he had no turn for business, and  because he was lame, and could not go about the boat but by rolling  himself over the casks. That, however, he gave himself no uneasiness  about it, nor about the purchase of the wine. That he said to God,   <i>It</i>      <i>was His business he was about:</i>    and that he afterwards found it very well performed. . . . So  likewise in his business in the kitchen, to which he had naturally a  great aversion.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_502"></A><A HREF="#fn_502"><FONT SIZE="1">503</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p70"></A>The mind, concentrated upon a higher object of  interest, is undistracted by its own anxieties, likes, or dislikes;  and hence performs the more efficiently the work that is given it to  do. Where it does not do so, then the normal make-up or imperfect  discipline of the subject, rather than its mystical proclivities, must  be blamed. St. Catherine of Genoa found in this divine companionship  the power which made her hospital a success. St. Teresa was an  administrator of genius and an admirable housewife, and declared that  she found her God very easily amongst the pots and pans.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_503"></A><A HREF="#fn_503"><FONT SIZE="1">504</FONT></A>
    Appearances notwithstanding, Mary would probably have been a better  cook than Martha, had circumstances required of her this form of  activity.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p72"></A>In persons of feeble or diffuse intelligence, however,  and above all in victims of a self-regarding spirituality, this deep  absorption in the sense of Divine Reality may easily degenerate into  monoideism. Then the &#8220;shady side&#8221; of Illumination, a  selfish preoccupation with transcendental joys, the &#8220;spiritual  gluttony&#8221; condemned by St. John of the Cross, comes out.  &#8220;I made many mistakes,&#8221; says Madame Guyon pathetically,  &#8220;through allowing myself to <a name="page_247"><font size="1" color="green">p. 247</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iv-Page_247"></A> be  too much taken up by my interior joys. . . . I used to sit in a corner  and work, but I could hardly do anything, because the strength of this  attraction made me let the work fall out of my hands. I spent hours in  this way without being able to open my eyes or to know what was  happening to me: so simply, so peacefully, so gently that sometimes I  said to myself, &#8216;Can heaven itself be more peaceful than  I?&#8217;&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_504"></A><A HREF="#fn_504"><FONT SIZE="1">505</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p74"></A>Here we see Madame Guyon basking like a pious tabby  cat in the beams of the Uncreated Light, and already leaning to the  extravagances of Quietism, with its dangerous &#8220;double character  of passivity and beatitude.&#8221; The heroic aspect of the mystic  vocation is in abeyance. Those mystical impressions which her peculiar  psychic make-up permitted her to receive, have been treated as a  source of personal and placid satisfactions; not as a well-spring,  whence new vitality might be drawn for great and self-giving  activities.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p75"></A>It has been claimed by the early biographers of St.  Catherine of Genoa, that she passed in the crisis of her conversion  directly through the Purgative to the Unitive Life; and never  exhibited the characteristics of the Illuminative Way. This has been  effectually disproved by Baron von H&uuml;gel,  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_505"></A><A HREF="#fn_505"><FONT SIZE="1">506</FONT></A>
    though he too is inclined in her case to reject the usual sequence of  the mystic states. Yet the description of Catherine&#8217;s condition  after her four great penitential years were ended, as given in cap.  vi. of the &#8220;Vita e Dottrina,&#8221; is an almost perfect picture  of healthy illumination of the inward or &#8220;immanental&#8221;  type; and makes an effective foil to the passage which I have quoted  from Madame Guyon&#8217;s life.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p77"></A>No doubt there were hours in which St.  Catherine&#8217;s experience, as it were, ran ahead; and she felt  herself not merely lit up by the Indwelling Light, but temporally  merged in it. These moments are responsible for such passages as the  beautiful fragment in cap. v.; which does, when taken alone, seem to  describe the true unitive state. &#8220;Sometimes,&#8221; she said,  &#8220;I do not see or feel myself to have either soul, body, heart,  will or taste, or any other thing except Pure Love.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_506"></A><A HREF="#fn_506"><FONT SIZE="1">507</FONT></A>
    Her normal condition of consciousness, however, was clearly not yet  that which Julian of Norwich calls being &#8220;oned with  bliss&#8221;; but rather an intense and continuous communion with an  objective Reality which was clearly realized as distinct from herself.  &#8220;After the aforesaid four years,&#8221; says the next chapter of  the &#8220;Vita,&#8221; &#8220;there was given unto her a purified  mind, free, and filled with God: insomuch that no other thing <a name="page_248"><font size="1" color="green">p. 248</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iv-Page_248"></A> could enter into it. Thus, when she heard  sermons or Mass, so much was she absorbed in her interior feelings,  that she neither heard nor saw that which was said or done without.  But within, in the sweet divine light, she saw and heard other things,  being wholly absorbed by that interior light: and it was not in her  power to act otherwise.&#8221; St. Catherine, then, is still a  spectator of the Absolute, does not feel herself to be   <i>one</i>    with it. &#8220;And it is a marvellous thing that with so great an  interior recollection, the Lord never permitted her to go beyond  control. But when she was needed, she always came to herself: so that  she was able to reply to that which was asked of her: and the Lord so  guided her, that none could complain of her. And she had her mind so  filled by Love Divine, that conversation became hard to her: and by  this continuous taste and sense of God, several times she was so  greatly transported, that she was forced to hide herself, that she  might not be seen.&#8221; It is clear, however, that Catherine herself  was aware of the transitory and imperfect nature of this intensely  joyous state. Her growing transcendental self, unsatisfied with the  sunshine of the Illuminative Way, the enjoyment of the riches of God,  already aspired to union with the Divine. With her, as with all truly  heroic souls, it was love for love, not love for joy. &#8220;She cried  to God because He gave her so many consolations, <A NAME="an_iv.iv-p78.1"></A>  <i>&#8216;Non voglio quello che esce da te, ma sol voglio te, O dolce  Amore</i>   !&#8217;&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_507"></A><A HREF="#fn_507"><FONT SIZE="1">508</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p80"></A><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p80.1"></A>  <i>&#8220;Non voglio quello che esce da te.&#8221;</i>    When the growing soul has reached this level of  desire, the Illuminative Way is nearly at an end. It has seen the  goal, &#8220;that Country which is no mere vision, but a home,&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_508"></A><A HREF="#fn_508"><FONT SIZE="1">509</FONT></A>
    and is set upon the forward march. So Rabia, the Moslem saint:  &#8220;O my God, my concern and my desire in this world, is that I  should remember thee above all the things of this world, and in the  next that out of all who are in that world, I should meet with thee  alone.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_509"></A><A HREF="#fn_509"><FONT SIZE="1">510</FONT></A>
    So Gertrude More: &#8220;No knowledge which we can here have of thee  can satisfy my soul seeking and longing without ceasing after thee. .  . . Alas, my Lord God, what is all thou canst give to a loving soul  which sigheth and panteth after thee alone, and esteemeth all things  as dung that she may gain thee? What is all I say, whilst thou givest  not thyself, who art that one thing which is only necessary and which  alone can satisfy <a name="page_249"><font size="1" color="green">p. 249</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iv-Page_249"></A> our souls? Was it any  comfort to St. Mary Magdalen, when she sought thee, to find two angels  which presented themselves instead of thee? verily I cannot think it  was any joy unto her. For that soul that hath set her whole love and  desire on thee can never find any true satisfaction but only in  thee.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_510"></A><A HREF="#fn_510"><FONT SIZE="1">511</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p84"></A>What is the nature of this mysterious mystic  illumination? Apart from the certitude it imparts, what is the form  which it most usually assumes in the consciousness of the self? The  illuminatives seem to assure us that its apparently symbolic name is  really descriptive; that they do experience a kind of radiance, a  flooding of the personality with new light. A new sun rises above the  horizon, and transfigures their twilit world. Over and over again they  return to light-imagery in this connection. Frequently, as in their  first conversion, they report an actual and overpowering consciousness  of radiant light, ineffable in its splendour, as an accompaniment of  their inward adjustment.</p>   <blockquote><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p84.1"></A> &#8220;Sopr&#8217; onne  lengua amore,<br>   bont&aacute; senza figura,<br>   lume fuor di mesura<br>   resplende nel mio core,&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_511"></A><A HREF="#fn_511"><FONT SIZE="1">512</FONT></A>

<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p92"></A>It really seems as though the mystics&#8217;  attainment of new levels of consciousness did bring with it the power  of perceiving a splendour always there, but beyond the narrow range of  our poor sight; to which it is only a &#8220;luminous darkness&#8221;  at the best. <a name="page_250"><font size="1" color="green">p. 250</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iv-Page_250"></A> &#8220;In Eternal Nature,  or the kingdom of Heaven,&#8221; said Law, &#8220;materiality stands  in life and light.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_515"></A><A HREF="#fn_515"><FONT SIZE="1">516</FONT></A>

I entered, and  beheld with the mysterious eye of my soul the Light that never  changes, above the eye of my soul, above my intelligence. It was not  the common light which all flesh can see, nor was it greater yet of  the same kind, as if the light of day were to grow brighter and  brighter and flood all space. It was not like this, but different:  altogether different from all such things. Nor was it above my  intelligence in the same way as oil is above water, or heaven above  earth; but it was higher because it made me, and I was lower because  made by it.

<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p97"></A>Here, as in the cases of St. Teresa, St. Catherine of  Genoa, and Jacopone da Todi, we have a characteristically  &#8220;immanental&#8221; description of the illuminated state. The  self, by the process which mystics call &#8220;introversion,&#8221;  the deliberate turning inwards of its attention, its conative powers,  discerns Reality within the heart: &#8220;the rippling tide of love  which flows secretly from God into the soul, and draws it mightily  back into its source.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_518"></A><A HREF="#fn_518"><FONT SIZE="1">519</FONT></A>

As in conversion, so here  Reality may be apprehended in either transcendent or immanent,  positive or negative terms.

    and for some selves that which is far is easiest to find. To a  certain type of mind, the veritable practice of the Presence of God is  not the intimate and adorable companionship of the personal Comrade or  the Inward Light, but the awestruck contemplation of the Absolute, the  &#8220;naked Godhead,&#8221; source and origin of all that Is. It is  an ascent to the supernal plane of perception, where &#8220;the  simple, absolute and unchangeable mysteries of heavenly Truth lie  hidden in the dazzling obscurity of the secret Silence, outshining all  brilliance with the intensity of their darkness, and surcharging our  blinded intellects with the utterly impalpable and invisible fairness  of glories which exceed all beauty.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_521"></A><A HREF="#fn_521"><FONT SIZE="1">522</FONT></A>

<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p103"></A>With such an experience of eternity, such a vision of  the triune all-including Absolute which &#8220;binds the Universe with  love,&#8221; Dante ends his &#8220;Divine Comedy&#8221;: and the  mystic joy with which its memory fills him is his guarantee that he  has really seen the Inviolate Rose, the flaming heart of things.</p>   <blockquote><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p103.1"></A> &#8220;O abbondante grazia,  ond&#8217; io presunsi<br>   ficcar lo viso per la luce eterna<br>   tanto che la veduta vi consunsi!<br>   Nel suo profondo vidi che s&#8217; interna,<br>   legato con amore in un volume,<br>   ci&ograve; che per l&#8217;universo si squaderna;<br>   Sustanzia ed accidenti, e lor costume,<br>   quasi conflati insieme per tal modo<br>   che ci&ograve; ch&#8217; io dico &egrave; un semplice  lume.<br>   La forma universal di questo nodo<br>   credo ch&#8217; io vidi, perch&egrave; pi&ugrave; di  largo,<br>   dicendo questo, mi sento ch&#8217; io godo.<br>   . . . . .<br>   O, quanto &egrave; corto il dire, e come fioco<br>   al mio concetto! e questo, a quel ch&#8217; io  vidi,<br>   &egrave; tanto che non basta a dicer poco.<br>   O luce eterna, che sola in te sidi,<br>   sola t&#8217; intendi, e, da te intelletta<br>   ed intendente te, ami ed  arridi!&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_522"></A><A HREF="#fn_522"><FONT SIZE="1">523</FONT></A>

It seems at first sight almost impossible to find room  within the same system for this expansive vision of the  Undifferentiated Light and such intimate and personal apprehensions of  Deity as Lady Julian&#8217;s conversations with her &#8220;courteous  and dearworthy Lord,&#8221; or St. Catherine&#8217;s companionship  with Love Divine. Yet all these are really reports of the same  psychological state: describe the attainment by selves of different  types, of the same stage in the soul&#8217;s progressive apprehension  of reality.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p112"></A>In a wonderful passage, unique in the literature of  mysticism, Angela of Foligno has reported the lucid vision in which  she perceived this truth: the twofold revelation of an Absolute at  once humble and omnipotent, personal and transcendent&#8212;the  unimaginable synthesis of &#8220;unspeakable power&#8221; and  &#8220;deep humility.&#8221;</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p113"></A>&#8220;The eyes of my soul were opened, and I beheld  the plenitude of God, wherein I did comprehend the whole world, both  here and beyond the sea, and the abyss and ocean and all things. In  all these things I beheld naught save the divine power, in a manner  assuredly indescribable; so that through excess of marvelling the soul  cried with a loud voice, saying &#8216;This whole world is full of  God!&#8217;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_523"></A><A HREF="#fn_523"><FONT SIZE="1">524</FONT></A>
    Wherefore I now comprehended how small a thing is the whole world,  that is to say both here and beyond the seas, the abyss, the ocean,  and all things; and that the Power of God exceeds and fills all. Then  He said unto me: &#8216;I have shown thee something of My  Power,&#8217; and I understood, that after this I should better  understand the rest. He then said &#8216;Behold now My  humility.&#8217; Then was I given an insight into the deep humility of  God towards man. And comprehending that unspeakable power and  beholding that deep humility, my soul marvelled greatly, and did  esteem itself to be nothing at all.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_524"></A><A HREF="#fn_524"><FONT SIZE="1">525</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p116"></A>It must never be forgotten that all apparently  one-sided descriptions of illumination&#8212;more, all experiences of  it&#8212;are governed by temperament. &#8220;That Light whose smile  kindles the Universe&#8221; is ever the same; but the self through  whom it passes, <a name="page_253"><font size="1" color="green">p. 253</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iv-Page_253"></A> and by whom we must  receive its report, has already submitted to the moulding influences  of environment and heredity, Church and State. The very language of  which that self avails itself in its struggle for expression, links it  with half a hundred philosophies and creeds. The response which it  makes to Divine Love will be the same in type as the response which  its nature would make to earthly love: but raised to the   <i>n</i>   th degree. We, receiving the revelation, receive with it all those  elements which the subject has contributed in spite of itself. Hence  the soul&#8217;s apprehension of Divine Reality may take almost any  form, from the metaphysical ecstasies which we find in Dionysius, and  to a less degree in St. Augustine, to the simple, almost  &#8220;common-sense&#8221; statements of Brother Lawrence, the  emotional ardours of St. Gertrude, or the lovely intimacies of Julian  or Mechthild.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p117"></A>Sometimes&#8212;so rich and varied does the nature of  the great mystic tend to be&#8212;the exalted and impersonal language  of the Dionysian theology goes, with no sense of incongruity, side by  side with homely parallels drawn from the most sweet and common  incidents of daily life. Suso, in whom illumination and purgation  existed side by side for sixteen years, alternately obtaining  possession of the mental field, and whose oscillations between the  harshest mortification and the most ecstatic pleasure-states were  exceptionally violent and swift, is a characteristic instance of such  an attitude of mind. His illumination was largely of the intimate and  immanental type; but, as we might expect in a pupil of Eckhart, it was  not without touches of mystical transcendence, which break out with  sudden splendour side by side with those tender and charming passages  in which the Servitor of the Eternal Wisdom tries to tell his  love.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p118"></A>Thus, he describes in one of the earlier chapters of  his life how &#8220;whilst he was thinking, according to his custom,  of the most lovable Wisdom, he questioned himself, and interrogated  his heart, which sought persistently for love, saying, &#8216;O my  heart, whence comes this love and grace, whence comes this gentleness  and beauty, this joy and sweetness of the heart? Does not all this  flow forth from the Godhead, as from its origin? Come! let my heart,  my senses and my soul immerse themselves in the deep Abyss whence come  these adorable things. What shall keep me back? To-day I will embrace  you, even as my burning heart desires to do.&#8217; And at this moment  there was within his heart as it were an emanation of all good, all  that is beautiful, all that is lovable and desirable was there  spiritually present, and this in a manner which cannot be expressed.  Whence came the habit that every time he heard God&#8217;s praises  sung or said, he recollected himself in the depths of his heart and  soul, and thought on that Beloved Object, <a name="page_254"><font size="1" color="green">p. 254</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iv-Page_254"></A> whence comes all love. It is impossible to  tell how often, with eyes filled with tears and open heart, he has  embraced his sweet Friend, and pressed Him to a heart overflowing with  love. He was like a baby which a mother holds upright on her knees,  supporting it with her hands beneath its arms. The baby, by the  movements of its little head, and all its little body, tries to get  closer and closer to its dear mother, and shows by its little laughing  gestures the gladness in its heart. Thus did the heart of the Servitor  ever seek the sweet neighbourhood of the Divine Wisdom, and thus he  was as it were altogether filled with delight.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_525"></A><A HREF="#fn_525"><FONT SIZE="1">526</FONT></A>
 </p>   <h4 align="center"><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p119.1"></A>2. The Illuminated Vision of the World</h4>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p120"></A>Closely connected with the sense of the  &#8220;Presence of God,&#8221; or power of perceiving the Absolute, is  the complementary mark of the illuminated consciousness; the vision of  &#8220;a new heaven and a new earth,&#8221; or an added significance  and reality in the phenomenal world. Such words as those of Julian,  &#8220;God is all thing that is good as to my sight, and the goodness  that all thing hath, it is He,&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_526"></A><A HREF="#fn_526"><FONT SIZE="1">527</FONT></A>
    seem to supply the link between the two. Here again we must  distinguish carefully between vaguely poetic language&#8212;&#8220;the  light that never was,&#8221; &#8220;every common bush afire with  God&#8221;&#8212;and descriptions which can be referred to a concrete  and definite psychological experience. This experience, at its best,  balances and completes the experience of the Presence of God at its  best. That is to say, its &#8220;note&#8221; is sacramental, not  ascetic. It entails the expansion rather than the concentration of  consciousness; the discovery of the Perfect One self-revealed in the  Many, not the forsaking of the Many in order to find the One. Its  characteristic expression is&#8212;</p>   <blockquote><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p121.1"></A> &#8220;The World is charged with the grandeur of  God;<br>   It will flame out, like shining from shook  foil,&#8221;<br>  </blockquote>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p122"></A>not &#8220;turn thy thoughts into thy own soul,  where He is hid.&#8221; It takes, as a rule, the form of an enhanced  mental lucidity&#8212;an abnormal sharpening of the  senses&#8212;whereby an ineffable radiance, a beauty and a reality  never before suspected, are perceived by a sort of clairvoyance  shining in the meanest things.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p123"></A>&#8220;From the moment in which the soul has received  the impression of Deity in infused orison,&#8221; says Malaval,  &#8220;she sees Him everywhere, by one of love&#8217;s secrets which  is only known of those who have experienced it. The simple vision of  pure love, which is <a name="page_255"><font size="1" color="green">p. 255</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iv-Page_255"></A> marvellously  penetrating, does not stop at the outer husk of creation: it  penetrates to the divinity which is hidden within.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_527"></A><A HREF="#fn_527"><FONT SIZE="1">528</FONT></A>

    Mystical poets of the type of Wordsworth and Walt Whitman seem to  possess in a certain degree this form of illumination. It is this  which Bucke, the American psychologist, analysed under the name of  &#8220;Cosmic Consciousness.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_530"></A><A HREF="#fn_530"><FONT SIZE="1">531</FONT></A>
    It is seen at its full development in the mystical experiences of  Boehme, Fox, and Blake.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p130"></A>We will take first the experience of Jacob Boehme, a  mystic who owed little or nothing to the influence of tradition, and  who furnishes one of the best recorded all-round examples of mystical  illumination; exhibiting, along with an acute consciousness of divine  companionship, all those phenomena of visual lucidity, automatism, and  enhanced intellectual powers which properly belong to it, but are  seldom developed simultaneously in the same individual.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p131"></A>In Boehme&#8217;s life, as described in the  Introduction to the English translation of his collected works,  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_531"></A><A HREF="#fn_531"><FONT SIZE="1">532</FONT></A>
    there were three distinct onsets of illumination; all of the  pantheistic and external type. In the first, which seems to have  happened whilst he was very young, we are told that &#8220;he was  surrounded by a divine Light for seven days, and stood in the highest  contemplation and Kingdom of Joy.&#8221; This we may perhaps identify  with mystical awakening, of the kind experienced by Suso. About the  year 1600 occurred the second illumination, initiated by a trance-like  state of consciousness, the result of gazing at a polished disc. To  this I have already referred.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_532"></A><A HREF="#fn_532"><FONT SIZE="1">533</FONT></A>
    This experience brought with it that peculiar and lucid <a name="page_256"><font size="1" color="green">p. 256</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iv-Page_256"></A> vision of the inner reality of the phenomenal  world in which, as he says, &#8220;he looked into the deepest  foundations of things.&#8221; &#8220;He believed that it was only a  fancy, and in order to banish it from his mind he went out upon the  green. But here he remarked that he gazed into the very heart of  things, the very herbs and grass, and that actual Nature harmonized  with what he had inwardly seen.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_533"></A><A HREF="#fn_533"><FONT SIZE="1">534</FONT></A>
    Of this same experience and the clairvoyance which accompanied it,  another biographer says, &#8220;Going abroad in the fields to a green  before Neys Gate, at G&ouml;rlitz, he there sat down, and, viewing the  herbs and grass of the field in his inward light, he saw into their  essences, use and properties, which were discovered to him by their  lineaments, figures and signatures. . . . In the unfolding of these  mysteries before his understanding, he had a great measure of joy, yet  returned home and took care of his family and lived in great peace and  silence, scarce intimating to any these wonderful things that had  befallen him.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_534"></A><A HREF="#fn_534"><FONT SIZE="1">535</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p136"></A>So far as we can tell from his own scattered  statements, from this time onwards Boehme must have enjoyed a frequent  and growing consciousness of the transcendental world: though there is  evidence that he, like all other mystics, knew seasons of darkness,  &#8220;many a shrewd Repulse,&#8221; and times of struggle with that  &#8220;powerful contrarium&#8221; the lower consciousness. In  1610&#8212;perhaps as the result of such intermittent  struggles&#8212;the vivid illumination of ten years before was  repeated in an enhanced form: and it was in consequence of this, and  in order that there might be some record of the mysteries upon which  he had gazed, that he wrote his first and most difficult book, the  &#8220;Aurora,&#8221; or &#8220;Morning Redness.&#8221; The passage in  which the &#8220;inspired shoemaker&#8221; has tried to tell us what  his vision of Reality was like, to communicate something of the grave  and enthusiastic travail of his being, the unspeakable knowledge of  things which he attained, is one of those which arouse in all who have  even the rudiments of mystical perception the sorrow and excitement of  exiles who suddenly hear the accents of home. Like absolute music, it  addresses itself to the whole being, not merely to the intellect.  Those who will listen and be receptive will find themselves repaid by  a strange sense of extended life, an exhilarating consciousness of  truth. Here, if ever, is a man who is struggling to &#8220;speak as he  saw&#8221;: and it is plain that he saw much&#8212;as much, perhaps,  as Dante, though he lacked the poetic genius which was needed to give  his vision an intelligible form. The very strangeness of the phrasing,  the unexpected harmonies and dissonances which worry polite <a name="page_257"><font size="1" color="green">p. 257</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iv-Page_257"></A> and well-regulated minds, are earnests of the  Spirit of Life crying out for expression from within. Boehme, like  Blake, seems &#8220;drunk with intellectual  vision&#8221;&#8212;&#8220;a God-intoxicated man.&#8221;</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p137"></A>&#8220;In this my earnest and Christian Seeking and  Desire,&#8221; he says, &#8220;(wherein I suffered many a shrewd  Repulse, but at last resolved rather to put myself in Hazard, than  give over and leave off) the Gate was opened to me, that in one  Quarter of an Hour I saw and knew more than if I had been many years  together at an University, at which I exceedingly admired, and  thereupon turned my Praise to God for it. For I saw and knew the Being  of all Beings, the Byss and the Abyss, and the Eternal Generation of  the   <i>Holy Trinity,</i>    the Descent and Original of the World, and of all creatures through  the Divine Wisdom: knew and saw in myself all the three Worlds,  namely,   <i>The Divine,</i>    angelical and paradisical; and the   <i>dark World,</i>    the Original of the Nature to the Fire; and then, thirdly, the   <i>external;</i>    and   <i>visible World,</i>    being a Procreation or external Birth from both the internal and  spiritual Worlds. And I saw and knew the whole working Essence in the  Evil and the Good, and the Original and Existence of each of them; and  likewise how the fruitful bearing Womb of Eternity brought forth. . .  . Yet however I must begin to labour in these great mysteries, as a  Child that goes to School. I saw it as in a great Deep in the  Internal. For I had a thorough view of the Universe, as in a Chaos,  wherein all things are couched and wrapped up, but it was impossible  for me to explain the same. Yet it opened itself to me, from Time to  Time, as in a Young Plant; though the same was with me for the space  of twelve years, and as it was as it were breeding, and I found a  powerful Instigation within me, before I could bring it forth into  external Form of Writing: and whatever I could apprehend with the  external Principle of my mind, that I wrote down.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_535"></A><A HREF="#fn_535"><FONT SIZE="1">536</FONT></A>

    Here, as in Boehme&#8217;s case, it is clear that a previous and  regrettable acquaintance with the &#8220;doctrine of signatures&#8221;  has to some extent determined the language and symbols under which he  describes his intuitive vision of actuality as it exists in the Divine  Mind.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p141"></A>&#8220;Now was I come up in spirit through the flaming  sword into the Paradise of God. All things were new: and all the  creation gave another smell unto me than before, beyond what words can  utter. . . . The creation was opened to me; and it was showed me how  all things had their names given them, according to their <a name="page_258"><font size="1" color="green">p. 258</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iv-Page_258"></A> nature and virtue. And I was at a stand in my  mind whether I should practise physic for the good of mankind, seeing  the nature and virtue of the creatures were so opened to me by the  Lord. . . . Great things did the Lord lead me unto, and wonderful  depths were opened unto me beyond what can by words be declared; but  as people come into subjection to the Spirit of God, and grow up in  the image and power of the Almighty, they may receive the word of  wisdom that opens all things, and come to know the   <i>hidden unity in the Eternal Being.&#8221;</i> </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p142"></A>&#8220;To know the hidden unity in the Eternal  Being&#8221;&#8212;know it with an invulnerable certainty, in the  all-embracing act of consciousness with which we are aware of the  personality of those we truly love&#8212;is to live at its fullest the  Illuminated Life, enjoying &#8220;all creatures in God and God in all  creatures.&#8221; Lucidity of this sort seemes to be an enormously  enhanced form of the poetic consciousness of &#8220;otherness&#8221;  in natural things&#8212;the sense of a unity in separateness, a mighty  and actual Life beyond that which eye can see, a glorious reality  shining through the phenomenal veil&#8212;frequent in those  temperaments which are at one with life. The self then becomes  conscious of the living reality of that World of Becoming, the vast  arena of the Divine creativity, in which the little individual life is  immersed. Alike in howling gale and singing cricket it hears the  crying aloud of that &#8220;Word which is through all things  everlastingly.&#8221; It participates, actively and open-eyed, in the  mighty journey of the Son towards the Father&#8217;s heart: and seeing  with purged sight all things and creatures as they are in that  transcendent order, detects in them too that striving of Creation to  return to its centre which is the secret of the Universe.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p143"></A>A harmony is thus set up between the mystic and Life  in all its forms. Undistracted by appearance, he sees, feels, and  knows it in one piercing act of loving comprehension. &#8220;And the  bodily sight stinted,&#8221; says Julian, &#8220;but the spiritual  sight dwelled in mine understanding, and I abode with reverent dread  joying in that I saw.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_537"></A><A HREF="#fn_537"><FONT SIZE="1">538</FONT></A>
    The heart outstrips the clumsy senses, and sees&#8212;perhaps for an  instant, perhaps for long periods of bliss&#8212;an undistorted and  more veritable world. All things are perceived in the light of  charity, and hence under the aspect of beauty: for beauty is simply  Reality seen with the eyes of love. As in the case of another and more  beatific Vision, <i>essere in caritate &egrave;</i> <i>qui necesse</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_538"></A><A HREF="#fn_538"><FONT SIZE="1">539</FONT></A>
   For such a reverent and joyous sight the meanest accidents of life are  radiant. The London streets are paths of loveliness; the very  omnibuses look like coloured archangels, their laps filled full of  little trustful souls. <a name="page_259"><font size="1" color="green">p. 259</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iv-Page_259"></A></p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p146"></A>Often when we blame our artists for painting ugly  things, they are but striving to show us a beauty to which we are  blind. They have gone on ahead of us, and attained that state of  &#8220;fourfold vision to which Blake laid claim; in which the  visionary sees the whole visible universe transfigured, because he has  &#8220;put off the rotten rags of sense and memory,&#8221; and  &#8220;put on Imagination uncorrupt.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_539"></A><A HREF="#fn_539"><FONT SIZE="1">540</FONT></A>
    In this state of lucidity symbol and reality, Nature and Imagination,  are seen to be   <i>One:</i>    and in it are produced all the more sublime works of art, since these  owe their greatness to the impact of Reality upon the artistic mind.  &#8220;I know,&#8221; says Blake again, &#8220;that this world is a  world of imagination and vision. I see everything I paint in this  world, but everybody does not see alike. To the eye of a miser a  guinea is far more beautiful than the sun and a bag worn with the use  of money has more beautiful proportions than a vine filled with  grapes. The tree which moves some to tears of joy is in the eyes of  others only a green thing which stands in the way. Some see Nature all  ridicule and deformity, and by these I shall not regulate my  proportions; and some scarce see Nature at all. But to the eyes of the  man of imagination Nature is Imagination itself. As a man is, so he  sees. As the eye is formed, such are its powers. You certainly  mistake, when you say that the visions of fancy are not to be found in  this world. To me this world is all one continued vision of fancy or  imagination, and I feel flattered when I am told so.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_540"></A><A HREF="#fn_540"><FONT SIZE="1">541</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p149"></A>If the Mystic Way be considered as an organic process  of transcendence, this illuminated apprehension of things, this  cleansing of the doors of perception, is surely what we might expect  to occur as man moves towards higher centres of consciousness. It  marks the self&#8217;s growth towards free and conscious participation  in the Absolute Life; its progressive appropriation of that life by  means of the contact which exists in the deeps of man&#8217;s  being&#8212;the ground or spark of the soul&#8212;between the subject  and the transcendental world. The surface intelligence, purified from  the domination of the senses, is invaded more and more by the  transcendent personality; the &#8220;New Man&#8221; who is by nature a  denizen of the independent spiritual world, and whose destiny, in  mystical language, is a &#8220;return to his Origin.&#8221; Hence an  inflow of new vitality, a deeper and wider apprehension of the  mysterious world in which man finds himself, an exaltation of his  intuitive powers.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p150"></A>In such moments of clear sight and enhanced perception  as that which Blake and Boehme describe, the mystic and the artist do  really see <A NAME="an_iv.iv-p150.1"></A>  <i>sub specie aeternitatis</i>     the Four-fold River of Life&#8212;that World of  Becoming in which, as Erigena says, &#8220;Every visible and invisible  creature is a theophany or appearance of God&#8221;&#8212; <a name="page_260"><font size="1" color="green">p. 260</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iv-Page_260"></A> as all perhaps might see it, if prejudice,  selfhood, or other illusion did not distort our sight. From this  loving vision there comes very often that beautiful sympathy with,  that abnormal power over, all living natural things, which crops up  again and again in the lives of the mystical saints; to amaze the  sluggish minds of common men, barred by &#8220;the torrent of Use and  Wont&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_541"></A><A HREF="#fn_541"><FONT SIZE="1">542</FONT></A>
    from all free and deep communion alike with their natural and  supernatural origin.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p152"></A>Yet it is surely not very amazing that St. Francis of  Assisi, feeling and knowing&#8212;not merely  &#8220;believing&#8221;&#8212;that every living creature was veritably  and actually a &#8220;theophany or appearance of God,&#8221; should  have been acutely conscious that he shared with these brothers and  sisters of his the great and lovely life of the All. Nor, this being  so, can we justly regard him as eccentric because he acted in  accordance with his convictions, preached to his little sisters the  birds,  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_542"></A><A HREF="#fn_542"><FONT SIZE="1">543</FONT></A>
    availed himself of the kindly offices of the falcon,  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_543"></A><A HREF="#fn_543"><FONT SIZE="1">544</FONT></A>
    enjoyed the friendship of the pheasant,  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_544"></A><A HREF="#fn_544"><FONT SIZE="1">545</FONT></A>
    soothed the captured turtledoves, his &#8220;simple-minded sisters,  innocent and chaste,&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_545"></A><A HREF="#fn_545"><FONT SIZE="1">546</FONT></A>
    or persuaded his Brother Wolf to a better life.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_546"></A><A HREF="#fn_546"><FONT SIZE="1">547</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p158"></A>The true mystic, so often taunted with &#8220;a denial  of the world,&#8221; does but deny the narrow and artificial world of  self: and finds in exchange the secrets of that mighty universe which  he shares with Nature and with God. Strange contacts, unknown to those  who only lead the life of sense, are set up between his being and the  being of all other things. In that remaking of his consciousness which  follows upon the &#8220;mystical awakening,&#8221; the deep and primal  life which he shares with all creation has been roused from its sleep.  Hence the barrier between human and non-human life, which makes man a  stranger on earth as well as in heaven, is done away. Life now  whispers to his life: all things are his intimates, and respond to his  fraternal sympathy.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p159"></A>Thus it seems quite a simple and natural thing to the  Little Poor Man of Assisi, whose friend the pheasant preferred his  cell to &#8220;the haunts more natural to its state,&#8221; that he  should be ambassador from the terrified folk of Gubbio to his  formidable brother the Wolf. The result of the interview, reduced to  ordinary language, could be paralleled in the experience of many  persons who have possessed this strange and incommunicable power over  animal life.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p160"></A>&#8220;O wondrous thing! whereas St. Francis had made  the sign of the Cross, right so the terrible wolf shut his jaws and  stayed his running: and when he was bid, came gently as a lamb and  laid <a name="page_261"><font size="1" color="green">p. 261</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iv-Page_261"></A> him down at the feet of St.  Francis. . . . And St. Francis stretching forth his hand to take  pledge of his troth, the wolf lifted up his right paw before him and  laid it gently on the hand of St. Francis, giving thereby such sign of  good faith as he was able. Then quoth St. Francis, &#8216;Brother  Wolf, I bid thee in the name of Jesu Christ come now with me, nothing  doubting, and let us go stablish this peace in God&#8217;s  name.&#8217; And the wolf obedient set forth with him, in fashion as a  gentle lamb; whereat the townsfolk made mighty marvel, beholding. . .  . And thereafter this same wolf lived two years in Agobio; and went  like a tame beast in and out the houses from door to door, without  doing hurt to any, or any doing hurt to him, and was courteously  nourished by the people; and as he passed thus wise through the  country and the houses, never did any dog bark behind him. At length  after a two years space, brother wolf died of old age: whereat the  townsfolk sorely grieved, sith marking him pass so gently through the  city, they minded them the better of the virtue and the sanctity of  St. Francis.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_547"></A><A HREF="#fn_547"><FONT SIZE="1">548</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p162"></A>In another mystic, less familiar than St. Francis to  English readers&#8212;Rose of Lima, the Peruvian saint&#8212;this deep  sympathy with natural things assumed a particularly lovely form. To  St. Rose the whole world was a holy fairyland, in which it seemed to  her that every living thing turned its face towards Eternity and  joined in her adoration of God. It is said in her biography that  &#8220;when at sunrise, she passed through the garden to go to her  retreat, she called upon nature to praise with her the Author of all  things. Then the trees were seen to bow as she passed by, and clasp  their leaves together, making a harmonious sound. The flowers swayed  upon their stalks, and opened their blossoms that they might scent the  air; thus according to their manner praising God. At the same time the  birds began to sing, and came and perched upon the hands and shoulders  of Rose. The insects greeted her with a joyous murmur, and all which  had life and movement joined in the concert of praise she addressed to  the Lord.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_548"></A><A HREF="#fn_548"><FONT SIZE="1">549</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p164"></A>Again&#8212;and here we catch an echo of the pure  Franciscan spirit, the gaiety of the Troubadours of God&#8212;during  her last Lent, &#8220;each evening at sunset a little bird with an  enchanting voice came and perched upon a tree beside her window, and  waited till she gave the sign to him to sing. Rose, as soon as she saw  her little feathered chorister, made herself ready to sing the praises  of God, and challenged the bird to this musical duel in a song which  she had <a name="page_262"><font size="1" color="green">p. 262</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iv-Page_262"></A> composed for this purpose.  &#8216;Begin, dear little bird,&#8217; she said, &#8216;begin thy  lovely song! Let thy little throat, so full of sweet melodies, pour  them forth: that together we may praise the Lord. Thou dost praise thy  Creator, I my sweet Saviour: thus we together bless the Deity. Open  thy little beak, begin and I will follow thee: and our voices shall  blend in a song of holy joy.&#8217;</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p165"></A>&#8220;At once the little bird began to sing, running  through his scale to the highest note. Then he ceased, that the saint  might sing in her turn . . . thus did they celebrate the greatness of  God, turn by turn, for a whole hour: and with such perfect order, that  when the bird sang Rose said nothing, and when she sang in her turn  the bird was silent, and listened to her with a marvellous attention.  At last, towards the sixth hour, the saint dismissed him, saying,  &#8216;Go, my little chorister, go, fly far away. But blessed be my  God who never leaves me!&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_549"></A><A HREF="#fn_549"><FONT SIZE="1">550</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p167"></A>The mystic whose illumination takes such forms as  these, who feels with this intensity and closeness the bond of love  which &#8220;binds in one book the scattered leaves of all the  universe,&#8221; dwells in a world unknown to other men. He pierces  the veil of imperfection, and beholds Creation with the  Creator&#8217;s eye. The &#8220;Pattern is shown him in the  Mount.&#8221; &#8220;The whole consciousness,&#8221; says  R&eacute;c&eacute;jac, &#8220;is flooded with light to unknown depths,  under the gaze of love, from which nothing escapes. In this stage,  intensity of vision and sureness of judgment are equal: and the things  which the seer brings back with him when he returns to common life are  not merely partial impressions, or the separate knowledge of  &#8216;science&#8217; or &#8216;poetry.&#8217; They are rather truths  which embrace the world, life and conduct: in a word,   <i>the whole consciousness</i>   .&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_550"></A><A HREF="#fn_550"><FONT SIZE="1">551</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p169"></A>It is curious to note in those diagrams of experience  which we have inherited from the more clear-sighted philosophers and  seers, indications that they have enjoyed prolonged or transitory  periods of this higher consciousness; described by R&eacute;c&eacute;jac  as the marriage of imaginative vision with moral transcendence. I  think it at least a reasonable supposition that Plato&#8217;s doctrine  of Ideas owed something to an intuition of this kind; for a  philosophy, though it may claim to be the child of pure reason, is  usually found to owe its distinctive character to the  philosopher&#8217;s psychological experience. The Platonic statements  as to the veritable existence of the Idea of a house, a table, or a  bed, and other such concrete and practical applications of the  doctrine of the ideal, which have annoyed many metaphysicians, become  explicable on such a psychological basis. That illuminated vision in  which &#8220;all things are made new&#8221; can afford to embrace the  homeliest as well as the sublimest things; <a name="page_263"><font size="1" color="green">p. 263</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iv-Page_263"></A> and, as a matter of experience, it does do  this, seeing all objects, as Monet saw the hayrick, as &#8220;modes of  light.&#8221; Blake said that his cottage at Felpham was a shadow of  the angels&#8217; houses,  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_551"></A><A HREF="#fn_551"><FONT SIZE="1">552</FONT></A>
    and I have already referred to the converted Methodist who saw his  horses and hogs on the ideal plane.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_552"></A><A HREF="#fn_552"><FONT SIZE="1">553</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p172"></A>Again, when Plotinus, who is known to have experienced  ecstatic states, speaks with the assurance of an explorer of an  &#8220;intelligible world,&#8221; and asks us, &#8220;What other fire  could be a better image of the fire which is there, than the fire  which is here? Or what other earth than this, of the earth which is  there?&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_553"></A><A HREF="#fn_553"><FONT SIZE="1">554</FONT></A>
    we seem to detect behind the language of Neoplatonic philosophy a  hint of the same type of first-hand experience. The minds to whom we  owe the Hebrew Kabalah found room for it too in their diagram of the  soul&#8217;s ascent towards Reality. The first &#8220;Sephira&#8221;  above Malkuth, the World of Matter, or lowest plane upon that Tree of  Life which is formed by the ten emanations of the Godhead is, they  say, &#8220;Yesod,&#8221; the &#8220;archetypal universe.&#8221; In  this are contained the realities, patterns, or Ideas, whose shadows  constitute the world of appearance in which we dwell. The path of the  ascending soul upon the Tree of Life leads him first from Malkuth to  Yesod:   <i>i.e.</i>   , human consciousness in the course of its transcendence passes from  the normal illusions of men to a deeper perception of its  environment&#8212;a perception which is symbolized by the  &#8220;archetypal plane&#8221; or world of Platonic Ideas.  &#8220;Everything in temporal nature,&#8221; says William Law,  &#8220;is descended out of that which is eternal, and stands as a  palpable visible outbirth of it, so when we know how to separate the  grossness, death, and darkness of time from it, we find what it is in  its eternal state. . . . In Eternal Nature, or the Kingdom of Heaven,  materiality stands in life and light; it is the light&#8217;s glorious  Body, or that garment wherewith light is clothed, and therefore has  all the properties of light in it, and only differs from light as it  is its brightness and beauty, as the holder and displayer of all its  colours, powers, and virtues.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_554"></A><A HREF="#fn_554"><FONT SIZE="1">555</FONT></A>
    When Law wrote this, he may have believed that he was interpreting to  English readers the unique message of his master, Jacob Boehme. As a  matter of fact he was reiterating truths which a long line of  practical mystics had been crying for centuries into the deaf ears of  mankind. He was saying in the eighteenth century what Gregory of Nyssa  had said in the fourth and Erigena in the ninth; telling the secret of  that &#8220;Inviolate Rose&#8221; which can never be profaned because  it can only be seen with the eyes of love. <a name="page_264"><font size="1" color="green">p. 264</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iv-Page_264"></A></p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p175"></A>That serene and illuminated consciousness of the  relation of things inward and outward&#8212;of the Hidden Treasure and  its Casket, the energizing Absolute and its expression in Time and  Space&#8212;which we have been studying in this chapter, is at its  best a state of fine equilibrium; a sane adjustment of the inner and  outer life. By that synthesis of love and will which is the secret of  the heart, the mystic achieves a level of perception in which the  whole world is seen and known in God, and God is seen and known in the  whole world. It is a state of exalted emotion: being produced by love,  of necessity it produces love in its turn. The sharp division between  its inlooking and outlooking forms which I have adopted for  convenience of description, is seldom present to the minds which  achieve it. They, &#8220;cleansed, fed, and sanctified,&#8221; are  initiated into a spiritual universe where such clumsy distinctions  have little meaning. All is alike part of the &#8220;new life&#8221;  of peaceful charity: and that progressive abolition of selfhood which  is of the essence of mystical development, is alone enough to prevent  them from drawing a line between the inward personal companionship and  outward impersonal apprehension of the Real. True Illumination, like  all real and vital experience, consists rather in the breathing of a  certain atmosphere, the living at certain levels of consciousness,  than in the acquirement of specific information. It is, as it were, a  resting-place upon &#8220;the steep stairway of love&#8221;; where the  self turns and sees all about it a transfigured universe, radiant with  that same Light Divine which nests in its own heart and leads it  on.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p176"></A>&#8220;When man&#8217;s desires are fixed immovably on  his Maker as far as for deadliness and corruption of the flesh he is  let,&#8221; says Rolle of the purified soul which has attained the  illuminated state, &#8220;then it is no marvel that his strength manly  using, first as it were heaven being opened, with his understanding he  beholds high heavenly citizens; and afterwards sweetest heat, as it  were burning fire, he feels. Then with marvellous sweetness he is  taught, and so forth in songful noise he is joyed. This, therefore, is  perfect charity, which no man knows but he that hath it took. And he  that it has taken, it never leaves: sweetly he lives and sickerly he  shall die.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_555"></A><A HREF="#fn_555"><FONT SIZE="1">556</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p178"></A>Sweetly, it is true, the illuminated mystic may live;  but not, as some think, placidly. Enlightenment is a symptom of  growth: and growth is a living process, which knows no rest. The  spirit, indeed, is invaded by a heavenly peace; but it is the peace,  not of idleness, but of ordered activity. &#8220;A rest most  busy,&#8221; in Hilton&#8217;s words: a progressive appropriation of  the Divine. The urgent push of an indwelling spirit, aspiring to its  home in the heart of Reality, is felt more and more, as the invasion  of the normal consciousnesss <a name="page_265"><font size="1" color="green">p. 265</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iv-Page_265"></A> by the  transcendental personality&#8212;the growth of the New  Man&#8212;proceeds towards its term.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p179"></A>Therefore the great seekers for reality are not as a  rule long delayed by the exalted joys of Illumination. Intensely aware  now of the Absolute Whom they adore, they are aware too that though  known He is unachieved. Even whilst they enjoy the rapture of the  Divine Presence&#8212;of life in a divine, ideal  world&#8212;something, they feel, makes default.   <i>Sol voglio Te, O dolce Amore</i>.    Hence for them that which they now enjoy, and which passes the  understanding of other men, is not a static condition; often it  coexists with that travail of the heart which Tauler has called  &#8220;stormy love.&#8221; The greater the mystic, the sooner he  realizes that the Heavenly Manna which has been administered to him is  not yet That with which the angels are full fed. Nothing less will do:  and for him the progress of illumination is a progressive  consciousness that he is destined not for the sunny shores of the  spiritual universe, but for &#8220;the vast and stormy sea of the  divine.&#8221;</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p180"></A>&#8220;Here,&#8221; says Ruysbroeck of the soul which  has been lit by the Uncreated Light, &#8220;there begins an eternal  hunger, which shall never more be satisfied. It is the inward craving  and hankering of the affective power and created spirit after an  Uncreated Good. And as the spirit longs for fruition, and is invited  and urged thereto by God, she must always desire to attain it. Behold!  here begin an eternal craving and continual yearning in eternal  insatiableness! These men are poor indeed: for they are hungry and  greedy, and their hunger is insatiable! Whatsoever they eat and drink  they shall never be satisfied, for this hunger is eternal. . . . Here  are great dishes of food and drink, of which none know but those who  taste them; but full satisfaction in fruition is the one dish that  lacks them, and this is why their hunger is ever renewed. Nevertheless  in this contact rivers of honey full of all delight flow forth; for  the spirit tastes these riches under every mode that it can conceive  or apprehend. But all this is according to the manner of the  creatures, and is below God: and hence there remains an eternal hunger  and impatience. If God gave to such a man all the gifts which all the  saints possess, and all that He is able to give, but without giving  Himself, the craving desire of the spirit would remain hungry and  unsatisfied.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_556"></A><A HREF="#fn_556"><FONT SIZE="1">557</FONT></A>

<p><A NAME="an_iv.iv-p94"></A>          It is, of course, arguable that the whole of this light-imagery is    ultimately derived from the Prologue of the Fourth Gospel: as the    imagery of the Spiritual Marriage is supposed to be derived from the    Song of Songs. Some hardy commentators have even found in it    evidence of the descent of Christian Mysticism from sun-worship.    (See H. F. Dunbar, &#8220;Symbolism in Mediaeval Thought&#8221;.)    But it must be remembered that mystics are essentially realists,    always seeking for language adequate to their vision of truth: hence    their adoption of this imagery is most simply explained by the fact    that it represent something which they know and are struggling to    describe.</p></P>
