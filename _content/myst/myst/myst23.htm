<p><A NAME="an_v-p1"></A>If<A NAME="an_v-p1.1"></A> we try to represent the course of Mysticism in Europe during the  Christian period by the common device of a chronological curve,  showing by its rises and falls as it passes across the centuries the  absence or preponderance in any given epoch of mystics and mystical  thought, we shall find that the great periods of mystical activity  tend to correspond with the great periods of artistic, material, and  intellectual civilization. As a rule, they come immediately after, and  seem to complete such periods: those outbursts of vitality in which  man makes fresh conquests over his universe apparently producing, as  their last stage, a type of heroic character which extends these  victories to the spiritual sphere. When science, politics, literature,  and the arts&#8212;the domination of nature and the ordering of  life&#8212;have risen to their height and produced their greatest  works, the mystic comes to the front; snatches the torch, and carries  it on. It is almost as if he were humanity&#8217;s finest flower; the  product at which each great creative period of the race had aimed.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_v-p2"></A>Thus the thirteenth century expressed to perfection  the medieval ideal in religion, art, philosophy, and public life. It  built the Gothic cathedrals, put the finishing touch to the system of  chivalry, and nourished the scholastic philosophers. It has many  saints, but not very many mystics; though they increase in number as  the century draws on. The fourteenth century is filled by great  contemplatives; who lifted this wave of activity to spiritual levels,  and brought the intellectual vigour, the romance and passion of the  mediaeval temperament, to bear upon the deepest mysteries of the  transcendental life. Again, the sixteenth century, that period of  abounding vitality which left no corner of existence unexplored, which  produced the Renaissance and the Humanists and remade the mediaeval  world, had hardly reached its full development before the great  procession of the post-Renaissance mystics, with St. Teresa at their  head, began. If life, then&#8212;the great and restless life of the  race&#8212;be described under the trite metaphor of a billowy sea,  each great wave as it rises from the deep bears the mystic type upon  its crest.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_v-p3"></A>Our curve will therefore follow close behind that  other curve which represents the intellectual life of humanity. Its  course will be studded and defined for us by the names of the great  mystics; the possessors of spiritual genius, the pathfinders to the  country of the soul. These starry names are significant not only in  themselves but also as links in the chain of manes growing spiritual  history. They are not isolated <a name="page_454"><font size="1" color="green">p. 454</font></A> <A NAME="an_v-Page_454"></A> phenomena, but are  related to one another. Each receives something from his predecessors:  each by his personal adventures enriches it, and hands it on to the  future. As we go on, we notice more and more this cumulative power of  the past. Each mystic, original though he be, yet owes much to the  inherited acquirement of his spiritual ancestors. These ancestors form  his tradition, are the classic examples on which his education is  based; and from them he takes the language which they have sought out  and constructed as a means of telling their adventures to the world.  It is by their help too, very often, that he elucidates for himself  the meaning of the dim perceptions of his amazed soul. From his own  experiences he adds to this store; and hands on an enriched tradition  of the transcendental life to the next spiritual genius evolved by the  race. Hence the names of the great mystics are connected by a thread;  and it becomes possible to treat them as subjects of history rather  than of biography.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_v-p4"></A>I have said that this thread forms a curve, following  the fluctuations of the intellectual life of the race. At its highest  points, the names of the mystics are clustered most thickly, at its  descents they become fewer and fewer, at the lowest points they die  away. Between the first century A.D. and the nineteenth, this curve  exhibits three great waves of mystical activity besides many minor  fluctuations. They correspond with the close of the Classical, the  Mediaeval, and the Renaissance periods in history: reaching their  highest points in the third, fourteenth, and seventeenth centuries. In  one respect, however, the mystic curve diverges from the historical  one. It rises to its highest point in the fourteenth century, and does  not again approach the level it there attains; for the mediaeval  period was more favourable to the development of mysticism than any  subsequent epoch has been. The fourteenth century is as much the  classic moment for the spiritual history of our race as the thirteenth  is for the history of Gothic, or the fifteenth for that of Italian  art.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_v-p5"></A>The names upon our curve, especially during the first  ten centuries of the Christian era, are often separated by long  periods of time. This, of course, does not necessarily mean that these  centuries produced few mystics: merely that few documents relating to  them have survived. We have now no means of knowing, for instance, the  amount of true mysticism which may have existed amongst the initiates  of the Greek or Egyptian Mysteries; how many advanced but inarticulate  contemplatives there were amongst the Alexandrian Neo-platonists,  amongst the pre-Christian communities of contemplatives described by   <b>Philo</b>   , the deeply mystical Alexandrian Jew (20 B.C.-A.D. 40), or the  innumerable Gnostic sects which replaced in the early Christian world  the Orphic and Dionysiac mystery-cults of Greece and Italy. Much real  mystical inspiration there must have been, for we know that from these  centres of life came many of the doctrines best loved by later  mystics: that the Neoplatonists gave them the concepts of Pure Being  and the One, that the New Birth and the Spiritual Marriage were  foreshadowed in the Mysteries, that Philo anticipated the theology of  the Fourth Gospel. <a name="page_455"><font size="1" color="green">p. 455</font></A> <A NAME="an_v-Page_455"></A></p>   
<p><A NAME="an_v-p6"></A>As we stand at the beginning of the Christian period  we see three great sources whence its mystical tradition might have  been derived. These sources are Greek, Oriental, and Christian&#8212;  <i>i.e.</i>   , primitive Apostolic&#8212;doctrine or thought. As a matter of fact  all contributed their share: but where Christianity gave the new vital  impulse to transcendence, Greek and Oriental thought provided the  principal forms in which it was expressed. The Christian religion, by  its very nature, had a profoundly mystical side. Putting the  personality of its Founder outside the limits of the present  discussion,   <b>St. Paul</b>    and the author of the Fourth Gospel are obvious instances of mystics  of the first rank amongst its earliest missionaries. Much of the inner  history of primitive Christianity still remains unknown to us, but in  what has been already made out we find numerous, if scattered,  indications that the mystic life was indigenous in the Church and the  natural mystic had little need to look for inspiration outside the  limits of his creed. Not only the epistles of St. Paul and the  Johannine writings, but also the earliest liturgic fragments which we  possess, and such primitive religious poetry as the &#8220;Odes of  Solomon&#8221; and the &#8220;Hymn of Jesus,&#8221; show how congenial  was mystical expression to the mind of the Church how easily that  Church could absorb and transmute the mystic elements of Essene,  Orphic, and Neoplatonic thought.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_v-p7"></A>Towards the end of the second century this tendency  received brilliant literary expression at the hands of   <b>Clement of Alexandria</b>    (c. 160-220)&#8212;who first adapted the language of the pagan  Mysteries to the Christian theory of the spiritual life&#8212;and his  great pupil   <b>Origen</b>    (c. 183-253). Nevertheless, the first person after St. Paul of whom  it can now be decisively stated that he was a practical mystic of the  first rank, and in whose writings the central mystic doctrine of union  with God is found, is a pagan. That person is   <b>Plotinus</b>   , the great Neoplatonic philosopher of Alexandria (A.D. 205-c. 270).  His mysticism owes nothing to the Christian religion, which is never  mentioned in his works. Intellectually it is based on the Platonic  philosophy, and also shows the influence of the Mysteries, and perhaps  certain of the Oriental cults and philosophies which ran riot in  Alexandria in the third century. Ostensibly a metaphysician, however,  Plotinus possessed transcendental genius of a high order, and was  consumed by a burning passion for the Absolute: and the importance of  his work lies in the degree in which his intellectual constructions  are made the vehicle of mystical experience. His disciple Porphyry has  left it on record that on four occasions he saw his master rapt to  ecstatic union with &#8220;the One.&#8221;</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_v-p8"></A>The Neoplatonism of which Plotinus was the greatest  exponent became the medium in which much of the mysticism&#8212;both  Christian and pagan&#8212;of the first six centuries was expressed.  But since mysticism is a way of life&#8212;an experience of Reality,  not a philosophic account of Reality&#8212;Neoplatonism, and the  mysticism which used its language, must not be identified with one  another.   <b>Porphyry</b>    (233-304) the favourite pupil of Plotinus seems to have inherited  something of his master&#8217;s mysticism, but Neoplatonism as a whole  was a confused, semi-religious philosophy, containing many  inconsistent elements. Appearing <a name="page_456"><font size="1" color="green">p. 456</font></A> <A NAME="an_v-Page_456"></A> when the wreck of  paganism was complete, but before Christianity had conquered the  educated world, it made a strong appeal to the spiritually minded; and  also to those who hankered after the mysterious and the occult. It  taught the illusory nature of all temporal things, and in the violence  of its idealism outdid its master Plato. It also taught the existence  of an Absolute God, the &#8220;Unconditioned One,&#8221; who might be  known in ecstasy and contemplation; and here it made a direct appeal  to the mystical instincts of men. Those natural mystics who lived in  the time of its greatest popularity found in it therefore a ready  means of expressing their own intuitions of reality. Hence the early  mysticism of Europe, both Christian and pagan, has come down to us in  a Neoplatonic dress; and speaks the tongue of Alexandria rather than  that of Jerusalem, Athens, or Rome.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_v-p9"></A>The influence of Plotinus upon later Christian  mysticism was enormous though indirect. During the patristic period  all that was best in the spirit of Neoplatonism flowed into the veins  of the Church.   <b>St. Augustine</b>    (A.D. 354-430) and   <b>Dionysius the Areopagite</b>    (writing between 475 and 525) are amongst his spiritual children; and  it is mainly through them that his doctrine reached the mediaeval  world.   <b>Proclus</b>    (412-c. 490), the last of the pagan philosophers, also derives from  his teaching. Through these three there is hardly one in the long tale  of the European contemplatives whom his powerful spirit has failed to  reach.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_v-p10"></A>The mysticism of St. Augustine is partly obscured for  us by the wealth of his intellectual and practical life: yet no one  can read the &#8220;Confessions&#8221; without being struck by the  intensity and actuality of his spiritual experience, and the  characteristically mystical formula under which he apprehended  Reality. It is clear that when he composed this work he was already an  advanced contemplative. The immense intellectual activities by which  he is best remembered were fed by the solitary adventures of his soul.  No merely literary genius could have produced the wonderful chapters  in the seventh and eighth books, or the innumerable detached passages  in which his passion for the Absolute breaks out. Later mystics,  recognizing this fact, constantly appeal to his authority, and his  influence ranks next to that of the Bible in the formation of the  mediaeval school.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_v-p11"></A>Second only to that of St. Augustine was the influence  exercised by the strange and nameless writer who chose to ascribe his  works to Dionysius the Areopagite, the friend of St. Paul, and to  address his letters upon mysticism to Paul&#8217;s fellow-worker,  Timothy. The pseudo-Dionysius was probably a Syrian monk. The  patristic quotations detected in his work prove that he cannot have  written before A.D.475; it is most likely that he flourished in the  early part of the sixth century. His chief works are the treatises on  the Angelic Hierarchies and on the Names of God, and a short but  priceless tract on mystical theology. From the ninth century to the  seventeenth these writings nourished the most spiritual intuitions of  men, and possessed an authority which it is now hard to realize.  Medieval mysticism is soaked in Dionysian conceptions. Particularly in  the fourteenth century, the golden <a name="page_457"><font size="1" color="green">p. 457</font></A> <A NAME="an_v-Page_457"></A> age of mystical  literature, the phrase &#8220;Dionysius saith&#8221; is of continual  recurrence: and has for those who use it much the same weight as  quotations from the Bible or the great fathers of the Church.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_v-p12"></A>The importance of Dionysius lies in the fact that he  was the first and for a long time the only, Christian writer who  attempted to describe frankly and accurately the workings of the  mystical consciousness, and the nature of its ecstatic attainment of  God. So well did he do h s work that later contemplatives, reading  him, found their most sublime experiences reflected and partly  explained. Hence in describing those experiences, they adopted his  language and metaphors; which afterwards became the classic terms of  contemplative science. To him Christian literature owes the  paradoxical concept of the Absolute Godhead as the &#8220;Divine  Dark,&#8221; the Unconditioned, &#8220;the negation of all that   <i>is</i>   &#8221;&#8212;  <i>i.e</i>   ., of all that the surface consciousness perceives&#8212;and of the  soul&#8217;s attainment of the Absolute as a &#8220;divine  ignorance,&#8221; a way of negation. This idea is common to Greek and  Indian philosophy. With Dionysius it enters the Catholic fold.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_v-p13"></A>Side by side with the Neoplatonic mysticism of St.  Augustine and Dionysius runs another line of spiritual culture, hardly  less important for the development of the contemplative life. This  takes its rise among the Fathers of the Egyptian desert, whose heroic  spirituality was a contributory factor in St. Augustine&#8217;s  conversion. It finds beautiful expression in the writings of   <b>St. Marcarius of Egypt</b>    (c. 295-386), the disciple of St. Anthony and friend of St. Basil,  and reaches the West through the &#8220;Dialogues&#8221; of   <b>John Cassian</b>    (c. 350- ), one of the most important documents for the history of  Christian mysticism. The fruit of a seven-year pilgrimage among the  Egyptian monasteries, and many conversations on spiritual themes with  the monks, we find in these dialogues for the first time a classified  and realistic description of the successive degrees of contemplative  prayer, and their relation to the development of the spiritual life.  Adopted by St. Benedict as part of the regular spiritual food of his  monks, they have had a decisive influence on the cloistered mysticism  of the Middle Ages. Their sober and orderly doctrine, destined to be  characteristic of the Roman Church, received fresh emphasis in the  works of   <b>St. Gregory the Great</b>    (540-604), which also helped to form the souls of succeeding  generations of contemplatives.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_v-p14"></A>We have therefore, at the opening of the Middle Ages,  two great streams of spiritual culture; the Benedictine, moderate and  practical, formed chiefly on Cassian and St. Gregory, and the  Neoplatonic, represented by Dionysius the Areopagite, and in a less  exclusive form by St. Augustine. The works of Dionysius were  translated from Greek into Latin about A.D. 850 by the Irish  philosopher and theologian,   <b>John Scotus Erigena</b>   , one of the scholars assembled at the court of Charlemagne: and this  event marks the beginning of a full tradition of mysticism in Western  Europe. John the Scot, many of whose own writings exhibit a strong  mystical bias, is the only name in this period which the history of  mysticism can claim. We are on the descending <a name="page_458"><font size="1" color="green">p. 458</font></A> <A NAME="an_v-Page_458"></A> line  of the &#8220;Dark Ages&#8221;: and here the curve of mysticism runs  parallel with the curves of intellectual and artistic activity.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_v-p15"></A>The great current of medieval mysticism first shows  itself in the eleventh century, and chiefly in connection with the  Benedictine Order for the work of such monastic reformers as   <b>St. Romuald</b>    (c. 950-1027)   <b>St. Peter Damian</b>    (1007-1072), and   <b>St. Bruno</b>    (1032-1101), the founder of the Grande Chartreuse, was really the  effort of contemplative souls to establish an environment in which the  mystical life could be lived. Thus too we must regard at least a large  proportion of the hermits and solitaries who became so marked a  feature in the religion of the West. At this period mysticism was not  sharply distinguished from the rest of the religious complex, but was  rather the realistic experience of the truths on which religion rests.  It spread mainly through personal instruction and discipleship. Its  literary monuments were few among the most important and widely  influential being the &#8220;Meditations&#8221; of   <b>St. Anselm</b>    (1033-1109), which, disentangled by recent scholarship from the  spurious material passing under his name, are now seen to have been a  chief channel of transmission for the Augustinian mysticism which  dominated the early Middle Ages. The general religious revival of the  twelfth century had its marked mystical aspect, and produced four  personalities of great historical importance: the Benedictines   <b>St. Bernard of Clairvaux</b>    (1091-1153),   <b>St. Hildegarde of Bingen</b>    (1098-1179), and   <b>Joachim of Flora</b>    (1132-1202); and the Scotch or Irish Augustinian   <b>Richard of St. Victor</b>      <i>(ob. c.</i>    1173), whom Dante held to be &#8220;in contemplation more than  man.&#8221; Richard&#8217;s master and contemporary, the scholastic  philosopher   <b>Hugh</b>    (1097-1141) of the same Abbey of St. Victor at Paris, is also  generally reckoned amongst the mystics of thus period, but with less  reason; since contemplation occupies a small place in his theological  writings. In spite of the deep respect shown towards him by Aquinas  and other theologians, Hugh&#8217;s influence on later mystical  literature was slight. The spirit of Richard and of St. Bernard, on  the contrary, was destined to dominate it for the next two hundred  years. With them the literature of mediaeval mysticism properly so  called begins.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_v-p16"></A>This literature Falls into two classes: the personal  and the didactic. Sometimes, as in a celebrated sermon of St. Bernard,  the two are combined; the teacher appealing to his own experience in  illustration of his theme. In the works of the Victorines the attitude  is didactic: one might almost say scientific. In them  mysticism&#8212;that is to say, the degrees of contemplation, the  training and exercise of the spiritual sense&#8212;takes its place as  a recognized department of theology. It is in Richard&#8217;s  favourite symbolism, &#8220;Benjamin,&#8221; the beloved child of  Rachel, emblem of the Contemplative Life: and in his two chief works,  &#8220;Benjamin Major&#8221; and &#8220;Benjamin Minor,&#8221; it is  classified and described in all its branches. Though mysticism was for  Richard the &#8220;science of the heart&#8221; and he had little  respect for secular learning, yet his solid intellectuality did much  to save the medieval school from the perils of religious emotionalism.  In his hands the antique mystical tradition which flowed through  Plotinus and the Areopagite, was codified and <a name="page_459"><font size="1" color="green">p. 459</font></A> <A NAME="an_v-Page_459"></A>  transmitted to the mediaeval world. Like his master, Hugh, he had the  mediaeval passion for elaborate allegory, neat arrangement, rigid  classification, and significant numbers in things. As Dante parcelled  out Heaven, Purgatory, and Hell with mathematical precision, and  proved that Beatrice was herself a Nine, so these writers divide and  subdivide the stages of contemplation, the states of the soul, the  degrees of Divine Love: and perform terrible   <i>tours de force</i>    in the course of compelling the ever-variable expressions of  man&#8217;s spiritual vitality to fall into orderly and parallel  series, conformable to the mystic numbers of Seven, Four, and  Three.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_v-p17"></A>The influence of Richard of St. Victor, great as it  was, is exceeded by that of St. Bernard; the dominant spiritual  personality of the twelfth century. Bernard&#8217;s career of  ceaseless and varied activity sufficiently disproves the  &#8220;idleness&#8221; of the contemplative type. He continued and  informed with his own spirit the Benedictine tradition, and his  writings quickly took their place, with those of Richard of St.  Victor, among the living forces which conditioned the development of  later mysticism. Both these mystics exerted a capital influence on the  formation of our national school of mysticism in the fourteenth  century. Translations and paraphrases of the &#8220;Benjamin  Major,&#8221; &#8220;Benjamin Minor,&#8221; and other works of Richard  of St. Victor, and of various tracts and epistles of St. Bernard, are  constantly met with in the MS. collections of mystical and theological  literature written in England in the thirteenth and fourteenth  centuries. An early paraphrase of the &#8220;Benjamin Minor,&#8221;  sometimes attributed to Richard Rolle, was probably made by the  anonymous author of &#8220;The Cloud of Unknowing,&#8221; who was also  responsible for the first appearance of the Areopagite in English  dress.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_v-p18"></A>If mediaeval mysticism in the West develops mainly  under the sane and enduring influence of the Victorines and St.  Bernard, in Germany and Italy it appeared in a more startling form;  seeking, in the prophetic activities of St. Hildegarde of Bingen and  the Abbot Joachim of Flora, to influence the course of secular  history. In St. Hildegarde and her fellow-Benedictine   <b>St. Elizabeth of Sh&ouml;nau</b>    (1138-1165) we have the first of that long line of women  mystics&#8212;visionaries, prophetesses, and political  reformers&#8212;combining spiritual transcendence with great practical  ability, of whom St. Catherine of Siena is probably the greatest  example. Exalted by the strength of their spiritual intuitions, they  emerged from an obscure life to impose their wills, and their reading  of events, upon the world. From the point of view of Eternity, in  whose light they lived, they attacked the sins of their generation.  St. Hildegarde, a woman of powerful character, apparently possessed of  abnormal psychic gifts, was driven by that Living Light which was her  inspiration to denounce the corruptions of Church and State. In the  inspired letters which she sent like firebrands over Europe, we see  German idealism and German practicality struggling together; the  unflinching description of abuses, the vast poetic vision by which  they are condemned. These qualities are seen again in the South German  mystics of the next century: the four Benedictine women of genius, who  <a name="page_460"><font size="1" color="green">p. 460</font></A> <A NAME="an_v-Page_460"></A> had their home in the convent of Helfde. These are  the   <b>Nun Gertrude</b>    (Abbess 1251-1291) and her sister   <b>St. Mechthild of Hackborn</b>      <i>(ob.</i>    1310), with her sublime symbolic visions: then, the poet of the  group, the exquisite   <b>Mechthild of Magdeburg</b>    (1212-1299), who, first a   <i>b&eacute;guine</i>    at Magdeburg, where she wrote the greater part of &#8220;The Flowing  Light of the Godhead,&#8221; came to Helfde in 1268; last the  celebrated   <b>St. Gertrude the Great</b>    (1256-1311). In these contemplatives the political spirit is less  marked than in St. Hildegarde: but religious and ethical activity  takes its place. St. Gertrude the Great is a characteristic Catholic  visionary of the feminine type: absorbed in her subjective  experiences, her often beautiful and significant dreams, her loving  conversations with Christ and the Blessed Virgin. Close to her in  temperament is St. Mechthild of Hackborn; but her attitude as a whole  is more impersonal, more truly mystic. The great symbolic visions in  which her most spiritual perceptions are expressed are artistic  creations rather than psycho-sensorial hallucinations, and dwell  little upon the humanity of Christ, with which St. Gertrude is  constantly occupied. The terms in which Mechthild of  Magdeburg&#8212;an educated and well-born woman, half poet, half  seer&#8212;describes her union with God are intensely individual, and  apparently owe more to the romantic poets of her time than to earlier  religious writers. The works of this Mechthild, early translated into  Latin, were read by Dante. Their influence is traceable in the  &#8220;Paradiso&#8221;; and by some scholars she is believed to be the  Matilda of his Earthly Paradise, though others give this position to  her sister-mystic, St. Mechthild of Hackborn.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_v-p19"></A>Modern scholarship tends more and more to see in the  strange personality of the Abbot Joachim of Flora, whom Dante placed  among the great contemplatives in the Heaven of the Sun, the chief  influence in the development of Italian mysticism. The true import of  his prophecies, which proclaimed in effect the substitution of  mystical for institutional Christianity, was only appreciated after  his death. But their prestige grew during the course of the thirteenth  century; especially after the appearance of the mendicant friars, who  seemed to fulfil his prediction that the new era of the Holy Spirit  would be brought in about the year 1260 by two new Orders who would  live in poverty the spiritual life. From this time, Joachism found its  chief vehicle of expression through Franciscan mysticism of the more  revolutionary sort. Though there is no evidence that   <b>St. Francis of Assisi</b>    (1182-1226) knew the prophecies of the &#8220;Eternal Gospel,&#8221;  he can hardly have grown up without some knowledge of them, and also  of the Cathari and other semi-mystical heresies&#8212;many of them  stressing the idea of evangelical poverty&#8212;which were spreading  through Italy from the north. But the mystical genius which may have  received food from these sources was itself strikingly original; the  spontaneous expression of a rare personality, a great spiritual  realist who admitted no rival to the absolute claims of the mystical  life of poverty and joy. St. Francis was untouched by monastic  discipline, or the writings of Dionysius or St. Bernard. His only  literary influence was the New Testament. With him, mysticism comes  into the open air, seeks to transform the stuff of daily life, <a name="page_461"><font size="1" color="green">p. 461</font></A> <A NAME="an_v-Page_461"></A> speaks the vernacular, turns the songs of the troubadours  to the purposes of Divine love; yet remains completely loyal to the  Catholic Church. None who came after him succeeded in recapturing his  secret which was the secret of spiritual genius of the rarest type:  but he left his mark upon the history, art and literature of Western  Europe, and the influence of his spirit still lives.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_v-p20"></A>In a general sense it is true to say that Italian  mysticism descends from St. Francis, and in its first period seems  almost to be the prerogative of his disciples; especially those of the  &#8220;Spiritual&#8221; party who strove to maintain his ideals in  their purity. It is here that we find Franciscan ardour and  singlemindedness in alliance with apocalyptic notions deriving from  Joachist ideas. In Provence, a widespread mystical movement coloured  by Joachism was led by Hugues de Digne and his sister   <b>St. Douceline</b>    (  <i>n</i>   . 1214); in whom we find a spirit which, like that of Francis, could  find the Divine through flowers and birds and simple natural things.  In Italy, nourished by the influence of such deeply mystical friars as    <b>John of Parma</b>      <i>(ob.</i>    1288  <i>)</i>    and   <b>John of La Verna</b>   , this Franciscan spirituality entered into conflict with the  ecclesiastical politics of the day; taking up that duty of denouncing  the corruptions of the Church, which has so often attracted the  mystics. Here the typical figure is that of   <b>Jacopone da Todi</b>      <i>(</i>   1228-1306), the converted lawyer turned mystical poet. On one hand  deeply influenced by St. Augustine and Dionysius the Areopagite, on  the other the devoted exponent of the Founder&#8217;s ideals, his  &#8220;spiritual songs&#8221; lift Franciscan mysticism to the heights  of ecstatic rapture and literary expression; whilst his savage  castigations of the Papacy give him a place among the great mediaeval  satirists. Jacopone&#8217;s poems have been shown by Von H&uuml;gel to  have had a formative influence on St. Catherine of Genoa; and have  probably affected many other mystics, not only in Italy but elsewhere,  for they quickly attained considerable circulation.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_v-p21"></A>In his contemporary the   <b>Blessed Angela of Foligno</b>    (1248-1309) who was converted from a sinful life to become a tertiary  hermit of the Franciscan Order we have a mystic of the first rank  whose visions and revelations place her in the same class as St.  Catherine of Genoa and St. Teresa. Known to her followers as the  Mistress of Theologians, and numbering among her disciples the  brilliant and tempestuous &#8220;spiritual&#8221; friar Ubertino da  Casale, the lofty metaphysical element in Angela&#8217;s mysticism  suggests the high level of spiritual culture achieved in Franciscan  circles of her time. By the sixteenth century her works, translated  into the vernacular, had taken their place amongst the classics of  mysticism. In the seventeenth they were largely used by St.  Fran&ccedil;ois de Sales, Madame Guyon, and other Catholic  contemplatives. Seventeen years older than Dante, whose great genius  properly closes this line of spiritual descent, she is a link between  the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries in Italian mysticism.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_v-p22"></A>We now approach the Golden Age of Mysticism: and at  the opening of that epoch, dominating it by their peculiar combination  of intellectual and spiritual power stand the figures of the  &#8220;Seraphic and Angelic <a name="page_462"><font size="1" color="green">p. 462</font></A> <A NAME="an_v-Page_462"></A> Doctors,&#8221;   <b>St. Bonaventura</b>   , the Franciscan (1221-1274), and   <b>St. Thomas Aquinas</b>   , the Dominican (1226-1274). As with St. Augustine, the intellectual  greatness of St. Thomas has obscured his mystical side, whilst St.  Bonaventura, the apostle of a wise moderation, may easily appear to  the hurried reader the least mystical of the Franciscan mystics. Yet  both were contemplatives, and because of this were able to interpret  to the medieval world the great spiritual tradition of the past. Hence  their immense influence on the mystical schools of the fourteenth  century. It is sometimes stated that these schools derive mainly from  St. Bonaventura, and represent an opposition to scholastic theology;  but as a matter of fact their greatest personalities&#8212;in  particular Dante and the German Dominicans&#8212;are soaked in the  spirit of Aquinas, and quote his authority at every turn.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_v-p23"></A>In Europe the mystic curve is now approaching its  highest point. In the East that point has already been passed. Sufi,  or Mahommedan mysticism, appearing in the eighth century in the  beautiful figure of   <b>Rabi&#8217;a</b>   , the &#8220;Moslem St. Teresa&#8221; (717-801), and continued by the  martyr   <b>Al Hallaj</b>      <i>(ob.</i>    922), attains literary expression in the eleventh in the  &#8220;Confessions&#8221; of   <b>Al Ghazzali</b>    (1058-1111), and has its classic period in the thirteenth in the  works of the mystic poets   <b>&#8216;Attar</b>    (c. 1140-1234),   <b>Sadi</b>    (1184-1263), and the saintly   <b>Jalalu &#8216;d Din</b>    (1207-1273). Its tradition is continued in the fourteenth century by  the rather erotic mysticism of   <b>Hafiz</b>    (c. 1300-1388) and his successors, and in the fifteenth by the poet   <b>J&aacute;m&iacute;</b>    (1414-1492).</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_v-p24"></A>Whilst Hafiz already strikes a note of decadence for  the mysticism of Islam, the year 1300 is for Western Europe a vital  year in the history of the spiritual life. Mystics of the first rank  are appearing, or about to appear. The Majorcan scholar-mystic   <b>Ramon Lull</b>      <i>(ob.</i>    1315) is drawing to the end of his long life. In Italy   <b>Dante</b>    (1265-1321) is forcing human language to express one of the most  sublime visions of the Absolute which has ever been crystallized into  speech. He inherits and fuses into one that loving and artistic  reading of reality which was the heart of Franciscan mysticism, and  that other ordered vision of the transcendental world which the  Dominicans through Aquinas poured into the stream of European thought.  For the one the spiritual world was all love: for the other all law.  For Dante it was both. In the &#8220;Paradiso&#8221; his stupendous  genius apprehends and shows to us a Beatific Vision in which the  symbolic systems of all great mystics and many whom the world does not  call mystics&#8212;of Dionysius, Richard, St. Bernard, Mechthild,  Aquinas, and countless others&#8212;are included and explained.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_v-p25"></A>The moment in which the &#8220;Commedia&#8221; was  being written coincides with the awakening of mystical activity in  Germany and Flanders. Between the years 1280 and 1309 was produced,  probably in the Liege district and under Franciscan influence, the  curious anonymous work which isnow only known to us in Latin and  English translations&#8212;  <b>&#8220;The Mirror of Simple Souls.&#8221;</b>    This long treatise, clearly influenced by Dionysius, the Victorines,  and the twelfth-century tract known as the &#8220;Letter to the  Brethren of Mons Dei,&#8221; is a piece of mystical literature of an  advanced kind, often fringing the borders of orthodoxy and looking  <a name="page_463"><font size="1" color="green">p. 463</font></A> <A NAME="an_v-Page_463"></A> forward to the speculative Flemish mysticism of the  fourteenth century. Its writer was probably contemporary with the  founder of this school; the great Dominican scholar   <b>Meister Eckhart</b>    (1260-1327), who resembled Dante in his combination of mystical  insight with intense intellectual power, and laid the foundations at  once of German philosophy and German mysticism. These two giants stand  side by side at the opening of the century; perfect representatives of  the Teutonic and Latin instinct for transcendental reality.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_v-p26"></A>Eckhart, though only a few years younger than St.  Gertrude the Great, seems to belong to a different world. His  commanding personality, his genius for the supra-sensible nourished by  the works of Dionysius and Erigena, moulded and inspired all whom it  came near. The German and Flemish mystics of the fourteenth and  fifteenth centuries, differing much in temperament from their master  and from each other, have yet something in common: something which is  shared by no other school. This something is derived from Eckhart; for  all have passed under his hand, being either his immediate disciples,  or the friends or pupils of his disciples. Eckhart&#8217;s doctrine is  chiefly known to us by reports of his vernacular sermons delivered at  Strassburg; then the religious centre of Germany. In these we see him  as a teaching mystic full of pastoral zeal, but demanding a high level  both of intellect and spirituality in those he addressed. Towards the  end of his life he fell into disgrace. A number of propositions  extracted from his writings, and representing his more extreme views,  were condemned by the Church as savouring of pantheism and other  heresies: and certainly the violence and daring of his language laid  him open to misconstruction. In his efforts to speak of the  unspeakable he was constantly betrayed into expressions which were  bound to seem paradoxical and exaggerated to other men.  Eckhart&#8217;s influence, however, was little hurt by ecclesiastical  condemnation. His pupils, though they remained loyal Catholics,  contrived also to be loyal disciples. To the end of their lives their  teaching was coloured&#8212;often inspired&#8212;by the doctrines of  the great, if heretical, scholar whose memory they venerated as that  of a saint.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_v-p27"></A>The contrast in type between Eckhart and his two most  famous disciples is an interesting one. All three were Dominican  friars; all were devout followers of St. Augustine, the Areopagite,  St. Bernard, and Aquinas; all had been trained in the schools of  Cologne, where Albert the Great and St. Thomas had taught, and where  their powerful influence still lived. The mysticism of Eckhart, so far  as he allows us to see it in his sermons and fragmentary writings, is  objective&#8212;one might almost say dogmatic. He describes with an  air of almost terrible certainty and intimacy, not that which he has  felt, but the place or plane of being he has known&#8212;&#8220;the  desert of the Godhead were no one is at home.&#8221; He is a great  scholar, a natural metaphysician passionately condensed with the quest  of Absolute Truth.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_v-p28"></A>Of his two pupils,   <b>John Tauler</b>    (c. 1300-1361), friar-preacher of Strassburg, was a born missionary:  a man who combined with great theological learning and mystical genius  of a high order an overwhelming <a name="page_464"><font size="1" color="green">p. 464</font></A> <A NAME="an_v-Page_464"></A> zeal for souls. He  laboured incessantly to awaken men to a sense of their transcendental  heritage. Without the hard intellectualism occasionally noticeable in  Eckhart, or the tendency to introspection and the excessive artistic  sensibility of Suso, Tauler is the most virile of the German mystics.  The breadth of his humanity is only equalled by the depth of his  spirituality. His sermons&#8212;his only authentic works&#8212;are  trumpet-calls to heroic action upon spiritual levels. They influenced  many later mystics, especially St. Teresa and St. John of the Cross.  Tauler is not a subjective writer: only by implication can we assure  ourselves that he speaks from personal experience. He has sometimes,  though unfairly, been described as a precursor of the Reformation.  Such a claim could only be made by those who look upon all pure  Christianity as a form of Protestant heresy. He attacked, like St.  Hildegarde, St. Catherine of Siena, and many others, the  ecclesiastical corruption of his period: but his writings, if read in  unexpurgated editions, prove him to have been a fervent and orthodox  Catholic.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_v-p29"></A>Tauler was one of the leading spirits in the great  informal society of the   <b>Friends of God</b>   , which sprang into being in Strassburg, spread through the Rhenish  province and beyond to Switzerland and Bavaria, and worked in this  moment of religious decadence for the spiritual regeneration of the  people. In a spirit of fierce enthusiasm and wholehearted devotion,  the Friends of God set themselves to the mystic life as the only life  worthy of the name. A great outburst of transcendental activity took  place: many visions and ecstasies were reported: amazing conversions  occurred. The movement had many features in common with that of the  Quakers; except that it took place within, instead of without, the  official Church, and was partly directed against the doctrines of the  Brethren of the Free Spirit and other heretical sects. With it was  connected the third of the trio of great German Dominican mystics, the    <b>Blessed Henry Suso</b>    (c. 1295-1365), a natural recluse and ascetic, and a visionary of the  most exuberant Catholic type. To Suso, subjective, romantic, deeply  interested in his own soul and his personal relation with God,  mysticism was not so much a doctrine to be imparted to other men as an  intimate personal adventure. Though a trained philosopher and  theologian, and a devoted follower of Eckhart, his  autobiography&#8212;a human document far more detailed and ingenuous  than St. Teresa&#8217;s more celebrated &#8220;Life&#8221;&#8212;is  mainly the record of his griefs and joys, his pains, visions,  ecstasies, and miseries. Even his mystical treatises are in dialogue  form, as if he could hardly get away from the personal and dramatic  aspect of the spiritual life.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_v-p30"></A>Around these three&#8212;Eckhart, Tauler,  Suso&#8212;are gathered other and more shadowy personalities: members  of this mystical society of the Friends of God, bound to the heroic  attempt to bring life&#8212;the terribly corrupt and disordered  religious life of the fourteenth century&#8212;back into relation with  spiritual reality, to initiate their neighbours into the atmosphere of  God. From one of these nameless members comes the literary jewel of  the movement: the beautiful little treatise called the   <b>&#8220;Theologia Germanica,&#8221;</b>    or &#8220;Book of the Perfect Life,&#8221; probably written in  Frankfort about the year 1350 by a priest of the Teutonic Order.  <a name="page_465"><font size="1" color="green">p. 465</font></A> <A NAME="an_v-Page_465"></A> One of the most successful of many attempts to make  mystic principles available for common men, this book was greatly  loved by Luther, who published an incomplete edition in 1518. Other  Friends of God are now only known to us as the authors of letters,  descriptions of conversions, visions, and spiritual  adventures&#8212;literature which the movement produced in enormous  quantities. No part of the history of mysticism has been more changed  by recent research than that of the Rhenish school: and the work is  still but partly done. At present we can only record the principal  names which we find connected with the mystical propaganda of the  Friends of God. These are first the nuns   <b>Margaret Ebner</b>    (1291-1351) and her sister   <b>Christina</b>   , important personages in the movement upon whose historicity no  doubts have been cast. Margaret appears to have been a psychic as well  as a mystic: and to have possessed, like Madame Guyon, telepathic and  clairvoyant powers. Next the rather shadowy pair of laymen,   <b>Henry of Nordlingen</b>    and   <b>Nicolas of Basle</b>   . Lastly the puzzling figure of   <b>Rulman Merswin</b>    (c. 1310-1382), author of the series of apocalyptic visions called  The Book of the Nine Rocks&#8221;; whose story of his conversion and  mystic life, whether it be regarded as fact or &#8220;tendency  literature,&#8221; is a psychological document of the first rank.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_v-p31"></A>In immediate dependence on the German school, and like  it drawing its intellectual vigour from the genius of Eckhart, is the  mysticism of Flanders: best known to us in the work of its most  sublime representative, the   <b>Blessed John Ruysbroeck</b>    (1293-1381), one of the greatest mystics whom the world has yet  known. In Ruysbroeck&#8217;s works the metaphysical and personal  aspects of mystical truth are fused and attain their highest  expression. Intellectually indebted to St. Augustine, Richard of St.  Victor, and Eckhart, his value lies in the fact that the Eckhartian  philosophy was merely the medium by which he expressed the results of  profound experience. In his early years a priest in Brussels, in old  age a recluse in the forest of Soignes, Ruysbroeck&#8217;s influence  on his own generation was great. Through his disciple   <b>Gerard Groot</b>    (1340-1384), founder of the Brotherhood of the Common Life, it formed  the inspiration of the religious movement of the New Devotion; which  carried over into the next century the spirit of the great mediaeval  mystics. The mystical writings of   <b>Henry de Mande</b>    (c. 1360-1415), the &#8220;Ruysbroeck of the North,&#8221; the  beautiful and deeply Platonic &#8220;Fiery Soliloquy with God&#8221;  of   <b>Gerlac Petersen</b>    (1378-1411), and above all the &#8220;Imitation of Christ&#8221; of  his friend   <b>Thomas &agrave; Kempis</b>    (1380-1471), in which some of Gerard Groot&#8217;s meditations may be  enshrined, are the chief channels through which this mystical current  passed. In the next century the Franciscan   <b>Henry de Herp</b>    or Harphius   <i>(ob.</i>    1477) and two greater personalities&#8212;the learned and holy  Platonist, Cardinal   <b>Nicolas of Cusa</b>    (1401-1464), and his friend the theologian and contemplative   <b>Denis the Carthusian</b>    (1402-1471), one of the great religious figures of the fifteenth  century&#8212;drew their inspiration from Ruysbroeck. Denis translated  the whole of his works into Latin; and calls him &#8220;another  Dionysius&#8221; but &#8220;clear where the Areopagite is  obscure.&#8221; It was mainly through the voluminous writings of  Denis, widely read <a name="page_466"><font size="1" color="green">p. 466</font></A> <A NAME="an_v-Page_466"></A> during succeeding centuries,  that the doctrine of the mediaeval mystics was carried over to the  Renaissance world. Ruysbroeck&#8217;s works, with those of Suso,  appear in English MSS. early in the fifteenth century, taking their  place by the side of St. Bernard, St. Bonaventura, and the great  English mystic Richard Rolle. The influence of his genius has also  been detected in the mystical literature of Spain.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_v-p32"></A>English mysticism seems to have its roots in the  religious revival which arose during Stephen&#8217;s reign. It was  then, and throughout its course, closely linked with the solitary  life. Its earnest literary monument, the &#8220;Ancren Riwle,&#8221;  was written early in the twelfth century for the use of three  anchoresses. So too the &#8220;Meditations&#8221; of   <b>St. Aldred</b>    (Abbot of Rievaulx 1146-1166), and the Rule he wrote for his  anchoress sister, presuppose the desire for the mystical life. But the  first English mystic we can name with certainty is   <b>Margery Kempe</b>    (probably writing c. 1290), the anchoress of Lynn. Even so, we know  nothing of this woman&#8217;s life; and only a fragment of her  &#8220;Contemplations&#8221; has survived. It is with the next name,   <b>Richard Rolle of Hampole</b>    (c. 1300-1349), that the short but brilliant procession of English  mystics begins. Rolle, educated at Oxford and perhaps at Paris, and  widely read in theology, became a hermit in order to live in  perfection that mystic life of &#8220;Heat, Sweetness, and  Song,&#8221; to which he felt himself to be called. Richard of St.  Victor, St. Bernard, and St. Bonaventura are the authors who have  influenced him most; but he remains, in spite of this, one of the most  individual of all writers on mysticism. A voluminous author, his chief  works are still in MS., and he seems to have combined the careers of  writer and wandering preacher with that of recluse. He laid claim to  direct inspiration, was outspoken in his criticisms of religious and  secular life, and in the next generation the Lollards were found to  appeal to his authority. Rolle already shows the practical temper  characteristic of the English school. His interest was not philosophy,  but spiritual life; and especially his own experience of it. There is  a touch of Franciscan poetry in his descriptions of his communion with  Divine Love, and the &#8220;heavenly song&#8221; in which it was  expressed, of Franciscan ardour in his zeal for souls. His works  greatly influenced succeeding English mystics.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_v-p33"></A>He was followed in the second half of the fourteenth  century by the unknown author of   <b>&#8220;The Cloud of Unknowing&#8221;</b>    and its companion treatises, and by the gracious spirit of   <b>Walter Hilton</b>      <i>(ob.</i>    1396). With &#8220;The Cloud of Unknowing,&#8221; the spirit of  Dionysius first appears in English literature. It is the work of an  advanced contemplative, deeply influenced by the Areopagite and the  Victorines, who was also an acute psychologist. From the hand that  wrote it came the first English translation of the &#8220;Theologia  Mystica,&#8221; &#8220;Dionise Hid Divinite&#8221;: a work which says  an old writer, &#8220;ran across England at deere rates,&#8221; so  ready was the religious consciousness of the time for the reception of  mystical truth.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_v-p34"></A>Hilton, though also influenced by Dionysius and  Richard of St. Victor, addresses a wider audience. He is pre-eminently  a spiritual director, the practical teacher of interior ways, not a  metaphysician; and his great work &#8220;The Scale of  Perfection&#8221; quickly took rank among the <a name="page_467"><font size="1" color="green">p. 467</font></A> <A NAME="an_v-Page_467"></A>  classics of the spiritual life. The moment of his death coincides with  the completion of the most beautiful of all English mystical works,  the &#8220;Revelations of Love&#8221; of the anchoress   <b>Julian of Norwich</b>    (1343&#8211;died after 1413), <A NAME="an_v-p34.1"></A>&#8220;theodidacta, profunda,  ecstatica,&#8221; whose unique personality closes and  crowns the history of English mediaeval mysticism. In her the best  gifts of Rolle and Hilton are transmuted by a &#8220;genius for the  infinite&#8221; of a peculiarly beautiful and individual type. She was  a seer, a lover, and a poet. Though considerable theological knowledge  underlies her teaching, it is in essence the result of a direct and  personal vision of singular intensity.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_v-p35"></A>Already before the completion of Julian&#8217;s  revelations two other women of genius, the royal prophetess and  founder   <b>St. Bridget of Sweden</b>    (1303-1373) and   <b>St. Catherine of Siena</b>    (1347-1380), had lived and died. St. Bridget, or Birgitta, a mystic  and visionary of the Hildegardian type, believed herself called to end  the exile of the Papacy and bring peace to the Church. Four months  after her death, St. Catherine&#8212;then aged 26&#8212;took up her  unfinished work. The true successor of Dante as a revealer of Reality,  and next to St. Francis the greatest of Italian mystics, Catherine  exhibits the Unitive Life in its richest, most perfect form. She was a  great active and a great ecstatic: at once politician, teacher, and  contemplative, holding a steady balance between the inner and the  outer life. Well named &#8220;the mother of thousands of souls,&#8221;  with little education she yet contrived, in a short career dogged by  persistent ill-health, to change the course of history, rejuvenate  religion, and compose, in her &#8220;Divine Dialogue,&#8221; one of  the jewels of Italian religious literature.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_v-p36"></A>With the first half of the fifteenth century it is  plain that the mystic curve droops downwards. At its opening we find  the influential figure of the Chancellor   <b>Gerson</b>    (1363-1429) at once a mystic in his own right and a keen and  impartial critic of extravagant mystical teachings and phenomena. But  the great period is over: the new life of the Renaissance, already  striving in other spheres of activity, has hardly touched the  spiritual plane. A transient revival of Franciscan spirituality is  associated with the work of three reforming mystics; the energetic  French visionary   <b>St. Colette of Corbie</b>    (1381-1447), her Italian disciple   <b>St. Bernardino of Siena</b>    (1380-1444), and the ecstatic Clarisse,   <b>St. Catherine of Bologna</b>    (1413-1463). Contemporary with this group are the careers of two  strongly contrasted woman-mystics:   <b>St. Joan of Arc</b>    (1412-1431), and the suffering Flemish visionary   <b>St. Lydwine of Schiedam</b>    (1380-1432).</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_v-p37"></A>With the second half of the century the scene shifts  to Italy, where a spiritual genius of the first rank appeared in   <b>St. Catherine of Genoa</b>    (1447-1510). She, like her namesake of Siena, was at once an eager  lover and an indomitable doer. More, she was a constructive mystic, a  profound thinker as well as an ecstatic: an original teacher, a busy  and practical philanthropist. Her influence lived on, and is seen in  the next generation in the fine, well-balanced nature of another  contemplative: the   <b>Venerable Battista Vernazza</b>    (1497-1587), her goddaughter and the child of one of her most loyal  friends. Catherine of Genoa <a name="page_468"><font size="1" color="green">p. 468</font></A> <A NAME="an_v-Page_468"></A> stands alone in her day  as an example of the sane and vigorous mystic life. Her contemporaries  were for the most part visionaries of the more ordinary female type,  such as   <b>Osanna Andreasi of Mantua</b>    (1449-1505),   <b>Columba Rieti</b>    (c. 1430-1501) and her disciple   <b>Lucia of Narni</b>   . They seem to represent the slow extinction of the spirit which  burned so bright in St. Catherine of Siena.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_v-p38"></A>That spirit reappears in the sixteenth century in  Flanders in the works of the Benedictine Abbot   <b>Blosius</b>    (1506-1565); and, far more conspicuously, in Spain, a country hardly  touched by the outburst of mystical life which elsewhere closed the  medieval period. Spanish mysticism first appears in close connection  with the religious orders: in the Franciscans   <b>Francisco de Osuna</b>      <i>(ob. c.</i>    1540), whose manual of contemplative prayer influenced the  development of St. Teresa, and   <b>St. Peter of Alcantara</b>    (1499-1562), her friend and adviser; in the Dominican   <b>Luis de Granada</b>    (1504-1588) and the Augustinian   <b>Luis de Leon</b>    (1528-1591). It attains definite and characteristic expression in the  life and personality of   <b>St. Ignatius Loyola</b>    (1491-1556), the great founder of the Society of Jesus. The concrete  nature of St. Ignatius&#8217; work, and especially its later  developments, has blinded historians to the fact that he was a true  mystic, own brother to such great actives as St. Teresa and George  Fox, actuated by the same vision of reality, passing through the same  stages of psychological growth. His spiritual sons greatly influenced  the inner life of the great Carmelite,   <b>St. Teresa</b>    (1515-1582).</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_v-p39"></A>Like St. Catherine of Siena, these mystics&#8212;and  to them we must add St. Teresa&#8217;s greatest disciple, the poet and  contemplative   <b>St. John of the Cross</b>    (1542-1591)&#8212;seem to have arisen in direct response to the need  created by the corrupt or disordered religious life of their time.  They were the &#8220;saints of the counter-Reformation&#8221;; and, in  a period of ecclesiastical chaos, flung the weight of their genius and  their sanctity into the orthodox Catholic scale. Whilst St. Ignatius  organized a body of spiritual soldiery, who should attack heresy and  defend the Church, St. Teresa, working against heavy odds, infused new  vitality into a great religious order and restored it to its duty of  direct communion with the transcendental world. In this she was helped  by St. John of the Cross; who, a psychologist and philosopher as well  as a great mystic, performed the necessary function of bringing the  personal experience of the Spanish school back again into touch with  the main stream of mystic tradition. All three, practical organizers  and profound contemplatives, exhibit in its splendour the dual  character of the mystic life. They left behind them in their literary  works an abiding influence which has guided the footsteps and  explained the discoveries of succeeding generations of adventurers in  the transcendental world. The true spiritual children of these mystics  are to be found, not in their own country, where the religious life  which they had lifted to transcendent levels degenerated when their  overmastering influence was withdrawn, but amongst the innumerable  contemplative souls of succeeding generations who have fallen under  the spell of the &#8220;Spiritual Exercises,&#8221; the  &#8220;Interior Castle,&#8221; or the &#8220;Dark Night of the  Soul.&#8221; <a name="page_469"><font size="1" color="green">p. 469</font></A> <A NAME="an_v-Page_469"></A></p>   
<p><A NAME="an_v-p40"></A>The Divine fire lit by the great Carmelites of Spain  is next seen in Italy, in the lives of the Dominican nun   <b>St. Catherine dei Ricci</b>    (1522-1590) and the Florentine Carmelite   <b>St. Maria Maddelena dei Pazzi</b>    (1566-1607), the author of voluminous literary works. It appears in  the New World in the beautiful figure of   <b>St. Rose of Lima</b>    (1586-1617), the Peruvian nun; and at the same moment, under a very  different aspect, in Protestant Germany, in the person of one of the  giants of mysticism, the &#8220;inspired shoemaker&#8221;   <b>Jacob Boehme</b>    (1575-1624).</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_v-p41"></A>Boehme, one of the most astonishing cases in history  of a natural genius for the transcendent, has left his mark upon  German philosophy as well as upon the history of mysticism. William  Law, Blake, and Saint-Martin are amongst those who have sat at his  feet. The great sweep of Boehme&#8217;s vision includes both Man and  the Universe: the nature of God and of the Soul. In him we find again  that old doctrine of Rebirth which the earlier German mystics had  loved. Were it not for the difficult symbolism in which his vision is  expressed, his influence would be far greater than it is. He remains  one of those cloud-wrapped immortals who must be rediscovered and  reinterpreted by the adventurers of every age.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_v-p42"></A>The seventeenth century rivals the fourteenth in the  richness and variety of its mystical life. Two main currents are to be  detected in it: dividing between them the two main aspects of  man&#8217;s communion with the Absolute. One, symbolic, constructive,  activistic, bound up with the ideas of regeneration, and often using  the language of the alchemists sets out from the Teutonic genius of  Boehme. It achieves its successes outside the Catholic Church, and  chiefly in Germany and England, where by 1650 his works were widely  known. In its decadent forms it runs to the occult: to alchemy,  Rosicrucianism, apocalyptic prophecy, and other aberrations of the  spiritual sense. The other current arises within the Catholic Church,  and in close touch with the great tradition of Christian mysticism. It  achieves fullest expansion in France, and tends to emphasize the  personal and intimate side of contemplation: encouraging passive  receptivity and producing in its exaggerated forms the aberrations of  the Quietists.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_v-p43"></A>In the seventeenth century England was peculiarly  rich, if not in great mystics, at any rate in mystically minded men,  seekers after Reality. Mysticism, it seems, was in the air; broke out  under many disguises and affected many forms of life. It produced in   <b>George Fox</b>    (1624-1690), the founder of the Quakers, a &#8220;great active&#8221;  of the first rank, entirely unaffected by tradition, and in the Quaker  movement itself an outbreak of genuine mysticism which is only  comparable to the fourteenth-century movement of the Friends of  God.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_v-p44"></A>We meet in Fox that overwhelming sense of direct  relationship with God, that consciousness of the transcendent  characteristic of the mystic; and Quaker spirituality, in spite of its  marked aversion to institutional religion, has much in common not only  with those Continental Quietists who are its most obvious spiritual  affinities, but also with the doctrine of the Catholic contemplatives.  Mysticism crops up frequently in the writings of the school; and finds  expression in the first generation in <a name="page_470"><font size="1" color="green">p. 470</font></A> <A NAME="an_v-Page_470"></A> the works of   <b>Isaac Penington</b>    (1616-1679) and in the second in the Journal of the heroic American  Friend   <b>John Woolman</b>    (1720-1772).</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_v-p45"></A>At the opposite end of the theological scale, the  seventeenth century gives us a group ofEnglish mystics ofthe Catholic  type, closely related to the contemporary French school. Of these, one  of the most individual is the young Benedictine nun   <b>Gertrude More</b>    (1606-1633), who carries on that tradition of the communion oflove  which flows from St. Augustine through St. Bernard and Thomas &agrave;  Kempis, and is the very heart of Catholic mysticism. In the writings  of her director, and the preserver of her works, the   <b>Venerable Augustine Baker</b>    (1575-1641)&#8212;one of the most lucid and orderly of guides to the  contemplative life&#8212;we see what were still the formative  influences in the environment where her mystical powers were trained.  Richard of St. Victor, Hilton, and &#8220;The Cloud of  Unknowing&#8221;; Angela of Foligno; Tauler, Suso, Ruysbroeck; St.  Teresa and St. John of the Cross; these are the authorities to whom  Augustine Baker most constantly appeals, and through these, as we  know, the family tree of the mystics goes back to the Neoplatonists  and the first founders of the Church.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_v-p46"></A>Outside that Church, the twins   <b>Thomas Vaughan</b>    the spiritual alchemist and   <b>Henry Vaughan</b>   , Silurist, the mystical poet (1622-1695) show the reaction of two  very different temperaments upon the transcendental life. Again, the  group of &#8220;Cambridge Platonists,&#8221;   <b>Henry More</b>    (1614-1687),   <b>John Smith</b>    (1618-1652),   <b>Benjamin Whichcote</b>    (1609-1683),   <b>Peter Sterry</b>    (c. 1614-1672), and   <b>John Norris</b>    (1657-1711) developed and preached a philosophy deeply tinged with  mysticism; and   <b>Thomas Traherne</b>    (c. 1637-1674) gave poetic expression to the Platonic vision of life.  In   <b>Bishop Hall</b>    (1574-1656) the same spirit takes a devotional form. Finally, the  Rosicrucians, symbolists, and other spiritually minded  occultists&#8212;above all the extraordinary sect of Philadelphians,  ruled by   <b>Dr. Pordage</b>    (1608-1698) and the prophetess   <b>Jane Lead</b>    (1623-1704)&#8212;exhibit mysticism in its least balanced aspect  mingled with mediumistic phenomena, wild symbolic visions, and  apocalyptic prophecies. The influence of these Philadelphians, who  were themselves strongly affected by Boehme&#8217;s works, lingered  for a century, appearing again in Saint-Martin the &#8220;Unknown  Philosopher.&#8221;</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_v-p47"></A>The Catholic mysticism of this period is best seen in  France, where the intellectual and social expansion of the Grande  Si&egrave;cle had also its spiritual side. Over against the brilliant  worldly life of seventeenth-century Paris and the slackness and even  corruption of much organized religion there sprang up something like a  cult of the inner life. This mystical renaissance seems to have  originated in the work of an English Capuchin friar, William Fitch, in  religion   <b>Benedict Canfield</b>    (1520-1611), who settled in Paris in old age and there became a  centre of spiritual influence. Among his pupils were   <b>Madame Acarie</b>    (1566-1618) and   <b>Pierre de B&eacute;rulle</b>    (1575-1629), and through them his teaching on contemplation affected  all the great religious personalities of the period. The house of  Madame Acarie&#8212;a woman equally remarkable for spiritual genius  and practical ability&#8212;became the gathering-point of a growing  mystical enthusiasm, which also expressed itself in a vigorous <a name="page_471"><font size="1" color="green">p. 471</font></A> <A NAME="an_v-Page_471"></A> movement of reform within the Church. B&eacute;rulle was one  of the founders of the Oratory. Madame Acarie, known as the  &#8220;conscience of Paris,&#8221; visited the relaxed convents and  persuaded them to a more strict and holy life. Largely by her  instrumentality, the first houses of reformed Carmelites were  established in France in 1604, nuns being brought to direct them from  St. Teresa&#8217;s Spanish convents, and French mysticism owes much to  this direct contact with the Teresian school. Madame Acarie and her  three daughters all became Carmelite nuns; and it was from the Dijon  Carmelites that   <b>St. Jeanne Fran&ccedil;oise de Chantal</b>    (1572-1641) received her training in contemplation. Her spiritual  father, and co-founder of the Order of the Visitation,   <b>St. Fran&ccedil;ois de Sales</b>    (1567-1622), had also been in youth a member of Madame Acarie&#8217;s  circle. He shows at its best the peculiar talent of the French school  for the detailed and individual direction of souls. Outside this  cultured and aristocratic group two great and pure mystics arise from  humbler social levels. First the intrepid Ursuline nun   <b>Marie de l&#8217;Incarnation</b>    (1599-1672), the pioneer of education in the New World, in whom we  find again St. Teresa&#8217;s twin gifts for high contemplation and  practical initiative. Secondly the Carmelite friar   <b>Brother Lawrence</b>    (1611-1691), who shows the passive tendency of French mysticism in  its most sane, well-balanced form. He was a humble empiricist, laying  claim to no special gifts: a striking contrast to his contemporary,  the brilliant and unhappy genius   <b>Pascal</b>    (1623-1662), who fought his way through many psychic storms to the  vision of the Absolute.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_v-p48"></A>The genuine French and Flemish mysticism of this  period, greatly preoccupied with the doctrines of self-naughting and  passivity, constantly approached the frontiers of Quietism. The three  great Capuchin teachers of contemplation, the Flemings   <b>Constantine Barban&ccedil;on</b>    (1581-1632) and   <b>John Evangelist of Barluke</b>    (1588-1635), and the English Benedict Canfield, were not entirely  beyond suspicion in this regard; as their careful language, and the  scrutiny to which they were subjected by contemporary authority,  clearly shows. The line between the true and false doctrine was a fine  one, as we see in the historic controversy between Bossuet and  Fenelon; and the perilous absurdities of the Quietist writers often  tempted the orthodox to draw it in the wrong place.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_v-p49"></A>The earliest in date and most exaggerated in type of  these true Quietists is the Franco-Flemish   <b>Antoinette Bourignan</b>    (1616-1680): a strong-willed and wrong-headed woman who, having  renounced the world with Franciscan thoroughness, founded a sect,  endured considerable persecutions, and made a great stir in the  religious life of her time. An even greater uproar resulted from the  doctrinal excesses of the devout Spanish priest   <b>Miguel de Molinos</b>    (1640-1697); whose extreme teachings were condemned by the Church,  and for a time brought the whole principle of passive contemplation  into disrepute. Quietism, at bottom, was the unbalanced expression of  that need which produced the contemporary Quaker movement in England:  a need for personal contact with spiritual realities, evoked by the  formal and unsatisfying quality of the official religion of the time.  Unfortunately the great <a name="page_472"><font size="1" color="green">p. 472</font></A> <A NAME="an_v-Page_472"></A> Quietists were not great  mystics. Hence their propaganda, in which the principle of  passivity&#8212;divorced from, and opposed to, all spiritual  action&#8212;was pressed to its logical conclusion, resulted in a  doctrine fatal not only to all organized religion but to the healthy  development of the inner life.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_v-p50"></A>  <b>Madame Guyon</b>    (1648-1717), the contemporary of Molinos, is usually quoted as a  typical Quietist. She is an example of the unfortunate results of an  alliance of mystical tendencies with a feeble surface intelligence.  Had she possessed the robust common sense so often found in the great  contemplatives, her temperamental inclination to passivity would have  been checked, and she would hardly have made use of the exaggerated  expressions which brought about the official condemnation of her  works. In spite of the brilliant championship of Fenelon, and the fact  that much of her writing merely reproduces orthodox teaching on  contemplative prayer in an inferior form, she was involved in the  general condemnation of &#8220;passive orison&#8221; which the  aberrations of the extreme Quietists had called forth.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_v-p51"></A>The end of the seventeenth century saw a great  outburst of popular Quietism, some within and some without the  official Church. Well within the frontiers of orthodoxy, and  exhibiting the doctrine of passivity in its noblest form, was the  Jesuit   <b>J. P. de Caussade</b>    (still living 1739). Among those who over-stepped the  boundary&#8212;though all the Quietists appealed to the general  tradition of mysticism in support of their one-sided  doctrine&#8212;were   <b>Malaval</b>   , whose &#8220;Th&eacute;ologie Mystique&#8221; contains some beautiful  French translations from St. Teresa, and   <b>Peter Poiret</b>    (1646-1719), once a Protestant pastor, then the devoted disciple of  Antoinette Bourignan. Later generations owe much to the enthusiasm and  industry of Poiret, whose belief in spiritual quiescence was combined  with great literary activity. He rescued and edited all Madame  Guyon&#8217;s writings; and has left us, in his &#8220;Bibliotheca  Mysticorum,&#8221; the memorial of many lost works on mysticism. From  this unique bibliography we can see how &#8220;orthodox&#8221; was the  food which nourished even the most extreme of the Quietists: how  thoroughly they believed themselves to represent not a new doctrine,  but the true tradition of Christian mysticism.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_v-p52"></A>With the close of the seventeenth century, the  Quietist movement faded away. The beginning of the eighteenth sees the  triumph of that other stream of spiritual vitality which arose outside  the Catholic Church and flowed from the great personality of Jacob  Boehme. If the idea of surrender be the mainspring of Quietism, the  complementary idea of rebirth is the mainspring of this school. In  Germany, Boehme&#8217;s works had been collected and published by an  obscure mystic,   <b>John Gichtel</b>    (1638-1710); whose life and letters constantly betray his influence.  In England, where that influence had been a living force from the  middle of the seventeenth century, when Boehme&#8217;s writings first  became known, the Anglo-German   <b>Dionysius Andreas Freher</b>    was writing between 1699 and 1720. In the early years of the  eighteenth century, Freher was followed by   <b>William Law</b>    (1686-1761), the Nonjuror: a brilliant stylist, and one of the most  profound of English religious writers. <a name="page_473"><font size="1" color="green">p. 473</font></A> <A NAME="an_v-Page_473"></A> Law, who was  converted by the reading of Boehme&#8217;s works from the narrow  Christianity to which he gave classic expression in the &#8220;Serious  Call&#8221; to a wide and philosophic mysticism, gave, in a series of  writings which burn with mystic passion, a new interpretation and an  abiding place in English literature to the &#8220;inspired  shoemaker&#8217;s&#8221; mighty vision of Man and the Universe.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_v-p53"></A>The latter part of a century which clearly represents  the steep downward trend of the mystic curve gives us three strange  personalities; all of whom have passed through Boehme&#8217;s school,  and have placed themselves in opposition to the ecclesiasticism of  their day. In Germany,   <b>Eckartshausen</b>    (1752-1803), in &#8220;The Cloud upon the Sanctuary&#8221; and other  works, continued upon individual lines that tradition of esoteric and  mystical Christianity, and of rebirth as the price of man&#8217;s  entrance into Reality, which found its best and sanest interpreter in  William Law. In France the troubled spirit of the transcendentalist   <b>Saint-Martin</b>    (1743-1803), the &#8220;Unknown Philosopher,&#8221; was deeply  affected in his passage from a merely occult to a mystical philosophy  by the reading of Boehme and Eckartshausen, and also by the works of  the English &#8220;Philadelphians,&#8221; Dr. Pordage and Jane Lead,  who had long sunk to oblivion in their native land. In England,   <b>William Blake</b>   , poet, painter, visionary, and prophet (1757-1827), shines like a  solitary star in the uncongenial atmosphere of the Georgian age.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_v-p54"></A>The career of Blake provides us with a rare instance  of mystical genius, forcing not only rhythm and words, but also colour  and form to express its vision of truth. So individual in his case was  this vision, so strange the elements from which his symbolic  reconstructions were built up, that he failed in the attempt to convey  it to other men. Neither in his prophetic books nor in his beautiful  mystical paintings does he contrive to transmit more than great and  stimulating suggestions of &#8220;things seen&#8221; in some higher  and more valid state of consciousness. Whilst his visionary symbolism  derives to a large extent from Swedenborg, whose works were the great  influence of his youth, Blake has learned much from Boehme, and  probably from his English interpreters. Almost alone amongst English  Protestant mystics, he has also received and assimilated the Catholic  tradition of the personal and inward communion of love. In his great  vision of &#8220;Jerusalem,&#8221; St. Teresa and Madame Guyon are  amongst the &#8220;gentle souls&#8221; whom he sees guarding that  Four-fold Gate which opens towards Beulah&#8212;the gate of the  contemplative life&#8212;and guiding the great &#8220;Wine-press of  Love&#8221; whence mankind, at the hands of its mystics, has received,  in every age, the Wine of Life.</p>
