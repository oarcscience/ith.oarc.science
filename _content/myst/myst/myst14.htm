<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p1"></A>Here<A NAME="an_iv.iii-p1.1"></A>, then, stands the newly awakened self: aware, for the first time, of  reality, responding to that reality by deep movements of love and of  awe. She sees herself, however, not merely to be thrust into a new  world, but set at the beginning of a new road. Activity is now to be  her watchword, pilgrimage the business of her life. &#8220;That a  quest there is, and an end, is the single secret spoken.&#8221; Under  one symbol or another, the need of that long slow process of  transcendence, of character building, whereby she is to attain  freedom, become capable of living upon high levels of reality, is  present in her consciousness. Those in whom this growth is not set  going are no mystics, in the exact sense in which that word is here  used; however great their temporary illumination may have been.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p2"></A>What must be the first step of the self upon this road  to perfect union with the Absolute? Clearly, a getting rid of all  those elements of normal experience which are not in harmony with  reality: of illusion, evil, imperfection of every kind. By false  desires and false thoughts man has built up for himself a false  universe: as a mollusk by the deliberate and persistent absorption of  lime and rejection of all else, can build up for itself a hard shell  which shuts it from the external world, and only represents in <a name="page_199"><font size="1" color="green">p. 199</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iii-Page_199"></A> a distorted and unrecognisable form the ocean  from which it was obtained. This hard and wholly unnutritious shell,  this one-sided secretion of the surface-consciousness, makes as it  were a little cave of illusion for each separate soul. A literal and  deliberate getting out of the cave must be for every mystic, as it was  for Plato&#8217;s prisoners, the first step in the individual hunt for  reality.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p3"></A>In the plain language of old-fashioned theology  &#8220;man&#8217;s sin is stamped upon man&#8217;s universe.&#8221; We  see a sham world because we live a sham life. We do not know  ourselves; hence do not know the true character of our senses and  instincts; hence attribute wrong values to their suggestions and  declarations concerning our relation to the external world. That  world, which we have distorted by identifying it with our own  self-regarding arrangements of its elements, has got to reassume for  us the character of Reality, of God. In the purified sight of the  great mystics it did reassume this character: their shells were opened  wide, they knew the tides of the Eternal Sea. This lucid apprehension  of the True is what we mean when we speak of the Illumination which  results from a faithful acceptance of the trials of the Purgative  Way.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p4"></A>That which we call the &#8220;natural&#8221; self as  it exists in the &#8220;natural&#8221; world&#8212;the &#8220;old  Adam&#8221; of St. Paul&#8212;is wholly incapable of supersensual  adventure. All its activities are grouped about a centre of  consciousness whose correspondences are with the material world. In  the moment of its awakening, it is abruptly made aware of this  disability. It knows itself finite. It now aspires to the infinite. It  is encased in the hard crust of individuality: it aspires to union  with a larger self. It is fettered: it longs for freedom. Its every  sense is attuned to illusion: it craves for harmony with the Absolute  Truth. &#8220;God is the only Reality,&#8221; says Patmore, &#8220;and  we are real only as far as we are in His order and He is in us.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_391"></A><A HREF="#fn_391"><FONT SIZE="1">392</FONT></A>
    Whatever form, then, the mystical adventure may take it, must begin  with a change in the attitude of the subject; a change which will  introduce it into the order of Reality, and enable it to set up  permanent relations with an Object which is not normally part of its  universe. Therefore, though the end of mysticism is not adequately  defined as goodness, it entails the acquirement of goodness. The  virtues are the &#8220;ornaments of the spiritual marriage&#8221;  because that marriage is union with the Good no less than with the  Beautiful and the True.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p6"></A>Primarily, then, the self must be purged of all that  stands between it and goodness: putting on the character of reality  instead of the character of illusion or &#8220;sin.&#8221; It longs  ardently to do this from the first moment in which it sees itself in  the all-revealing radiance of the Uncreated Light. &#8220;When love  <a name="page_200"><font size="1" color="green">p. 200</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iii-Page_200"></A> openeth the inner eyes of the soul for  to see this truth,&#8221; says Hilton, &#8220;with other circumstances  that come withal then beginneth the soul for sooth to be vastly meek.  For then by the sight of God it feeleth and seeth itself as it is, and  then doth the soul forsake the beholding and leaning to itself.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_392"></A><A HREF="#fn_392"><FONT SIZE="1">393</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p8"></A>So, with Dante, the first terrace of the Mount of  Purgatory is devoted to the cleansing of pride and the production of  humility: the inevitable&#8212;one might almost say  mechanical&#8212;result of a vision, however fleeting, of Reality, and  an undistorted sight of the earthbound self. All its life that self  has been measuring its candlelight by other candles. Now for the first  time it is out in the open air and sees the sun. &#8220;This is the  way,&#8221; said the voice of God to St. Catherine of Siena in  ecstasy. &#8220;If thou wilt arrive at a perfect knowledge and  enjoyment of Me, the Eternal Truth, thou shouldst never go outside the  knowledge of thyself; and by humbling thyself in the valley of  humility thou wilt know Me and thyself, from which knowledge thou wilt  draw all that is necessary. . . . In self knowledge, then, thou wilt  humble thyself; seeing that, in thyself, thou dost not even  exist.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_393"></A><A HREF="#fn_393"><FONT SIZE="1">394</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p10"></A>The first thing that the self observes, when it turns  back upon itself in that awful moment of lucidity&#8212;enters, as St.  Catherine says, into &#8220;the cell of  self-knowledge,&#8221;&#8212;is the horrible contrast between its  clouded contours and the pure sharp radiance of the Real; between its  muddled faulty life, its perverse self-centred drifting, and the clear  onward sweep of that Becoming in which it is immersed. It is then that  the outlook of rapture and awe receives the countersign of repentance.  The harbinger of that new self which must be born appears under the  aspect of a desire: a passionate longing to escape from the suddenly  perceived hatefulness of selfhood, and to conform to Reality, the  Perfect which it has seen under its aspect of Goodness, of Beauty, or  of Love&#8212;to be worthy of it, in fact to be   <i>real.</i>    &#8220;This showing,&#8221; says Gerlac Petersen of that experience,  &#8220;is so vehement and so strong that the whole of the interior  man, not only of his heart but of his body, is marvellously moved and  shaken, and faints within itself, unable to endure it. And by this  means, his interior aspect is made clear without any cloud, and  conformable in its own measure to Him whom he seeks.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_394"></A><A HREF="#fn_394"><FONT SIZE="1">395</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p12"></A>The lives of the mystics abound in instances of the  &#8220;vehemence of this showing&#8221;: of the deep-seated sense of  necessity which urges the newly awakened self to a life of discomfort  and conflict, often to intense poverty and pain, as the only way of  replacing false experience by true. Here the transcendental  consciousness, exalted <a name="page_201"><font size="1" color="green">p. 201</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iii-Page_201"></A> by a clear  intuition of its goal, and not merely &#8220;counting&#8221; but   <i>perceiving</i>    the world to be obviously well lost for such a prize, takes the  reins. It forces on the unwilling surface mind a sharp vision of its  own disabilities, its ugly and imperfect life; and the thirst for  Perfection which is closely bound up with the mystic temperament makes  instant response. &#8220;No more sins!&#8221; was the first cry of St.  Catherine of Genoa in that crucial hour in which she saw by the light  of love her own self-centred and distorted past. She entered forthwith  upon the Purgative Way, in which for four years she suffered under a  profound sense of imperfection, endured fasting, solitude and  mortification; and imposed upon herself the most repulsive duties in  her efforts towards that self-conquest which should make her  &#8220;conformable in her own measure&#8221; to the dictates of that  Pure Love which was the aspect of reality that she had seen. It is the  inner conviction that this conformity&#8212;this transcendence of the  unreal&#8212;is possible and indeed normal which upholds the mystic  during the terrible years of Purgation: so that &#8220;not only  without heaviness, but with a joy unmeasured he casts back all thing  that may him let.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_395"></A><A HREF="#fn_395"><FONT SIZE="1">396</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p14"></A>To the true lover of the Absolute, Purgation no less  than Illumination is a privilege, a dreadful joy. It is an earnest of  increasing life. &#8220;Let me suffer or die!&#8221; said St. Teresa:  a strange alternative in the ears of common sense, but a forced option  in the spiritual sphere. However harsh its form, however painful the  activities to which it spurs him, the mystic recognizes in this  breakup of his old universe an essential part of the Great Work: and  the act in which he turns to it is an act of loving desire, no less  than an act of will. &#8220;Burning of love into a soul truly taken  all vices purgeth: . . . for whilst the true lover with strong and  fervent desire into God is borne, all things him displease that from  the sight of God withdrawn.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_396"></A><A HREF="#fn_396"><FONT SIZE="1">397</FONT></A>
    His eyes once opened, he is eager for that costly ordering of his  disordered loves which alone can establish his correspondences with  Transcendental Life. &#8220;Teach me, my only joy,&#8221; cries Suso,  &#8220;the way in which I may bear upon my body the marks of Thy  Love.&#8221; &#8220;Come, my soul, depart from outward things and  gather thyself together into a true interior silence, that thou mayst  set out with all thy courage and bury and lose thyself in the desert  of a deep contrition.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_397"></A><A HREF="#fn_397"><FONT SIZE="1">398</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p17"></A>It is in this torment of contrition, this acute  consciousness of unworthiness, that we have the first swing back of  the oscillating self from the initial state of mystic pleasure to the  complementary state of pain. It is, so to speak, on its transcendental  side, the reflex <a name="page_202"><font size="1" color="green">p. 202</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iii-Page_202"></A> action which follows  the first touch of God. Thus, we read that Rulman Merswin,  &#8220;swept away by the transports of Divine Love,&#8221; did not  surrender himself to the passive enjoyment of this first taste of  Absolute Being, but was impelled by it to diligent and instant  self-criticism. He was &#8220;seized with a hatred of his body, and  inflicted on himself such hard mortifications that he fell ill.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_398"></A><A HREF="#fn_398"><FONT SIZE="1">399</FONT></A>
    It is useless for lovers of healthy-mindedness to resent this and  similar examples of self-examination and penance: to label them morbid  or mediaeval. The fact remains that only such bitter knowledge of  wrongness of relation, seen by the light of ardent love, can spur the  will of man to the hard task of readjustment.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p19"></A>&#8220;I saw full surely,&#8221; says Julian of  Norwich, &#8220;that it behoveth needs to be that we should be in  longing and in penance, until the time that we be led so deep into God  that we verily and truly know our own soul.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_399"></A><A HREF="#fn_399"><FONT SIZE="1">400</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p21"></A>Dante&#8217;s whole journey up the Mount of Purgation  is the dramatic presentation of this one truth. So, too, the  celebrated description of Purgatory attributed to St. Catherine of  Genoa  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_400"></A><A HREF="#fn_400"><FONT SIZE="1">401</FONT></A>
    is obviously founded upon its author&#8217;s inward experience of  this Purgative Way. In it, she applies to the souls of the dead her  personal consciousness of the necessity of purification; its place in  the organic process of spiritual growth. It is, as she acknowledges at  the beginning, the projection of her own psychological adventures upon  the background of the spiritual world: its substance being simply the  repetition after death of that eager and heroic acceptance of  suffering, those drastic acts of purification, which she has herself  been compelled to undertake under the whip of the same psychic  necessity&#8212;that of removing the rust of illusion, cleansing the  mirror in order that it may receive the divine light. &#8220;It  is,&#8221; she says, &#8220;as with a covered object, the object  cannot respond to the rays of the sun, not because the sun ceases to  shine&#8212;for it shines without intermission&#8212;but because the  covering intervenes. Let the covering be destroyed, and again the  object will be exposed to the sun, and will answer to the rays which  beat against it in proportion as the work of destruction advances.  Thus the souls are covered by a rust&#8212;that is, by sin&#8212;which  is gradually consumed away by the fire of purgatory. The more it is  consumed, the more they respond to God their true Sun. Their happiness  increases as the rust falls off and lays them open to the divine ray .  . . the instinctive tendency to seek happiness in <a name="page_203"><font size="1" color="green">p. 203</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iii-Page_203"></A> God develops itself, and goes on increasing  through the fire of love which draws it to its end with such  impetuosity and vehemence that any obstacle seems intolerable; and the  more clear its vision, the more extreme its pain.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_401"></A><A HREF="#fn_401"><FONT SIZE="1">402</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p24"></A><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p24.1"></A>&#8220;Mostratene la via di  gire al monte!&#8221;  cry the souls of the newly-dead  in Dante&#8217;s vision,  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_402"></A><A HREF="#fn_402"><FONT SIZE="1">403</FONT></A>
    pushed by that &#8220;instinctive tendency&#8221; towards the  purifying flames. Such a tendency, such a passionate desire, the  aspiring self must have. No cool, well-balanced knowledge of the need  of new adjustments will avail to set it on the Purgative Way. This is  a heroic act, and demands heroic passions in the soul.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p26"></A>&#8220;In order to overcome our desires,&#8221; says  St. John of the Cross, who is the classic authority upon this portion  of the mystic quest, &#8220;and to renounce all those things, our love  and inclination for which are wont so to inflame the will that it  delights therein, we require a more ardent fire and a nobler  love&#8212;that of the Bridegroom. Finding her delight and strength in  Him, the soul gains the vigour and confidence which enable her easily  to abandon all other affections. It was necessary, in her struggle  with the attractive force of her sensual desires, not only to have  this love for the Bridegroom, but also to be filled with a burning  fervour, full of anguish . . . if our spiritual nature were not on  fire with other and nobler passions we should never cast off the yoke  of the senses, nor be able to enter on their night, neither should we  have the courage to remain in the darkness of all things, and in  denial of every desire.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_403"></A><A HREF="#fn_403"><FONT SIZE="1">404</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p28"></A>&#8220;We must be filled with a burning fervour full  of anguish.&#8221; Only this deep and ardent passion for a perceived  Object of Love can persuade the mystic to those unnatural acts of  abnegation by which he kills his lesser love of the world of sense,  frees himself from the &#8220;remora of desire,&#8221; unifies all his  energies about the new and higher centre of his life. His business, I  have said, is transcendence: a mounting up, an attainment of a higher  order of reality. Once his eyes have been opened on Eternity, his  instinct for the Absolute roused from its sleep, he sees union with  that Reality as his duty no less than his joy: sees too, that this  union can only be consummated on a plane where illusion and selfhood  have no place.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p29"></A>The inward voice says to him perpetually, at the least  seasonable moments, <A NAME="an_iv.iii-p29.1"></A>&#8220;Dimitte omnia  transitoria, quaere aeterna.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_404"></A><A HREF="#fn_404"><FONT SIZE="1">405</FONT></A>
    Hence the purgation of the senses, and of the character which they  have helped to build is always placed first in order in the Mystic  Way; though sporadic flashes of illumination and ecstasy may, and  often <a name="page_204"><font size="1" color="green">p. 204</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iii-Page_204"></A> do, precede and accompany it.  Since spiritual no less than physical existence, as we know it, is an  endless Becoming, it too has no end. In a sense the whole of the  mystical experience in this life consists in a series of  purifications, whereby the Finite slowly approaches the nature of its  Infinite Source: climbing up the cleansing mountain pool by pool, like  the industrious fish in Rulman Merswin&#8217;s vision, until it  reaches its Origin. The greatest of the contemplative saints, far from  leaving purgation behind them in their progress, were increasingly  aware of their own inadequateness, the nearer they approached to the  unitive state: for the true lover of the Absolute, like every other  lover, is alternately abased and exalted by his unworthiness and his  good fortune. There are moments of high rapture when he knows only  that the banner over him is Love: but there are others in which he  remains bitterly conscious that in spite of his uttermost surrender  there is within him an ineradicable residuum of selfhood, which  &#8220;stains the white radiance of eternity.&#8221;</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p31"></A>In this sense, then, purification is a perpetual  process. That which mystical writers mean, however, when they speak of  the Way of Purgation, is rather the slow and painful completion of  Conversion. It is the drastic turning of the self from the unreal to  the real life: a setting of her house in order, an orientation of the  mind to Truth. Its business is the getting rid, first of self-love;  and secondly of all those foolish interests in which the  surface-consciousness is steeped.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p32"></A>&#8220;The essence of purgation,&#8221; says Richard  of St. Victor, &#8220;is self-simplification.&#8221; Nothing can  happen until this has proceeded a certain distance: till the involved  interests and tangled motives of the self are simplified, and the  false complications of temporal life are recognized and cast away.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p33"></A>&#8220;No one,&#8221; says another authority in this  matter, &#8220;can be enlightened unless he be first cleansed or  purified and stripped.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_405"></A><A HREF="#fn_405"><FONT SIZE="1">406</FONT></A>
    Purgation, which is the remaking of character in conformity with  perceived reality, consists in these two essential acts: the cleansing  of that which is to remain, the stripping of that which is to be done  away. It may best be studied, therefore, in two parts: and I think  that it will be in the reader&#8217;s interest if we reverse the order  which the &#8220;Theologia Germanica&#8221; adopts, and first consider  Negative Purification, or self-stripping, and next Positive  Purification, or character-adjustment. These, then, are the branches  into which this subject will here be split. (1) The Negative aspect,  the stripping or purging away of those superfluous, unreal, and  harmful things which dissipate the precious energies of the self. This  is the business of Poverty, or   <i>Detachment</i>   . (2) The Positive aspect: <a name="page_205"><font size="1" color="green">p. 205</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iii-Page_205"></A> a raising to  their highest term, their purest state, of all that remains&#8212;the  permanent elements of character. This is brought about by   <i>Mortification,</i>    the gymnastic of the soul: a deliberate recourse to painful  experiences and difficult tasks.</p>   <h4 align="center"><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p34.1"></A>I. Detachment</h4>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p35"></A>Apart from the plain necessity of casting out  imperfection and sin, what is the type of &#8220;good character&#8221;  which will best serve the self in its journey towards union with the  Absolute?</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p36"></A>The mystics of all ages and all faiths agree in their  answer. Those three virtues which the instinct of the Catholic Church  fixed upon as the necessities of the cloistered life&#8212;the great  Evangelical counsel of voluntary Poverty with its departments,  Chastity, the poverty of the senses, and Obedience, the poverty of the  will&#8212;are also, when raised to their highest term and transmuted  by the Fire of Love, the essential virtues of the mystical quest.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p37"></A>By   <i>Poverty</i>    the mystic means an utter self-stripping, the casting off of  immaterial as well as material wealth, a complete detachment from all  finite things. By   <i>Chastity</i>    he means an extreme and limpid purity of soul, cleansed from personal  desire and virgin to all but God: by   <i>Obedience,</i>    that abnegation of selfhood, that mortification of the will, which  results in a complete self-abandonment, a &#8220;holy  indifference&#8221; to the accidents of life. These three aspects of  perfection are really one: linked together as irrevocably as the three  aspects of the self. Their common characteristic is this: they tend to  make the subject regard itself, not as an isolated and interesting  individual, possessing desires and rights, but as a scrap of the  Cosmos, an ordinary bit of the Universal Life, only important as a  part of the All, an expression of the Will Divine. Detachment and  purity go hand in hand, for purity is but detachment of the heart; and  where these are present they bring with them that humble spirit of  obedience which expresses detachment of will. We may therefore treat  them as three manifestations of one thing: which thing is Inward  Poverty. &#8220;Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the  Kingdom of Heaven,&#8221; is the motto of all pilgrims on this  road.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p38"></A>&#8220;God is pure Good in Himself,&#8221; says  Eckhart, &#8220;therefore will He dwell nowhere but in a pure soul.  There He can pour Himself out: into that He can wholly flow. What is  Purity? It is that a man should have turned himself away from all  creatures and have set his heart so entirely on the Pure Good that no  creature is to him a comfort, that he has no desire for aught  creaturely, save so far as he may apprehend therein the Pure Good,  which is God. And as little as the bright eye can endure aught foreign  in it, so <a name="page_206"><font size="1" color="green">p. 206</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iii-Page_206"></A> little can the pure soul bear  anything in it, any stain on it, that comes between it and God. To it  all creatures are pure to enjoy; for it enjoyeth all creatures in God,  and God in all creatures.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_406"></A><A HREF="#fn_406"><FONT SIZE="1">407</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p40"></A>&#8220;To it all creatures are pure to enjoy!&#8221;  This is hardly the popular concept of the mystic; which credits him,  in the teeth of such examples as St. Francis, St. Mechthild of  Magdeburg, Rolle, Suso, and countless others, with a hearty dread of  natural things. Too many examples of an exaggerated  asceticism&#8212;such as the unfortunate story told of the holy  Cur&eacute; d&#8217;Ars, who refused to smell a rose for fear of  sin&#8212;have supported in this respect the vulgar belief; for it is  generally forgotten that though most mystics have practised asceticism  as a means to an end, all ascetics are not mystics. Whatever may be  the case with other deniers of the senses, it is true that the soul of  the great mystic, dwelling on high levels of reality, his eyes set on  the Transcendental World, is capable of combining with the perfection  of detachment that intense and innocent joy in natural things, as  veils and vessels of the divine, which results from seeing &#8220;all  creatures in God and God in all creatures.&#8221; &#8220;Whoso knows  and loves the nobleness of My Freedom,&#8221; said the voice of God to  Mechthild of Magdeburg, &#8220;cannot bear to love Me alone, he must  love also Me in the creatures.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_407"></A><A HREF="#fn_407"><FONT SIZE="1">408</FONT></A>
    That all-embracing love is characteristic of the illumination which  results from a faithful endurance of the Purgative Way; for the  corollary of &#8220;blessed are the pure in heart&#8221; is not merely  a poetic statement. The annals of mysticism prove it to be a  psychological law.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p42"></A>How then is this contradiction to be resolved: that  the mystic who has declared the fundamental necessity of  &#8220;leaving all creatures&#8221; yet finds them pure to enjoy? The  answer to the riddle lies in the ancient paradox of Poverty: that we  only enjoy true liberty in respect of such things as we neither  possess nor desire. &#8220;That thou mayest have pleasure in  everything, seek pleasure in nothing. That thou mayest know  everything, seek to know nothing. That thou mayest possess all things,  seek to possess nothing. . . . In detachment the spirit finds quiet  and repose, for coveting nothing, nothing wearies it by elation, and  nothing oppresses it by dejection, because it stands in the centre of  its own humility. For as soon as it covets anything, it is immediately  fatigued thereby.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_408"></A><A HREF="#fn_408"><FONT SIZE="1">409</FONT></A>

<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p44"></A>It is not love but lust&#8212;the possessive case, the  very food of selfhood&#8212;which poisons the relation between the  self and the external world and &#8220;immediately fatigues&#8221; the  soul.

We are the slaves  of our own property. We drag with us not a treasure, but a chain.  &#8220;Behold,&#8221; says the &#8220;Theologia Germanica,&#8221;  &#8220;on this sort must we cast all things from us and strip  ourselves of them: we must refrain from claiming anything for our own.  When we do this, we shall have the best, fullest, clearest, and  noblest knowledge that a man can have, and also the noblest and purest  love and desire.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_409"></A><A HREF="#fn_409"><FONT SIZE="1">410</FONT></A>
    &#8220;Some there are,&#8221; says Plotinus, &#8220;that for all  their effort have not attained the Vision. . . . They have received  the authentic Light, all their soul has gleamed as they have drawn  near, but they come with a load on their shoulders which holds them  back from the place of Vision. They have not ascended in the pure  integrity of their being, but are burdened with that which keeps them  apart. They are not yet made one within.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_410"></A><A HREF="#fn_410"><FONT SIZE="1">411</FONT></A>
    Accept Poverty, however, demolish ownership, the verb &#8220;to  have&#8221; in every mood and tense, and this downward drag is at an  end. At once the Cosmos belongs to you, and you to it. You escape the  heresy of separateness, are &#8220;made one,&#8221; and merged in  &#8220;the greater life of the All.&#8221; Then, a free spirit in a  free world, the self moves upon its true orbit; undistracted by the  largely self-imposed needs and demands of ordinary earthly  existence.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p47"></A>This was the truth which St. Francis of Assisi  grasped, and applied with the energy of a reformer and the delicate  originality of a poet to every circumstance of the inner and the outer  life. This noble liberty it is which is extolled by his spiritual  descendant, Jacopone da Todi, in one of his most magnificent  odes:&#8212;</p>   <blockquote><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p47.1"></A> &#8220;Povert&aacute;, alto  sapere,<br>   a nulla cosa sojacere,<br>   en desprezo possedere<br>   tutte le cose create. . . .<br>   Dio non alberga en core stretto,<br>   tant&#8217;&eacute; grande quant&#8217; hai  affetto,<br>   povertate ha si gran petto<br>   che ci alberga deitate. . . .<br>   Povertate &egrave; nulla avere<br>   e nulla cosa poi volere;<br>   ad omne cosa possedere<br>   en spirito de libertate.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_411"></A><A HREF="#fn_411"><FONT SIZE="1">412</FONT></A>
  <br>  </blockquote>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p51"></A><a name="page_208"><font size="1" color="green">p. 208</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iii-Page_208"></A> &#8220;My little  sisters the birds,&#8221; said St. Francis, greatest adept of that  high wisdom, &#8220;Brother Sun, Sister Water, Mother Earth.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_412"></A><A HREF="#fn_412"><FONT SIZE="1">413</FONT></A>
    Not my servants, but my kindred and fellow-citizens; who may safely  be loved so long as they are not desired. So, in almost identical  terms, the dying Hindu ascetic:&#8212;</p>   <blockquote><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p52.1"></A> &#8220;Oh Mother Earth, Father Sky,<br>   Brother Wind, Friend Light, Sweetheart Water,<br>   Here take my last salutation with folded hands!<br>   For to-day I am melting away into the Supreme<br>   Because my heart became pure,<br>   And all delusion vanished,<br>   Through the power of your good company.&#8221;<br>  </blockquote>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p53"></A>It is the business of Lady Poverty to confer on her  lovers this freedom of the Universe, to eradicate delusion, cut out  the spreading growth of claimfulness, purify the heart, and initiate  them into the &#8220;great life of the All.&#8221; Well might St.  Francis desire marriage with that enchantress, who gives back ten-fold  all that she takes away. &#8220;Holy poverty,&#8221; he said,  &#8220;is a treasure so high excelling and so divine that we be not  worthy to lay it up in our vile vessels; since this is that celestial  virtue whereby all earthly things and fleeting are trodden underfoot,  and whereby all hindrances are lifted from the soul, so that freely  she may join herself to God Eternal.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_413"></A><A HREF="#fn_413"><FONT SIZE="1">414</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p55"></A>Poverty, then, prepares man&#8217;s spirit for that  union with God to which it aspires. She strips off the clothing which  he so often mistakes for himself, transvaluates all his values, and  shows him things as they are. &#8220;There are,&#8221; says Eckhart,  &#8220;four ascending degrees of such spiritual poverty. 1. The  soul&#8217;s contempt of all things that are not God. 2. Contempt of  herself and her own works. 3. Utter self-abandonment. 4. Self-loss in  the incomprehensible Being of God.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_414"></A><A HREF="#fn_414"><FONT SIZE="1">415</FONT></A>
    So, in the &#8220;Sacrum Commercium,&#8221; when the friars, climbing  &#8220;the steeps of the hill,&#8221; found Lady Poverty at the summit  &#8220;enthroned only in her nakedness,&#8221; she &#8220;preventing  them with the blessings of sweetness,&#8221; said, &#8220;Why hasten  ye so from the vale of tears to the mount of light? If, peradventure,  it is me that ye seek, lo, I am but as you behold, a little poor one,  stricken with storms and far from any consolation.&#8221; Whereto the  brothers answer, &#8220;  <i>Only admit us to thy peace; and we shall be saved</i>   .&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_415"></A><A HREF="#fn_415"><FONT SIZE="1">416</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p58"></A>The same truth: the saving peace of utter detachment  from everything but Divine Reality&#8212;a detachment which makes  those <a name="page_209"><font size="1" color="green">p. 209</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iii-Page_209"></A> who have it the citizens of the  world, and enabled the friars to say to Lady Poverty as they showed  her from the hill of Assisi the whole countryside at her feet,  <A NAME="an_iv.iii-p58.1"></A>&#8220;Hoc est claustrum nostrum,  Domina,&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_416"></A><A HREF="#fn_416"><FONT SIZE="1">417</FONT></A>
   &#8212;is taught by Meister Eckhart in a more homely parable.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p60"></A>&#8220;There was a learned man who, eight years long,  desired that God would show him a man who would teach him the truth.  And once when he felt a very great longing, a voice from God came to  him and said, &#8216;Go to the church, and there shalt thou find a man  who shalt show thee the way to blessedness.&#8217; And he went thence  and found a poor man whose feet were torn and covered with dust and  dirt: and all his clothes were hardly worth three farthings. And he  greeted him, saying:&#8212;</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p61"></A>&#8220;&#8216;God give you good day!&#8217;</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p62"></A>&#8220;He answered: &#8216;I have never had a bad  day.&#8217;</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p63"></A>&#8220;&#8216;God give you good luck.&#8217;</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p64"></A>&#8220;&#8216;I have never had ill luck.&#8217;</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p65"></A>&#8220;&#8216;May you be happy! but why do you answer  me thus?&#8217;</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p66"></A>&#8220;&#8216;I have never been unhappy.&#8217;</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p67"></A>&#8220;&#8216;Pray explain this to me, for I cannot  understand it.&#8217;</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p68"></A>&#8220;The poor man answered, &#8216;Willingly. You  wished me good day. I never had a bad day; for if I am hungry I praise  God; if it freezes, hails, snows, rains, if the weather is fair or  foul, still I praise God; am I wretched and despised, I praise God,  and so I have never had an evil day. You wished that God would send me  luck. But I never had ill luck, for I know how to live with God, and I  know that what He does is best; and what God gives me or ordains for  me, be it good or ill, I take it cheerfully from God as the best that  can be, and so I have never had ill luck. You wished that God would  make me happy. I was never unhappy; for my only desire is to live in  God&#8217;s will, and I have so entirely yielded my will to  God&#8217;s, that what God wills, I will.&#8217;</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p69"></A>&#8220;&#8216;But if God should will to cast you into  hell,&#8217; said the learned man, &#8216;what would you do  then?&#8217;</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p70"></A>&#8220;&#8216;Cast me into hell? His goodness forbids!  But if He did cast me into hell, I should have two arms to embrace  Him. One arm is true humility, that I should lay beneath Him, and be  thereby united to His holy humanity. And with the right arm of love,  which is united with His holy divinity, I should so embrace Him that  He would have to go to hell with me. And I would rather be in hell and  have God, then in heaven and not have God.&#8217;</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p71"></A>&#8220;Then the Master understood that true  abandonment with utter humility is the nearest way to God.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p72"></A>&#8220;The Master asked further: &#8216;Whence are you  come?&#8217; <a name="page_210"><font size="1" color="green">p. 210</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iii-Page_210"></A></p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p73"></A>&#8220;&#8216;From God.&#8217;</p>

<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p75"></A>&#8220;&#8216;When I forsook all creatures.&#8217;</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p76"></A>&#8220;&#8216;Where have you left God?&#8217;</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p77"></A>&#8220;&#8216;In pure hearts, and in men of good  will.&#8217;</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p78"></A>&#8220;The Master asked: &#8216;What sort of man are  you?&#8217;</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p79"></A>&#8220;&#8216;I am a king.&#8217;</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p80"></A>&#8220;&#8216;Where is your kingdom?&#8217;</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p81"></A>&#8220;&#8216;My soul is my kingdom, for I can so rule  my senses inward and outward, that all the desires and power of my  soul are in subjection, and this kingdom is greater than a kingdom on  earth.&#8217;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_417"></A><A HREF="#fn_417"><FONT SIZE="1">418</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p83"></A>&#8220;&#8216;What brought you to this  perfection?&#8217;</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p84"></A>&#8220;&#8216;My silence, my high thoughts, and my  union with God. For I could not rest in anything that was less than  God. Now I have found God; and in God have eternal rest and  peace.&#8217;&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_418"></A><A HREF="#fn_418"><FONT SIZE="1">419</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p86"></A>Poverty, then, consists in a breaking down of  man&#8217;s inveterate habit of trying to rest in, or take seriously,  things which are &#8220;less than God&#8221;:   <i>i.e.</i>   , which do not possess the character of reality. Such a habit is the  most fertile of all causes of &#8220;world-weariness,&#8221;  disillusion and unrest: faults, or rather spiritual diseases, which  the mystics never exhibit, but which few who are without all mystic  feeling can hope to escape. Hence the sharpened perceptions of the  contemplatives have always seen poverty as a counsel of prudence, a  higher form of common sense. It was not with St. Francis, or any other  great mystic, a first principle, an end in itself. It was rather a  logical deduction from the first principle of their science&#8212;the  paramount importance to the soul of an undistracted vision of  reality.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p87"></A>Here East and West are in agreement: &#8220;Their  science,&#8221; says Al Ghazzali of the Sufis, who practised, like the  early Franciscans, a complete renunciation of worldly goods,  &#8220;has for its object the uprooting from the soul of all violent  passions, the extirpation from it of vicious desires and evil  qualities; so that the heart may become detached from all that is not  God, and give itself for its only occupation meditation upon the  Divine Being.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_419"></A><A HREF="#fn_419"><FONT SIZE="1">420</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p89"></A>All those who have felt themselves urged towards the  attainment of this transcendental vision, have found that possessions  interrupt the view; that claims, desires, attachments become centres  of conflicting interest in the mind. They assume a false air of  importance, force themselves upon the attention, and complicate <a name="page_211"><font size="1" color="green">p. 211</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iii-Page_211"></A> life. Hence, in the interest of  self-simplification, they must be cleared away: a removal which  involves for the real enthusiast little more sacrifice than the weekly  visit of the dustman. &#8220;Having entirely surrendered my own  free-will,&#8221; says Al Ghazzali of his personal experience,&#8221;  my heart no longer felt any distress in renouncing fame, wealth, or  the society of my children.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_420"></A><A HREF="#fn_420"><FONT SIZE="1">421</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p91"></A>Others have reconciled self-surrender with a more  moderate abandonment of outward things; for possessions take different  rank for almost every human soul. The true rule of poverty consists in  giving up those things which enchain the spirit, divide its interests,  and deflect it on its road to God&#8212;whether these things be  riches, habits, religious observances, friends, interests, distastes,  or desires&#8212;not in mere outward destitution for its own sake. It  is attitude, not act, that matters; self-denudation would be  unnecessary were it not for our inveterate tendency to attribute false  value to things the moment they become our own. &#8220;What is poverty  of spirit but meekness of mind, by which a man knows his own  infirmity?&#8221; says Rolle, &#8220;seeing that to perfect stableness  he may not come but by the grace of God, all thing that him might let  from that grace he forsakes, and only in joy of his Maker he sets his  desire. And as of one root spring many branches, so of wilful poverty  on this wise taken proceed virtues and marvels untrowed. Not as some,  that change their clothes and not their souls; riches soothly it seems  these forsake, and vices innumerable they cease not to gather. . . .  If thou truly all thing for God forsake,   <i>see more what thou despised than what thou forsaketh.</i>   &#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_421"></A><A HREF="#fn_421"><FONT SIZE="1">422</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p93"></A>The Poverty of the mystics, then, is a mental rather  than a material state. Detachment of the will from all desire of  possessions is the inner reality, of which Franciscan poverty is a  sacrament to the world. It is the poor in spirit, not the poor in  substance, who are to be spiritually blessed. &#8220;Let all things be  forsaken of me,&#8221; says Gerlac Petersen, &#8220;so that being poor  I may be able in great inward spaciousness, and without any hurt, to  suffer want of all those things which the mind of man can desire; out  of or excepting God Himself.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_422"></A><A HREF="#fn_422"><FONT SIZE="1">423</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p95"></A>&#8220;The soul,&#8221; says St. John of the Cross,  &#8220;is not empty, so long as the desire for sensible things  remains. But the absence of this desire for things produces emptiness  and liberty of soul; even when there is an abundance of  possessions.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_423"></A><A HREF="#fn_423"><FONT SIZE="1">424</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p97"></A>Every person in whom the mystical instinct awakes soon  discovers in himself certain tastes or qualities which interrupt the  <a name="page_212"><font size="1" color="green">p. 212</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iii-Page_212"></A> development of that instinct. Often  these tastes and qualities are legitimate enough upon their own plane;  but they are a drain upon the energy of the self, preventing her from  attaining that intenser life for which she was made and which demands  her undivided zest. They distract her attention, fill the field of  perception, stimulate her instinctive life: making of the  surface-consciousness so active a thing that it can hardly be put to  sleep. &#8220;Where can he have that pure and naked vision of  unchangeable Truth whereby he see into all things,&#8221; says  Petersen again, &#8220;who is so busied in other things, not perhaps  evil, which operate . . . upon his thoughts and imagination and  confuse and enchain his mind . . . that his sight of that unique One  in Whom all things are is overclouded?&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_424"></A><A HREF="#fn_424"><FONT SIZE="1">425</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p99"></A>The nature of these distracting factors which  &#8220;confuse and enchain the mind&#8221; will vary with almost every  individual. It is impossible to predict what those things will be  which a self must give up, in order that the transcendental  consciousness may grow. &#8220;It makes little difference whether a  bird be held by a slender thread or by a rope; the bird is bound, and  cannot fly until the cord that holds it is broken. It is true that a  slender thread is more easily broken; still notwithstanding, if it is  not broken the bird cannot fly. This is the state of a soul with  particular attachments: it never can attain to the liberty of the  divine union, whatever virtues it may possess. Desires and attachments  affect the soul as the remora is said to affect a ship; that is but a  little fish, yet when it clings to the vessel it effectually hinders  its progress.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_425"></A><A HREF="#fn_425"><FONT SIZE="1">426</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p101"></A>Thus each adventurer must discover and extirpate all  those interests which nourish selfhood, however innocent or even  useful these interests may seem in the eyes of the world. The only  rule is the ruthless abandonment of everything which is in the way.  &#8220;When any man God perfectly desires to love, all things as well  inward as outward that to God&#8217;s love are contrary and from His  love do let, he studies to do away.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_426"></A><A HREF="#fn_426"><FONT SIZE="1">427</FONT></A>
    This may mean the prompt and utter self-stripping of St. Francis of  Assisi, who cast off his actual clothing in his relentless  determination to have nothing of his own:  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_427"></A><A HREF="#fn_427"><FONT SIZE="1">428</FONT></A>
    the reluctant bit-by-bit renunciations which at last set his follower  Angela of Foligno free, or the drastic proceedings of Antoinette  Bourignan, who found that a penny was enough to keep her from God.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p104"></A>&#8220;Being one night in a most profound  Penitence,&#8221; says the biographer of this extraordinary woman,  &#8220;she said from the bottom <a name="page_213"><font size="1" color="green">p. 213</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iii-Page_213"></A> of her  Heart, &#8216;O my Lord! what must I do to please Thee? For I have  nobody to teach me. Speak to my soul and it will hear  Thee.&#8217;&#8221; At that instant she heard, as if another had  spoken within her &#8220;Forsake all earthly things. Separate thyself  from the love of the creatures. Deny thyself.&#8221; From this time,  the more she entered into herself the more she was inclined to abandon  all. But she had not the courage necessary for the complete  renunciation towards which her transcendental consciousness was  pressing her. She struggled to adjust herself to the inner and the  outer life, but without success. For such a character as hers,  compromise was impossible. &#8220;She asked always earnestly, When  shall I be perfectly thine, O my God? and she thought He still  answered her,   <i>When thou shalt no longer possess anything, and shalt die to  thyself.</i>    And where shall I do that, Lord? He answered,   <i>In the Desert.&#8221;</i>    At last the discord between her deeper and her superficial self  became intolerable. Reinforced by the miseries of an unsympathetic  home, still more by a threat of approaching marriage, the impulse to  renunciation got its way. She disguised herself in a hermit&#8217;s  dress&#8212;she was only eighteen, and had no one to help or advise  her&#8212;and &#8220;went out of her chamber about Four in the  Morning, taking nothing but one Penny to buy Bread for that Day and it  being said to her in the going out,   <i>Where is thy Faith? In a Penny?</i>    she threw it away. . . . Thus she went away wholly delivered from the  heavy burthen of the Cares and Good Things of this World.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_428"></A><A HREF="#fn_428"><FONT SIZE="1">429</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p106"></A>An admirable example of the mystic&#8217;s attitude  towards the soul-destroying division of interests, the natural but  hopeless human struggle to make the best of both worlds, which sucks  at its transcendental vitality, occurs in St. Teresa&#8217;s purgative  period. In her case this war between the real and the superficial self  extended over many years; running side by side with the state of  Illumination, and a fully developed contemplative life. At last it was  brought to an end by a &#8220;Second Conversion&#8221; which unified  her scattered interests and set her firmly and for ever on the Unitive  Way. The virile strength of Teresa&#8217;s character, which afterwards  contributed to the greatness of her achievement, opposed the invading  transcendental consciousness; disputed every inch of territory;  resisted every demand made upon it by the growing spiritual self. Bit  by bit it was conquered, the sphere of her deeper life enlarged; until  the moment came in which she surrendered, once for all, to her true  destiny.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_429"></A><A HREF="#fn_429"><FONT SIZE="1">430</FONT></A>
    <a name="page_214"><font size="1" color="green">p. 214</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iii-Page_214"></A></p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p108"></A>During the years of inward stress, of penance and  growing knowledge of the Infinite, which she spent in the Convent of  the Incarnation, and which accompanied this slow remaking of  character, Teresa&#8217;s only self-indulgence&#8212;as it seems, a  sufficiently innocent one&#8212;was talking to the friends who came  down from Avila to the convent-parlour, and spoke to her through the   <i>grille.</i>    Her confessors, unaccustomed to the education of mystical genius, saw  nothing incompatible between this practice and the pursuit of a high  contemplative life. But as her transcendental consciousness, her  states of orison grew stronger, Teresa felt more and more the  distracting influence of these glimpses of the outer world. They were  a drain upon the energy which ought to be wholly given to that new,  deep, more real life which she felt stirring within her, and which  could only hope to achieve its mighty destiny by complete  concentration upon the business in hand. No genius can afford to  dissipate his energies: the mystic genius least of all. Teresa knew  that so long as she retained these personal satisfactions, her life  had more than one focus; she was not whole-hearted in her surrender to  the Absolute. But though her inward voices, her deepest instincts,  urged her to give them up, for years she felt herself incapable of  such a sacrifice. It was round the question of their retention or  surrender that the decisive battle of her life was fought.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p109"></A>&#8220;The devil,&#8221; says her great Augustinian  eulogist, Fray Luis de Leon, in his vivid account of these long  interior struggles, &#8220;put before her those persons most  sympathetic by nature; and God came, and in the midst of the  conversation discovered Himself aggrieved and sorrowful. The devil  delighted in the conversation and pastime, but when she turned her  back on them and betook herself to prayer, God redoubled the delight  and favours, as if to show her how false was the lure which charmed  her at the grating, and that His sweetness was the veritable  sweetness. . . . So that these two inclinations warred with each other  in the breast of this blessed woman, and the authors who inspired them  each did his utmost to inflame her most, and the oratory blotted out  what the grating wrote, and at times the grating vanquished and  diminished the good fruit produced by prayer, causing agony and grief  which disquieted and perplexed her soul: for though she was resolved  to belong entirely to God, she knew not how to shake herself free from  the world: and at times she persuaded herself that she could enjoy  both, which ended mostly, as she says, in complete enjoyment of  neither. For the amusements of the locutorio were embittered and  turned into wormwood by the memory of the secret and sweet intimacy  with God; and in the same way when she retired to be with God, and  commenced to speak with Him, <a name="page_215"><font size="1" color="green">p. 215</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iii-Page_215"></A> the  affections and thoughts which she carried with her from the grating  took possession of her.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_430"></A><A HREF="#fn_430"><FONT SIZE="1">431</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p111"></A>Compare with these violent oscillations between the  superficial and mystical consciousness&#8212;characteristic of  Teresa&#8217;s strong volitional nature, which only came to rest after  psychic convulsions which left no corner of its being  unexplored&#8212;the symbolic act of renunciation under which  Antoinette Bourignan&#8217;s &#8220;interior self&#8221; vanquished  the surface intelligence and asserted its supremacy. Teresa must give  up her passionate delight in human friendship. Antoinette, never much  tempted in that direction, must give up her last penny. What society  was to Teresa&#8217;s generous, energetic nature, prudence was to the  temperamentally shrewd and narrow Antoinette: a distraction, a check  on the development of the all-demanding transcendental genius, an  unconquered relic of the &#8220;lower life.&#8221;</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p112"></A>Many a mystic, however, has found the perfection of  detachment to be consistent with a far less drastic renunciation of  external things than that which these women felt to be essential to  their peace. The test, as we have seen, does not lie in the nature of  the things which are retained, but in the reaction which they  stimulate in the self. &#8220;Absolute poverty is thine,&#8221; says  Tauler, &#8220;when thou canst not remember whether anybody has ever  owed thee or been indebted to thee for anything; just as all things  will be forgotten by thee in the last journey of death.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_431"></A><A HREF="#fn_431"><FONT SIZE="1">432</FONT></A>
    Poverty, in this sense, may be consistent with the habitual and  automatic use of luxuries which the abstracted self never even  perceives. Thus we are told that St. Bernard was reproached by his  enemies with the inconsistency of preaching evangelical poverty whilst  making his journeys from place to place on a magnificently caparisoned  mule, which had been lent to him by the Cluniac monks. He expressed  great contrition: but said that he had never noticed what it was that  he rode upon.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_432"></A><A HREF="#fn_432"><FONT SIZE="1">433</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p115"></A>Sometimes, the very activity which one self has  rejected as an impediment becomes for another the channel of spiritual  perception. I have mentioned the Cur&eacute; d&#8217;Ars, who, among  other inhibitions, refused to allow himself to smell a rose. Yet St.  Francis preached to the flowers,  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_433"></A><A HREF="#fn_433"><FONT SIZE="1">434</FONT></A>
    and ordered a plot to be set aside for their cultivation when the  convent garden was made, &#8220;in order that all who saw them might  remember the Eternal Sweetness.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_434"></A><A HREF="#fn_434"><FONT SIZE="1">435</FONT></A>
    <a name="page_216"><font size="1" color="green">p. 216</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iii-Page_216"></A> So, too, we are told of his spiritual  daughter, St. Douceline, that &#8220;out of doors one day with her  sisters, she heard a bird&#8217;s note. &#8216;What a lovely  song!&#8217; she said: and the song drew her straight way to God. Did  they bring her a flower,   <i>its</i>      <i>beauty had a like effect</i>   .&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_435"></A><A HREF="#fn_435"><FONT SIZE="1">436</FONT></A>
    &#8220;To look on trees, water, and flowers,&#8221; says St. Teresa  of her own beginnings of contemplation, &#8220;helped her to recollect  the Presence of God.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_436"></A><A HREF="#fn_436"><FONT SIZE="1">437</FONT></A>
    Here we are reminded of Plato. &#8220;The true order of going is to  use the beauties of Earth as steps along which one mounts upwards for  the sake of that other Beauty.&#8221; This, too, is the true order of  Holy Poverty: the selfless use, not the selfish abuse of lovely and  natural things.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p120"></A>To say that some have fallen short of this difficult  ideal and taken refuge in mere abnegation is but to say that  asceticism is a human, not a superhuman art, and is subject to  &#8220;the frailty of the creature.&#8221; But on the whole, these  excesses are mainly found amongst saintly types who have not exhibited  true mystic intuition. This intuition, entailing as it does communion  with intensest Life, gives to its possessors a sweet sanity, a  delicate balance, which guards them, as a rule, from such conceptions  of chastity as that of the youthful saint who shut himself in a  cupboard for fear he should see his mother pass by: from the obedience  which identifies the voice of the director with the voice of God; from  detachment such as that exhibited by the Blessed Angela of Foligno,  who, though a true mystic, viewed with almost murderous satisfaction  the deaths of relatives who were &#8220;impediments.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_437"></A><A HREF="#fn_437"><FONT SIZE="1">438</FONT></A>
    The detachment of the mystic is just a restoration to the liberty in  which the soul was made: it is a state of joyous humility in which he  cries, &#8220;Nought I am, nought I have, nought I lack.&#8221; To  have arrived at this is to have escaped from the tyranny of selfhood:  to be initiated into the purer air of that universe which knows but  one rule of action&#8212;that which was laid down once for all by St.  Augustine when he said, in the most memorable and misquoted of  epigrams: &#8220;Love, and do what you like.&#8221;</p>   <h4 align="center"><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p121.1"></A>2. Mortification</h4>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p122"></A>By mortification, I have said, is to be understood the  positive aspect of purification: the remaking in relation to reality  of the permanent elements of character. These elements, so far, have  <a name="page_217"><font size="1" color="green">p. 217</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iii-Page_217"></A> subserved the interests of the old  self, worked for it in the world of sense. Now they must be adjusted  to the needs of the new self and to the transcendent world in which it  moves. Their focal point is the old self; the &#8220;natural  man&#8221; and his self-regarding instincts and desires. The object of  mortification is to kill that old self, break up his egoistic  attachments and cravings, in order that the higher centre, the  &#8220;new man,&#8221; may live and breathe. As St. Teresa discovered  when she tried to reconcile the claims of worldly friendships and  contemplation, one or other must go: a house divided against itself  cannot stand. &#8220;Who hinders thee more,&#8221; says Thomas a  Kempis, &#8220;than the unmortified affections of thy own heart? . . .  if we were perfectly dead unto ourselves, and not entangled within our  own breasts, then should we be able to taste Divine things, and to  have some experience of heavenly contemplation.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_438"></A><A HREF="#fn_438"><FONT SIZE="1">439</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p124"></A>In psychological language, the process of  mortification is the process of setting up &#8220;new paths of neural  discharge.&#8221; That is to say, the mystic life has got to express  itself in action: and for this new paths must be cut and new habits  formed&#8212;all, in spite of the new self&#8217;s enthusiasm,  &#8220;against the grain&#8221;&#8212;resulting in a complete  sublimation of personality. The energy which wells up incessantly in  every living being must abandon the old road of least resistance and  discharge itself in a new and more difficult way. In the terms of the  hormic psychology, the conative drive of the psyche must be  concentrated on new objectives; and the old paths, left to themselves,  must fade and die. When they are dead, and the new life has triumphed,  Mortification is at an end. The mystics always know when this moment  comes. Often an inner voice then warns them to lay their active  penances aside.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p125"></A>Since the greater and stronger the mystic, the  stronger and more stubborn his character tends to be, this change of  life and turning of energy from the old and easy channels to the new  is often a stormy matter. It is a period of actual battle between the  inharmonious elements of the self, its lower and higher springs of  action: of toil, fatigue, bitter suffering, and many disappointments.  Nevertheless, in spite of its etymological associations, the object of  mortification is not death but life: the production of health and  strength, the health and strength of the human consciousness viewed  <A NAME="an_iv.iii-p125.1"></A>  <i>sub specie aeternitatis</i>     .    &#8220;In the truest death of all created things, the sweetest and  most natural life is hidden.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_439"></A><A HREF="#fn_439"><FONT SIZE="1">440</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p127"></A>&#8220;This dying,&#8221; says Tauler again,  &#8220;has many degrees, and so has this life. A man might die a  thousand deaths in one day and find at once a joyful life  corresponding to each of them. This is as <a name="page_218"><font size="1" color="green">p. 218</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iii-Page_218"></A> it must be: God cannot deny or refuse this to  death. The stronger the death the more powerful and thorough is the  corresponding life; the more intimate the death, the more inward is  the life. Each life brings strength, and strengthens to a harder  death. When a man dies to a scornful word, bearing it in God&#8217;s  name, or to some inclination inward or outward, acting or not acting  against his own will, be it in love or grief, in word or act, in going  or staying; or if he denies his desires of taste or sight, or makes no  excuses when wrongfully accused; or anything else, whatever it may be,  to which he has not yet died, it is harder at first to one who is  unaccustomed to it and unmortified than to him who is mortified. . . .  A great life makes reply to him who dies in earnest even in the least  things, a life which strengthens him immediately to die a greater  death; a death so long and strong, that it seems to him hereafter more  joyful, good and pleasant to die than to live, for he finds life in  death and light shining in darkness.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_440"></A><A HREF="#fn_440"><FONT SIZE="1">441</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p129"></A>No more than detachment, then, is mortification an end  in itself. It is a process, an education directed towards the  production of a definite kind of efficiency, the adjustment of human  nature to the demands of its new life. Severe, and to the outsider  apparently unmeaning&#8212;like their physical parallels the exercises  of the gymnasium&#8212;its disciplines, faithfully accepted, do  release the self from the pull of the lower nature, establish it on  new levels of freedom and power. &#8220;Mortification,&#8221; says the  Benedictine contemplative Augustine Baker, &#8220;tends to subject the  body to the spirit and the spirit to God. And this it does by crossing  the inclinations of sense, which are quite contrary to those of the  Divine Spirit . . . by such crossing and afflicting of the body,  self-love and self-will (the poison of our spirits) are abated, and in  time in a sort destroyed; and instead of them there enter into the  soul the Divine love and Divine will, and take possession  thereof.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_441"></A><A HREF="#fn_441"><FONT SIZE="1">442</FONT></A>
    This transformation accomplished, mortification may end, and often  does, with startling abruptness. After a martyrdom which lasted  sixteen years, says Suso&#8212;speaking as usual in the third  person&#8212;of his own experience, &#8220;On a certain Whitsun Day a  heavenly messenger appeared to him, and ordered him in God&#8217;s  name to continue it no more. He at once ceased, and threw all the  instruments of his sufferings [irons, nails, hair-shirt, etc.] into a  river.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_442"></A><A HREF="#fn_442"><FONT SIZE="1">443</FONT></A>
    From this time onward, austerities of this sort had no part in  Suso&#8217;s life.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p132"></A>The Franco-Flemish mystic who wrote, and the English  contemplative <a name="page_219"><font size="1" color="green">p. 219</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iii-Page_219"></A> who translated,  &#8220;The Mirror of Simple Souls,&#8221; have between them described  and explained in bold and accurate language the conditions under which  the soul is enabled to abandon that &#8220;hard service of the  virtues&#8221; which has absorbed it during the Purgative Way. The  statement of the &#8220;French Book&#8221; is direct and  uncompromising: well calculated to startle timid piety.  &#8220;Virtues, I take leave of you for evermore!&#8221; exclaims the  Soul. &#8220;Now shall mine heart be more free and more in peace than  it hath been before. I wot well your service is too travaillous. . . .  Some time I laid mine heart in you without any dissevering: ye wot  well this: I was in all things to you obedient. O I was then your  servant, but now I am delivered out of your thraldom.&#8221;</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p133"></A>To this astounding utterance the English translator  has added a singularly illuminating gloss. &#8220;I am stirred  here,&#8221; he says, &#8220;to say more to the matter, as thus:  First: when a soul giveth her to perfection, she laboureth busily day  and night to get virtues, by counsel of reason, and striveth with  vices at every thought, at every word and deed that she perceiveth  cometh of them, and busily searcheth vices, them to destroy. Thus the  virtues be mistresses, and every virtue maketh her to war with its  contrary, the which be vices. Many sharp pains and bitterness of  conscience feeleth the soul in this war. . . . But so long one may  bite on the bitter bark of the nut, that at last he shall come to the  sweet kernel. Right so, ghostly to understand, it fareth by these  souls that be come to peace. They have so long striven with vices and  wrought by virtues, that they be come to the nut kernel, that is, to  the love of God, which is sweetness. And when the soul hath deeply  tasted this love, so that this love of God worketh and hath his usages  in her soul, then the soul is wondrous light and gladsome. . . . Then  is she mistress and lady over the virtues, for she hath them all  within herself. . . . And then this soul taketh leave of virtues, as  of the thraldom and painful travail of them that she had before, and  now she is lady and sovereign, and they be subjects.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_443"></A><A HREF="#fn_443"><FONT SIZE="1">444</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p135"></A>Jacopone da Todi speaks to the same effect:&#8212;</p>   <blockquote><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p135.1"></A> &#8220;La guerra &egrave;  terminata<br>   de le virtu battaglia,<br>   de la mente travaglia<br>   cosa nulla contende&#8221;.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_444"></A><A HREF="#fn_444"><FONT SIZE="1">445</FONT></A>
  <br>  </blockquote>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p137"></A>Thus, St. Catherine of Genoa, after a penitential  period of four years, during which she was haunted by a constant sense  of sin, and occupied by incessant mortifications, found that  &#8220;all thought <a name="page_220"><font size="1" color="green">p. 220</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iii-Page_220"></A> of such  mortifications was   <i>in an instant</i>    taken from her mind: in such a manner that, had she even wished to  continue such mortifications, she would have been unable to do so . .  . the sight of her sins was now taken from her mind, so that  henceforth she did not catch a glimpse of them: it was as though they  had all been cast into the depths of the sea.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_445"></A><A HREF="#fn_445"><FONT SIZE="1">446</FONT></A>
    In other words, the new and higher centre of consciousness, finally  established, asserted itself and annihilated the old. <A NAME="an_iv.iii-p138.1"></A>&#8220;La guerra e teminata,&#8221;all  the energy of a strong nature flows freely in the new channels; and  mortification ceases, mechanically, to be possible to the now unified,  sublimated, or &#8220;regenerated&#8221; self.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p139"></A>Mortification takes its name from the reiterated  statement of all ascetic writers that the senses, or &#8220;body of  desire,&#8221; with the cravings which are excited by different  aspects of the phenomenal world, must be mortified or killed; which  is, of course, a description of psychological necessities from their  special point of view. All those self-regarding instincts&#8212;so  ingrained that they have become automatic&#8212;which impel the self  to choose the more comfortable part, are seen by the awakened  intuition of the embryo mystic as gross infringements of the law of  love. &#8220;This is the travail that a man behoveth, to draw out his  heart and his mind from the fleshly love and the liking of all earthly  creatures, from vain thoughts and from fleshly imaginations, and out  from the love and the vicious feeling of himself, that his soul should  find no rest in no fleshly thought, nor earthly affection.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_446"></A><A HREF="#fn_446"><FONT SIZE="1">447</FONT></A>
    The rule of Poverty must be applied to the temper of normal  consciousness as well as to the tastes and possessions of the self.  Under this tonic influence, real life will thrive, unreal life will  wither and die.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p141"></A>This mortifying process is necessary, not because the  legitimate exercise of the senses is opposed to Divine Reality, but  because those senses have usurped a place beyond their station; become  the focus of energy, steadily drained the vitality of the self.  &#8220;The dogs have taken the children&#8217;s meat.&#8221; The  senses have grown stronger than their masters, monopolized the field  of perception, dominated an organism which was made for greater  activities, and built up those barriers of individuality which must be  done away if true personality is to be achieved, and with it some  share in the boundless life of the One. It is thanks to this wrong  distribution of energy, this sedulous feeding of the cuckoo in the  nest, that &#8220;in order to approach the Absolute, mystics must  withdraw from everything, even themselves.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_447"></A><A HREF="#fn_447"><FONT SIZE="1">448</FONT></A>
    &#8220;The soul is plunged in utter <a name="page_221"><font size="1" color="green">p. 221</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iii-Page_221"></A>  ignorance, when she supposes that she can attain to the high estate of  union with God before she casts away the desire of all things, natural  and supernatural, which she may possess,&#8221; says St. John of the  Cross, &#8220;because the distance between them and that which takes  place in the state of pure transformation in God is infinite.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_448"></A><A HREF="#fn_448"><FONT SIZE="1">449</FONT></A>
    Again, &#8220;until the desires be lulled to sleep by the  mortification of sensuality, and sensuality itself be mortified in  them, so that it shall war against the spirit no more, the soul cannot  go forth in perfect liberty to union with the Beloved.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_449"></A><A HREF="#fn_449"><FONT SIZE="1">450</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p145"></A>The death of selfhood in its narrow individualistic  sense is, then, the primary object of mortification. All the twisted  elements of character which foster the existence of this unreal yet  complex creature are to be pruned away. Then, as with the trees of the  forest, so with the spirit of man, strong new branches will spring  into being, grow towards air and light. &#8220;I live, yet not  I&#8221; is to be the declaration of the mystic who has endured this  &#8220;bodily death.&#8221; The self-that-is-to-be will live upon a  plane where her own prejudices and preferences are so uninteresting as  to be imperceptible. She must be weaned from these nursery toys: and  weaning is a disagreeable process. The mystic, however, undertakes it  as a rule without reluctance: pushed by his vivid consciousness of  imperfection, his intuition of a more perfect state, necessary to the  fulfilment of his love. Often his entrance upon the torments of the  Purgative Way, his taking up of the spiritual or material instruments  of mortification, resembles in ardour and abruptness that  &#8220;heroic plunge into Purgatory&#8221; of the newly dead when it  perceives itself in the light of Love Divine, which is described in  the &#8220;Treatise&#8221; of St. Catherine of Genoa as its nearest  equivalent. &#8220;As she, plunged in the divine furnace of purifying  love, was united to the Object of her love, and satisfied with all he  wrought in her, so she understood it to be with the souls in  Purgatory.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_450"></A><A HREF="#fn_450"><FONT SIZE="1">451</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p147"></A>This &#8220;divine furnace of purifying love&#8221;  demands from the ardent soul a complete self-surrender, and voluntary  turning from all impurity, a humility of the most far-reaching kind:  and this means the deliberate embrace of active suffering, a  self-discipline in dreadful tasks. As gold in the refiner&#8217;s  fire, so &#8220;burning of love into a soul truly taken all vices  purgeth.&#8221; Detachment may be a counsel of prudence, a practical  result of seeing the true values of things; but the pain of  mortification is seized as a splendid opportunity, a love token,  timidly offered by the awakened spirit to that all-demanding Lover  from Whom St. Catherine of Siena heard the terrible words &#8220;I,  Fire, the Acceptor of sacrifices, ravishing <a name="page_222"><font size="1" color="green">p. 222</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iii-Page_222"></A> away from them their darkness, give the  light.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_451"></A><A HREF="#fn_451"><FONT SIZE="1">452</FONT></A>
    &#8220;Suffering is the ancient law of love,&#8221; says the Eternal  Wisdom to Suso, &#8220;there is no quest without pain, there is no  lover who is not also a martyr. Hence it is inevitable that he who  would love so high a thing as Wisdom should sometimes suffer  hindrances and griefs.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_452"></A><A HREF="#fn_452"><FONT SIZE="1">453</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p150"></A>The mystics have a profound conviction that Creation,  Becoming, Transcendence, is a painful process at the best. Those who  are Christians point to the Passion of Christ as a proof that the  cosmic journey to perfection, the path of the Eternal Wisdom, follows  of necessity the Way of the Cross. That law of the inner life, which  sounds so fantastic and yet is so bitterly true&#8212;&#8220;No  progress without pain&#8221;&#8212;asserts itself. It declares that  birth pangs must be endured in the spiritual as well as in the  material world: that adequate training must always hurt the athlete.  Hence the mystics&#8217; quest of the Absolute drives them to an eager  and heroic union with the reality of suffering, as well as with the  reality of joy.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_453"></A><A HREF="#fn_453"><FONT SIZE="1">454</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p152"></A>This divine necessity of pain, this necessary sharing  in the travail of a World of Becoming, is beautifully described by  Tauler in one of those &#8220;internal conversations&#8221; between  the contemplative soul and its God, which abound in the works of the  mystics and are familiar to all readers of &#8220;The Imitation of  Christ.&#8221; &#8220;A man once thought,&#8221; says Tauler,  &#8220;that God drew some men even by pleasant paths, while other were  drawn by the path of pain. Our Lord answered him thus, &#8216;What  think ye can be pleasanter or nobler than to be made most like unto  Me? that is by suffering. Mark, to whom was ever offered such a  troubled life as to Me? And in whom can I better work in accordance  with My true nobility than in those who are most like Me? They are the  men who suffer. . . . Learn that My divine nature never worked so  nobly in human nature as by suffering; and because suffering is so  efficacious, it is sent out of great love. I understand the weakness  of human nature at all times, and out of love and righteousness I lay  no heavier load on man than he can bear. The crown must be firmly  <a name="page_223"><font size="1" color="green">p. 223</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iii-Page_223"></A> pressed down that is to bud and blossom  in the Eternal Presence of of My Heavenly Father. He who desires to be  wholly immersed in the fathomless sea of My Godhead must also be  deeply immersed in the deep sea of bitter sorrow. I am exalted far  above all things, and work supernatural and wonderful works in Myself:  the deeper and more supernaturally a man crushes himself beneath all  things the more supernaturally will he be drawn far above all  things.&#8217;&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_454"></A><A HREF="#fn_454"><FONT SIZE="1">455</FONT></A>

<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p154"></A>Pain, therefore, the mystics always welcome and often  court: sometimes in the crudely physical form which Suso describes so  vividly and horribly in the sixteenth chapter of his Life, more  frequently in those refinements of torture which a sensitive spirit  can extract from loneliness, injustice, misunderstanding&#8212;above  all, from deliberate contact with the repulsive accidents of life. It  would seem from a collation of the evidence that the typical mystical  temperament is by nature highly fastidious. Its passionate  apprehension of spiritual beauty, its intuitive perception of divine  harmony, is counterbalanced by an instinctive loathing of ugliness, a  shrinking from the disharmonies of squalor and disease. Often its  ideal of refinement is far beyond the contemporary standards of  decency: a circumstance which is alone enough to provide ample  opportunity of wretchedness. This extreme sensitiveness, which forms  part of the normal psychophysical make-up of the mystic, as it often  does of the equally highly-strung artistic type, is one of the first  things to be seized upon by the awakened self as a disciplinary  instrument. Then humility&#8217;s axiom, &#8220;Naught is too low for  love&#8221; is forced to bear the less lovely gloss, &#8220;Naught  must be too disgusting.&#8221;</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p155"></A>Two reasons at once appear for this. One is the  contempt for phenomena, nasty as well as nice&#8212;the longing to be  free from all the fetters of sense&#8212;which often goes with the  passion for invisible things. Those mystics to whom the attractions of  earth are only illusion, are inconsistent if they attribute a greater  reality to the revolting and squalid incidents of life. St. Francis  did but carry his own principles to their logical conclusion, when he  insisted that the vermin were as much his brothers as the birds. Real  detachment means the death of preferences of all kinds: even of those  which seem to other men the very proofs of virtue and fine taste.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p156"></A>The second reason is nobler. It is bound up with that  principle of self-surrender which is the mainspring of the mystic  life. To the contemplative mind, which is keenly conscious of unity in  multiplicity&#8212;of Gods in the world&#8212;all disinterested  service is service of the Absolute which he loves: and the harder it  is, the more opposed to his self-regarding and aesthetic instincts,  the <a name="page_224"><font size="1" color="green">p. 224</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iii-Page_224"></A> more nearly it approaches his  ideal. The point to which he aspires&#8212;though he does not always  know it&#8212;is that in which all disharmony, all appearance of  vileness, is resolved in the concrete reality which he calls the Love  of God. Then, he feels dimly, everything will be seen under the aspect  of a cosmic and charitable beauty; exhibiting through the woof of  corruption the web of eternal life.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p157"></A>It is told of St. Francis of Assisi, in whom the love  of lovely things was always paramount, how he forced himself to visit  the lepers whose sight and smell disgusted him: how he served them and  even kissed them.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_455"></A><A HREF="#fn_455"><FONT SIZE="1">456</FONT></A>
    &#8220;Then as he departed, in very truth that which had aforetime  been bitter unto him, to wit, the sight and touch of lepers, now  changed into sweetness. For, as he confessed, the sight of lepers had  been so grievous unto him that he had been minded to avoid not only  seeing them, but even going nigh their dwelling. And if at any time he  chanced to pass their abodes, or to see them, albeit he were moved by  compassion to do them an alms through another person, yet alway would  he turn aside his face, stopping his nostrils with his hand. But  through the grace of God he became so intimate a friend of the lepers  that, even as he recorded in his will, he did sojourn with them and  did humbly serve them.&#8221;</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p159"></A>Also, after his great renunciation of all property,  he, once a prosperous young man who had been &#8220;dainty in his  father&#8217;s home,&#8221; accustomed himself to take a bowl and beg  scraps of food from door to door: and here too, as in the case of the  lepers, that which at first seemed revolting became to him sweet.  &#8220;And when he would have eaten that medley of various  meats,&#8221; says the legend, &#8220;at first he shrank back, for  that he had never been used willingly even to see, much less to eat,  such scraps. At length, conquering himself, he began to eat; and it  seemed to him that in eating no rich syrup had he ever tasted aught so  delightsome.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_456"></A><A HREF="#fn_456"><FONT SIZE="1">457</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p161"></A>The object, then, of this self-discipline is, like the  object of all purgation, freedom: freedom from the fetters of the  senses, the &#8220;remora of desire,&#8221; from the results of  environment and worldly education, from pride and prejudice,  preferences and distaste: from selfhood in every form. Its effect is a  sharp reaction to the joy of self-conquest. The very act that had once  caused in the enchained self a movement of loathing becomes not merely  indifferent, but an occasion of happiness. So Margery Kempe &#8220;had  great mourning and sorrowing if she might not kiss a leper when she  met them in the way for the love of our Lord,   <i>which was all</i>    <a name="page_225"><font size="1" color="green">p. 225</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iii-Page_225"></A>   <i>contrary to her disposition</i>    in the years of her youth and prosperity, for then she abhorred them  most.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_457"></A><A HREF="#fn_457"><FONT SIZE="1">458</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p163"></A>I spare the sensitive reader a detailed account of the  loathsome ordeals by which St. Catherine of Genoa and Madame Guyon  strove to cure themselves of squeamishness and acquire this liberty of  spirit.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_458"></A><A HREF="#fn_458"><FONT SIZE="1">459</FONT></A>
    They, like St. Francis, St. Elizabeth of Hungary, and countless other  seekers for the Real, sought out and served with humility and love the  sick and the unclean; deliberately associated themselves with life in  its meanest forms; compelled themselves to contact with the most  revolting substances; and mortified the senses by the traditional  ascetic expedient of deliberately opposing all&#8212;even their most  natural and harmless&#8212;inclinations. &#8220;In the first four  years after she received the sweet wound from her Lord,&#8221; says  the Life of St. Catherine of Genoa, she &#8220;made great penances: so  that all her senses were mortified. And first, so soon as she  perceived that her nature desired anything at once she deprived it  thereof, and did so that it should receive all those things that it  abhorred. She wore harsh hair, ate no meat nor any other thing that  she liked; ate no fruit, neither fresh nor dried . . . and she lived  greatly submitted to all persons, and always sought to do all those  things which were contrary to her own will; in such a way that she was  always inclined to do more promptly the will of others than her  own.&#8221; . . . &#8220;And while she worked such and so many  mortifications of all her senses it was several times asked of her  &#8216;Why do you do this?&#8217; And she answered &#8216;I do not  know, but I feel myself drawn inwardly to do this . . . and I think it  is God&#8217;s will.&#8217;&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_459"></A><A HREF="#fn_459"><FONT SIZE="1">460</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p166"></A>St. Ignatius Loyola, in the world a highly bred  Spanish gentleman of refined personal habits, found in those habits an  excellent opportunity of mortification. &#8220;As he was somewhat nice  about the arrangement of his hair, as was the fashion of those days  and became him not ill, he allowed it to grow naturally, and neither  combed it nor trimmed it nor wore any head covering by day or night.  For the same reason he did not pare his finger or toe nails; for on  these points he had been fastidious to an extreme.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_460"></A><A HREF="#fn_460"><FONT SIZE="1">461</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p168"></A>Madame Guyon, a delicate girl of the leisured class,  accustomed to the ordinary comforts of her station, characteristically  chose the most crude and immoderate forms of mortification in her  efforts towards the acquirement of &#8220;indifference.&#8221; But the  peculiar psychic constitution which afterwards showed itself in the  forms <a name="page_226"><font size="1" color="green">p. 226</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iii-Page_226"></A> of automatism and clairvoyance,  seems to have produced a partial anesthesia. &#8220;Although I had a  very delicate body, the instruments of penitence tore my flesh  without, as it seemed to me, causing pain. I wore girdles of hair and  of sharp iron, I often held wormwood in my mouth.&#8221; &#8220;If I  walked, I put stones in my shoes. These things, my God, Thou didst  first inspire me to do, in order that I might be deprived even of the  most innocent satisfactions.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_461"></A><A HREF="#fn_461"><FONT SIZE="1">462</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p170"></A>In the earlier stages of their education, a constant  <i>agere contra</i>,   even in apparently indifferent things, seems essential to the  mystics; till the point is reached at which the changes and chances of  mortal life are accepted with a true indifference and do not trouble  the life of the soul. This established ascendancy of the  &#8220;interior man,&#8221; the transcendental consciousness, over  &#8220;sensitive nature&#8221;&#8212;the self in its reactions to the  ups and downs and manifold illusions of daily life&#8212;is the very  object of Purgation. It is, then, almost impossible that any mystic,  whatever his religion, character or race, should escape its battles:  for none at the beginning of their growth are in a position to  dispense with its good offices. Neoplatonists and Mahommedans, no less  than the Christian ascetics, are acquainted with the Purgative Way.  All realize the first law of Spiritual Alchemy, that you must tame the  Green Lion before you give him wings. Thus in &#8216;Attar&#8217;s  allegory of the Valleys, the valley of self-stripping and renunciation  comes first.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_462"></A><A HREF="#fn_462"><FONT SIZE="1">463</FONT></A>
    So too Al Ghazzali, the Persian contemplative, says of the period  immediately following his acceptance of the principles of Sufi ism and  consequent renunciation of property, &#8220;I went to Syria, where I  remained more than two years; without any other object than that of  living in seclusion and solitude, conquering my desires, struggling  with my passions, striving to purify my soul, to perfect my character,  and to prepare my heart to meditate upon God.&#8221; At the end of  this period of pure purgation circumstances forced him to return to  the world; much to his regret, since he &#8220;had not yet attained to  the perfect ecstatic state, unless it were in one or two isolated  moments.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_463"></A><A HREF="#fn_463"><FONT SIZE="1">464</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p173"></A>Such gleams of ecstatic vision, distributed through  the later stages of purification, seem to be normal features of  mystical development. Increasing control of the lower centres, of the  surface intelligence and its scattered desires, permits the emergence  of the transcendental perceptions. We have seen that Fox in his early  stages displayed just such an alternation between the light and shade  of the mystic way.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_464"></A><A HREF="#fn_464"><FONT SIZE="1">465</FONT></A>
    So too did that least ascetic of visionaries, Jacob Boehme.  &#8220;Finding within myself a <a name="page_227"><font size="1" color="green">p. 227</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iii-Page_227"></A> powerful  contrarium, namely the desires that belong to the flesh and  blood,&#8221; he says, &#8220;I began to fight a hard battle against  my corrupted nature, and with the aid of God I made up my mind to  overcome the inherited evil will, to break it, and to enter wholly  into the Love of God. . . . This, however, was not possible for me to  accomplish, but I stood firmly by my earnest resolution, and fought a  hard battle with myself. Now while I was wrestling and battling, being  aided by God, a wonderful light arose within my soul. It was a light  entirely foreign to my unruly nature, but in it I recognized the true  nature of God and man, and the relation existing between them, a thing  which heretofore I had never understood, and for which I would never  have sought.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_465"></A><A HREF="#fn_465"><FONT SIZE="1">466</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p176"></A>In these words Boehme bridges the gap between  Purgation and Illumination: showing these two states or ways as  coexisting and complementary one to another, the light and dark sides  of a developing mystic consciousness. As a fact, they do often exist  side by side in the individual experience:  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_466"></A><A HREF="#fn_466"><FONT SIZE="1">467</FONT></A>
    and any treatment which exhibits them as sharply and completely  separated may be convenient for purposes of study, but becomes at best  diagrammatic if considered as a representation of the mystic life. The  mystical consciousness, as we have seen, belongs&#8212;from the  psychological point of view&#8212;to that mobile or  &#8220;unstable&#8221; type in which the artistic temperament also  finds a place. It sways easily between the extremes of pleasure and  pain in its gropings after transcendental reality. It often attains  for a moment to heights in which it is not able to rest: is often  flung from some rapturous vision of the Perfect to the deeps of  contrition and despair.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p178"></A>The mystics have a vivid metaphor by which to describe  that alternation between the onset and the absence of the joyous  transcendental consciousness which forms as it were the characteristic  intermediate stage between the bitter struggles of pure Purgation, and  the peace and radiance of the Illuminative Life. They call it  <A NAME="an_iv.iii-p178.1"></A>   <i>Ludus Amoris</i>     <i>,</i>    the &#8220;Game of Love&#8221; which God plays with the desirous  soul. It is the &#8220;game of chess,&#8221; says St. Teresa,  &#8220;in which game Humility is the Queen without whom none can  checkmate the Divine King.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_467"></A><A HREF="#fn_467"><FONT SIZE="1">468</FONT></A>
    &#8220;Here,&#8221; says Martensen, &#8220;God plays a blest game  with the soul.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_468"></A><A HREF="#fn_468"><FONT SIZE="1">469</FONT></A>
    The &#8220;Game of Love&#8221; is a reflection in consciousness of  that state of struggle, oscillation and unrest which precedes the  first unification of the self. It ceases when this has taken place and  the new level of reality has been <a name="page_228"><font size="1" color="green">p. 228</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iii-Page_228"></A>  attained. Thus St. Catherine of Siena, that inspired psychologist, was  told in ecstasy, &#8220;With the souls who have arrived at perfection,  I play no more the Game of Love, which consists in leaving and  returning again to the soul; though thou must understand that it is  not, properly speaking, I, the immovable GOD, Who thus elude them, but  rather the sentiment that My charity gives them of Me.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_469"></A><A HREF="#fn_469"><FONT SIZE="1">470</FONT></A>
    In other terms, it is the imperfectly developed spiritual perception  which becomes tired and fails, throwing the self back into the  darkness and aridity whence it has emerged. So we are told of Rulman  Merswin  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_470"></A><A HREF="#fn_470"><FONT SIZE="1">471</FONT></A>
    that after the period of harsh physical mortification which succeeded  his conversion came a year of &#8220;delirious joy alternating with  the most bitter physical and moral sufferings.&#8221; It is, he says,  &#8220;the Game of Love which the Lord plays with His poor sinful  creature.&#8221; Memories of all his old sins still drove him to  exaggerated penances: morbid temptations &#8220;made me so ill that I  feared I should lose my reason.&#8221; These psychic storms reacted  upon the physical organism. He had a paralytic seizure, lost the use  of his lower limbs, and believed himself to be at the point of death.  When he was at his worst, however, and all hope seemed at an end, an  inward voice told him to rise from his bed. He obeyed, and found  himself cured. Ecstasies were frequent during the whole of this  period. In these moments of exaltation he felt his mind to be  irradiated by a new light, so that he knew, intuitively, the direction  which his life was bound to take, and recognized the inevitable and  salutary nature of his trials. &#8220;God showed Himself by turns  harsh and gentle: to each access of misery succeeded the rapture of  supernatural grace.&#8221; In this intermittent style, torn by these  constant fluctuations between depression and delight, did Merswin, in  whom the psychic instability of the artistic and mystic types is  present in excess, pass through the purgative and illuminated states.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_471"></A><A HREF="#fn_471"><FONT SIZE="1">472</FONT></A>
    They appear to have coexisted in his consciousness, first one and  then the other emerging and taking control. Hence he did not attain  the peaceful condition which is characteristic of full illumination,  and normally closes the &#8220;First Mystic Life&#8221;; but passed  direct from these violent alternations of mystical pleasure and  mystical pain to the state which he calls &#8220;the school of  suffering love.&#8221; This, as we shall see when we come to its  consideration, is strictly analogous to that <a name="page_229"><font size="1" color="green">p. 229</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iii-Page_229"></A> which other mystics have called the  &#8220;Dark Night of the Soul,&#8221; and opens the &#8220;Second  Mystic Life&#8221; or Unitive Way.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p184"></A>Such prolonged coexistence of alternating pain and  pleasure states in the developing soul, such delay in the attainment  of equilibrium, is not infrequent, and must be taken into account in  all analyses of the mystic type. Though it is convenient for purposes  of study to practise a certain dissection, and treat as separate  states which are, in the living subject, closely intertwined, we  should constantly remind ourselves that such a proceeding is  artificial. The struggle of the self to disentangle itself from  illusion and attain the Absolute is a life-struggle. Hence, it will  and must exhibit the freedom and originality of life: will, as a  process, obey artistic rather than scientific laws. It will sway now  to the light and now to the shade of experience: its oscillations will  sometimes be great, sometimes small. Mood and environment, inspiration  and information, will all play their part.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p185"></A>There are in this struggle three factors.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p186"></A>(1) The unchanging light of Eternal Reality: that Pure  Being &#8220;which ever shines and nought shall ever dim.&#8221;</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p187"></A>(2) The web of illusion, here thick, there thin; which  hems in, confuses, and allures the sentient self.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p188"></A>(3) That self, always changing, moving,  struggling&#8212;always, in fact,   <i>becoming&#8212;</i>   alive in every fibre, related at once to the unreal and to the real;  and, with its growth in true being, ever more conscious of the  contrast between them.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p189"></A>In the ever-shifting relations between these three  factors, the consequent energy engendered, the work done, we may find  a cause of the innumerable forms of stress and travail which are  called in their objective form the Purgative Way. One only of the  three is constant: the Absolute to which the soul aspires. Though all  else may fluctuate, that goal is changeless. That Beauty so old and so  new, &#8220;with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of  turning,&#8221; which is the One of Plotinus, the All of Eckhart and  St. John of the Cross, the Eternal Wisdom of Suso, the Unplumbed Abyss  of Ruysbroeck, the Pure Love of St. Catherine of Genoa, awaits  yesterday, to-day, and for ever the opening of Its creature&#8217;s  eyes.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p190"></A>In the moment of conversion those eyes were opened for  an instant: obtained, as it were, a dazzling and unforgettable glimpse  of the Uncreated Light. They must learn to stay open: to look  steadfastly into the eyes of Love: so that, in the beautiful imagery  of the mystics, the &#8220;faithful servant&#8221; may become the  &#8220;secret friend.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_472"></A><A HREF="#fn_472"><FONT SIZE="1">473</FONT></A>
    Then it is, says Boehme, that &#8220;the divine glimpse and <a name="page_230"><font size="1" color="green">p. 230</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iii-Page_230"></A> beam of joy ariseth in the soul, being a new  eye, in which the dark, fiery soul conceiveth the Ens and Essence of  the divine light.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_473"></A><A HREF="#fn_473"><FONT SIZE="1">474</FONT></A>
    So hard an art is not at once acquired in its perfection. It is in  accordance with all that we know of the conditions of development that  a partial achievement should come first; bewildering moments of  lucidity, splendid glimpses, whose brevity is due to the weakness of  the newly opened and unpractised &#8220;eye which looks upon  Eternity,&#8221; the yet undisciplined strength of the &#8220;eye  which looks upon Time.&#8221; Such is that play of light and dark, of  exaltation and contrition, which often bridges the gap between the  Purgative and the Illuminative states. Each by turn takes the field  and ousts the other; for &#8220;these two eyes of the soul of man  cannot both perform their work at once.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_474"></A><A HREF="#fn_474"><FONT SIZE="1">475</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p194"></A>To use another and more domestic metaphor, that Divine  Child which was, in the hour of the mystic conversion, born in the  spark of the soul, must learn like other children to walk. Though it  is true that the spiritual self must never lose its sense of utter  dependence on the Invisible; yet within that supporting atmosphere,  and fed by its gifts, it must &#8220;find its feet.&#8221; Each effort  to stand brings first a glorious sense of growth, and then a fall:  each fall means another struggle to obtain the difficult balance which  comes when infancy is past. There are many eager trials, many hopes,  many disappointments. At last, as it seems suddenly, the moment comes:  tottering is over, the muscles have learnt their lesson, they adjust  themselves automatically, and the new self suddenly finds  itself&#8212;it knows not how&#8212;standing upright and secure. That  is the moment which marks the boundary between the purgative and the  illuminative states.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p195"></A>The process of this passage of the &#8220;new&#8221;  or spiritual man from his awakening to the illuminated life, has been  set out by Jacob Boehme in language which is at once poetic and  precise. &#8220;When Christ the Corner-Stone [  <i>i.e.</i>   , the divine principle latent in man] stirreth himself in the  extinguished Image of Man in his hearty Conversion and  Repentance,&#8221; he says, &#8220;then Virgin Sophia appeareth in the  stirring of the Spirit of Christ in the extinguished Image, in her  Virgin&#8217;s attire before the Soul; at which the Soul is so amazed  and astonished in its Uncleanness that all its Sins immediately awake  in it, and it trembleth before her; for then the judgment passeth upon  the Sins of the Soul, so that it even goeth back in its unworthiness,  being ashamed in the Presence of its fair Love, and entereth into  itself, feeling and acknowledging itself utterly unworthy to receive  such a Jewel. This is understood by those who are of our tribe and  have tasted of this heavenly <a name="page_231"><font size="1" color="green">p. 231</font></A> <A NAME="an_iv.iii-Page_231"></A> Gift, and  by none else. But the noble Sophia draweth near in the Essence of the  Soul, and kisseth it in friendly Manner, and tinctureth its dark Fire  with her Rays of Love, and shineth through it with her bright and  powerful Influence. Penetrated with the strong Sense and Feeling of  which, the Soul skippeth in its Body for great Joy, and in the  strength of this Virgin Love exulteth, and praiseth the great God for  his blest Gift of Grace. I will set down here a short description how  it is when the Bride thus embraceth the Bridegroom, for the  consideration of the Reader, who perhaps hath not yet been in this  wedding chamber. It may be he will be desirous to follow us, and to  enter into the Inner Choir, where the Soul joineth hands and danceth  with Sophia, or the Divine Wisdom.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_475"></A><A HREF="#fn_475"><FONT SIZE="1">476</FONT></A>

Since the death of Lydwine, there is not a saint who has not    confirmed it. Hear them formulate their desires. Always to suffer,    and to die! cries St. Teresa; always to suffer, yet not to die,    corrects St. Magdalena dei Pazzi; yet more, oh Lord, yet more!    exclaims St. Francis Xavier, dying in anguish on the coast of China;    I wish to be broken with suffering in order that I may prove my love    to God, declares a seventeenth century Carmelite, the Ven. Mary of    the Trinity. The desire for suffering is itself an agony, adds a    great servant of God of our own day, Mother Mary Du Bourg; and she    confided to her daughters in religion that &#8216;if they sold pain    in the market she would hurry to buy it there.&#8217;&#8221; (J.

<p><A NAME="an_iv.iii-p183"></A>          We recognize here the chief symptoms of the &#8220;cyclic    type&#8221; of mentality, with its well-marked alternations of    depression and exaltation. This psychological type is found    frequently, but not invariably, among the mystics: and its    peculiarities must be taken into account when studying their    experiences. For a technical description, see W. McDougall:    &#8220;An Introduction to Abnormal Psychology,&#8221; caps. xxii and    xxviii.</p></P>
